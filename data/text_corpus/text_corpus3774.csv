18870,taking advantage of the active oxidants generated in the process of mn ii catalyzed sulfite oxidation by oxygen this study sought to enhance mn ii removal from water by activating oxygen with sulfite the results revealed that mn ii can be effectively oxidized by oxygen to mno2 with the addition of sulfite under environmentally relevant conditions and the performance of this process is dependent on the dosage of sulfite and the initial ph mn k edge xanes analysis indicates that mn ii removal is primarily due to the transformation of mn ii to mno2 and secondarily to the adsorption of mn ii on generated mno2 co existing nacl and cacl2 negatively affect mn ii removal while the presence of fe ii considerably enhances mn ii removal by improving both mn ii oxidation and mn ii adsorption on the generated solids consequently mn ii removal is as high as 98 in the presence of 1 0 mg l of fe ii and both the residual mn 0 1 mg l mn and fe 0 3 mg l fe can meet china s drinking water standard the experiments with real water samples also demonstrate the effectiveness of the sulfite promoted mn ii removal process especially in the presence of fe ii the enhancing effect of sulfite on mn ii oxidation by oxygen is mainly associated with the generation of hso5 and the critical step for generating hso5 is the rapid oxidation of so3 by oxygen epr and radical scavenging studies demonstrate that so4 radical is the key reactive oxygen species responsible for mn ii oxidation by hso5 graphical abstract image 1 keywords mn ii oxidation peroxymonosulfate sulfite sulfate radicals so4 1 introduction groundwater is a preferred drinking water source when the potable surface water is inaccessible particularly in arid and semi arid regions worldwide lyu et al 2019 over 400 major cities in china utilize groundwater as drinking water source jia et al 2018 manganese is a common mineral in groundwater piazza et al 2019 and exists mainly as reduced soluble form of mn ii mn concentration of groundwater in china can range up to 2 0 mg l attributed to factitious pollution and dissolution from soil and rock jia et al 2018 although mn is one of the essential trace elements for human health lyu et al 2019 excess mn in water supply system could result in aesthetic operational and health related problems scholz 2016 the chinese government established a drinking water standard of 0 1 mg l for mn in 2006 gb5749 2006 and thus the removal of excess mn ii from groundwater is a necessity oxidation is a conventional method used to separate manganese from water by transforming soluble mn ii into sparingly soluble manganese oxides which can be removed by subsequent coagulation sedimentation treatment patil et al 2016 however the oxidation of mn ii in homogeneous solutions by atmospheric oxygen is kinetically slow with a half life of about 400 days which is likely due to the d5 electron configuration of mn ii diem and stumm 1984 therefore a number of methods have been proposed to enhance the transformation of mn ii into mn oxides in the process of drinking water treatment including chemical oxidation with strong oxidants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide ozone ferrate and permanganate van benschoten et al 1992 choo et al 2005 goodwill et al 2016 biological oxidation hoyland et al 2014 and surface catalyzed oxidation with o2 jones and knocke 2017 recent studies suggest that o2 ho and fe vi produced from photochemical reactions electrochemical processes and extracellular microbiological processes may present an efficient pathway for the oxidation of mn ii baral et al 1986 van genuchten and pena 2017 learman et al 2011 nico et al 2002 wuttig et al 2013 these highly reactive species can react with aqueous mn ii with rate constants of 107 108 m 1s 1 table s1 thus even at quite low concentrations these species can appreciably affect the geochemical cycles of several metals including mn ii in natural water wuttig et al 2013 it is well known that mn ii is an active catalyst for s iv autooxidation in aqueous solutions connick and zhang 1996 grgić and berčič 2001 the s iv oxidation process has been extensively studied to understand its kinetics and mechanisms largely due to its involvement in the formation of acid rain the desulfurization of flue gas and biological systems siskos et al 1984 connick and zhang 1996 brandt and van eldik 1995 it was found that various oxidants including so5 e so5 hso5 1 1 v vs nhe at ph 7 0 strongly oxidizing so4 e so4 so4 2 2 5 3 1 v neta et al 1988 and ho e ho h2o 2 7 v in acidic conditions and e ho ho 1 8 v in neutral conditions buxton et al 1988 could generate in the process of mn ii catalyzed oxidation of so2 by o2 connick and zhang 1996 eqs 3 9 in table 1 previous studies have proposed that the role of mn ii in catalyzing the oxidation of so2 by o2 was as a chain propagator i e mn ii can be oxidized by so5 into mn iii firstly and then the generated mn iii oxidize so3 2 to give so3 which will combine with o2 to form so5 again eqs 3 5 in table 1 berglund et al 1993 brandt and van eldik 1995 connick and zhang 1996 in addition it is well known that mn iii is prone to disproportionate to mno2 and mn ii with an equilibrium constant log k 7 9 reaction 1 klewicki and morgan 1998 taking together the oxidation of mn ii to mno2 by o2 may be accelerated with the addition of hso3 so3 2 the aqueous species of so2 zhang et al 2010 reported that oxidative precipitation with a so2 air mixture was much more effective than that with air alone for mn ii removal from a typical synthetic laterite waste solution containing 2 0 g l mn ii however in their study the oxidation experiments were carried out at 60 c and the initial concentration of mn ii was three orders of magnitude higher than those involved in drinking water treatment these conditions are quite different from the scenarios involved in drinking water treatment 1 2mn iii h2o mno2 mn2 4h log k 7 9 considering that o2 is ubiquitous in nature and sodium sulfite na2so3 is inexpensive and environmentally friendly here we propose using sulfite to enhance the oxidative removal of mn ii from drinking water by o2 specifically the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the feasibility of adding sulfite to enhance mn ii removal from both simulated and real groundwater 2 determine the influence of operating conditions such as sulfite concentration initial ph phini and co existing ions on the performance of sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation by o2 and 3 clarify the mechanisms of mn ii oxidation in the system by characterizing the precipitated solids the transformed sulfur species and the generated radicals it should be specified that both hso3 and so3 2 are present in solution over the typical ph range 6 0 9 0 of groundwater jia et al 2018 because the second pk a of h2so3 is 7 2 neta and huie 1985 thus the term sulfite or so3 2 used in the following section refers to the equilibrium mixture of hso3 and so3 2 unless otherwise specified the results of this study may provide an alternative method for mn ii removal in drinking water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals a complete listing of reagents is provided in supporting information si text s1 2 2 experimental procedures the process of carrying out batch experiments for investigating sulfite promoted mn ii removal is summarized in fig 1 specifically experiments were performed in open air in two transparent wide mouth glass bottles v 250 ml unless otherwise noted the 200 ml working solution only contained 36 μm of mncl2 2 0 mg mn ii l and its initial ph phini was adjusted to the predetermined value using hcl and naoh after 5 min of stirring to ensure the working solution was saturated with o2 the reaction was initiated by spiking the solution with a set number of aliquots of 150 mm na2so3 stock solution to reach the targeted sulfite concentration the stock solution of na2so3 was freshly prepared and used within 2 h for each set of experiment to avoid its oxidation before use and its ph was adjusted to that of the working solution before dosing to the working solution to investigate the influence of co existing ions the constituent of interest nacl na2so4 nano3 naclo4 or cacl2 fecl2 or fecl3 was spiked into the working solution before ph adjustment since fe is a common co contaminant with mn ii in groundwater with concentration generally below 10 0 mg l jia et al 2018 we also investigated the influence of both fecl2 and fecl3 on the mn ii sulfite process the initial concentration of mn ii in groundwater samples collected from cities of xi an and langfang was increased to 36 μm 2 0 mg l manually by adding mncl2 stock solution to examine the efficiency of mn ii removal in real water with the sulfite promoted oxygenation method detailed information about two natural groundwater samples used in this study was provided in text s2 for all experiments the solution in the flask was well mixed via magnetic stirring and its temperature was maintained at 25 1 c with a circulating water bath no buffer was used in this study to avoid its potential influence and no attempt was made to keep ph constant during the reaction all experiments were performed in at least duplicate unless otherwise noted the obtained data were averaged and the corresponding standard deviations were determined and presented to quantify the kinetics of sulfite consumption mn ii oxidation and hso5 reduction we collected samples at different time intervals to examine the residual sulfite as well as the concentrations of mno2 and hso5 in the solution the samples for sulfite determination did not need to be filtered because no mno2 generated until the depletion of sulfite the samples collected for analyzing the amount of produced mno2 and hso5 were not filtered it should be specified that mn ii can be removed by transforming to non soluble mno2 and adsorbing to the generated mno2 both the generated mno2 and the absorbed mn ii can be easily separated from water by filtration consequently this study not only quantified the amount of in situ produced mn oxides but also determined the amount of filterable mn including both mno2 and mn ii adsorbed on mno2 to better understand the mechanisms involved in sulfite enhanced mn ii removal process 2 3 solid phase characterization after specific tests the precipitates were collected on a 0 22 μm pore cellulose acetate membrane filter washed with deionized water freeze dried under vacuum and then placed into zippered bags for solid phase characterization the oxidation states of manganese species in the collected precipitates were analyzed with x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes shanghai synchrotron radiation facility china the detailed information for xanes analysis is presented in text s3 the morphology of the precipitates was characterized with a hitachi 4800 field emission scanning electron microscope sem at 3 kv 2 4 chemical analysis a shanghai leici ph meter with a saturated kcl solution as the electrolyte was used to measure the solution s ph the concentration of sulfite was quantified with a modified colorimetric procedure with dtnb as the chromogenic agent humphrey et al 1970 the detailed procedure for sulfite detection is presented in text s4 for the standard curve see fig s1 at the end of experiment a 10 ml sample was collected and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter quenched with one drop of na2s2o3 stock solution acidified with one drop of 65 hno3 then subjected to determine the residual mn concentration using a perkin elmer optima 5300 dv icp oes the filterable mn was determined by subtracting the concentration of residual mn from the initial concentration of mn ii qualitative analysis of the oxidized sulfur species generated in this process with ion chromatography ic and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry under multiple reaction monitoring modes lc ms ms mrm revealed that hso5 and so4 2 were the oxidation products of sulfite in sulfite enhanced mn ii removal process details of the qualitative analysis of the oxidized sulfur species are presented in text s5 in this study a modified abts method was adopted to determine the concentrations of generated mno2 and hso5 colorless 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts can react with oxidants via single electron transfer process to give abts a stable green colored radical ion which can be quantified spectrophotometrically at 645 nm fan et al 2017b in our previous study we found that hso5 interferes with the abts analysis of mno2 at ph 2 0 sun et al 2018a here we found that the ability of hso5 to oxidize abts was efficiently suppressed at ph 6 0 whereas the oxidation by mno2 was unaffected therefore we could first obtain the mno2 concentration at ph 6 0 then the total concentration of mno2 and hso5 was derived at ph 2 0 where both of them reacted with abts at a stoichiometry of 2 1 the concentration of hso5 was calculated by the subtraction method relevant standard curves of the abts method see fig s2 moreover to avoid changes in mno2 and hso5 concentrations during measurement edta a chelating agent was added to the samples immediately after they were collected in order to halt the mn ii oxidation by complexing mn ii the influence of co existing mn ii 100 μm and hso5 40 μm on the detection of mno2 with the abts method at ph 6 0 was found negligible fig s3 verifying the validity of this modified abts method for determining the concentrations of mno2 and hso5 details for analyzing the concentrations of mno2 and hso5 are presented in text s6 for the experiments investigating the effects of fe ii and fe iii on sulfite promoted mn ii removal fe iii may affect the analysis of mno2 and hso5 dissolved fe iii was found capable of oxidizing abts to abts at ph 2 0 for the standard curve see fig s2 but not at ph 6 0 therefore the contribution of fe iii to the abts oxidation needs to be deducted from the determined total concentration of mno2 and hso5 the concentration of fe iii was obtained by subtracting the concentration of fe ii from that of total iron the concentration of fe ii was examined with a modified ferrozine method using a persee tu 1901 uv visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 560 nm fan et al 2017a and the concentration of total iron was analyzed using icp oes different from fe iii the presence of other metal ions such as ca ii na i and fe ii had negligible influences on the determination of mno2 and hso5 concentrations with the abts method dmpo was used as the spin trapping agent in the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments to determine the presence of radicals in the system oh et al 2016 further details of epr analysis are given in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of sulfite enhanced mn ii removal and products characterization the oxidative removal of 36 μm mn ii by aeration in pure water was evaluated at phini 7 0 as expected no filterable manganese was detected even after 120 min aeration fig s4a which is in line with results reported in other studies kouzbour et al 2017 morgan 2005 however upon the addition of sulfite the mn ii solution turns yellow quickly implying the occurrence of mn ii oxidation since the filterable manganese may be a mixture of mn ii mn iii and mn iv we collected the xanes spectrum of the precipitates produced from the mn ii sulfite process and made linear combination fit analysis to identify the mn species as illustrated in fig 2 a the major mn species in the collected sample are mn iv 85 7 and mn ii 14 3 mn ii contained in the filterable precipitate can be mainly ascribed to its adsorption on freshly generated mno2 therefore mn ii can be removed by both transformation to mno2 and adsorption on the generated mno2 in the following section the generated mno2 reo defined as the amount of removed mn ii by oxidation the filterable mn ref defined as the amount of removed mn ii by filtration as well as the amount of mn removed by adsorption rea ref reo were quantified to better elucidate the process of sulfite promoted mn ii removal with regard to the mn ii catalyzed oxidation of s iv a series of sulfur oxides including so4 2 hso5 s2o6 2 s2o8 2 and s2o7 2 are likely to be involved brandt and van eldik 1995 ic was employed to clarify the final sulfite oxidation products but only sulfate so4 2 was detected fig 2b in view of the possible effects of strong alkaline ic mobile phase on the detection of other possible sulfur oxidation products we subsequently analyzed the reaction solution with lc ms ms interestingly under mrm mode signals assigned to so4 2 m z 97 1 and hso5 m z 113 0 were detected in the spectrum fig 2c and their major abundant product ions are the same as that of standard so4 2 and hso5 solutions respectively figs s5a b therefore so4 2 and hso5 are believed to be the major oxidized products of sulfite this result is in accordance with that reported in previous literature fronaeus et al 1998 where hso5 is proposed to be an important intermediate participating in the catalytic cycle for the manganese catalyzed auto oxidation of sulfite under acidic conditions and so4 2 is suggested to be the stable oxidation product of sulfite since so4 2 is redox inert yet hso5 is an unsymmetrical oxidant with a standard redox potential of 1 82 v ghanbari and moradi 2017 hso5 may be an important active oxidant for the enhanced oxidative removal of mn ii in the presence of sulfite 3 2 factors affecting the process of sulfite promoted mn removal 3 2 1 effect of sulfite dosage the kinetics of sulfite consumption and mno2 generation were determined as a function of sulfite dosage at phini 7 0 in mn ii sulfite system and the results are shown in fig 3 a and b control experiments fig s4b revealed that the oxidation of sulfite by oxygen is very slow without mn ii and only 1 8 μm sulfite is oxidized within 4 min however complete disappearance of sulfite was observed within 4 min with the presence of mn ii and at the same initial sulfite concentration 36 μm and phini 7 0 as depicted in fig 3a which should be ascribed to the catalyzing effect of mn ii connick and zhang 1996 fig 3a demonstrates that the concentration of sulfite drops linearly with time after a lag phase in mn ii sulfite system regardless of the initial sulfite concentration clearly indicating a zero order dependence of the reaction rate on sulfite concentration this result corresponds well with the observed constant disappearance rate of o2 in the process of mn ii catalyzed sulfite oxidation by o2 connick and zhang 1996 the disappearance kinetics of sulfite at various initial sulfite concentrations in the presence of 36 μm mn ii are simulated with the zero order rate law as illustrated by the solid lines in fig 3a and the obtained sulfite consumption rates are summarized in table s2 as the initial concentration of sulfite increased from 36 to 108 μm the sulfite consumption rate increases from 10 2 to 42 0 μm min however a further increase in the sulfite concentration results in a lower but almost steady sulfite consumption rate some researchers reported that the first order dependence of sulfite appearance rate at low sulfur concentrations changes to a zero order dependence at high sulfite concentrations ibusuki and barnes 1984 martin and hill 1987 similar to the phenomenon observed in this study fig 3b shows that the generation of mno2 is negligible without sulfite dosing but 7 0 μm mno2 is generated after 90 min once 36 μm of sulfite is spiked into the solution at the beginning of the reaction the maximum amount of mno2 is produced when the initial sulfite concentration is 108 μm interestingly mno2 does not accumulate until the depletion of sulfite which may be ascribed to the rapid reduction of generated mn iii by sulfite before the depletion of sulfite brandt and eldik 1995 podkrajšek et al 2004 the initial generation kinetics of mno2 as a function of initial sulfite concentration is simulated with the zero order rate law as illustrated by the solid lines in fig 3b the obtained mno2 generation rate constants are listed in table s2 fig 3c illustrates that 27 6 39 5 mn ii can be removed by filtration after reaction with 36 180 μm sulfite for 90 min the fraction of adsorbed mn ii constitutes 11 5 29 6 of the filterable mn consistent with the linear combination fits of the mn k edge xanes spectrum fig 2a the amounts of hso5 accumulated in the mn ii sulfite system at the time point where sulfite is depleted were determined for each experimental set at phini 7 0 and the results are presented in fig 3c generally a positive correlation is observed between the amount of generated mno2 and that of generated hso5 indicating that hso5 is responsible for mn ii oxidation moreover it was found that the generation of mno2 is accompanied by the consumption of hso5 and the molar ratio of consumed hso5 to that of generated mno2 is 1 1 fig s6 indicating the overall reaction of mn ii with hso5 follows reaction 2 2 hso5 mn2 h2o so4 2 mno2 3h 3 2 2 effect of phini level after determining the optimum sulfite dosage 108 μm for mn ii removal at phini 7 0 the influence of phini on the performance of sulfite promoted mn ii removal was examined and the results are summarized in figs 4 a c fig 4a demonstrates that the oxidation of sulfite is strongly dependent on phini no obvious lag phase is observed at phini 6 0 6 5 but the duration of the lag phase is prolonged with increasing phini from 7 0 to 9 0 which can be ascribed to the more difficult chain initiation process at phini 7 5 lim and hamrick 1984 excluding the lag phase and tailing data the main portion of each dataset for sulfite disappearance can be simulated with the zero order rate law the sulfite disappearance rates are found to decrease gradually from 94 2 to 10 μm min with elevating phini from 6 0 to 9 0 which is likely associated with changes in the species distribution of sulfite and mn ii at different ph values the distributions of s iv oxide species neta and huie 1985 and mn ii species zhang et al 1994 as a function of ph are shown in fig s7 specifically at ph 6 0 the fraction of so3 2 increases with ph and hso3 is commonly documented to be more readily oxidized to s vi species than so3 2 in the presence of mn ii hoffmann and edwards 1975 in addition the shift of the dominant form of mn ii from mn2 reactive to its hydroxide form mnoh at phini 7 0 via reaction 3 zhang et al 1994 may also contribute to the decrease in sulfite consumption rate 3 mn2 h2o k mnoh h k ca 2 10 11 fig 4b exhibits the mno2 generation kinetics whilst fig 4c summarizes both the amount of mn removed by oxidation and or adsorption after 120 min reaction and the amount of hso5 generated at different phini levels about 60 of consumed sulfite is transformed into hso5 at phini 6 0 6 5 with a further increase in ph however the amount of generated hso5 decreases sharply from 60 μm at phini 6 5 to 15 μm at phini 7 5 and remaine almost constant at phini 7 5 9 0 for sets investigating the effects of initial sulfite concentration and phini we found there is a linear regression between the quantity of hso5 generated and the sulfite consumption rates fig s8 but the reason for this remains unknown at this stage it is revealed in the section the effect of sulfite dosage the transformation rate of mn ii into mno2 is strongly dependent on the quantity of hso5 generated when the phini is 7 0 however no such dependency is found in trials investigating the effects of phini over the phini range of 6 0 9 0 although the rate of sulfite oxidation along with the quantity of hso5 generated reach a maximum at phini 6 0 the formation of mno2 is negligible at this ph level as phini increases from 6 0 to 7 0 the percentage of mn ii transformed into mno2 ascends considerably from 3 4 to 39 4 then drops to 20 at phini 7 5 9 0 with the highest percentage of mn ii oxidation achieved at phini 7 0 where the quantity of hso5 generated is 35 μm the minor formation of mno2 at phini 6 0 6 5 in spite of the presence of a large amount of hso5 is likely associated with the large energy cost of oxidizing mn2 to its corresponding mn iii species morgan 2005 above ph 6 5 the shift of mn2 to the hydroxide form can reduce the energy barrier for oxidation morgan 2005 accordingly it is reasonable that many previous studies reported the oxidation of mn ii by o2 clo2 kmno4 and by the electrocoagulation h2o2 system increases progressively with increasing ph van benschoten et al 1992 morgan 2005 van genuchten and pena 2017 in this study similar amounts of mno2 are generated at phini 7 5 9 0 which differs from the ph dependence of mn ii oxidation reported in the literature this is because the solution ph drops to 7 0 after the depletion of sulfite in mn ii sulfite process when phini is in the range of 7 5 9 0 table s2 in summary whereas the generation of hso5 the oxidant responsible for mn ii oxidation in mn ii sulfite process is favored under acidic conditions mn ii is more easily oxidized by hso5 under neutral and alkaline conditions as a result the optimum removal of mn ii in the presence of sulfite is achieved at phini 7 0 in pure water 3 2 3 effect of various metal ions the influences of co existing metal ions na i ca ii fe ii and fe iii on sulfite promoted mn ii removal were investigated at phini 7 0 it was found that mn ii removal is significantly inhibited with the concentration of nacl increasing from 0 to 200 mg of na l fig 5 a to unravel the influence of anions the kinetics of sulfite promoted mn ii removal in the presence of nacl na2so4 naclo4 or nano3 at two concentrations 100 mg na l and 200 mg na l were determined and the results are shown in fig s9 obviously the counter anions have no obvious differential effect on the kinetics of mno2 generation in the presence of excess na i thus the negative effect of nacl on sulfite promoted mn ii removal should be associated with either na i or the ionic strength fig 5b demonstrates that cacl2 at the same mass concentration as nacl has much greater inhibiting effect on mn ii removal as well as hso5 generation than nacl the influences of nacl and cacl2 on mno2 generation and hso5 generation were further compared by converting their concentrations to ionic strength as demonstrated in fig s10 obviously the inhibited mn ii removal at elevated nacl or cacl2 concentration should be primarily ascribed to the increased ionic strength and secondly due to the cation species the result is consistent with the negative effect of ionic strength on the kinetics of sulfite oxidation by oxygen martin and hill 1987 the slightly stronger inhibiting effect of ca ii compared to na i might be due to the stronger interaction of ca ii with sulfite millero et al 1989 the presence of fe ii or fe iii has very different effects on mn ii removal than that of na i and ca ii as shown in fig 5c and d the quantity of generated hso5 decreases from 35 1 μm to 25 1 26 6 μm due to the presence of 0 5 3 0 mg l of fe iii the presence of 0 5 mg l of fe iii slightly depresses mno2 generation while the amount of generated mno2 in the presence of 1 0 3 0 mg l of fe iii equals to or is lightly greater than that without fe iii fig s11 summarizes the data on generated mno2 and adsorbed mn ii obtained under various conditions there is a good correlation between them verifying that the freshly formed mno2 offers adsorption sites for mn ii as fe iii concentration elevates from 1 0 to 3 0 mg l the amount of adsorbed mn ii increases progressively and the removal efficiency of total mn is increased by 24 in the presence of 3 0 mg l of fe iii although the amount of generated mno2 varies slightly which may be ascribed to the coagulating function of fe iii wang et al 2019 the coagulating function of fe iii is also revealed by the larger flocs formed in mn ii sulfite process with the presence of fe iii compared to its counterpart without fe iii as illustrated in figs s12a b compared to fe iii fe ii has a much greater enhancing effect on mn ii removal the dosing of fe ii not only considerably enhances the oxidation of mn ii but also promotes the adsorption of mn ii on generated solids with the presence of 1 0 mg l fe ii the percentage of mn ii transformed into mno2 is enhanced to 71 8 which is 32 higher than that obtained without fe ii this may be due to the following reasons firstly sulfite is completely consumed within 20 s in the presence of 1 0 mg l fe ii data not shown and thus the duration for mn ii oxidation by hso5 is prolonged secondly the enhanced mn ii oxidation may be ascribed to the activation of hso5 by residual fe ii after sulfite depletion or the solids generated in the process the amount of adsorbed mn ii increases from 6 3 to 26 7 by increasing the fe ii concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l the greater enhancing effect of fe ii on mn ii removal via adsorption than fe iii should be due to the better coagulating effect of fe iii formed in situ than commercial fe iii guan et al 2009 and the larger amount of generated mno2 which provides adsorption sites for mn ii consequently mn ii removal is as high as 98 with the addition of 1 0 mg l of fe ii and both the residual mn 0 1 mg l mn and fe 0 3 mg l fe can meet china s drinking water standard moreover it was observed that the presence of fe ii benefits the aggregation and precipitation of the generated mno2 which is consistent with the phenomenon that larger tighter and denser flocs are generated in the presence of fe ii as revealed by the sem images in fig s12c 3 3 identification of the active oxidants contributing to mn ii oxidation the above evidence indicates that hso5 is the key species contributing to the sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation process in addition to direct oxidation by hso5 mn ii may also be oxidized by various reactive species since it has been documented that mn ii and mno2 can activate hso5 to generate so4 and so5 radicals following reactions 4 5 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 ghanbari and moradi 2017 the generated so4 radicals can further react with h2o oh to produce ho oh et al 2016 moreover some researchers have proposed that hso5 self decomposition without explicit activation could generate singlet oxygen 1o2 yang et al 2018 all these reactive oxygen species ross including so4 so5 ho and 1o2 are potential active oxidants contributing mn ii oxidation in mn ii sulfite system 4 hso5 mn2 mniii so4 2 oh 5 hso5 2mno2 mn2o3 so5 oh to identify the major oxidants involved in the process of sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation epr spectra were collected using dmpo as a spin trap for so4 and ho oh et al 2016 as shown in fig 6 a 1 only the characteristic signal of dmpo so3 αn 14 7 g αh 15 9 g sun et al 2018b was observed for the mn ii sulfite system at phini 7 0 when dmpo was spiked into the sulfite solution before the addition of mn ii as proposed in the literature the initial generation of so3 in the absence of mn iii can be ascribed to the oxidation of mn ii into mn iii by trace quantities of fe iii 10 8 mol l eqs 1 and 2 in table 1 or by an interaction between hso3 and traces of fe iii reactions 6 7 grgić and berčič 2001 warneck and ziajka 1995 such low concentration of fe iii are usually present as impurities in chemicals and purified water grgić and berčič 2001 the generated so3 can be rapidly oxidized by o2 into so5 with a rate constant as large as 1 5 2 5 109 m 1 s 1 eq 3 in table 1 brandt and van eldik 1995 connick and zhang 1996 so5 can be further transformed into hso5 and so4 2 via eqs 4 and 6 9 in table 1 berglund et al 1994 brandt and van eldik 1995 6 fe iii hso3 feohso3h k 600 l mol 7 feohso3h fe2 so3 h2o k 0 065 s 1 since mn ii was not oxidized until sulfite was depleted the epr spectrum of the mn ii sulfite system was also collected during the mn ii oxidation phase i e dmpo was spiked 13 min after the initiation of the reaction between mn ii and sulfite as shown in fig 6 a 2 the spectrum characteristic of the dmpo ho adduct quartet lines with peak a height ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed xiong et al 2015 in addition the typical spectrum of the dmpo ho adduct was also observed by mixing mn ii hso5 and dmpo as demonstrated in fig 6a 3 these results further confirm that mn ii is oxidized by the radicals generated via hso5 activation although only dmpo ho was detected in the mn ii oxidation process the contribution of so4 radicals for mn ii oxidation cannot be excluded because the dmpo so4 adduct is unstable and readily transforms into the more stable dmpo ho adduct via nucleophilic substitution oh et al 2016 moreover no epr signal for so5 has been reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge to further clarify the contribution of various radicals to mn ii oxidation the influence of quenching agents on mn ii transformation to mno2 was investigated it is well known that tert butyl alcohol tba can effectively quench ho k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 but not so4 k 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 while ethanol etoh can effectively quench both ho k 9 7 108 m 1s 1 and so4 k 3 2 106 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 in addition so5 is relatively nonreactive toward both tba and etoh k 103 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 both tba and etoh significantly slow sulfite consumption in the mn ii sulfite system as shown in fig s13 which may be due to the inhibition effect of alcohols on the radical chain reactions involved in sulfite oxidation wang et al 2009 thus etoh and tba were dosed into the mn ii sulfite system after the depletion of sulfite to assess the contributions of different species to mn ii oxidation as shown in fig 6b the presence of 100 mm of tba has a negligible influence on mn ii oxidation but the process of mn ii transformation to mno2 is completely suppressed by 100 mm of etoh these results suggest that neither so5 nor ho is the major active oxidant in the mn ii sulfite system h2o2 is known to react with hso5 to generate 1o2 reaction 8 yang et al 2018 to exclude the dominant role of 1o2 in the mn ii oxidation process h2o2 was added after the depletion of sulfite despite the enhanced rate of 1o2 production mn ii oxidation is greatly depressed fig 6b which can be explained by the h2o2 induced partial decomposition of hso5 fig 6c consequently so4 is identified as the major reactive species responsible for mn ii oxidation and the reactions involved in the mn oxidation phase are illustrated by eqs 13 15 in table 1 the mechanisms for the sulfite promoted removal of mn ii are schematically illustrated in fig 7 a and the influences of various factors on sulfite enhanced mn ii removal are summarized in fig 7b since fe ii is much more efficient than fe iii and mn ii for activating hso5 to generate so4 reaction 9 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 the dosing of fe ii greatly promoted the oxidation of mn ii in mn ii sulfite system 8 hso5 h2o2 h so4 2 h2o 1o2 9 fe ii hso5 fe iii so4 oh 3 4 effectiveness in real water the efficiency of mn ii removal from three real water samples was also examined to demonstrate the effectiveness of sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation process the properties of the three water samples i e a tap water sample from our laboratory and two groundwater samples collected from langfang city and xi an respectively are summarized in table s3 as presented in fig 8 at phini 7 0 and upon the application of 108 μm sulfite quite similar mn removal 30 is observed for two groundwater samples and 54 mn removal is achieved in tap water the ineffective removal of mn ii in these three water samples can be ascribed to the ca ii and na i present in real water samples table s3 the higher removal efficiency of mn ii in tap water compared to that in groundwater samples may be due to the much lower na i concentration 53 4 mg l compared to that in the two groundwater samples 113 3 126 6 mg l the performance of sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation in real water samples was determined with the presence of 1 0 mg l of fe ii similar to the results in pure water the presence of 1 0 mg l of fe ii greatly improves mn ii removal in the three real water samples and the mn ii removal efficiency is as high as 86 in the tap water furthermore the residual fe ii concentration is below 0 10 mg l for all three treated real water samples therefore sulfite enhanced mn ii removal can be an effective method for removing mn ii from groundwater especially for groundwater containing both mn ii and fe ii 4 conclusions this study offers an innovative approach for mn ii removal from water via the oxidants generated in the process of mn ii catalyzed sulfite oxidation under aerobic conditions the major conclusions include 1 the enhancing effect of sulfite on mn ii oxidation by o2 is associated with the generation of so3 which can rapidly combine with o2 to form so5 and further transforms into hso5 hso5 is the major oxidant contributing to the oxidation of mn ii to mno2 which initiates after the depletion of sulfite 2 epr and radical scavenging studies demonstrate that the so4 radical is the crucial active oxidant responsible for mn ii oxidation by hso5 3 nacl and cacl2 thwart mn ii removal in the presence of sulfite which is primarily due to the inhibiting effect of high ionic strength on hso5 generation fe iii has a slight influence while fe ii considerably enhances mn ii removal since fe ii is much more efficient than fe iii for activating hso5 to generate so4 and thus the oxidation of mn ii and the adsorption of mn ii to the generated mno2 are promoted 4 the experiments with real water samples also demonstrate the effectiveness of the sulfite promoted mn ii removal process especially in the presence of fe ii in sum the use of sulfite to enhance mn ii removal from water may represent a promising alternative to conventional methods since it is cost effective environmentally friendly easily applied and the final stable product of sulfite is sulfate a common anion in groundwater moreover the concentration of generated sulfate in mn ii sulfite process is much below the maximum contaminant level of the china s drinking water standard for sulfate 250 mg l further studies with natural groundwater samples with elevated mn ii concentration under weak alkaline conditions are needed to verify the effectiveness of sulfite enhanced mn ii removal approach acknowledgment this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 21522704 the authors thank the beamline bl14w1 shanghai

18870,taking advantage of the active oxidants generated in the process of mn ii catalyzed sulfite oxidation by oxygen this study sought to enhance mn ii removal from water by activating oxygen with sulfite the results revealed that mn ii can be effectively oxidized by oxygen to mno2 with the addition of sulfite under environmentally relevant conditions and the performance of this process is dependent on the dosage of sulfite and the initial ph mn k edge xanes analysis indicates that mn ii removal is primarily due to the transformation of mn ii to mno2 and secondarily to the adsorption of mn ii on generated mno2 co existing nacl and cacl2 negatively affect mn ii removal while the presence of fe ii considerably enhances mn ii removal by improving both mn ii oxidation and mn ii adsorption on the generated solids consequently mn ii removal is as high as 98 in the presence of 1 0 mg l of fe ii and both the residual mn 0 1 mg l mn and fe 0 3 mg l fe can meet china s drinking water standard the experiments with real water samples also demonstrate the effectiveness of the sulfite promoted mn ii removal process especially in the presence of fe ii the enhancing effect of sulfite on mn ii oxidation by oxygen is mainly associated with the generation of hso5 and the critical step for generating hso5 is the rapid oxidation of so3 by oxygen epr and radical scavenging studies demonstrate that so4 radical is the key reactive oxygen species responsible for mn ii oxidation by hso5 graphical abstract image 1 keywords mn ii oxidation peroxymonosulfate sulfite sulfate radicals so4 1 introduction groundwater is a preferred drinking water source when the potable surface water is inaccessible particularly in arid and semi arid regions worldwide lyu et al 2019 over 400 major cities in china utilize groundwater as drinking water source jia et al 2018 manganese is a common mineral in groundwater piazza et al 2019 and exists mainly as reduced soluble form of mn ii mn concentration of groundwater in china can range up to 2 0 mg l attributed to factitious pollution and dissolution from soil and rock jia et al 2018 although mn is one of the essential trace elements for human health lyu et al 2019 excess mn in water supply system could result in aesthetic operational and health related problems scholz 2016 the chinese government established a drinking water standard of 0 1 mg l for mn in 2006 gb5749 2006 and thus the removal of excess mn ii from groundwater is a necessity oxidation is a conventional method used to separate manganese from water by transforming soluble mn ii into sparingly soluble manganese oxides which can be removed by subsequent coagulation sedimentation treatment patil et al 2016 however the oxidation of mn ii in homogeneous solutions by atmospheric oxygen is kinetically slow with a half life of about 400 days which is likely due to the d5 electron configuration of mn ii diem and stumm 1984 therefore a number of methods have been proposed to enhance the transformation of mn ii into mn oxides in the process of drinking water treatment including chemical oxidation with strong oxidants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide ozone ferrate and permanganate van benschoten et al 1992 choo et al 2005 goodwill et al 2016 biological oxidation hoyland et al 2014 and surface catalyzed oxidation with o2 jones and knocke 2017 recent studies suggest that o2 ho and fe vi produced from photochemical reactions electrochemical processes and extracellular microbiological processes may present an efficient pathway for the oxidation of mn ii baral et al 1986 van genuchten and pena 2017 learman et al 2011 nico et al 2002 wuttig et al 2013 these highly reactive species can react with aqueous mn ii with rate constants of 107 108 m 1s 1 table s1 thus even at quite low concentrations these species can appreciably affect the geochemical cycles of several metals including mn ii in natural water wuttig et al 2013 it is well known that mn ii is an active catalyst for s iv autooxidation in aqueous solutions connick and zhang 1996 grgić and berčič 2001 the s iv oxidation process has been extensively studied to understand its kinetics and mechanisms largely due to its involvement in the formation of acid rain the desulfurization of flue gas and biological systems siskos et al 1984 connick and zhang 1996 brandt and van eldik 1995 it was found that various oxidants including so5 e so5 hso5 1 1 v vs nhe at ph 7 0 strongly oxidizing so4 e so4 so4 2 2 5 3 1 v neta et al 1988 and ho e ho h2o 2 7 v in acidic conditions and e ho ho 1 8 v in neutral conditions buxton et al 1988 could generate in the process of mn ii catalyzed oxidation of so2 by o2 connick and zhang 1996 eqs 3 9 in table 1 previous studies have proposed that the role of mn ii in catalyzing the oxidation of so2 by o2 was as a chain propagator i e mn ii can be oxidized by so5 into mn iii firstly and then the generated mn iii oxidize so3 2 to give so3 which will combine with o2 to form so5 again eqs 3 5 in table 1 berglund et al 1993 brandt and van eldik 1995 connick and zhang 1996 in addition it is well known that mn iii is prone to disproportionate to mno2 and mn ii with an equilibrium constant log k 7 9 reaction 1 klewicki and morgan 1998 taking together the oxidation of mn ii to mno2 by o2 may be accelerated with the addition of hso3 so3 2 the aqueous species of so2 zhang et al 2010 reported that oxidative precipitation with a so2 air mixture was much more effective than that with air alone for mn ii removal from a typical synthetic laterite waste solution containing 2 0 g l mn ii however in their study the oxidation experiments were carried out at 60 c and the initial concentration of mn ii was three orders of magnitude higher than those involved in drinking water treatment these conditions are quite different from the scenarios involved in drinking water treatment 1 2mn iii h2o mno2 mn2 4h log k 7 9 considering that o2 is ubiquitous in nature and sodium sulfite na2so3 is inexpensive and environmentally friendly here we propose using sulfite to enhance the oxidative removal of mn ii from drinking water by o2 specifically the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the feasibility of adding sulfite to enhance mn ii removal from both simulated and real groundwater 2 determine the influence of operating conditions such as sulfite concentration initial ph phini and co existing ions on the performance of sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation by o2 and 3 clarify the mechanisms of mn ii oxidation in the system by characterizing the precipitated solids the transformed sulfur species and the generated radicals it should be specified that both hso3 and so3 2 are present in solution over the typical ph range 6 0 9 0 of groundwater jia et al 2018 because the second pk a of h2so3 is 7 2 neta and huie 1985 thus the term sulfite or so3 2 used in the following section refers to the equilibrium mixture of hso3 and so3 2 unless otherwise specified the results of this study may provide an alternative method for mn ii removal in drinking water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals a complete listing of reagents is provided in supporting information si text s1 2 2 experimental procedures the process of carrying out batch experiments for investigating sulfite promoted mn ii removal is summarized in fig 1 specifically experiments were performed in open air in two transparent wide mouth glass bottles v 250 ml unless otherwise noted the 200 ml working solution only contained 36 μm of mncl2 2 0 mg mn ii l and its initial ph phini was adjusted to the predetermined value using hcl and naoh after 5 min of stirring to ensure the working solution was saturated with o2 the reaction was initiated by spiking the solution with a set number of aliquots of 150 mm na2so3 stock solution to reach the targeted sulfite concentration the stock solution of na2so3 was freshly prepared and used within 2 h for each set of experiment to avoid its oxidation before use and its ph was adjusted to that of the working solution before dosing to the working solution to investigate the influence of co existing ions the constituent of interest nacl na2so4 nano3 naclo4 or cacl2 fecl2 or fecl3 was spiked into the working solution before ph adjustment since fe is a common co contaminant with mn ii in groundwater with concentration generally below 10 0 mg l jia et al 2018 we also investigated the influence of both fecl2 and fecl3 on the mn ii sulfite process the initial concentration of mn ii in groundwater samples collected from cities of xi an and langfang was increased to 36 μm 2 0 mg l manually by adding mncl2 stock solution to examine the efficiency of mn ii removal in real water with the sulfite promoted oxygenation method detailed information about two natural groundwater samples used in this study was provided in text s2 for all experiments the solution in the flask was well mixed via magnetic stirring and its temperature was maintained at 25 1 c with a circulating water bath no buffer was used in this study to avoid its potential influence and no attempt was made to keep ph constant during the reaction all experiments were performed in at least duplicate unless otherwise noted the obtained data were averaged and the corresponding standard deviations were determined and presented to quantify the kinetics of sulfite consumption mn ii oxidation and hso5 reduction we collected samples at different time intervals to examine the residual sulfite as well as the concentrations of mno2 and hso5 in the solution the samples for sulfite determination did not need to be filtered because no mno2 generated until the depletion of sulfite the samples collected for analyzing the amount of produced mno2 and hso5 were not filtered it should be specified that mn ii can be removed by transforming to non soluble mno2 and adsorbing to the generated mno2 both the generated mno2 and the absorbed mn ii can be easily separated from water by filtration consequently this study not only quantified the amount of in situ produced mn oxides but also determined the amount of filterable mn including both mno2 and mn ii adsorbed on mno2 to better understand the mechanisms involved in sulfite enhanced mn ii removal process 2 3 solid phase characterization after specific tests the precipitates were collected on a 0 22 μm pore cellulose acetate membrane filter washed with deionized water freeze dried under vacuum and then placed into zippered bags for solid phase characterization the oxidation states of manganese species in the collected precipitates were analyzed with x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes shanghai synchrotron radiation facility china the detailed information for xanes analysis is presented in text s3 the morphology of the precipitates was characterized with a hitachi 4800 field emission scanning electron microscope sem at 3 kv 2 4 chemical analysis a shanghai leici ph meter with a saturated kcl solution as the electrolyte was used to measure the solution s ph the concentration of sulfite was quantified with a modified colorimetric procedure with dtnb as the chromogenic agent humphrey et al 1970 the detailed procedure for sulfite detection is presented in text s4 for the standard curve see fig s1 at the end of experiment a 10 ml sample was collected and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter quenched with one drop of na2s2o3 stock solution acidified with one drop of 65 hno3 then subjected to determine the residual mn concentration using a perkin elmer optima 5300 dv icp oes the filterable mn was determined by subtracting the concentration of residual mn from the initial concentration of mn ii qualitative analysis of the oxidized sulfur species generated in this process with ion chromatography ic and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry under multiple reaction monitoring modes lc ms ms mrm revealed that hso5 and so4 2 were the oxidation products of sulfite in sulfite enhanced mn ii removal process details of the qualitative analysis of the oxidized sulfur species are presented in text s5 in this study a modified abts method was adopted to determine the concentrations of generated mno2 and hso5 colorless 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts can react with oxidants via single electron transfer process to give abts a stable green colored radical ion which can be quantified spectrophotometrically at 645 nm fan et al 2017b in our previous study we found that hso5 interferes with the abts analysis of mno2 at ph 2 0 sun et al 2018a here we found that the ability of hso5 to oxidize abts was efficiently suppressed at ph 6 0 whereas the oxidation by mno2 was unaffected therefore we could first obtain the mno2 concentration at ph 6 0 then the total concentration of mno2 and hso5 was derived at ph 2 0 where both of them reacted with abts at a stoichiometry of 2 1 the concentration of hso5 was calculated by the subtraction method relevant standard curves of the abts method see fig s2 moreover to avoid changes in mno2 and hso5 concentrations during measurement edta a chelating agent was added to the samples immediately after they were collected in order to halt the mn ii oxidation by complexing mn ii the influence of co existing mn ii 100 μm and hso5 40 μm on the detection of mno2 with the abts method at ph 6 0 was found negligible fig s3 verifying the validity of this modified abts method for determining the concentrations of mno2 and hso5 details for analyzing the concentrations of mno2 and hso5 are presented in text s6 for the experiments investigating the effects of fe ii and fe iii on sulfite promoted mn ii removal fe iii may affect the analysis of mno2 and hso5 dissolved fe iii was found capable of oxidizing abts to abts at ph 2 0 for the standard curve see fig s2 but not at ph 6 0 therefore the contribution of fe iii to the abts oxidation needs to be deducted from the determined total concentration of mno2 and hso5 the concentration of fe iii was obtained by subtracting the concentration of fe ii from that of total iron the concentration of fe ii was examined with a modified ferrozine method using a persee tu 1901 uv visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 560 nm fan et al 2017a and the concentration of total iron was analyzed using icp oes different from fe iii the presence of other metal ions such as ca ii na i and fe ii had negligible influences on the determination of mno2 and hso5 concentrations with the abts method dmpo was used as the spin trapping agent in the electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments to determine the presence of radicals in the system oh et al 2016 further details of epr analysis are given in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of sulfite enhanced mn ii removal and products characterization the oxidative removal of 36 μm mn ii by aeration in pure water was evaluated at phini 7 0 as expected no filterable manganese was detected even after 120 min aeration fig s4a which is in line with results reported in other studies kouzbour et al 2017 morgan 2005 however upon the addition of sulfite the mn ii solution turns yellow quickly implying the occurrence of mn ii oxidation since the filterable manganese may be a mixture of mn ii mn iii and mn iv we collected the xanes spectrum of the precipitates produced from the mn ii sulfite process and made linear combination fit analysis to identify the mn species as illustrated in fig 2 a the major mn species in the collected sample are mn iv 85 7 and mn ii 14 3 mn ii contained in the filterable precipitate can be mainly ascribed to its adsorption on freshly generated mno2 therefore mn ii can be removed by both transformation to mno2 and adsorption on the generated mno2 in the following section the generated mno2 reo defined as the amount of removed mn ii by oxidation the filterable mn ref defined as the amount of removed mn ii by filtration as well as the amount of mn removed by adsorption rea ref reo were quantified to better elucidate the process of sulfite promoted mn ii removal with regard to the mn ii catalyzed oxidation of s iv a series of sulfur oxides including so4 2 hso5 s2o6 2 s2o8 2 and s2o7 2 are likely to be involved brandt and van eldik 1995 ic was employed to clarify the final sulfite oxidation products but only sulfate so4 2 was detected fig 2b in view of the possible effects of strong alkaline ic mobile phase on the detection of other possible sulfur oxidation products we subsequently analyzed the reaction solution with lc ms ms interestingly under mrm mode signals assigned to so4 2 m z 97 1 and hso5 m z 113 0 were detected in the spectrum fig 2c and their major abundant product ions are the same as that of standard so4 2 and hso5 solutions respectively figs s5a b therefore so4 2 and hso5 are believed to be the major oxidized products of sulfite this result is in accordance with that reported in previous literature fronaeus et al 1998 where hso5 is proposed to be an important intermediate participating in the catalytic cycle for the manganese catalyzed auto oxidation of sulfite under acidic conditions and so4 2 is suggested to be the stable oxidation product of sulfite since so4 2 is redox inert yet hso5 is an unsymmetrical oxidant with a standard redox potential of 1 82 v ghanbari and moradi 2017 hso5 may be an important active oxidant for the enhanced oxidative removal of mn ii in the presence of sulfite 3 2 factors affecting the process of sulfite promoted mn removal 3 2 1 effect of sulfite dosage the kinetics of sulfite consumption and mno2 generation were determined as a function of sulfite dosage at phini 7 0 in mn ii sulfite system and the results are shown in fig 3 a and b control experiments fig s4b revealed that the oxidation of sulfite by oxygen is very slow without mn ii and only 1 8 μm sulfite is oxidized within 4 min however complete disappearance of sulfite was observed within 4 min with the presence of mn ii and at the same initial sulfite concentration 36 μm and phini 7 0 as depicted in fig 3a which should be ascribed to the catalyzing effect of mn ii connick and zhang 1996 fig 3a demonstrates that the concentration of sulfite drops linearly with time after a lag phase in mn ii sulfite system regardless of the initial sulfite concentration clearly indicating a zero order dependence of the reaction rate on sulfite concentration this result corresponds well with the observed constant disappearance rate of o2 in the process of mn ii catalyzed sulfite oxidation by o2 connick and zhang 1996 the disappearance kinetics of sulfite at various initial sulfite concentrations in the presence of 36 μm mn ii are simulated with the zero order rate law as illustrated by the solid lines in fig 3a and the obtained sulfite consumption rates are summarized in table s2 as the initial concentration of sulfite increased from 36 to 108 μm the sulfite consumption rate increases from 10 2 to 42 0 μm min however a further increase in the sulfite concentration results in a lower but almost steady sulfite consumption rate some researchers reported that the first order dependence of sulfite appearance rate at low sulfur concentrations changes to a zero order dependence at high sulfite concentrations ibusuki and barnes 1984 martin and hill 1987 similar to the phenomenon observed in this study fig 3b shows that the generation of mno2 is negligible without sulfite dosing but 7 0 μm mno2 is generated after 90 min once 36 μm of sulfite is spiked into the solution at the beginning of the reaction the maximum amount of mno2 is produced when the initial sulfite concentration is 108 μm interestingly mno2 does not accumulate until the depletion of sulfite which may be ascribed to the rapid reduction of generated mn iii by sulfite before the depletion of sulfite brandt and eldik 1995 podkrajšek et al 2004 the initial generation kinetics of mno2 as a function of initial sulfite concentration is simulated with the zero order rate law as illustrated by the solid lines in fig 3b the obtained mno2 generation rate constants are listed in table s2 fig 3c illustrates that 27 6 39 5 mn ii can be removed by filtration after reaction with 36 180 μm sulfite for 90 min the fraction of adsorbed mn ii constitutes 11 5 29 6 of the filterable mn consistent with the linear combination fits of the mn k edge xanes spectrum fig 2a the amounts of hso5 accumulated in the mn ii sulfite system at the time point where sulfite is depleted were determined for each experimental set at phini 7 0 and the results are presented in fig 3c generally a positive correlation is observed between the amount of generated mno2 and that of generated hso5 indicating that hso5 is responsible for mn ii oxidation moreover it was found that the generation of mno2 is accompanied by the consumption of hso5 and the molar ratio of consumed hso5 to that of generated mno2 is 1 1 fig s6 indicating the overall reaction of mn ii with hso5 follows reaction 2 2 hso5 mn2 h2o so4 2 mno2 3h 3 2 2 effect of phini level after determining the optimum sulfite dosage 108 μm for mn ii removal at phini 7 0 the influence of phini on the performance of sulfite promoted mn ii removal was examined and the results are summarized in figs 4 a c fig 4a demonstrates that the oxidation of sulfite is strongly dependent on phini no obvious lag phase is observed at phini 6 0 6 5 but the duration of the lag phase is prolonged with increasing phini from 7 0 to 9 0 which can be ascribed to the more difficult chain initiation process at phini 7 5 lim and hamrick 1984 excluding the lag phase and tailing data the main portion of each dataset for sulfite disappearance can be simulated with the zero order rate law the sulfite disappearance rates are found to decrease gradually from 94 2 to 10 μm min with elevating phini from 6 0 to 9 0 which is likely associated with changes in the species distribution of sulfite and mn ii at different ph values the distributions of s iv oxide species neta and huie 1985 and mn ii species zhang et al 1994 as a function of ph are shown in fig s7 specifically at ph 6 0 the fraction of so3 2 increases with ph and hso3 is commonly documented to be more readily oxidized to s vi species than so3 2 in the presence of mn ii hoffmann and edwards 1975 in addition the shift of the dominant form of mn ii from mn2 reactive to its hydroxide form mnoh at phini 7 0 via reaction 3 zhang et al 1994 may also contribute to the decrease in sulfite consumption rate 3 mn2 h2o k mnoh h k ca 2 10 11 fig 4b exhibits the mno2 generation kinetics whilst fig 4c summarizes both the amount of mn removed by oxidation and or adsorption after 120 min reaction and the amount of hso5 generated at different phini levels about 60 of consumed sulfite is transformed into hso5 at phini 6 0 6 5 with a further increase in ph however the amount of generated hso5 decreases sharply from 60 μm at phini 6 5 to 15 μm at phini 7 5 and remaine almost constant at phini 7 5 9 0 for sets investigating the effects of initial sulfite concentration and phini we found there is a linear regression between the quantity of hso5 generated and the sulfite consumption rates fig s8 but the reason for this remains unknown at this stage it is revealed in the section the effect of sulfite dosage the transformation rate of mn ii into mno2 is strongly dependent on the quantity of hso5 generated when the phini is 7 0 however no such dependency is found in trials investigating the effects of phini over the phini range of 6 0 9 0 although the rate of sulfite oxidation along with the quantity of hso5 generated reach a maximum at phini 6 0 the formation of mno2 is negligible at this ph level as phini increases from 6 0 to 7 0 the percentage of mn ii transformed into mno2 ascends considerably from 3 4 to 39 4 then drops to 20 at phini 7 5 9 0 with the highest percentage of mn ii oxidation achieved at phini 7 0 where the quantity of hso5 generated is 35 μm the minor formation of mno2 at phini 6 0 6 5 in spite of the presence of a large amount of hso5 is likely associated with the large energy cost of oxidizing mn2 to its corresponding mn iii species morgan 2005 above ph 6 5 the shift of mn2 to the hydroxide form can reduce the energy barrier for oxidation morgan 2005 accordingly it is reasonable that many previous studies reported the oxidation of mn ii by o2 clo2 kmno4 and by the electrocoagulation h2o2 system increases progressively with increasing ph van benschoten et al 1992 morgan 2005 van genuchten and pena 2017 in this study similar amounts of mno2 are generated at phini 7 5 9 0 which differs from the ph dependence of mn ii oxidation reported in the literature this is because the solution ph drops to 7 0 after the depletion of sulfite in mn ii sulfite process when phini is in the range of 7 5 9 0 table s2 in summary whereas the generation of hso5 the oxidant responsible for mn ii oxidation in mn ii sulfite process is favored under acidic conditions mn ii is more easily oxidized by hso5 under neutral and alkaline conditions as a result the optimum removal of mn ii in the presence of sulfite is achieved at phini 7 0 in pure water 3 2 3 effect of various metal ions the influences of co existing metal ions na i ca ii fe ii and fe iii on sulfite promoted mn ii removal were investigated at phini 7 0 it was found that mn ii removal is significantly inhibited with the concentration of nacl increasing from 0 to 200 mg of na l fig 5 a to unravel the influence of anions the kinetics of sulfite promoted mn ii removal in the presence of nacl na2so4 naclo4 or nano3 at two concentrations 100 mg na l and 200 mg na l were determined and the results are shown in fig s9 obviously the counter anions have no obvious differential effect on the kinetics of mno2 generation in the presence of excess na i thus the negative effect of nacl on sulfite promoted mn ii removal should be associated with either na i or the ionic strength fig 5b demonstrates that cacl2 at the same mass concentration as nacl has much greater inhibiting effect on mn ii removal as well as hso5 generation than nacl the influences of nacl and cacl2 on mno2 generation and hso5 generation were further compared by converting their concentrations to ionic strength as demonstrated in fig s10 obviously the inhibited mn ii removal at elevated nacl or cacl2 concentration should be primarily ascribed to the increased ionic strength and secondly due to the cation species the result is consistent with the negative effect of ionic strength on the kinetics of sulfite oxidation by oxygen martin and hill 1987 the slightly stronger inhibiting effect of ca ii compared to na i might be due to the stronger interaction of ca ii with sulfite millero et al 1989 the presence of fe ii or fe iii has very different effects on mn ii removal than that of na i and ca ii as shown in fig 5c and d the quantity of generated hso5 decreases from 35 1 μm to 25 1 26 6 μm due to the presence of 0 5 3 0 mg l of fe iii the presence of 0 5 mg l of fe iii slightly depresses mno2 generation while the amount of generated mno2 in the presence of 1 0 3 0 mg l of fe iii equals to or is lightly greater than that without fe iii fig s11 summarizes the data on generated mno2 and adsorbed mn ii obtained under various conditions there is a good correlation between them verifying that the freshly formed mno2 offers adsorption sites for mn ii as fe iii concentration elevates from 1 0 to 3 0 mg l the amount of adsorbed mn ii increases progressively and the removal efficiency of total mn is increased by 24 in the presence of 3 0 mg l of fe iii although the amount of generated mno2 varies slightly which may be ascribed to the coagulating function of fe iii wang et al 2019 the coagulating function of fe iii is also revealed by the larger flocs formed in mn ii sulfite process with the presence of fe iii compared to its counterpart without fe iii as illustrated in figs s12a b compared to fe iii fe ii has a much greater enhancing effect on mn ii removal the dosing of fe ii not only considerably enhances the oxidation of mn ii but also promotes the adsorption of mn ii on generated solids with the presence of 1 0 mg l fe ii the percentage of mn ii transformed into mno2 is enhanced to 71 8 which is 32 higher than that obtained without fe ii this may be due to the following reasons firstly sulfite is completely consumed within 20 s in the presence of 1 0 mg l fe ii data not shown and thus the duration for mn ii oxidation by hso5 is prolonged secondly the enhanced mn ii oxidation may be ascribed to the activation of hso5 by residual fe ii after sulfite depletion or the solids generated in the process the amount of adsorbed mn ii increases from 6 3 to 26 7 by increasing the fe ii concentration from 0 to 1 0 mg l the greater enhancing effect of fe ii on mn ii removal via adsorption than fe iii should be due to the better coagulating effect of fe iii formed in situ than commercial fe iii guan et al 2009 and the larger amount of generated mno2 which provides adsorption sites for mn ii consequently mn ii removal is as high as 98 with the addition of 1 0 mg l of fe ii and both the residual mn 0 1 mg l mn and fe 0 3 mg l fe can meet china s drinking water standard moreover it was observed that the presence of fe ii benefits the aggregation and precipitation of the generated mno2 which is consistent with the phenomenon that larger tighter and denser flocs are generated in the presence of fe ii as revealed by the sem images in fig s12c 3 3 identification of the active oxidants contributing to mn ii oxidation the above evidence indicates that hso5 is the key species contributing to the sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation process in addition to direct oxidation by hso5 mn ii may also be oxidized by various reactive species since it has been documented that mn ii and mno2 can activate hso5 to generate so4 and so5 radicals following reactions 4 5 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 ghanbari and moradi 2017 the generated so4 radicals can further react with h2o oh to produce ho oh et al 2016 moreover some researchers have proposed that hso5 self decomposition without explicit activation could generate singlet oxygen 1o2 yang et al 2018 all these reactive oxygen species ross including so4 so5 ho and 1o2 are potential active oxidants contributing mn ii oxidation in mn ii sulfite system 4 hso5 mn2 mniii so4 2 oh 5 hso5 2mno2 mn2o3 so5 oh to identify the major oxidants involved in the process of sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation epr spectra were collected using dmpo as a spin trap for so4 and ho oh et al 2016 as shown in fig 6 a 1 only the characteristic signal of dmpo so3 αn 14 7 g αh 15 9 g sun et al 2018b was observed for the mn ii sulfite system at phini 7 0 when dmpo was spiked into the sulfite solution before the addition of mn ii as proposed in the literature the initial generation of so3 in the absence of mn iii can be ascribed to the oxidation of mn ii into mn iii by trace quantities of fe iii 10 8 mol l eqs 1 and 2 in table 1 or by an interaction between hso3 and traces of fe iii reactions 6 7 grgić and berčič 2001 warneck and ziajka 1995 such low concentration of fe iii are usually present as impurities in chemicals and purified water grgić and berčič 2001 the generated so3 can be rapidly oxidized by o2 into so5 with a rate constant as large as 1 5 2 5 109 m 1 s 1 eq 3 in table 1 brandt and van eldik 1995 connick and zhang 1996 so5 can be further transformed into hso5 and so4 2 via eqs 4 and 6 9 in table 1 berglund et al 1994 brandt and van eldik 1995 6 fe iii hso3 feohso3h k 600 l mol 7 feohso3h fe2 so3 h2o k 0 065 s 1 since mn ii was not oxidized until sulfite was depleted the epr spectrum of the mn ii sulfite system was also collected during the mn ii oxidation phase i e dmpo was spiked 13 min after the initiation of the reaction between mn ii and sulfite as shown in fig 6 a 2 the spectrum characteristic of the dmpo ho adduct quartet lines with peak a height ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed xiong et al 2015 in addition the typical spectrum of the dmpo ho adduct was also observed by mixing mn ii hso5 and dmpo as demonstrated in fig 6a 3 these results further confirm that mn ii is oxidized by the radicals generated via hso5 activation although only dmpo ho was detected in the mn ii oxidation process the contribution of so4 radicals for mn ii oxidation cannot be excluded because the dmpo so4 adduct is unstable and readily transforms into the more stable dmpo ho adduct via nucleophilic substitution oh et al 2016 moreover no epr signal for so5 has been reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge to further clarify the contribution of various radicals to mn ii oxidation the influence of quenching agents on mn ii transformation to mno2 was investigated it is well known that tert butyl alcohol tba can effectively quench ho k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 but not so4 k 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 while ethanol etoh can effectively quench both ho k 9 7 108 m 1s 1 and so4 k 3 2 106 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 in addition so5 is relatively nonreactive toward both tba and etoh k 103 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 both tba and etoh significantly slow sulfite consumption in the mn ii sulfite system as shown in fig s13 which may be due to the inhibition effect of alcohols on the radical chain reactions involved in sulfite oxidation wang et al 2009 thus etoh and tba were dosed into the mn ii sulfite system after the depletion of sulfite to assess the contributions of different species to mn ii oxidation as shown in fig 6b the presence of 100 mm of tba has a negligible influence on mn ii oxidation but the process of mn ii transformation to mno2 is completely suppressed by 100 mm of etoh these results suggest that neither so5 nor ho is the major active oxidant in the mn ii sulfite system h2o2 is known to react with hso5 to generate 1o2 reaction 8 yang et al 2018 to exclude the dominant role of 1o2 in the mn ii oxidation process h2o2 was added after the depletion of sulfite despite the enhanced rate of 1o2 production mn ii oxidation is greatly depressed fig 6b which can be explained by the h2o2 induced partial decomposition of hso5 fig 6c consequently so4 is identified as the major reactive species responsible for mn ii oxidation and the reactions involved in the mn oxidation phase are illustrated by eqs 13 15 in table 1 the mechanisms for the sulfite promoted removal of mn ii are schematically illustrated in fig 7 a and the influences of various factors on sulfite enhanced mn ii removal are summarized in fig 7b since fe ii is much more efficient than fe iii and mn ii for activating hso5 to generate so4 reaction 9 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 the dosing of fe ii greatly promoted the oxidation of mn ii in mn ii sulfite system 8 hso5 h2o2 h so4 2 h2o 1o2 9 fe ii hso5 fe iii so4 oh 3 4 effectiveness in real water the efficiency of mn ii removal from three real water samples was also examined to demonstrate the effectiveness of sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation process the properties of the three water samples i e a tap water sample from our laboratory and two groundwater samples collected from langfang city and xi an respectively are summarized in table s3 as presented in fig 8 at phini 7 0 and upon the application of 108 μm sulfite quite similar mn removal 30 is observed for two groundwater samples and 54 mn removal is achieved in tap water the ineffective removal of mn ii in these three water samples can be ascribed to the ca ii and na i present in real water samples table s3 the higher removal efficiency of mn ii in tap water compared to that in groundwater samples may be due to the much lower na i concentration 53 4 mg l compared to that in the two groundwater samples 113 3 126 6 mg l the performance of sulfite enhanced mn ii oxidation in real water samples was determined with the presence of 1 0 mg l of fe ii similar to the results in pure water the presence of 1 0 mg l of fe ii greatly improves mn ii removal in the three real water samples and the mn ii removal efficiency is as high as 86 in the tap water furthermore the residual fe ii concentration is below 0 10 mg l for all three treated real water samples therefore sulfite enhanced mn ii removal can be an effective method for removing mn ii from groundwater especially for groundwater containing both mn ii and fe ii 4 conclusions this study offers an innovative approach for mn ii removal from water via the oxidants generated in the process of mn ii catalyzed sulfite oxidation under aerobic conditions the major conclusions include 1 the enhancing effect of sulfite on mn ii oxidation by o2 is associated with the generation of so3 which can rapidly combine with o2 to form so5 and further transforms into hso5 hso5 is the major oxidant contributing to the oxidation of mn ii to mno2 which initiates after the depletion of sulfite 2 epr and radical scavenging studies demonstrate that the so4 radical is the crucial active oxidant responsible for mn ii oxidation by hso5 3 nacl and cacl2 thwart mn ii removal in the presence of sulfite which is primarily due to the inhibiting effect of high ionic strength on hso5 generation fe iii has a slight influence while fe ii considerably enhances mn ii removal since fe ii is much more efficient than fe iii for activating hso5 to generate so4 and thus the oxidation of mn ii and the adsorption of mn ii to the generated mno2 are promoted 4 the experiments with real water samples also demonstrate the effectiveness of the sulfite promoted mn ii removal process especially in the presence of fe ii in sum the use of sulfite to enhance mn ii removal from water may represent a promising alternative to conventional methods since it is cost effective environmentally friendly easily applied and the final stable product of sulfite is sulfate a common anion in groundwater moreover the concentration of generated sulfate in mn ii sulfite process is much below the maximum contaminant level of the china s drinking water standard for sulfate 250 mg l further studies with natural groundwater samples with elevated mn ii concentration under weak alkaline conditions are needed to verify the effectiveness of sulfite enhanced mn ii removal approach acknowledgment this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 21522704 the authors thank the beamline bl14w1 shanghai

18871,the main goal of the current study was to investigate the membrane fouling mechanism of aerobic granular sludge ags with various ags sizes in this regard agss were sieved into 6 levels 0 0 5 0 5 0 7 0 7 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 7 mm and larger than 1 7 mm then filtrated by a small dead end filtration cell interestingly there appeared a critical ags size 1 1 2 mm for membrane fouling above 1 2 mm flux increased and fouling reduced with size due to the loose cake layer and high permeability caused by larger ags below 1 mm for smaller ags higher flux and lower fouling appeared because less extracellular polymeric substance eps formed and adhered onto ags foulants in the critical size membrane fouling was serious to the most extent on account of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of eps moreover this critical ags size also possessed the highest cake layer pore blocking and irreversible fouling which generally existed in various operational conditions besides the results of sem afm hydrophilicity and atr ftir also proved that the existence of the maximum membrane fouling at the critical ags size this study provides a deep understanding of the membrane fouling mechanisms of ags in membrane filtration and is beneficial for developing a new membrane fouling mitigation strategy by terms of regulating ags size graphical abstract image keywords aerobic granular sludge ags membrane fouling control membrane bioreactor mbr critical ags size shear stress 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags produced during the biological wastewater treatment process with suitable culture condition is a microbial aggregate of numerous self immobilized functional microorganisms and has a diversified microbial communities and tightly compact structure juang et al 2010 liu et al 2009 pronk et al 2015 compared with the conventional activated sludges ags exhibited several advantages zhao et al 2016 including abundant microbial biodiversity great biomass concentration up to 20 g tss l 1 large relative density the possibility to simultaneously degrade organic carbon and nutrients low sludge yield remarkable settling capability and robust ability to withstand the high organic loading rate lin et al 2010 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 these advantages made ags bioreactor a promising wastewater treatment technology lotito et al 2014 the membrane bioreactor mbr is becoming widely adopted for the treatment and reclamation of both municipal and industrial wastewaters this was due to its compact nature iorhemen et al 2017 mutamim et al 2013 generation of high quality particulate free effluent ferrero et al 2012 west et al 2016 capability of withstanding high organic loading scholes et al 2016 west et al 2016 production of largely disinfected effluent meng and liu 2016 scholes et al 2016 and reduction in sludge generation fenu et al 2010 xue et al 2016 however membrane fouling remained the major drawback impeding the wider application of the mbr meng et al 2009 2017 the combination of mbr with ags would compose an ags mbr which could utilize their advantages to improve the treatment efficiency and overcome their respective shortcomings li et al 2012 found that the treatment performance of ags mbr with lower cod and nh3 n concentration in the effluent was more stable and better than that of the conventional mbr because of its internal anaerobic anoxic and aerobic structure and the richer biological community besides ags mbr also exhibited 50 higher membrane permeability and 10 better membrane cleaning efficiency than the conventional mbr as ags caused less membrane fouling than suspended sludge tay et al 2007 reported that treatment efficiencies of ags mbr and submerged mbr were similar exceeding 99 cod removal but the permeability loss and tmp increment for ags mbr were very low and negligible another bench scale study discovered that membrane flux of ags mbr was 2 6 times than that of the conventional mbr another bench scale study discovered that final membrane flux 3 1 l h 1 m 2 of ags mbr was about 2 times than that 1 5 l h 1 m 2 of the conventional mbr li et al 2005 furthermore for the long term operation 100 day ags mbr exhibited a low membrane fouling rate below 0 1 kpa day yu et al 2009 and low tmp xiang et al 2010 even without any need for physical cleaning any more thanh et al 2008 xiang et al 2010 wang et al 2013 found that mbr with ags performed a long and stable operation of 61 days at high flux 20 l m2 h which was much better than flocculent and bulking sludge xuan et al 2010 reported that granular sludge could maintain the relatively independent shape and excellent porosity to enhance sludge filtering performance due to its compact structure decreased c n ratio worsened the granular quality and exacerbated cake layer formation and pore blocking thereby aggravating membrane fouling chen et al 2017 most investigations were dealing with research of ags mbr filtration performance whereas research regarding its deep seated membrane fouling mechanism was still not yet launched agss have a wide size distribution in membrane filtration process the particle size significantly affected membrane fouling studying the effect of ags size on membrane fouling was of significance for the regulation of ags particle size and fouling control ags exhibits a favorable filtration characteristic and its size directly affects the structure and porosity of fouling layer nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the effect of ags size on membrane fouling has not yet been conducted therefore it is of great importance to quantitatively analyze the membrane fouling mechanism of ags with various sizes to gain an insight into membrane fouling of ags there are still some problems that need to be addressed 1 how the ags size affects the membrane fouling if there is a critical ags size for the maximum or the minimum membrane fouling 2 do eps and smp soluble microbial product affect ags membrane fouling what is the main membrane fouling mechanism 3 what is the interaction between ags foulants and shear rate on membrane can shear rate effectively reduce membrane fouling by considering these problems the current study encompasses a detailed investigation into the fouling mechanisms of ags with various size the main research contents consist of 1 to clarify the fouling behavior at various ags sizes 2 to explore whether there is a critical ags size for distinguishing the membrane fouling degree 3 to describe the impact of eps and smp on membrane fouling 4 to characterize the micromorphology of fouled membranes with various ags sizes the pivotal of this study is to analyze the membrane fouling mechanism of ags membrane filtration especially for the effect of ags size as well is expected to facilitate the potential application in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and membranes as showed in fig 1 the membrane module and bioreactor were independent the main characteristic of ags was shown in table 1 in order to change the operation conditions tmp shear stress and membrane type repeatedly and rapidly a small dead end filtration device was employed as the membrane module in this module the membrane was located at the bottom of the cell the built in agitator could cause different shear stress on membrane with various rotating speeds a constant pressure was provided by filling the cell with nitrogen gas and the maximal pressure could reach 0 6 mpa whereas permeate was collected in a tube placed on an electronic scale in order to calculate the permeate flux besides mv020 fabricated by microdyn nadir gmbh was tested in the present study according to the manufacturer s information their properties are summarized in table 2 2 2 analytical items the classification of ags with different sizes was determined using the sieving method xuan et al 2010 the 300 ml of sludge from the reactor was sampled with a calibrated cylinder and screened by a series of standard sieves the agss were then divided into six ranges according to particle diameter d as less than 0 5 d 0 5 mm 0 5 0 7 mm d0 5 0 7 0 7 1 mm d0 7 1 1 1 2 mm d1 1 2 1 2 1 7 mm d1 2 1 7 mm and larger than 1 7 mm d 1 7 the sludge which was smaller than 0 5 mm was defined as floc sludge whereas the other sludge ranges d 0 5 mm were regarded as granules then they were utilized for independent filtration experiments extraction and analysis of eps and smp the ags concentration was adjusted to about 5 0 g l after it was taken from the reactor 50 ml ags was centrifuged 4000 rpm 5 min and the supernatant was discarded the precipitate was washed twice with ultra pure water the ags was grounded to a powder with particles less than 0 5 mm the ags was brought up to volume with ultra pure water and was placed in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm filter millipore usa then the proteins and polysaccharides of eps and smp in the supernatant were determined by modified lowry method respectively chen et al 2017 2 3 experimental procedure after classification ags suspension solutions with various particle size was used for filtration experiments all experiments were conducted at a controlled room temperature of 20 c a new membrane was employed for each test unless the permeability of the used membrane could be fully recovered to ensure the same initial membrane conditions for the entire study the membranes were soaked in deionized water for at least 24 h before use and pre pressured with deionized water for 0 5 h under a pressure of 0 2 mpa for uf and 0 05 mpa for mf after stabilization the pure water flux of membranes was measured at 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 mpa for uf and 0 2 0 15 0 1 and 0 05 mpa for mf to calculate the water permeability lp prior to the commencement of the experiments the feed was heated to 35 c and was fully recycled in the system at zero tmp and this process lasted about 10 min for each test in order to estimate the membrane performance rapidly at various membrane types agitation speeds and tmps these tests were performed with permeate and retentate recycling to limit the variation of feed volume to less than 10 a pre filtration was carried out for 10 min at the lowest tested tmp and a rotating speed of 300 rpm to ensure membranes stabilization for each group of experiments with the same membrane tmp was increased in steps from 0 to 0 6 mpa but agitation speed was decreased in steps from 1000 rpm to 300 rpm except if stated otherwise this procedure minimized the possible effect of concentration polarization and fouling formed at the previous test point on the next one and the experimental protocol will be defined in more details later in each section the filtration was periodically stopped by suddenly releasing the pressure 0 1 mpa in order to mimic back flushing and minimize the fouling accumulation from the last tmp step samples were collected in permeate 5 min after the beginning of each tmp increment or each agitation speed decrement so as to obtain stabilized flux and transmission conditions after each series of tests the filtration system was flushed by deionized water for 10 min at 300 rpm then alkaline cleaning was carried out by using a p3 ultrasil 10 ecolab cleaning usa detergent to remove foulants at 0 25 concentration and 300 rpm and lp was measured to determine the permeability recovery 2 4 membrane characterization for the membranes before and after experiment their micromorphology was inspected via scanning electron microscopy sn 3400 hitachi ltd japan and afm xe 100 park system korea the atr ftir 660 ir varian australia was adopted to analyze the foulant composition water contact angle values of virgin and fouled membranes were measured using water contact angle measurement phoenix 300 seo to estimate the hydrophilicity 2 5 calculated parameters according to darcy s law the permeate flux can be described by a resistance in series model 1 j tmp μ r m r fouling where tmp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the solvent viscosity pa s rm is the membrane resistance m 1 and rfouling is the total resistance resulting from various fouling types m 1 in this section the intrinsic membrane reversible fouling layer and irreversible fouling layer resistances were calculated as follows 1 the intrinsic membrane resistance was calculated from the water permeability of the new membrane before experiment 2 the sum of intrinsic membrane reversible fouling layer and irreversible fouling layer resistances were attained from the water permeability of the fouled membrane after experiment 3 the sum of intrinsic membrane and irreversible fouling layer resistances were obtained from the water permeability of the fouled membrane after membrane cleaning thus the reversible fouling and irreversible fouling resistances were calculated according to eq 1 permeability recovery was defined by a comparison of the average water permeability for cleaned and new membranes 2 permeability recovery l pc l pi 100 where lpc and lpi are water permeability l m 2 h 1 of the cleaned fouled and new membranes respectively critical radius rc m xiao et al 2010 2013 was determined by the following equation 3 r c 0 521 n 100 42 5 n where n is agitation speed rpm average shear stress τav pa xiao et al 2010 2013 was defined according to the following equation 4 τ av 0 0742 n 1 5 r c 1 6 138 r c 3 2 6 data analysis all tests were repeated at least three times the errors were controlled below 5 mean values were calculated and presented on the figures and tables 3 results and discussion 3 1 the critical ags size for membrane fouling 3 1 1 the determination of critical ags size the permeate fluxes and total fouling resistances were showed in fig 2 the agss with different particle sizes revealed various fluxes and fouling behaviors generally speaking the higher size difference between foulants and membrane pores the lower membrane fouling occurred interestingly there was a critical ags size for distinguishing membrane fouling as shown in fig 2 above 1 2 mm increasing ags size flux strengthened and fouling resistance reduced below 1 mm lower ags size exhibited a higher flux and smaller fouling resistance within 1 1 2 mm filtration performance demonstrated the minimum flux and the maximum fouling resistance thus 1 1 2 mm becomes the critical ags size for membrane fouling and can be used to distinguish membrane fouling larger ags size had positive impact on membrane fouling control which could be explained as follows primarily the deposition of agss on membrane was governed by shear induced transport fshear hydrodynamic drag fdrag and foulant membrane interaction fbarrier the three main forces exerted on agss determine the distance between agss and membrane surface and the deposition situation on membrane luo et al 2012 for shear induced transport larger ags size owns higher fshear which effectively overcame the forces of hydrodynamic drag and foulant membrane interaction as well as alleviated foulants deposition on membrane thereby the ags with larger size exhibited greater anti fouling capacity indeed the smaller size difference between foulants and membrane pore the greater pore blocking produced zhang et al 2016 therefore with the increase of ags size the size difference between membrane pore and the ags promoted bringing about lower pore blocking fouling moreover smaller foulants could construct more compact fouling layers on membrane thus the fouling layer of larger ags with looser structure and higher porosity demonstrated lower filtration resistance besides the large ags was gathered by small flocculent sludges zhu et al 2017 while the reactor with larger ags had lower flocculent sludge concentration and smaller viscosity which was conducive to filtration performance in addition the ags with d 0 5 showed much more serious membrane fouling because d 0 5 contained the massive small agss and flocculent sludge and they combined eps and smp to constitute high density cake layer and serious pore blocking thereby these perspectives could account for lower fouling caused by elevating ags size d 1 2 however for ags size at 0 5 1 mm with the increase of ags size flux reduced and fouling enhanced which could be explained by the next section 3 1 2 the effect of eps and smp eps is the important foulant and its main constituents include proteins pn and polysaccharides ps as shown in fig 3 the pn concentration increased clearly with the ags size since larger ags could release more eps besides epss with high concentration were easy to combine ags to reduce the porosity and then ags enlarges at last ma et al 2017 moreover the small ags formed at high shear effect which also reduced the pn concentration around small ags for ps its concentration 51 54 mg g was much lower than that of pn 82 118 mg g thus the eps released by ags was mainly made up of pn in membrane fouling layer eps may block the porosity and adhere to fouling cake layer and membrane and reduce permeability in contrast to ps pn which displayed larger size and higher concentration combined with ags to form a tighter membrane fouling layer thus in ags membrane filtration pns were the most main eps foulants and blocked the fouling layer furthermore within 0 5 mm 1 2 mm the agss with larger size exhibited a higher hydrophobicity and smaller stability lu et al 2018 in addition ags with higher stability could maintain the more stable shape and excellent porosity xuan et al 2010 this stable structure reduced the release amount of eps thereby slowing down the formation of the dense cake and gel layer and decreasing the filtration resistance from the view of membrane fouling large agss with high eps concentration solution and great hydrophobicity could create more eps and cause a tighter membrane fouling layer thus for the ags size in this range of 0 5 1 mm membrane fouling reduced with ags size but for ags exceeding 1 2 mm the higher better porous structure of cake layer produced by larger ags could exhibit a greater anti blocking ability of eps as displayed in fig 3 smp raised slowly from 75 to 79 mg l with the size of ags particles the smp production came from the metabolic process of microorganism in ags microbial decay as well as eps hydrolysis the smp grew with ags size because larger ags had more microorganisms and faster metabolic rate and greater microbial decay rate as a main foulant smps were dominated by dissolved substances unlike other solid foulants smp did not exert a direct effect on the changes of permeability reduction and membrane fouling at various ags sizes even after they were absorbed into ags the excellent porous structure of cake layer for ags also contributed to smp anti blocking 3 1 3 the fouling behavior as discussed above 1 1 2 mm was the critical ags size for membrane fouling higher or lower than 1 1 2 mm membrane fouling lessened but in 0 5 1 mm and 1 2 1 7 mm the effects of ags size on membrane fouling were different at 1 2 1 7 mm ags exhibited a great shear effect low pore blocking and high porosity of cake layer while these synergistic effects outstripped the fouled effect of high eps content during 0 5 1 mm the addition of eps intensified pore blocking and weakened porosity of cake layer thus less eps at lower ags size was propitious to fouling control in the critical size 1 1 2 mm membrane fouling was the most serious because of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of eps therefore the critical ags size was affected by multiple membrane fouling mechanisms and its determination and regulation conduced to membrane fouling control 3 2 fouling mechanisms and membrane cleaning for ags with various sizes 3 2 1 comparison of fouling mechanisms between activated sludge and ags table 3 describes the membrane fouling resistances for activated sludge and various agss pore blocking and cake layer are two membrane fouling types the activated sludge and agss exhibited different fouling mechanism in the activated sludge the cake layer resistance mainly caused by flocculation sludge accounted for 71 23 thus most foulants accumulated and formed a fouling layer on membrane for agss the pore blocking occupied a more significant position even exceeding 50 for some ags sizes because in ags membrane filtration ags replaced the flocculation sludge and became the main foulants then owing to large size ags was difficult to deposit and adhere onto membrane surface furthermore the cake layer resistance of activated sludge was clearly higher than that of ags implied that the cake layer of activated sludge possessed a more compacted structure than ags in fact the porous structure of ags cake layer could absorb partial epss and smps but for the compacted structure of activated sludge cake layer the epss and smps could not be absorbed these two elements then entered the membrane inside or accumulated afterwards blocking membrane pores in addition lower ags size demonstrated a greater pore blocking and smaller cake layer except for 1 1 2 mm and 0 0 5 mm the 1 1 2 mm ags possessed the larger cake layer and pore blocking than other ags sizes which was due to the synergistic effect of compact cake layer and adhesion of eps as for 0 0 5 mm it had a high flocculation sludge concentration and small ags leading to a compact cake layer and more foulants inside membrane pores therefore the pore blocking accounts for the main fouling resistance in ags membrane filtration 3 2 2 membrane cleaning efficiency for ags with various sizes the membrane cleaning efficiency for ags with various sizes was shown in fig 4 permeability was recovered to varying degrees by water rinse and chemical cleaning the optimized permeability recovery after membrane cleaning had the following sequence d 1 7 d1 2 1 7 d0 5 0 7 d0 7 1 d1 1 2 membrane fouled by ags in the critical size 1 1 2 mm exhibited the lowest permeability recovery and the greatest irreversible fouling which coincided with the above analysis for ags with d 1 7 and d0 5 0 7 their permeability recovery were obviously higher than other ags because large ags foulants d 1 7 or low eps foulants 0 5 0 7 mm were easier to be removed by membrane cleaning additionally the low irreversible fouling indicated eps prefers to adhere to the cake layer rather than the membrane in general all permeability recoveries exceeded 85 indicating ags could clearly reduce irreversible membrane fouling 3 3 the effect of operational conditions shear stress and tmp on flux and fouling for ags with various sizes as shown in fig 5 tmp intensified the driving force and raised flux while produced low fouling resistance despite that high tmp and high flux pushed more agss towards membrane surface they both compacted the cake layer at the same time however the clear discrepancy of flux and fouling resistance for various ags sizes especially for the critical ags size still existed it was well known that anti fouling capacity reinforced with higher shear stress on membrane zhang and ding 2015 as presented by fig 6 the high shear stress curtailed concentration polarization and membrane fouling thus promoting permeate flux and decreasing fouling resistance obviously especially for the high tmp the increasing shear effect could reduce the effect of ags size on membrane flux in fig 6 the diversity of fouling resistance was evident at less than 1 5 pa when shear stress exceeded 1 5 pa the diversity of fouling resistance at various ags sizes was not prominent because high shear stress significantly strengthened the shear induced transport while the hydrodynamic drag and foulant membrane interaction were almost constant the deposition rates for all ags sizes on membrane reduced and became very close on the other hand high shear stress also facilitated the recombination of some macro pollutant particles zhang and ding 2015 thus with high shear stress the small ags turned into large ags which accelerated shear enhanced back transport although shear stress reduced the fouling differences for various ags sizes the same with tmp there was an ags size with the lowest fouling for various shear stresses thus the critical ags size could exist at various operational conditions although the effect of ags size on membrane fouling was studied the filtration performance of mixed ags solution was another research hotspot for improving the application value of ags mbr the flux fouling resistance threshold flux and pollutant removal of mixed ags solution were displayed 3 4 characterization of membrane surface morphology and properties altered by ags with various sizes 3 4 1 the contact angle and hydrophilicity table 4 shows the contact angles for new membranes and fouled membranes because of the existence of ags fouling layer on membrane fouled membranes had higher contact angle and lower hydrophilicity furthermore the contact angle diminished with the increase of ags size above the critical size 1 2 1 7 mm implying that after membrane cleaning the membrane fouled by larger ags had fewer foulant residues and lower irreversible fouling as well as kept more hydrophilicity below 1 mm ags with 0 5 0 7 mm had the greatest hydrophilicity as its irreversible foulants were the least thus the critical size could be deployed to distinguish the irreversible fouling and hydrophilicity in ags membrane filtration 3 4 2 membrane surface morphology as seen in fig 7 compared with the pristine membrane after filtrated by ags solution the membrane was fouled in varying degrees on membrane surface white spots or cake layer occurred and accumulated especially for d as for the critical ags size 1 1 2 mm while lines and wrinkles of membrane could not be observed because of the formation of compacted cake layer comprised by ags and eps adhesion for e f and g the clear lines and wrinkles of membrane stilled existed as just some large ags foulants remained on membrane and did not cover all morphology of pristine membrane with respect to c and d although the small agss formed tight fouling layer on membrane less eps were produced and adhered on membrane so a small amount of lines and wrinkles of membrane were not covered thereby with the observation of sem the large ags d 1 7 and small ags d0 5 0 7 foulants brought about lower foulants residual as well as a tight cake layer formed in the critical ags size 1 1 2 mm 3 4 3 analysis of membrane foulants fig 8 illustrated the ftir spectrograms of new and fouled membrane five characteristic peaks 1124 cm 1 c o group in polysaccharides 1405 cm 1 c o group in hydroxyl acid lipids 1654 cm 1 amino group in protein substances 2910 cm 1 c h group in fatty substances 3320 cm 1 hydroxyl group of all membranes were obviously observed this implied that polysaccharides proteins and other carbohydrates existed in the foulants and they came from ags eps and smp the characteristic peaks displayed the following order d 1 7 d1 2 1 7 d0 5 0 7 d0 7 1 d1 1 2 which corresponded to the foulant contents the ags with a critical size 1 1 2 mm exhibited the greatest contents of polysaccharides protein substances and fatty substances increasing or decreasing size could lessen the characteristic peaks and foulant contents for the d 0 5 ags and mixed ags the peaks were in the lead because of high foulant concentration existing in them 3 4 4 afm images and membrane roughness afm images were employed to analyze the membrane surface roughness fig 9 depicts the afm images of pristine membrane and fouled membrane the bright areas represented the peaks of foulants on the membrane surface whereas the dark ones represented the valleys of fouling layer or membrane pores the morphology of the membrane surface has become rougher with increasing ags size at small ags size below 1 mm the foulants formed a smooth cake layer on membrane fig 9 b d with the growth of ags size exceeding 1 2 mm the rough fouling layer was shaped by large ags fig 9 e g while this rough cake fouling layer was easier to create a porous structure and resist the eps fouling the eps adhesion had a less effect on a better porous structure of ags layer therefore the ags size could affect the membrane surface roughness and permeable structure of fouling layer 3 5 mini discussion membrane fouling is an important limiting factor for mbr although many strategies have been utilized to control membrane fouling they cannot still achieve effective application in mbr engineering due to some insuperable weaknesses membrane foulants in mbr come from the substances of biological water treatment process controlling the formation of these substances and modifying their characteristic then making them friendly to membrane filtration this is a thorough going reform method as the upgraded version of activated sludge ags was proved to have advantages in the settling property microbial diversity and capacity of bearing shock load some studies have reported that sludge after granulation could contribute to membrane fouling control due to its large size stable porous structure and hardness to form cake fouling layer pronk et al 2015 wang et al 2013 unlike the conventional active sludge ags shows a better regulating ability in this study as illustrated in fig 10 the agss with various sizes revealed different membrane fouling mechanisms as ags size increases ags cake fouling layer exhibits an obvious structure change which was able to resist the blockage of eps there is a critical size with the highest membrane fouling below it the cake fouling layer is tight and high compressibility emerged while some pore blocking occurs above it this cake fouling layer becomes loose and high permeability and more epss emerge in this critical size membrane fouling is the most serious because of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of eps the anti fouling ability of ags can be effectively maximized by avoiding or keeping away from the critical size fig 1 displays that this ags membrane filtration is of simple structure easy to install manage and safeguard thereby the membrane fouling control strategy of critical ags size is able to implement into the existing mbr facilities after a simple modification with high feasibility and strong operability nevertheless rapid cultivation and stabilization of agss are two key problems to achieve this goal this is also the focus of future research 4 conclusion during the current study the membrane fouling mechanism of ags with various sizes has been explored the paper is noteworthy that there appeared a critical ags size 1 1 2 mm for membrane fouling exceeding 1 2 mm flux rose and fouling decreased with size since the loose cake layer formed by larger ags demonstrated a high permeability less than 1 mm better flux and smaller fouling emerged at lower size due to less eps production as for the critical size the highest fouling was caused by the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of eps furthermore they still exhibited the higher cake layer pore blocking and irreversible fouling than other ags sizes while existed at various operational conditions afterwards the analyses of sem afm hydrophilicity and atr ftir also proved that the existence of the maximum membrane fouling in the critical ags size based on the results it can be concluded that regulating ags size could be an effective method for reducing membrane fouling and improving flux acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the guangdong natural science foundation of china no 2017a030310540 and guangdong provincial science and

18871,the main goal of the current study was to investigate the membrane fouling mechanism of aerobic granular sludge ags with various ags sizes in this regard agss were sieved into 6 levels 0 0 5 0 5 0 7 0 7 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 7 mm and larger than 1 7 mm then filtrated by a small dead end filtration cell interestingly there appeared a critical ags size 1 1 2 mm for membrane fouling above 1 2 mm flux increased and fouling reduced with size due to the loose cake layer and high permeability caused by larger ags below 1 mm for smaller ags higher flux and lower fouling appeared because less extracellular polymeric substance eps formed and adhered onto ags foulants in the critical size membrane fouling was serious to the most extent on account of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of eps moreover this critical ags size also possessed the highest cake layer pore blocking and irreversible fouling which generally existed in various operational conditions besides the results of sem afm hydrophilicity and atr ftir also proved that the existence of the maximum membrane fouling at the critical ags size this study provides a deep understanding of the membrane fouling mechanisms of ags in membrane filtration and is beneficial for developing a new membrane fouling mitigation strategy by terms of regulating ags size graphical abstract image keywords aerobic granular sludge ags membrane fouling control membrane bioreactor mbr critical ags size shear stress 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags produced during the biological wastewater treatment process with suitable culture condition is a microbial aggregate of numerous self immobilized functional microorganisms and has a diversified microbial communities and tightly compact structure juang et al 2010 liu et al 2009 pronk et al 2015 compared with the conventional activated sludges ags exhibited several advantages zhao et al 2016 including abundant microbial biodiversity great biomass concentration up to 20 g tss l 1 large relative density the possibility to simultaneously degrade organic carbon and nutrients low sludge yield remarkable settling capability and robust ability to withstand the high organic loading rate lin et al 2010 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 these advantages made ags bioreactor a promising wastewater treatment technology lotito et al 2014 the membrane bioreactor mbr is becoming widely adopted for the treatment and reclamation of both municipal and industrial wastewaters this was due to its compact nature iorhemen et al 2017 mutamim et al 2013 generation of high quality particulate free effluent ferrero et al 2012 west et al 2016 capability of withstanding high organic loading scholes et al 2016 west et al 2016 production of largely disinfected effluent meng and liu 2016 scholes et al 2016 and reduction in sludge generation fenu et al 2010 xue et al 2016 however membrane fouling remained the major drawback impeding the wider application of the mbr meng et al 2009 2017 the combination of mbr with ags would compose an ags mbr which could utilize their advantages to improve the treatment efficiency and overcome their respective shortcomings li et al 2012 found that the treatment performance of ags mbr with lower cod and nh3 n concentration in the effluent was more stable and better than that of the conventional mbr because of its internal anaerobic anoxic and aerobic structure and the richer biological community besides ags mbr also exhibited 50 higher membrane permeability and 10 better membrane cleaning efficiency than the conventional mbr as ags caused less membrane fouling than suspended sludge tay et al 2007 reported that treatment efficiencies of ags mbr and submerged mbr were similar exceeding 99 cod removal but the permeability loss and tmp increment for ags mbr were very low and negligible another bench scale study discovered that membrane flux of ags mbr was 2 6 times than that of the conventional mbr another bench scale study discovered that final membrane flux 3 1 l h 1 m 2 of ags mbr was about 2 times than that 1 5 l h 1 m 2 of the conventional mbr li et al 2005 furthermore for the long term operation 100 day ags mbr exhibited a low membrane fouling rate below 0 1 kpa day yu et al 2009 and low tmp xiang et al 2010 even without any need for physical cleaning any more thanh et al 2008 xiang et al 2010 wang et al 2013 found that mbr with ags performed a long and stable operation of 61 days at high flux 20 l m2 h which was much better than flocculent and bulking sludge xuan et al 2010 reported that granular sludge could maintain the relatively independent shape and excellent porosity to enhance sludge filtering performance due to its compact structure decreased c n ratio worsened the granular quality and exacerbated cake layer formation and pore blocking thereby aggravating membrane fouling chen et al 2017 most investigations were dealing with research of ags mbr filtration performance whereas research regarding its deep seated membrane fouling mechanism was still not yet launched agss have a wide size distribution in membrane filtration process the particle size significantly affected membrane fouling studying the effect of ags size on membrane fouling was of significance for the regulation of ags particle size and fouling control ags exhibits a favorable filtration characteristic and its size directly affects the structure and porosity of fouling layer nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the effect of ags size on membrane fouling has not yet been conducted therefore it is of great importance to quantitatively analyze the membrane fouling mechanism of ags with various sizes to gain an insight into membrane fouling of ags there are still some problems that need to be addressed 1 how the ags size affects the membrane fouling if there is a critical ags size for the maximum or the minimum membrane fouling 2 do eps and smp soluble microbial product affect ags membrane fouling what is the main membrane fouling mechanism 3 what is the interaction between ags foulants and shear rate on membrane can shear rate effectively reduce membrane fouling by considering these problems the current study encompasses a detailed investigation into the fouling mechanisms of ags with various size the main research contents consist of 1 to clarify the fouling behavior at various ags sizes 2 to explore whether there is a critical ags size for distinguishing the membrane fouling degree 3 to describe the impact of eps and smp on membrane fouling 4 to characterize the micromorphology of fouled membranes with various ags sizes the pivotal of this study is to analyze the membrane fouling mechanism of ags membrane filtration especially for the effect of ags size as well is expected to facilitate the potential application in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and membranes as showed in fig 1 the membrane module and bioreactor were independent the main characteristic of ags was shown in table 1 in order to change the operation conditions tmp shear stress and membrane type repeatedly and rapidly a small dead end filtration device was employed as the membrane module in this module the membrane was located at the bottom of the cell the built in agitator could cause different shear stress on membrane with various rotating speeds a constant pressure was provided by filling the cell with nitrogen gas and the maximal pressure could reach 0 6 mpa whereas permeate was collected in a tube placed on an electronic scale in order to calculate the permeate flux besides mv020 fabricated by microdyn nadir gmbh was tested in the present study according to the manufacturer s information their properties are summarized in table 2 2 2 analytical items the classification of ags with different sizes was determined using the sieving method xuan et al 2010 the 300 ml of sludge from the reactor was sampled with a calibrated cylinder and screened by a series of standard sieves the agss were then divided into six ranges according to particle diameter d as less than 0 5 d 0 5 mm 0 5 0 7 mm d0 5 0 7 0 7 1 mm d0 7 1 1 1 2 mm d1 1 2 1 2 1 7 mm d1 2 1 7 mm and larger than 1 7 mm d 1 7 the sludge which was smaller than 0 5 mm was defined as floc sludge whereas the other sludge ranges d 0 5 mm were regarded as granules then they were utilized for independent filtration experiments extraction and analysis of eps and smp the ags concentration was adjusted to about 5 0 g l after it was taken from the reactor 50 ml ags was centrifuged 4000 rpm 5 min and the supernatant was discarded the precipitate was washed twice with ultra pure water the ags was grounded to a powder with particles less than 0 5 mm the ags was brought up to volume with ultra pure water and was placed in a water bath at 80 c for 30 min then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm filter millipore usa then the proteins and polysaccharides of eps and smp in the supernatant were determined by modified lowry method respectively chen et al 2017 2 3 experimental procedure after classification ags suspension solutions with various particle size was used for filtration experiments all experiments were conducted at a controlled room temperature of 20 c a new membrane was employed for each test unless the permeability of the used membrane could be fully recovered to ensure the same initial membrane conditions for the entire study the membranes were soaked in deionized water for at least 24 h before use and pre pressured with deionized water for 0 5 h under a pressure of 0 2 mpa for uf and 0 05 mpa for mf after stabilization the pure water flux of membranes was measured at 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 mpa for uf and 0 2 0 15 0 1 and 0 05 mpa for mf to calculate the water permeability lp prior to the commencement of the experiments the feed was heated to 35 c and was fully recycled in the system at zero tmp and this process lasted about 10 min for each test in order to estimate the membrane performance rapidly at various membrane types agitation speeds and tmps these tests were performed with permeate and retentate recycling to limit the variation of feed volume to less than 10 a pre filtration was carried out for 10 min at the lowest tested tmp and a rotating speed of 300 rpm to ensure membranes stabilization for each group of experiments with the same membrane tmp was increased in steps from 0 to 0 6 mpa but agitation speed was decreased in steps from 1000 rpm to 300 rpm except if stated otherwise this procedure minimized the possible effect of concentration polarization and fouling formed at the previous test point on the next one and the experimental protocol will be defined in more details later in each section the filtration was periodically stopped by suddenly releasing the pressure 0 1 mpa in order to mimic back flushing and minimize the fouling accumulation from the last tmp step samples were collected in permeate 5 min after the beginning of each tmp increment or each agitation speed decrement so as to obtain stabilized flux and transmission conditions after each series of tests the filtration system was flushed by deionized water for 10 min at 300 rpm then alkaline cleaning was carried out by using a p3 ultrasil 10 ecolab cleaning usa detergent to remove foulants at 0 25 concentration and 300 rpm and lp was measured to determine the permeability recovery 2 4 membrane characterization for the membranes before and after experiment their micromorphology was inspected via scanning electron microscopy sn 3400 hitachi ltd japan and afm xe 100 park system korea the atr ftir 660 ir varian australia was adopted to analyze the foulant composition water contact angle values of virgin and fouled membranes were measured using water contact angle measurement phoenix 300 seo to estimate the hydrophilicity 2 5 calculated parameters according to darcy s law the permeate flux can be described by a resistance in series model 1 j tmp μ r m r fouling where tmp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the solvent viscosity pa s rm is the membrane resistance m 1 and rfouling is the total resistance resulting from various fouling types m 1 in this section the intrinsic membrane reversible fouling layer and irreversible fouling layer resistances were calculated as follows 1 the intrinsic membrane resistance was calculated from the water permeability of the new membrane before experiment 2 the sum of intrinsic membrane reversible fouling layer and irreversible fouling layer resistances were attained from the water permeability of the fouled membrane after experiment 3 the sum of intrinsic membrane and irreversible fouling layer resistances were obtained from the water permeability of the fouled membrane after membrane cleaning thus the reversible fouling and irreversible fouling resistances were calculated according to eq 1 permeability recovery was defined by a comparison of the average water permeability for cleaned and new membranes 2 permeability recovery l pc l pi 100 where lpc and lpi are water permeability l m 2 h 1 of the cleaned fouled and new membranes respectively critical radius rc m xiao et al 2010 2013 was determined by the following equation 3 r c 0 521 n 100 42 5 n where n is agitation speed rpm average shear stress τav pa xiao et al 2010 2013 was defined according to the following equation 4 τ av 0 0742 n 1 5 r c 1 6 138 r c 3 2 6 data analysis all tests were repeated at least three times the errors were controlled below 5 mean values were calculated and presented on the figures and tables 3 results and discussion 3 1 the critical ags size for membrane fouling 3 1 1 the determination of critical ags size the permeate fluxes and total fouling resistances were showed in fig 2 the agss with different particle sizes revealed various fluxes and fouling behaviors generally speaking the higher size difference between foulants and membrane pores the lower membrane fouling occurred interestingly there was a critical ags size for distinguishing membrane fouling as shown in fig 2 above 1 2 mm increasing ags size flux strengthened and fouling resistance reduced below 1 mm lower ags size exhibited a higher flux and smaller fouling resistance within 1 1 2 mm filtration performance demonstrated the minimum flux and the maximum fouling resistance thus 1 1 2 mm becomes the critical ags size for membrane fouling and can be used to distinguish membrane fouling larger ags size had positive impact on membrane fouling control which could be explained as follows primarily the deposition of agss on membrane was governed by shear induced transport fshear hydrodynamic drag fdrag and foulant membrane interaction fbarrier the three main forces exerted on agss determine the distance between agss and membrane surface and the deposition situation on membrane luo et al 2012 for shear induced transport larger ags size owns higher fshear which effectively overcame the forces of hydrodynamic drag and foulant membrane interaction as well as alleviated foulants deposition on membrane thereby the ags with larger size exhibited greater anti fouling capacity indeed the smaller size difference between foulants and membrane pore the greater pore blocking produced zhang et al 2016 therefore with the increase of ags size the size difference between membrane pore and the ags promoted bringing about lower pore blocking fouling moreover smaller foulants could construct more compact fouling layers on membrane thus the fouling layer of larger ags with looser structure and higher porosity demonstrated lower filtration resistance besides the large ags was gathered by small flocculent sludges zhu et al 2017 while the reactor with larger ags had lower flocculent sludge concentration and smaller viscosity which was conducive to filtration performance in addition the ags with d 0 5 showed much more serious membrane fouling because d 0 5 contained the massive small agss and flocculent sludge and they combined eps and smp to constitute high density cake layer and serious pore blocking thereby these perspectives could account for lower fouling caused by elevating ags size d 1 2 however for ags size at 0 5 1 mm with the increase of ags size flux reduced and fouling enhanced which could be explained by the next section 3 1 2 the effect of eps and smp eps is the important foulant and its main constituents include proteins pn and polysaccharides ps as shown in fig 3 the pn concentration increased clearly with the ags size since larger ags could release more eps besides epss with high concentration were easy to combine ags to reduce the porosity and then ags enlarges at last ma et al 2017 moreover the small ags formed at high shear effect which also reduced the pn concentration around small ags for ps its concentration 51 54 mg g was much lower than that of pn 82 118 mg g thus the eps released by ags was mainly made up of pn in membrane fouling layer eps may block the porosity and adhere to fouling cake layer and membrane and reduce permeability in contrast to ps pn which displayed larger size and higher concentration combined with ags to form a tighter membrane fouling layer thus in ags membrane filtration pns were the most main eps foulants and blocked the fouling layer furthermore within 0 5 mm 1 2 mm the agss with larger size exhibited a higher hydrophobicity and smaller stability lu et al 2018 in addition ags with higher stability could maintain the more stable shape and excellent porosity xuan et al 2010 this stable structure reduced the release amount of eps thereby slowing down the formation of the dense cake and gel layer and decreasing the filtration resistance from the view of membrane fouling large agss with high eps concentration solution and great hydrophobicity could create more eps and cause a tighter membrane fouling layer thus for the ags size in this range of 0 5 1 mm membrane fouling reduced with ags size but for ags exceeding 1 2 mm the higher better porous structure of cake layer produced by larger ags could exhibit a greater anti blocking ability of eps as displayed in fig 3 smp raised slowly from 75 to 79 mg l with the size of ags particles the smp production came from the metabolic process of microorganism in ags microbial decay as well as eps hydrolysis the smp grew with ags size because larger ags had more microorganisms and faster metabolic rate and greater microbial decay rate as a main foulant smps were dominated by dissolved substances unlike other solid foulants smp did not exert a direct effect on the changes of permeability reduction and membrane fouling at various ags sizes even after they were absorbed into ags the excellent porous structure of cake layer for ags also contributed to smp anti blocking 3 1 3 the fouling behavior as discussed above 1 1 2 mm was the critical ags size for membrane fouling higher or lower than 1 1 2 mm membrane fouling lessened but in 0 5 1 mm and 1 2 1 7 mm the effects of ags size on membrane fouling were different at 1 2 1 7 mm ags exhibited a great shear effect low pore blocking and high porosity of cake layer while these synergistic effects outstripped the fouled effect of high eps content during 0 5 1 mm the addition of eps intensified pore blocking and weakened porosity of cake layer thus less eps at lower ags size was propitious to fouling control in the critical size 1 1 2 mm membrane fouling was the most serious because of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of eps therefore the critical ags size was affected by multiple membrane fouling mechanisms and its determination and regulation conduced to membrane fouling control 3 2 fouling mechanisms and membrane cleaning for ags with various sizes 3 2 1 comparison of fouling mechanisms between activated sludge and ags table 3 describes the membrane fouling resistances for activated sludge and various agss pore blocking and cake layer are two membrane fouling types the activated sludge and agss exhibited different fouling mechanism in the activated sludge the cake layer resistance mainly caused by flocculation sludge accounted for 71 23 thus most foulants accumulated and formed a fouling layer on membrane for agss the pore blocking occupied a more significant position even exceeding 50 for some ags sizes because in ags membrane filtration ags replaced the flocculation sludge and became the main foulants then owing to large size ags was difficult to deposit and adhere onto membrane surface furthermore the cake layer resistance of activated sludge was clearly higher than that of ags implied that the cake layer of activated sludge possessed a more compacted structure than ags in fact the porous structure of ags cake layer could absorb partial epss and smps but for the compacted structure of activated sludge cake layer the epss and smps could not be absorbed these two elements then entered the membrane inside or accumulated afterwards blocking membrane pores in addition lower ags size demonstrated a greater pore blocking and smaller cake layer except for 1 1 2 mm and 0 0 5 mm the 1 1 2 mm ags possessed the larger cake layer and pore blocking than other ags sizes which was due to the synergistic effect of compact cake layer and adhesion of eps as for 0 0 5 mm it had a high flocculation sludge concentration and small ags leading to a compact cake layer and more foulants inside membrane pores therefore the pore blocking accounts for the main fouling resistance in ags membrane filtration 3 2 2 membrane cleaning efficiency for ags with various sizes the membrane cleaning efficiency for ags with various sizes was shown in fig 4 permeability was recovered to varying degrees by water rinse and chemical cleaning the optimized permeability recovery after membrane cleaning had the following sequence d 1 7 d1 2 1 7 d0 5 0 7 d0 7 1 d1 1 2 membrane fouled by ags in the critical size 1 1 2 mm exhibited the lowest permeability recovery and the greatest irreversible fouling which coincided with the above analysis for ags with d 1 7 and d0 5 0 7 their permeability recovery were obviously higher than other ags because large ags foulants d 1 7 or low eps foulants 0 5 0 7 mm were easier to be removed by membrane cleaning additionally the low irreversible fouling indicated eps prefers to adhere to the cake layer rather than the membrane in general all permeability recoveries exceeded 85 indicating ags could clearly reduce irreversible membrane fouling 3 3 the effect of operational conditions shear stress and tmp on flux and fouling for ags with various sizes as shown in fig 5 tmp intensified the driving force and raised flux while produced low fouling resistance despite that high tmp and high flux pushed more agss towards membrane surface they both compacted the cake layer at the same time however the clear discrepancy of flux and fouling resistance for various ags sizes especially for the critical ags size still existed it was well known that anti fouling capacity reinforced with higher shear stress on membrane zhang and ding 2015 as presented by fig 6 the high shear stress curtailed concentration polarization and membrane fouling thus promoting permeate flux and decreasing fouling resistance obviously especially for the high tmp the increasing shear effect could reduce the effect of ags size on membrane flux in fig 6 the diversity of fouling resistance was evident at less than 1 5 pa when shear stress exceeded 1 5 pa the diversity of fouling resistance at various ags sizes was not prominent because high shear stress significantly strengthened the shear induced transport while the hydrodynamic drag and foulant membrane interaction were almost constant the deposition rates for all ags sizes on membrane reduced and became very close on the other hand high shear stress also facilitated the recombination of some macro pollutant particles zhang and ding 2015 thus with high shear stress the small ags turned into large ags which accelerated shear enhanced back transport although shear stress reduced the fouling differences for various ags sizes the same with tmp there was an ags size with the lowest fouling for various shear stresses thus the critical ags size could exist at various operational conditions although the effect of ags size on membrane fouling was studied the filtration performance of mixed ags solution was another research hotspot for improving the application value of ags mbr the flux fouling resistance threshold flux and pollutant removal of mixed ags solution were displayed 3 4 characterization of membrane surface morphology and properties altered by ags with various sizes 3 4 1 the contact angle and hydrophilicity table 4 shows the contact angles for new membranes and fouled membranes because of the existence of ags fouling layer on membrane fouled membranes had higher contact angle and lower hydrophilicity furthermore the contact angle diminished with the increase of ags size above the critical size 1 2 1 7 mm implying that after membrane cleaning the membrane fouled by larger ags had fewer foulant residues and lower irreversible fouling as well as kept more hydrophilicity below 1 mm ags with 0 5 0 7 mm had the greatest hydrophilicity as its irreversible foulants were the least thus the critical size could be deployed to distinguish the irreversible fouling and hydrophilicity in ags membrane filtration 3 4 2 membrane surface morphology as seen in fig 7 compared with the pristine membrane after filtrated by ags solution the membrane was fouled in varying degrees on membrane surface white spots or cake layer occurred and accumulated especially for d as for the critical ags size 1 1 2 mm while lines and wrinkles of membrane could not be observed because of the formation of compacted cake layer comprised by ags and eps adhesion for e f and g the clear lines and wrinkles of membrane stilled existed as just some large ags foulants remained on membrane and did not cover all morphology of pristine membrane with respect to c and d although the small agss formed tight fouling layer on membrane less eps were produced and adhered on membrane so a small amount of lines and wrinkles of membrane were not covered thereby with the observation of sem the large ags d 1 7 and small ags d0 5 0 7 foulants brought about lower foulants residual as well as a tight cake layer formed in the critical ags size 1 1 2 mm 3 4 3 analysis of membrane foulants fig 8 illustrated the ftir spectrograms of new and fouled membrane five characteristic peaks 1124 cm 1 c o group in polysaccharides 1405 cm 1 c o group in hydroxyl acid lipids 1654 cm 1 amino group in protein substances 2910 cm 1 c h group in fatty substances 3320 cm 1 hydroxyl group of all membranes were obviously observed this implied that polysaccharides proteins and other carbohydrates existed in the foulants and they came from ags eps and smp the characteristic peaks displayed the following order d 1 7 d1 2 1 7 d0 5 0 7 d0 7 1 d1 1 2 which corresponded to the foulant contents the ags with a critical size 1 1 2 mm exhibited the greatest contents of polysaccharides protein substances and fatty substances increasing or decreasing size could lessen the characteristic peaks and foulant contents for the d 0 5 ags and mixed ags the peaks were in the lead because of high foulant concentration existing in them 3 4 4 afm images and membrane roughness afm images were employed to analyze the membrane surface roughness fig 9 depicts the afm images of pristine membrane and fouled membrane the bright areas represented the peaks of foulants on the membrane surface whereas the dark ones represented the valleys of fouling layer or membrane pores the morphology of the membrane surface has become rougher with increasing ags size at small ags size below 1 mm the foulants formed a smooth cake layer on membrane fig 9 b d with the growth of ags size exceeding 1 2 mm the rough fouling layer was shaped by large ags fig 9 e g while this rough cake fouling layer was easier to create a porous structure and resist the eps fouling the eps adhesion had a less effect on a better porous structure of ags layer therefore the ags size could affect the membrane surface roughness and permeable structure of fouling layer 3 5 mini discussion membrane fouling is an important limiting factor for mbr although many strategies have been utilized to control membrane fouling they cannot still achieve effective application in mbr engineering due to some insuperable weaknesses membrane foulants in mbr come from the substances of biological water treatment process controlling the formation of these substances and modifying their characteristic then making them friendly to membrane filtration this is a thorough going reform method as the upgraded version of activated sludge ags was proved to have advantages in the settling property microbial diversity and capacity of bearing shock load some studies have reported that sludge after granulation could contribute to membrane fouling control due to its large size stable porous structure and hardness to form cake fouling layer pronk et al 2015 wang et al 2013 unlike the conventional active sludge ags shows a better regulating ability in this study as illustrated in fig 10 the agss with various sizes revealed different membrane fouling mechanisms as ags size increases ags cake fouling layer exhibits an obvious structure change which was able to resist the blockage of eps there is a critical size with the highest membrane fouling below it the cake fouling layer is tight and high compressibility emerged while some pore blocking occurs above it this cake fouling layer becomes loose and high permeability and more epss emerge in this critical size membrane fouling is the most serious because of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of eps the anti fouling ability of ags can be effectively maximized by avoiding or keeping away from the critical size fig 1 displays that this ags membrane filtration is of simple structure easy to install manage and safeguard thereby the membrane fouling control strategy of critical ags size is able to implement into the existing mbr facilities after a simple modification with high feasibility and strong operability nevertheless rapid cultivation and stabilization of agss are two key problems to achieve this goal this is also the focus of future research 4 conclusion during the current study the membrane fouling mechanism of ags with various sizes has been explored the paper is noteworthy that there appeared a critical ags size 1 1 2 mm for membrane fouling exceeding 1 2 mm flux rose and fouling decreased with size since the loose cake layer formed by larger ags demonstrated a high permeability less than 1 mm better flux and smaller fouling emerged at lower size due to less eps production as for the critical size the highest fouling was caused by the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of eps furthermore they still exhibited the higher cake layer pore blocking and irreversible fouling than other ags sizes while existed at various operational conditions afterwards the analyses of sem afm hydrophilicity and atr ftir also proved that the existence of the maximum membrane fouling in the critical ags size based on the results it can be concluded that regulating ags size could be an effective method for reducing membrane fouling and

geomedia sand loading clay composites exhibited significantly higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than biochar which is advantageous when clogging is a concern or when rapid infiltration is needed under typical urban stormwater conditions the clay composites will remove contaminants for at least 20 30 years before regeneration or replacement is needed graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban stormwater biochar sorption pesticide pfas 1 introduction stormwater runoff is being considered in water stressed cities as an alternative water resource grebel et al 2013 despite its potential for augmenting water supplies urban stormwater contains contaminants that pose risks to human health and aquatic ecosystems in particular urban runoff often contains elevated concentrations of trace

water resources and to minimize health hazards it may be necessary to treat stormwater during infiltration engineered geomedia can be employed in stormwater infiltration systems to remove chemical contaminants hatt et al 2009 geomedia performance depends upon their ability to remove a broad suite of contaminants their cost and susceptibility to passivation and clogging previous studies have shown that manganese oxide coated sand can oxidize certain electron rich organic compounds in urban runoff charbonnet et al 2018 grebel et al 2016 biochar a pyrolytic carbonaceous geomedia can also remove nutrients iqbal et al 2015 metals uchimiya et al 2011 e coli mohanty and boehm 2015 and trace organic compounds ulrich et al 2015 from stormwater these and other geomedia can be applied to improve water quality during groundwater recharge or stormwater capture for non potable applications such as landscape irrigation grant et al 2012 for example geomedia can be added as a soil amendment in decentralized stormwater infiltration systems in which treatment occurs by infiltration during intermittent storm events or it can be added to surficial sediments i e sand and gravel in managed aquifer recharge systems in addition to biochar and manganese oxide coated sands polymer modified clay composites may be useful as a geomedia for stormwater treatment montmorillonite clays are hydrophilic negatively charged minerals with high reactive surface area and cation exchange capacity lin and juang 2002 because of these properties polycations can exchange with inner layer cations resulting in charge reversal on the clay surface and increased hydrophobic domains which can enhance trace organic compound removal yang et al 2003 the resulting positive charge can also facilitate removal of negatively charged natural organic matter nom chang and juang 2004 and nom complexed metals anirudhan and suchithra 2010 poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac and protonated poly 4 vinylpyridine co styrene pvpcos polymers can be employed for charge reversal and hydrophobic modification of montmorillonite clays pdadmac is an inexpensive synthetic polymer used as a wastewater treatment coagulant yan et al 2008 the pdadmac quaternary amine moiety results in a permanent positive charge independent of solution ph roach et al 2011 providing pdadmac modified montmorillonite with the ability to remove anionic contaminants and nom bolto et al 2001 from water the pyrrolidine pdadmac monomer however lacks the π orbital network responsible for enhanced interactions with

facilitate solubilization sorption onto the montmorillonite surface and exchange with the inner na and ca2 ions the protonated 3 g l pvpcos was mixed overnight before combining the pvpcos and montmorillonite solutions at the same 2 1 polymer clay ratio the polymer clay solutions were mixed on a shaker for 4 h to allow for complete polycation intercalation and surface coating before centrifugation at 10 000 rpm or 18 600 g avanti j 30i beckman coulter inc for 10 min the supernatant containing unadsorbed polymer was drained and the remaining polymer coated clays were washed three times with milli q water following a second round of centrifugation the fluffy polymer clay suspensions were transferred to a beaker and oven dried at 50 c overnight this differs from our previous studies where composites were freeze dried radian and mishael 2012 zadaka et al 2009 freeze drying reduces clay composite aggregation and increases composite surface area maes et al 1997 compared to oven drying however oven drying is faster and less laborious which is important for large scale synthesis for stormwater infiltration applications furthermore freeze drying clays can result in structural deterioration upon wetting murray and quirk 1980 which could decrease contaminant removal over long periods and groundwater recharge due to swelling and clogging after oven drying the clay composites and biochar were ground using a mortar and pestle and sieved to achieve a 100 300 μm range to normalize particle size effects no polymer desorption from the oven dried clay composites was observed table s5 with experimental description oven dried clay composite physicochemical properties i e surface area and charge and polymer loading were characterized experimental details are included in the supplementary material analytical methods for trace organic compound trace metal and dissolved organic carbon doc analyses are also provided in the supplementary material 2 3 batch sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted to determine the equilibrium sorption of geomedia under simulated stormwater conditions all batch experiments were performed in triplicate at 25 c in polypropylene containers to reduce sorption of contaminants to container walls the reaction ph was buffered with 1 mm bicarbonate in the simulated stormwater matrix and changed by less than 0 1 ph unit during sorption experiments the trace organic compound stock solutions were prepared in water and a trace metal stock solution was prepared in 1 wt nitric acid ph 1 cr vi which is insoluble below ph 2 was prepared separately and added to the reaction mixture all batch experiments included all the contaminants simultaneously for all batch experiments a control experiment without geomedia was conducted simultaneously to determine contaminant sorption to container walls batch sorption experiments were performed at different initial contaminant concentrations i e 5 50 and 500 μg l of each contaminant experiments containing 5 mg c l nom were also conducted to study the effect of doc approximately 125 ml of reaction solution containing the contaminants and nom in simulated stormwater was pre mixed on a stir plate 800 rpm for 1 h prior to introducing the geomedia the pre mixing allowed nom to complex contaminants before interacting with geomedia which is representative of how contaminants encounter geomedia during stormwater infiltration the geomedia 0 5 g l was then added to the reaction to initiate sorption after 24 h aliquots were filtered using a 0 2 μm nylon membrane filter and prepared for analysis of contaminant and doc sorption to geomedia sorption rates were determined in batch kinetic experiments initial contaminant concentrations of 50 μg l and 0 5 g l geomedia were used for tests without nom 250 ml reaction solutions were prepared a 1 l reaction volume for nom containing solutions was used at the same solid liquid ratio to account for the larger sample volume necessary for toc analysis as before the contaminants and 5 mg c l nom were pre mixed prior to introducing geomedia aliquots were collected at pre selected time intervals over the course of the 24 h reaction period for trace contaminant analysis experiments were conducted to examine nom sorption by geomedia 1 l solutions of simulated stormwater were prepared with 5 mg c l nom and varying initial contaminant concentrations 0 control 5 50 and 500 μg l after the 1 h nom contaminant premixing period geomedia 0 5 g l was added to the solutions and mixed at 800 rpm samples from each reaction system were filtered using a 0 2 μm nylon membrane filter and analyzed for doc after 24 h of reaction anova two factor statistical analysis was performed to determine the significance of the effect of nom and geomedia on contaminant removal tables s9 s11 to qualitatively assess the affinities of each contaminant to nom we performed a dialysis size exclusion test devitt and wiesner 1998 15 ml aliquots of 5 mg c l nom was placed inside dialysis tubing mwco 500 1000 da spectra por 7 sulfur heavy metal free spectrum los angeles ca at this size cut off most of the nom remained isolated inside the dialysis tubing while compounds smaller than 500 da freely passed through the tubing the nom tubes were first dialyzed against milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm after dialysis against milli q water was complete i e the exchanged milli q conductivity remained constant the outsides of the dialysis tubes were rinsed with milli q water and transferred to a container of the simulated stormwater matrix for dialysis against the matrix cations and anions after equilibration the simulated stormwater solution was spiked with 50 μg l of each contaminant and stirred for 24 h after 24 h aliquots of the simulated stormwater solution were analyzed for trace contaminant concentration a control experiment was simultaneously conducted filling the dialysis tube with water instead of nom to quantify association of contaminants to the dialysis tubing 2 4 column studies to better assess the performance of the polymer clay composites we conducted column studies using pvc columns 12 cm in length 2 54 cm inner diameter ottawa sand 600 850 μm was acid washed with 5 wt nitric acid then washed with deionized water to remove impurities geomedia was added at 3 wt to the sand in plastic containers and gently mixed using a stir rod to ensure even distribution prior to column packing barrier sand 2400 3400 μm packed at the top and bottom of the column fittings secured the geomedia from leaching during filtration fig s2 the following treatments were replicated in three separate columns 1 control ottawa sand only 2 3 wt pdadmac clay composite 3 3 wt pvpcos clay composite 4 3 wt biochar geomedia the outer walls of the columns were mechanically vibrated to maximize packing density after packing ptfe tubing 1 8 inner diameter was used to transfer deionized water to wet the columns for 48 h prior to initiating the experiments columns were operated in up flow mode at a volumetric flow rate of 0 8 ml min 12 cm h infiltration rate to fully saturate the columns dry and wetted columns were weighted to determine porosity to initiate the column studies a 75 l feed solution was prepared containing 10 μg l of each contaminant in simulated stormwater a separate column study was performed adding 5 mg c l nom to the simulated stormwater matrix to determine the effect of doc on column filtration for the nom column study the feed solution was mixed using a stir plate placed underneath the tank for 1 h before initiating the column experiments throughout the experiment samples were collected from the column effluent and prepared for analysis of trace contaminants and doc when applicable collected samples were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator and analyzed within 24 h contaminant concentration in the feed tank was also measured to determine contaminant loss to tank walls the saturated hydraulic conductivity of each column was measured at the beginning and conclusion of the column studies using the constant head method to relate geomedia performance to stormwater permeability column porosities hydraulic residence times and additional experimental information is provided in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 polymer clay composite physicochemical properties and surface analysis the clay composite surface charge was determined by the nature of the surface functional groups and polymer montmorillonite interactions table 1 the montmorillonite exhibited a negative surface charge 40 3 1 5 mv due to silanol and aluminol groups and isomorphic substitution bourg et al 2007 after polymer sorption the measured surface charge of as prepared pdadmac clay composites i e 42 7 1 8 mv and pvpcos clay composites i e 18 7 3 1 mv was reversed indicating successful clay modification under simulated stormwater conditions i e ph 7 6 and 4 6 mm nacl the pvpcos clay composite surface charge decreased to 9 7 1 5 mv while the pdadmac clay composite surface charge remained positive 41 0 1 8 mv pvpcos clay composite surface charge decrease at circumneutral ph has been observed for similarly prepared composites kohay et al 2015 biochar exhibited an overall negative charge 34 1 0 7 mv due to deprotonated carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups fourier transform infrared ftir spectra fig 1 suggest that the pvpcos polymer configuration on montmorillonite consisted of loop and tail regions unassociated with the montmorillonite surface the 1635 cm 1 pdadmac quaternized nitrogen band yudovin farber et al 2010 appeared in the as prepared pvpcos clay composite spectra due to the protonated amine nitrogen in the simulated stormwater spectra the 1605 cm 1 band corresponding to uncharged pyridine nitrogen healy et al 1989 increased while the 1635 cm 1 band area decreased the presence of both bands in the pvpcos clay composite simulated stormwater spectra suggests that 1 a fraction of sorbed protonated pvpcos pyridines interacted primarily with the negatively charged montmorillonite surface and are not heavily influenced by bulk solution ph and 2 a fraction of sorbed uncharged pyridines did not directly interact with the montmorillonite surface at the system ph pdadmac should adsorb in more extended train configurations graphical abstract a1 due to stronger electrostatic interactions with montmorillonite churchman 2002 while uncharged pvpcos may exist in loops and tails breen 1999 due to regions of unassociated pyridine graphical abstract b1 expansion of sorbed pvp on clay surfaces following charge neutralization was observed in other studies marra and hair 1988 this expanded configuration of uncharged monomers may lead to more divalent cation sorption on pvpcos clay composites than pdadmac clay composites 3 2 batch urban stormwater contaminant sorption capacity and kinetics under simulated stormwater conditions batch sorption and kinetics experiments with trace organics figs s3 and s5 and metals figs s4 and s6 were conducted to evaluate geomedia performance for stormwater treatment 3 2 1 trace organic compound removal trace organic compound sorption fig 2 a and sorption kinetics solid curves fig s5 were affected by the compound s hydrophobicity and the extent of hydrophobic domains on the geomedia surface as the organic compound hydrophobicity i e octanol water partition coefficient kow table s2 increased the extent of equilibrium sorption and the sorption rate increased for both clay composites ranging from approximately 20 30 removal of 2 4 d tcep and atrazine least hydrophobic to 80 removal of fipronil as the compound hydrophobicity increases the statistical difference in removal between clay composites and biochar decreases table s9b for pfoa and pfos which undergo a somewhat different sorption mechanism than the other compounds li et al 2011 over 95 removal was observed 2 4 d sorption on clay composites was higher than tcep because 2 4 d contains a deprotonated carboxylic group available for additional interactions table s2 similar organic compound removal was observed for both clay composites with slightly higher removal by pvpcos clay composites biochar removed over 95 of all trace organics at all initial concentrations and at faster rates i e within 5 min compared to the clay composites the pdadmac and pvpcos polymer modification resulted in two orders of magnitude increase in pfoa removal in μmol g sorbent and one order of magnitude increase in pfos removal compared to unmodified montmorillonite fig s7 less hydrophobic organics displayed comparable removal on bare montmorillonite compound partitioning to hydrophobic domains on the clay composite surface and electrostatic interactions governed organic compound sorption studies of polar uncharged organic compound sorption onto polymer clays suggest that compounds partition from the aqueous phase to the organic rich polymer phase near the functionalized clay surface park et al 2011 the organic compound composite aromatic structural compatibility was expected to be greater for pvpcos clay composites yet organic compound sorption by pdadmac clay composites was comparable over the entire contaminant concentration range fig s3 this may have been due to attractive weak forces between the organic compound aromatic moieties and the pdadmac trains trace organic compound sorption onto biochar can occur via several mechanisms including surface interactions e g electrostatics hydrogen bonding π electron and physical interactions such as pore filling mechanisms teixidó et al 2011 the polyaromatic hydrophobic biochar surface is ideal for organic compound sorption and the large degree of biochar microporosity and surface area can facilitate removal pfoa and pfos removal was comparable i e statistically insignificant table s10b for all three geomedia at all initial concentrations fig s3 pfas are oleophobic surfactants with negatively charged polar head groups pfas sorption onto positively charged pdadmac clay composites was likely facilitated by electrostatic attraction of the acidic head groups pfas have also exhibited strong affinity for biochar and activated carbon despite their negative surface charged xiao et al 2017 hydrophobic interactions between the pfas backbone and the hydrophobic domains of pvpcos clay composites and biochar overcame electrostatic repulsion graphical abstract b1 pfoa sorption kinetics were comparable for biochar and pvpcos clay composites and faster than the pdadmac clay composite removal rate pfos sorption kinetics were comparable for biochar and pdadmac clay composites and slower for pvpcos clay composites 3 2 2 oxyanion and divalent cation removal the pdadmac clay composites were the most effective geomedia for oxyanion i e haso4 2 and cro4 2 table s4 sorption fig 2b and exhibited the fastest kinetics solid curves fig s6 generally haso4 2 was not removed by pvpcos clay composites nor biochar and only 20 removal was observed for pdadmac clay composites approximately 60 cro4 2 removal was achieved by pdadmac clay composites whereas no cro4 2 removal was observed for pvpcos clay composites and biochar due to repulsive forces divalent cation removal increased as a function of metal hydrolysis cupric carbonate cuco3 0 aq was predicted to be the dominant aqueous cu species abundance 86 while the remaining divalent cations existed mostly as the free aqueous metal i e m m2 species abundances of 75 80 table s4 over the range of initial contaminant concentrations equilibrium sorption and kinetics generally increased in the order of zn ni cd cu for all geomedia fig s4 this divalent cation series corresponds to increasing degree of hydrolysis benjamin 2014 with asynchronization for cu whose stability constant pka 7 5 is below the system ph pdadmac clay composites exhibited less sorption of m2 cations compared to pvpcos clay composites pvpcos clay composite m2 removal was comparable or superior to biochar with over 75 removal over all initial concentrations fig s4 furthermore the statistical difference in removal of m2 ions decreased between pvpcos and biochar as hydrolysis increased tables s9d s10d s11d greater than 95 cu removal was observed for all geomedia at all initial concentrations geomedia surface functional groups and ion exchange properties govern divalent cation sorption ftir data suggest that ion exchange and surface complexation sites associated with the montmorillonite surface are available to facilitate divalent metal cation sorption on the composites graphical abstract a1 and b1 particularly for pvpcos clay composites due to the polymer loop and tail configuration the pvp amine moiety can also complex divalent cations zhang et al 2014 cr vi song et al 2015 and as v yoshitake et al 2002 because the pdadmac does not contain r2 n groups divalent cation removal may occur via direct interaction with montmorillonite furthermore pdadmac clay composites may exhibit less divalent cation removal because of electrostatic repulsion biochar contains negatively charged functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl which can complex divalent cations additionally biochar like montmorillonite possesses exchangeable cations e g ca2 mg2 that can take up divalent metals kołodyńska et al 2012 in general trace metal sorption of unmodified clays was slightly higher or comparable to that observed for the clay composites fig s7 3 3 effect of dissolved organic matter on trace organic compound removal the presence of nom in the simulated stormwater matrix generally reduced trace organic compound sorption fig 2a and sorption rate dotted curves fig s5 of clay composites atrazine however displayed a 10 increase in sorption at the 50 μg l initial concentration for both clay composites when nom was introduced the effect of nom for atrazine was not significant according to the anova two factor analysis table s10a the decreased sorption effect of nom was particularly evident for pfas equilibrium sorption notably the pfos sorption rate was not significantly affected by the presence of nom the net decrease in organic compound removal on clay composites particularly for positively charged pdadmac clay composites is contrary to previous results in which the presence of aldrich humic acid enhanced organic compound sorption on pdadmac and pvpcos type clay composites bottero et al 1994 zadaka et al 2009 the complexity and varied functional groups of suwannee river nom compared to aldrich humic acid may explain the absence of the enhanced sorption phenomena observed in other studies for example aldrich humic acid has higher phenolic acidity i e 3 6 meq g and lower carboxylic acidity 7 9 meq g karanfil et al 1996 than the 2r101n suwannee river nom isolate 2 5 meq g and 11 2 meq g respectively driver and perdue 2014 which can contribute to greater hydrophobicity and organic compound sorption the effect of nom on sorption was minor for biochar biochar s high surface area may help overcome any loss in sorption sites due to nom organic compound removal was hindered by nom competition for sorption sites and electrostatic repulsion graphical abstract a2 and b2 nom sorption on geomedia in the absence of contaminants was higher on pdadmac clay composites and biochar 50 60 removal compared to pvpcos clay composites 30 removal fig s8 as the initial contaminant concentration increased to 5 μg l nom continued to strongly sorb to pdadmac clay composites and biochar yet less than 5 of nom sorbed to the pvpcos clay composites nom sorption on pvpcos clay composites and biochar also occurred despite electrostatic repulsion due to hydrophobic interactions of aromatic moieties accardi dey and gschwend 2002 the pvpcos clay composites may sorb less nom because the composites have less aromatic regions and overall surface area compared to biochar nom interacts predominantly with the geomedia surface rather than the trace organic compounds several compounds e g atr diu and fpr showed slight affinity for nom while less hydrophobic compounds e g 2 4 d and tcep and negatively charged pfas displayed no interaction with nom due to unfavorable hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions fig s9 with the exception of atrazine nom organic compound affinity was negligible compared to the amount of nom sorbed onto geomedia resulting in a net reduction in organic compound removal 3 4 effect of nom on trace metal sorption in general the effects of nom on metal removal were weaker than for organic compound removal yet the effect of nom was statistically significant for almost every reaction system examined table s9 s11 nom increased ni and cd removal fig 2b for pdadmac clay composites and zn removal for pvpcos clay composites e g 20 more removal at 5 μg l the effect of nom on cu sorption was negligible for the clay composites nom did not alter trace metal sorption on biochar the small enhancement in ni and cd removal may be due to sorption of nom metal complexes suwannee river nom has high oxygen content 41 48 ihss 2018 and carboxylic acidity 11 21 meq g driver and perdue 2014 to complex divalent cations the divalent cation affinity for nom fig s9 matched predicted metal humic acid affinities given by the nica donnan model milne et al 2003 for pdadmac clay composites the sorption enhancement was most favorable due to electrostatic attraction between the positively charged composite surface and negatively charged nom metal complexes for pvpcos clay composites nom sorbs weakly to the composite surface and ftir data suggests that the montmorillonite surface may be available for surface complexation thus the capability for both nom m2 and montmorillonite m2 complexation can contribute to the enhanced divalent cation removal observations graphical abstract b2 3 5 functionalized polymer clay composite performance in flow through systems trace organic compound removal by clay composites in simulated stormwater during continuous flow was consistent with predictions from batch studies figure s10a1 complete breakthrough occurred within the first 5 pore volumes for the control sand columns fig 3 top row and fig s11 indicating that trace organics did not interact with the sand to an appreciable degree both polymer clay composites exhibited similar performance with respect to removal of 2 4 d atr and pfoa while pvpcos clay composites displayed slightly greater sorption of tcep diu fpr and pfos fig s11 in general as trace organic affinity for geomedia increased i e as shown in batch experiments breakthrough occurred at later times incomplete breakthrough of diu fpr and pfos could have been due to diffusion limitations of compounds that exhibit higher affinities for surfaces sabatini and austin 1990 biochar amended columns were extremely efficient in removing even the most polar trace organics with no breakthrough occurring at up to 150 pore volumes batch sorption and cumulative column sorption for biochar figure s10a1 revealed that maximum sorption capacity was not achieved cr vi was best removed by pdadmac clay composite columns which can be attributed to favorable electrostatic interactions fig s12 as with batch sorption results weak sorption of haso4 2 was observed for the geomedia with breakthrough occurring between 30 and 50 pore volumes all divalent cations were well removed by all columns including the sand control hatt et al also observed 94 removal of divalent cations by sand in stormwater filtration systems in a synthetic stormwater matrix hatt et al 2008 an additional batch study indicated that ottawa sand exhibited a weak affinity for divalent cations in simulated stormwater e g 10 30 removal at 50 μg l initial metal concentration solid bars fig s13b given that the majority of the surfaces in the columns consisted of sand i e 97 wt sand the effect of sorption onto sand was more prominent than that of the geomedia breakthrough required more time for clay composite amended columns in the presence of nom fig 4 top row and fig 4 which is most likely due to competition between nom and contaminants for sorption sites during filtration for example breakthrough was retarded for 2 4 d fpr and pfoa fig s14 compared to columns without nom fig 3 batch sorption kinetics dotted lines fig s5 and predictions figure s10a2 agreed with column observations organic compound removal was similar for both clay composite columns breakthrough occurred later as the trace organic compound affinity for the geomedia increased for example complete breakthrough occurred near 50 pore volumes for 2 4 d the least hydrophobic compound and no breakthrough was observed for pfos the compound with the highest affinity for the geomedia the clay composite columns exhibited comparable pfos removal as biochar columns cr vi sorption on pdadmac clay composites increased in the presence of nom which was consistent with batch sorption results fig s4 nom cro4 2 affinity fig s9 and geomedia nom interactions fig s8 even biochar amended columns exhibited 10 more removal of cr vi as v continued to exhibit poor removal in all test columns fig 4 control columns continued to exhibit complete removal of zn and cd in the presence of nom whereas some breakthrough was observed for ni and cu fig s15 like the pvpcos clay composites sand does not have a strong affinity to nom fig s8 therefore metal sorption to sand was likely controlled by metal nom interactions a pulse of ni was observed in control columns which could have been due to the strong affinity of ni to nom and immediate breakthrough of nom for these columns fig 5 the nom acted as a carrier for cu resulting in incomplete breakthrough which was observed in other studies under similar conditions oden et al 1993 polymer clay composite amended columns also exhibited a pulse of high divalent cation concentrations in the first 50 pore volumes fig s15 which can be explained by geomedia nom metal interactions both clay composite columns display immediate breakthrough of nom fig 5 pvpcos clay composites possess low affinity for nom fig s8 and these columns also exhibited the largest pulse similarly ni and zn had the strongest affinity to nom fig s9 and the largest pulse in clay composite columns after 50 pore volumes zn ni and cu divalent cation removal stabilized and no breakthrough was observed for up to 150 pore volumes cd removal remained high in the presence of nom with no observed pulse the high divalent cation removal by clay composites was underpredicted from batch sorption figure s10b2 although contaminant removal was extremely efficient for biochar test columns the saturated hydraulic conductivity was significantly lower compared to control and clay composite test columns fig 6 approximately 90 reduction in biochar column hydraulic conductivity was observed even treatment due to the water holding capacity of biochar barnes et al 2014 increasing the biochar particle size could increase biochar hydraulic conductivity however contaminant removal efficiency may be sacrificed low hydraulic conductivity in stormwater infiltration systems can lead to clogging decreased sorption and reduced groundwater recharge therefore although clay composite column performance was comparable or worse than that of biochar for all stormwater contaminants except cr vi and divalent cations at conditions employed in this study the high hydraulic conductivity could make the composites more appropriate for deployment in stormwater treatment applications when the risk of system clogging is considered or when higher groundwater recharge rates are needed 3 6 estimated geomedia lifetime under typical conditions a stormwater infiltration system will be subjected to 50 cm yr of rainfall with 4000 m2 of impervious surface coverage therefore we assumed a 50 m2 0 5 m deep stormwater bioinfiltration system hatt et al 2009 to calculate geomedia lifetime the model infiltration system was estimated to receive 2000 m3 stormwater yr a 50 μg l initial concentration of urban runoff contaminants entering the stormwater infiltration system was assumed under the same simulated stormwater reaction conditions i e stormwater matrix at ph 7 6 with 5 mg c l nom in this study using data from the column studies at 150 pore volumes calculations were made to estimate the time to geomedia failure average geomedia lifetimes for trace organic compound and metal removal were 20 years 30 years and 80 years for pdadmac clay composites pvpcos clay composites and biochar respectively 4 conclusions poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride and poly 4 vinylpyridine co styrene coated montmorillonite clay composites were synthesized in a fast simple procedure and assessed for contaminant removal in stormwater infiltration systems polymer functionalization facilitated sorption of hydrophobic trace organic compounds without sacrificing the ability of the montmorillonite to remove trace metals trace organic compound removal was controlled by hydrophobic interactions for uncharged compounds and electrostatic attraction in the case of negatively charged 2 4 d and pfas trace metal removal was attributable to composite surface functional group complexation electrostatic interactions with the polymers and interactions between the metals and montmorillonite or sand mineral surface more research is needed to determine the exact polymer configuration and montmorillonite surface availability for both clay composites particularly as it relates to mechanisms of trace metal sorption furthermore higher polymer loadings onto montmorillonite clays could improve trace organic compound removal the presence of nom decreased organic compound sorption onto both clay composites which was inconsistent with results from other studies in which enhanced contaminant removal was observed when aldrich humic acid was employed as a surrogate for nom the suwannee river nom used in this study is more representative of naturally occurring doc and thus a better proxy for assessing geomedia potential during stormwater infiltration metal nom complexation enhanced the removal of both oxyanion and divalent cation metals in the simulated stormwater matrix further testing is needed to determine other factors that may affect geomedia performance and lifetime under field conditions for example polymer clays have demonstrated bactericidal activity against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria nigmatullin et al 2008 while the presence of biochar in soils has been reported to promote bacterial growth luo et al 2015 suggesting a propensity for biofouling which could reduce biochar lifetime during stormwater infiltration the high polymer clay composite saturated hydraulic conductivity after column studies in simulated stormwater supports deployment of this geomedia for stormwater infiltration and other passive treatment processes over biochar for optimal urban stormwater treatment in infiltration systems permeable reactive barriers or landfill amendment application a combination of functionalized polymer clays and biochar could be employed resulting in a

developed and characterized as engineered geomedia for trace contaminant removal during infiltration of urban runoff montmorillonite clays were functionalized with either poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac or poly 4 vinylpyridine co styrene pvpcos to enhance organic compound sorption using a simple scalable synthesis method seven representative trace organic compounds and six trace metals were employed to assess the performance of the polymer clay composites relative to biochar i e an adsorbent proposed for similar purposes in batch sorption and column studies under simulated stormwater conditions contaminant and geomedia electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and the presence of natural organic matter nom affected sorption in batch studies polymer clay composites exhibited similar performance to biochar for perfluoroalkyl substance removal but had lower affinity for polar pesticides and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate oxyanion removal was greatest for positively charged pdadmac clay composites particularly cr vi while pvpcos clay composites removed over 95 of ni cd and cu nom decreased removal of all organic compounds but increased trace metal removal on clay composites due to sorption of nom complexed metals polymer clay composite amended columns best removed oxyanions while biochar amended columns exhibited superior removal for all trace organics at 3 wt geomedia sand loading clay composites exhibited significantly higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than biochar which is advantageous when clogging is a concern or when rapid infiltration is needed under typical urban stormwater conditions the clay composites will remove contaminants for at least 20 30 years before regeneration or replacement is needed graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban stormwater biochar sorption pesticide pfas 1 introduction stormwater runoff is being considered in water stressed cities as an alternative water resource grebel et al 2013 despite its potential for augmenting water supplies urban stormwater contains contaminants that pose risks to human health and aquatic ecosystems in particular urban runoff often contains elevated concentrations of trace

water resources and to minimize health hazards it may be necessary to treat stormwater during infiltration engineered geomedia can be employed in stormwater infiltration systems to remove chemical contaminants hatt et al 2009 geomedia performance depends upon their ability to remove a broad suite of contaminants their cost and susceptibility to passivation and clogging previous studies have shown that manganese oxide coated sand can oxidize certain electron rich organic compounds in urban runoff charbonnet et al 2018 grebel et al 2016 biochar a pyrolytic carbonaceous geomedia can also remove nutrients iqbal et al 2015 metals uchimiya et al 2011 e coli mohanty and boehm 2015 and trace organic compounds ulrich et al 2015 from stormwater these and other geomedia can be applied to improve water quality during groundwater recharge or stormwater capture for non potable applications such as landscape irrigation grant et al 2012 for example geomedia can be added as a soil amendment in decentralized stormwater infiltration systems in which treatment occurs by infiltration during intermittent storm events or it can be added to surficial sediments i e sand and gravel in managed aquifer recharge systems in addition to biochar and manganese oxide coated sands polymer modified clay composites may be useful as a geomedia for stormwater treatment montmorillonite clays are hydrophilic negatively charged minerals with high reactive surface area and cation exchange capacity lin and juang 2002 because of these properties polycations can exchange with inner layer cations resulting in charge reversal on the clay surface and increased hydrophobic domains which can enhance trace organic compound removal yang et al 2003 the resulting positive charge can also facilitate removal of negatively charged natural organic matter nom chang and juang 2004 and nom complexed metals anirudhan and suchithra 2010 poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac and protonated poly 4 vinylpyridine co styrene pvpcos polymers can be employed for charge reversal and hydrophobic modification of montmorillonite clays pdadmac is an inexpensive synthetic polymer used as a wastewater treatment coagulant yan et al 2008 the pdadmac quaternary amine moiety results in a permanent positive charge independent of solution ph roach et al 2011 providing pdadmac modified montmorillonite with the ability to remove anionic contaminants and nom bolto et al 2001 from water the pyrrolidine pdadmac monomer however lacks the π orbital network responsible for enhanced interactions with

cations and nom and in flow through systems to address this issue representative trace organic compounds and metals in urban stormwater were studied in a simulated stormwater matrix biochar was also studied under identical conditions to benchmark the performance of the polymer clay composite column infiltration studies with geomedia amended sand were conducted to evaluate geomedia performance in

clay composites first a 5 g l montmorillonite clay solution was prepared in millipore milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm then sonicated for 15 min to break up aggregates for the pdadmac clay composite a 3 g l pdadmac solution was prepared in milli q water and then the clay and pdadmac solutions were combined at a 2 1 v v ratio resulting in a 2 g l pdadmac and 1 67 g l montmorillonite mixture for the pvpcos clay composite first the pvpcos polymer solution was acidified using sulfuric acid 95 purity sigma aldrich mo in a stoichiometric ratio to protonate the pyridine nitrogen and facilitate solubilization sorption onto the montmorillonite surface and exchange with the inner na and ca2 ions the protonated 3 g l pvpcos was mixed overnight before combining the pvpcos and montmorillonite solutions at the same 2 1 polymer clay ratio the polymer clay solutions were mixed on a shaker for 4 h to allow for complete polycation intercalation and surface coating before centrifugation at 10 000 rpm or 18 600 g avanti j 30i beckman coulter inc for 10 min the supernatant containing unadsorbed polymer was drained and the remaining polymer coated clays were washed three times with milli q water following a second round of centrifugation the fluffy polymer clay suspensions were transferred to a beaker and oven dried at 50 c overnight this differs from our previous studies where composites were freeze dried radian and mishael 2012 zadaka et al 2009 freeze drying reduces clay composite aggregation and increases composite surface area maes et al 1997 compared to oven drying however oven drying is faster and less laborious which is important for large scale synthesis for stormwater infiltration applications furthermore freeze drying clays can result in structural deterioration upon wetting murray and quirk 1980 which could decrease contaminant removal over long periods and groundwater recharge due to swelling and clogging after oven drying the clay composites and biochar were ground using a mortar and pestle and sieved to achieve a 100 300 μm range to normalize particle size effects no polymer desorption from the oven dried clay composites was observed table s5 with experimental description oven dried clay composite physicochemical properties i e surface area and charge and polymer loading were characterized experimental details are

sorption experiments batch sorption experiments were conducted to determine the equilibrium sorption of geomedia under simulated stormwater conditions all batch experiments were performed in triplicate at 25 c in polypropylene containers to reduce sorption of contaminants to container walls the reaction ph was buffered with 1 mm bicarbonate in the simulated stormwater matrix and changed by less than 0 1 ph unit during sorption experiments the trace organic compound stock solutions were prepared in water and a trace metal stock solution was prepared in 1 wt nitric acid ph 1 cr vi which is insoluble below ph 2 was prepared separately and added to the reaction mixture all batch experiments included all the contaminants simultaneously for all batch experiments a control experiment without geomedia was conducted simultaneously to determine contaminant sorption to container walls batch sorption experiments were performed at different initial contaminant concentrations i e 5 50 and 500 μg l of each contaminant experiments containing 5 mg c l nom were also conducted to study the effect of doc approximately 125 ml of reaction solution containing the contaminants and nom in simulated stormwater was pre mixed on a stir plate 800 rpm for 1 h prior to introducing the geomedia the pre mixing allowed nom to complex contaminants before interacting with geomedia which is representative of how contaminants encounter geomedia during stormwater infiltration the geomedia 0 5 g l was then added to the reaction to initiate sorption after 24 h aliquots were filtered using a 0 2 μm nylon membrane filter and prepared for analysis of contaminant and doc sorption to geomedia sorption rates were determined in batch kinetic experiments initial contaminant concentrations of 50

for the larger sample volume necessary for toc analysis as before the contaminants and 5 mg c l nom were pre mixed prior to introducing geomedia aliquots were collected at pre selected time intervals over the course of the 24 h reaction period for trace contaminant analysis experiments were conducted to examine nom sorption by geomedia 1 l solutions of simulated stormwater were prepared with 5 mg

samples from each reaction system were filtered using a 0 2 μm nylon membrane filter and analyzed for doc after 24 h of reaction anova two factor statistical analysis was performed to determine the significance of the effect of nom and geomedia on contaminant removal tables s9 s11 to qualitatively assess the affinities of each contaminant to nom we performed a dialysis size exclusion test devitt

remained isolated inside the dialysis tubing while compounds smaller than 500 da freely passed through the tubing the nom tubes were first dialyzed against milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm after dialysis against milli q water was complete i e the exchanged milli q conductivity remained constant the outsides of the dialysis tubes were rinsed with milli q water and transferred to a container of the simulated stormwater matrix for dialysis against the matrix cations and anions after equilibration the simulated stormwater solution was spiked with 50 μg l of each contaminant and stirred for 24 h after 24 h aliquots of the simulated stormwater solution were analyzed for trace contaminant concentration a control experiment was simultaneously conducted filling the dialysis tube with water instead of nom to quantify association of contaminants to the dialysis tubing 2 4 column studies to better assess the performance of the polymer clay composites we conducted column studies using pvc columns 12 cm in length 2 54 cm inner diameter ottawa sand 600 850 μm was acid washed with 5 wt nitric acid then washed with deionized water to remove impurities geomedia was added at 3 wt to the sand

the columns for 48 h prior to initiating the experiments columns were operated in up flow mode at a volumetric flow rate of 0 8 ml min 12 cm h infiltration rate to fully saturate the columns dry and wetted columns were weighted to determine porosity to initiate the column studies a 75 l feed solution was prepared containing 10 μg l of each contaminant in simulated stormwater a separate column study was performed adding 5 mg c l nom to the simulated stormwater matrix to determine the effect of doc on column filtration for the nom column study the feed solution was mixed using a stir plate placed underneath the tank for 1 h before initiating the column experiments throughout the experiment samples were collected from the column effluent and prepared for analysis of trace contaminants and doc when applicable collected samples were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator and analyzed within 24 h contaminant concentration in the feed tank was also measured to determine contaminant loss to tank walls the saturated hydraulic conductivity of each column was measured at the beginning and conclusion of the column studies using the constant head method to relate geomedia performance to stormwater permeability column porosities hydraulic residence times and additional experimental information is provided in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 polymer clay composite physicochemical properties and surface analysis the clay composite surface charge was determined by the nature of the surface functional groups and polymer montmorillonite interactions table 1 the montmorillonite exhibited a negative surface charge 40 3 1 5 mv due to silanol and aluminol groups and isomorphic substitution bourg et al 2007 after polymer sorption the measured surface charge of as prepared pdadmac clay composites i e 42 7 1 8 mv and pvpcos clay composites i e 18 7 3 1 mv was reversed indicating successful clay modification under simulated stormwater conditions i e ph 7 6 and 4 6 mm nacl the pvpcos clay composite surface charge decreased to 9 7 1 5 mv while the pdadmac clay composite surface charge remained positive 41 0 1 8 mv pvpcos clay composite surface charge decrease at circumneutral ph has been observed for similarly prepared composites kohay et al 2015 biochar exhibited an overall negative charge 34 1 0 7 mv due to deprotonated carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups fourier transform infrared ftir spectra fig 1 suggest that the pvpcos polymer configuration on montmorillonite consisted of loop and tail regions unassociated with the montmorillonite surface the 1635 cm 1 pdadmac quaternized nitrogen band yudovin farber et al 2010 appeared in the as prepared pvpcos clay composite spectra due to the protonated amine nitrogen in the simulated stormwater spectra the 1605 cm 1 band corresponding to uncharged pyridine nitrogen healy et al 1989 increased while the 1635 cm 1 band area decreased the presence of both bands in the pvpcos clay composite simulated stormwater spectra suggests that 1 a fraction of sorbed protonated pvpcos pyridines interacted primarily with the negatively charged montmorillonite surface and are not heavily influenced by bulk solution ph and 2 a fraction of sorbed uncharged pyridines did not directly interact with the montmorillonite surface at the system ph pdadmac should adsorb in more extended train configurations graphical abstract a1 due to stronger electrostatic interactions with montmorillonite churchman 2002 while uncharged pvpcos may exist in loops and tails breen 1999 due to regions of unassociated pyridine graphical abstract b1 expansion of sorbed pvp on clay surfaces following charge neutralization was observed in other studies marra and hair 1988 this expanded configuration of uncharged monomers may lead to more divalent cation sorption on pvpcos clay composites than pdadmac clay composites 3 2 batch urban stormwater contaminant sorption capacity and kinetics under simulated stormwater conditions batch sorption and kinetics experiments with trace organics figs s3 and s5 and metals figs s4 and s6 were conducted to evaluate geomedia performance for stormwater treatment 3 2 1 trace organic compound removal trace organic compound sorption fig 2 a and sorption kinetics solid curves fig s5 were affected by the compound s hydrophobicity and the extent of hydrophobic domains on the geomedia surface as the organic compound hydrophobicity i e octanol water partition coefficient kow table s2 increased the extent of equilibrium sorption and the sorption rate increased for both clay composites ranging from approximately 20 30 removal of 2 4 d tcep and atrazine least hydrophobic to 80 removal of fipronil as the compound hydrophobicity increases the statistical difference in removal between clay composites and biochar decreases table s9b for pfoa and pfos which undergo a somewhat different sorption mechanism than the other compounds li et al 2011 over 95 removal was observed 2 4 d sorption on clay composites was higher than tcep because 2 4 d contains a deprotonated carboxylic group available for additional interactions table s2 similar organic compound removal was observed for both clay composites with slightly higher removal by pvpcos clay composites biochar removed over 95 of all trace organics at all initial concentrations and at faster rates i e within 5 min compared to the clay composites the pdadmac and pvpcos polymer modification resulted in two orders of magnitude increase in pfoa removal in μmol g sorbent and one order of magnitude increase in pfos removal compared to unmodified montmorillonite fig s7 less hydrophobic organics displayed comparable removal on bare montmorillonite compound partitioning to hydrophobic domains on the clay composite surface and electrostatic interactions governed organic compound sorption studies of polar uncharged organic compound sorption onto polymer clays suggest that compounds partition from the aqueous phase to the organic rich polymer phase near the functionalized clay surface park et al 2011 the organic compound composite aromatic structural compatibility was expected to be greater for pvpcos clay composites yet organic compound sorption by pdadmac clay composites was comparable over the entire contaminant concentration range fig s3 this may have been due to attractive weak forces between the organic compound aromatic moieties and the pdadmac trains trace organic compound sorption onto biochar can occur via several mechanisms including surface interactions e g electrostatics hydrogen bonding π electron and physical interactions such as pore filling mechanisms teixidó et al 2011 the polyaromatic hydrophobic biochar surface is ideal for organic compound sorption and the large degree of biochar microporosity and surface area can facilitate removal pfoa and pfos removal was comparable i e statistically insignificant table s10b for all three geomedia at all initial concentrations fig s3 pfas are oleophobic surfactants with negatively charged polar head groups pfas sorption onto positively charged pdadmac clay composites was likely facilitated by electrostatic attraction of the acidic head groups pfas have also exhibited strong affinity for biochar and activated carbon despite their negative surface charged xiao et al 2017 hydrophobic interactions between the pfas backbone and the hydrophobic domains of pvpcos clay composites and biochar overcame electrostatic repulsion graphical abstract b1 pfoa sorption kinetics were comparable for biochar and pvpcos clay composites and faster than the pdadmac clay composite removal rate pfos sorption kinetics were comparable for biochar and pdadmac clay composites and slower for pvpcos clay composites 3 2 2 oxyanion and divalent cation removal the pdadmac clay composites were the most effective geomedia for oxyanion i e haso4 2 and cro4 2 table s4 sorption fig 2b and exhibited the fastest kinetics solid curves fig s6 generally haso4 2 was not removed by pvpcos clay composites nor biochar and only 20 removal was observed for pdadmac clay composites approximately 60 cro4 2 removal was achieved by pdadmac clay composites whereas no cro4 2 removal was observed for pvpcos clay composites and biochar due to repulsive forces divalent cation removal increased as a function of metal hydrolysis cupric carbonate cuco3 0 aq was predicted to be the dominant aqueous cu species abundance 86 while the remaining divalent cations existed mostly as the free aqueous metal i e m m2 species abundances of 75 80 table s4 over the range of initial contaminant concentrations equilibrium sorption and kinetics generally increased in the order of zn ni cd cu for all geomedia fig s4 this divalent cation series corresponds to increasing degree of hydrolysis benjamin 2014 with asynchronization for cu whose stability constant pka 7 5 is below the system ph pdadmac clay composites exhibited less sorption of m2 cations compared to pvpcos clay composites pvpcos clay composite m2 removal was comparable or superior to biochar with over 75 removal over all initial concentrations fig s4 furthermore the statistical difference in removal of m2 ions decreased between pvpcos and biochar as hydrolysis increased tables s9d s10d s11d greater than 95 cu removal was observed for all geomedia at all initial concentrations geomedia surface functional groups and ion exchange properties govern divalent cation sorption ftir data suggest that ion exchange and surface complexation sites associated with the montmorillonite surface are available to facilitate divalent metal cation sorption on the composites graphical abstract a1 and b1 particularly for pvpcos clay composites due to the polymer loop and tail configuration the pvp amine moiety can also complex divalent cations zhang et al 2014 cr vi song et al 2015 and as v yoshitake et al 2002 because the pdadmac does not contain r2 n groups divalent cation removal may occur via direct interaction with montmorillonite furthermore pdadmac clay composites may exhibit less divalent cation removal because of electrostatic repulsion biochar contains negatively charged functional groups e g carboxyl hydroxyl which can complex divalent cations additionally biochar like montmorillonite possesses exchangeable cations e g ca2 mg2 that can take up divalent metals kołodyńska et al 2012 in general trace metal sorption of unmodified clays was slightly higher or comparable to that observed for the clay composites fig s7 3 3 effect of dissolved organic matter on trace organic compound removal the presence of nom in the simulated stormwater matrix generally reduced trace organic compound sorption fig 2a and sorption rate dotted curves fig s5 of clay composites atrazine however displayed a 10 increase in sorption at the 50 μg l initial concentration for both clay composites when nom was introduced the effect of nom for atrazine was not significant according to the anova two factor analysis table s10a the decreased sorption effect of nom was particularly evident for pfas equilibrium sorption notably the pfos sorption rate was not significantly affected by the presence of nom the net decrease in organic compound removal on clay composites particularly for positively charged pdadmac clay composites is contrary to previous results in which the presence of aldrich humic acid enhanced organic compound sorption on pdadmac and pvpcos type clay composites bottero et al 1994 zadaka et al 2009 the complexity and varied functional groups of suwannee river nom compared to aldrich humic acid may explain the absence of the enhanced sorption phenomena observed in other studies for example aldrich humic acid has higher phenolic acidity i e 3 6 meq g and lower carboxylic acidity 7 9 meq g karanfil et al 1996 than the 2r101n suwannee river nom isolate 2 5 meq g and 11 2 meq g respectively driver and perdue 2014 which can contribute to greater hydrophobicity and organic compound sorption the effect of nom on sorption was minor for biochar biochar s high surface area may help overcome any loss in sorption sites due to nom organic compound removal was hindered by nom competition for sorption sites and electrostatic repulsion graphical abstract a2 and b2 nom sorption on geomedia in the absence of contaminants was higher on pdadmac clay composites and biochar 50 60 removal compared to pvpcos clay composites 30 removal fig s8 as the initial contaminant concentration increased to 5 μg l nom continued to strongly sorb to pdadmac clay composites and biochar yet less than 5 of nom sorbed to the pvpcos clay composites nom sorption on pvpcos clay composites and biochar also occurred despite electrostatic repulsion due to hydrophobic interactions of aromatic moieties accardi dey and gschwend 2002 the pvpcos clay composites may sorb less nom because the composites have less aromatic regions and overall surface area compared to biochar nom interacts predominantly with the geomedia surface rather than the trace organic compounds several compounds e g atr diu and fpr showed slight affinity for nom while less hydrophobic compounds e g 2 4 d and tcep and negatively charged pfas displayed no interaction with nom due to unfavorable hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions fig s9 with the exception of atrazine nom organic compound affinity was negligible compared to the amount of nom sorbed onto geomedia resulting in a net reduction in organic compound removal 3 4 effect of nom on trace metal sorption in general the effects of nom on metal removal were weaker than for organic compound removal yet the effect of nom was statistically significant for almost every reaction system examined table s9 s11 nom increased ni and cd removal fig 2b for pdadmac clay composites and zn removal for pvpcos clay composites e g 20 more removal at 5 μg l the effect of nom on cu sorption was negligible for the clay composites nom did not alter trace metal sorption on biochar the small enhancement in ni and cd removal may be due to sorption of nom metal complexes suwannee river nom has high oxygen content 41 48 ihss 2018 and carboxylic acidity 11 21 meq g driver and perdue 2014 to complex divalent cations the divalent cation affinity for nom fig s9 matched predicted metal humic acid affinities given by the nica donnan model milne et al 2003 for pdadmac clay composites the sorption enhancement was most favorable due to electrostatic attraction between the positively charged composite surface and negatively charged nom metal complexes for pvpcos clay composites nom sorbs weakly to the composite surface and ftir data suggests that the montmorillonite surface may be available for surface complexation thus the capability for both nom m2 and montmorillonite m2 complexation can contribute to the enhanced divalent cation removal observations graphical abstract b2 3 5 functionalized polymer clay composite performance in flow through systems trace organic compound removal by clay composites in simulated stormwater during continuous flow was consistent with predictions from batch studies figure s10a1 complete breakthrough occurred within the first 5 pore volumes for the control sand columns fig 3 top row and fig s11 indicating that trace organics did not interact with the sand to an appreciable degree both polymer clay composites exhibited similar performance with respect to removal of 2 4 d atr and pfoa while pvpcos clay composites displayed slightly greater sorption of tcep diu fpr and pfos fig s11 in general as trace organic affinity for geomedia increased i e as shown in batch experiments breakthrough occurred at later times incomplete breakthrough of diu fpr and pfos could have been due to diffusion limitations of compounds that exhibit higher affinities for surfaces sabatini and austin 1990 biochar amended columns were extremely efficient in removing even the most polar trace organics with no breakthrough occurring at up to 150 pore volumes batch sorption and cumulative column sorption for biochar figure s10a1 revealed that maximum sorption capacity was not achieved cr vi was best removed by pdadmac clay composite columns which can be attributed to favorable electrostatic interactions fig s12 as with batch sorption results weak sorption of haso4 2 was observed for the geomedia with breakthrough occurring between 30 and 50 pore volumes all divalent cations were well removed by all columns including the sand control hatt et al also observed 94 removal of divalent cations by sand in stormwater filtration systems in a synthetic stormwater matrix hatt et al 2008 an additional batch study indicated that ottawa sand exhibited a weak affinity for divalent cations in simulated stormwater e g 10 30 removal at 50 μg l initial metal concentration solid bars fig s13b given that the majority of the surfaces in the columns consisted of sand i e 97 wt sand the effect of sorption onto sand was more prominent than that of the geomedia breakthrough required more time for clay composite amended columns in the presence of nom fig 4 top row and fig 4 which is most likely due to competition between nom and contaminants for sorption sites during filtration for example breakthrough was retarded for 2 4 d fpr and pfoa fig s14 compared to columns without nom fig 3 batch sorption kinetics dotted lines fig s5 and predictions figure s10a2 agreed with column observations organic compound removal was similar for both clay composite columns breakthrough occurred later as the trace organic compound affinity for the geomedia increased for example complete breakthrough occurred near 50 pore volumes for 2 4 d the least hydrophobic compound and no breakthrough was observed for pfos the compound with the highest affinity for the geomedia the clay composite columns exhibited comparable pfos removal as biochar columns cr vi sorption on pdadmac clay composites increased in the presence of nom which was consistent with batch sorption results fig s4 nom cro4 2 affinity fig s9 and geomedia nom interactions fig s8 even biochar amended columns exhibited 10 more removal of cr vi as v continued to exhibit poor removal in all test columns fig 4 control columns continued to exhibit complete removal of zn and cd in the presence of nom whereas some breakthrough was observed for ni and cu fig s15 like the pvpcos clay composites sand does not have a strong affinity to nom fig s8 therefore metal sorption to sand was likely controlled by metal nom interactions a pulse of ni was observed in control columns which could have been due to the strong affinity of ni to nom and immediate breakthrough of nom for these columns fig 5 the nom acted as a carrier for cu resulting in incomplete breakthrough which was observed in other studies under similar conditions oden et al 1993 polymer clay composite amended columns also exhibited a pulse of high divalent cation concentrations in the first 50 pore volumes fig s15 which can be explained by geomedia nom metal interactions both clay composite columns display immediate breakthrough of nom fig 5 pvpcos clay composites possess low affinity for nom fig s8 and these columns also exhibited the largest pulse similarly ni and zn had the strongest affinity to nom fig s9 and the largest pulse in clay composite columns after 50 pore volumes zn ni and cu divalent cation removal stabilized and no breakthrough was observed for up to 150 pore volumes cd removal remained high in the presence of nom with no observed pulse the high divalent cation removal by clay composites was underpredicted from batch sorption figure s10b2 although contaminant removal was extremely efficient for biochar test columns the saturated hydraulic conductivity was significantly lower compared to control and clay composite test columns fig 6 approximately 90 reduction in biochar column hydraulic conductivity was observed even treatment due to the water holding capacity of biochar barnes et al 2014 increasing the biochar particle size could increase biochar hydraulic conductivity however contaminant removal efficiency may be sacrificed low hydraulic conductivity in stormwater infiltration systems can lead to clogging decreased sorption and reduced groundwater recharge therefore although clay composite column performance was comparable or worse than that of biochar for all stormwater contaminants except cr vi and divalent cations at conditions employed in this study the high hydraulic conductivity could make the composites more appropriate for deployment in stormwater treatment applications when the risk of system clogging is considered or when higher groundwater recharge rates are needed 3 6 estimated geomedia lifetime under typical conditions a stormwater infiltration system will be subjected to 50 cm yr of rainfall with 4000 m2 of impervious surface coverage therefore we assumed a 50 m2 0 5 m deep stormwater bioinfiltration system hatt et al 2009 to calculate geomedia lifetime the model infiltration system was estimated to receive 2000 m3 stormwater yr a 50 μg l initial concentration of urban runoff contaminants entering the stormwater infiltration system was assumed under the same simulated stormwater reaction conditions i e stormwater matrix at ph 7 6 with 5 mg c l nom in this study using data from the column studies at 150 pore volumes calculations were made to estimate the time to geomedia failure average geomedia lifetimes for trace organic compound and metal removal were 20 years 30 years and 80 years for pdadmac clay composites pvpcos clay composites and biochar respectively 4 conclusions poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride and poly 4 vinylpyridine co styrene coated montmorillonite clay composites were synthesized in a fast simple procedure and assessed for contaminant removal in stormwater infiltration systems polymer functionalization facilitated sorption of hydrophobic trace organic compounds without sacrificing the ability of the montmorillonite to remove trace metals trace organic compound removal was controlled by hydrophobic interactions for uncharged compounds and electrostatic attraction in the case of negatively charged 2 4 d and pfas trace metal removal was attributable to composite surface functional group complexation electrostatic interactions with the polymers and interactions between the metals and montmorillonite or sand mineral surface more research is needed to determine the exact polymer configuration and montmorillonite surface availability for both clay composites particularly as it relates to mechanisms of trace metal sorption furthermore higher polymer loadings onto montmorillonite clays could improve trace organic compound removal the presence of nom decreased organic compound sorption onto both clay composites which was inconsistent with results from other studies in which enhanced contaminant removal was observed when aldrich humic acid was employed as a surrogate for nom the suwannee river nom used in this study is more representative of naturally occurring doc and thus a better proxy for assessing geomedia potential during stormwater infiltration metal nom complexation enhanced the removal of both oxyanion and divalent cation metals in the simulated stormwater matrix further testing is needed to determine other factors that may affect geomedia performance and lifetime under field conditions for example polymer clays have demonstrated bactericidal activity against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria nigmatullin et al 2008 while the presence of biochar in soils has been reported to promote bacterial growth luo et al 2015 suggesting a propensity for biofouling which could reduce biochar lifetime during stormwater infiltration the high polymer clay composite saturated hydraulic conductivity after column studies in simulated stormwater supports deployment of this geomedia for stormwater infiltration and other passive treatment processes over biochar for optimal urban stormwater treatment in infiltration systems permeable reactive barriers or landfill amendment application a combination of functionalized polymer clays and biochar could be employed resulting in a symbiotic effect of increased permeability coupled with sorption of a wide variety of contaminants declaration of interests x the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

18873,as one of the key economic modes in china chemical industry park cip has made great contribution to the chinese rapid economic growth concomitantly how to effectively and safely dispose of the cip wastewater cipww has been an unavoidable issue molecular transformation of dissolved organic matter dom in cipww treatment is essential to optimize the employed process and to provide solid basis for risk evaluation of the discharged effluent as well in this study electrospray ionization coupled with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms was used to characterize the molecular transformation of dom during full scale treatment of integrated chemical wastewater in a centralized wastewater treatment plant cwwtp where the combined process follows

of uf and ro can remove most dom with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc declining by 19 2 and 94 6 respectively the correlation between spectral indexes and acute toxicity with the

opening policies chemical industry parks cips have gradually turned to be one of the main economic modes in china in 2012 there were 1185 cips distributed in almost all the provinces of china supporting information si fig s1 xu et al 2014 cips have greatly promoted the development of chinese economy however the trade off between the economic contribution of cips and their environmental impact has gained increasing concern cip is a major source of industrial pollution with the discharge amount and intensity much higher than the decentralized industries hu et al 2019 mao et al 2012 from 2011 to 2015 the industrial wastewater discharged in china remained at 20 billion tons annually of which chemical industry accounted for 20 fig s2 to respond to such urgent situation it is indispensable to effectively treat the wastewater from cips for water reuse or safe discharge into the receiving bodies currently a common model has been developed and widely employed in china cips that is pretreatment of highly contaminated waste effluents in each enterprise in cips followed by collection form integrated chemical industry park wastewater cipww for advanced treatment in centralized wastewater treatment plant cwwtp zhu et al 2015 cipww is usually featured by one or more of the following characteristics large yield high organic matter loadings high salinity poor biodegradation and high toxicity guo et al 2019 li et al 2011 long et al 2018 ma et al 2016 wu et al 2016 zhu et al 2015 the widely used technologies in cwwtp include biological techniques e g hydrolysis acidification a2 o membrane bioreactor oxidation ditch li et al 2015a ma et al 2016 wu et al 2016 physical chemical techniques e g flocculation precipitation membrane separation weng et al 2018 yen et al 2017 and chemical techniques e g fenton ozonation wen et al 2018 generally for a given cwwtp a combined process including physicochemical and biological units is usually proposed in full scale treatment depending on the properties of cipww and the final goal of the treatment discharge or water reuse particularly the transformation of dissolved organic matter dom should be concerned during cipww treatment which is crucial to optimize the combined process currently several spectral methods have been widely employed to characterize the dom properties and its transformation during water treatment including ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy based on the above methods aromaticity molecular weight mw humification degree recent autochthonous contribution and other information on dom could be well available fasching et al 2014 huguet et al 2009 lavonen et al 2015 maizel and remucal 2017 weishaar et al 2003 zhang et al 2012 however they are incompetent for directly identifying dom at molecular level on the other side toxicity tests e g acute toxicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity have been conducted to evaluate the toxicity changes during various treatments of municipal wastewater or industrial wastewater dong et al 2017 kohler et al 2006 ma et al 2018 mišík et al 2011 however the molecular level understanding of cipww associated with the toxicity evaluation is still unclear gaining the molecular level information of cipww is believed to consolidate the base to better understand the combined process and to identify the most likely toxic compounds of the discharged effluent as well very recently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms coupled with electrospray ionization esi has been employed to provide the unambiguously molecular formulae in the complex dom matrices due to the unprecedented ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy he et al 2016 li et al 2016 ohno et al 2010 osterholz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 currently this robust analytical tool has been successfully used to characterize dom composition and or transformation in a variety of environmental samples including river water wagner et al 2015 lake water kellerman et al 2014 cloud water bianco et al 2018 municipal wastewater tseng et al 2013 landfill leachate yuan et al 2017 soil li et al 2018 and smoke particles song et al 2018 all the above study suggested that ft icr ms is a powerful tool to characterize the dom transformation during cipww treatment however very few studies are available on the industrial wastewaters hu et al 2017 li et al 2015b and to the best of our knowledge no reference is available on the integrated cipww particularly the pairwise relationships between the molecular information acute toxicity and the easily available spectral indexes of the wastewater samples which are believed to deeply understand the molecular basis of the latter indexes have not been reported in this study we collected 21 samples throughout a cwwtp and employed ft icr ms to characterize the molecular composition and transformation of dom during full scale treatment of cipww which could be used to identify the contribution of each unit of the combined process meanwhile spectral indexes and acute toxicity were correlated with molecular formulae of dom further we established the pairwise relationships between molecular level parameters spectral indexes and acute toxicity of the samples for the first time this study revealed the transformation behavior of dom from cipww and the correlations of different indexes with molecular information also this study helps to provide fundamental guidance to improve and optimize the combined process of the cwwtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation the test wastewater was sampled from a typical cwwtp located in taixing city jiangsu province of china where influent 15000 m3 d included the mixed effluents from 100 pharmaceutical and chemical enterprises in the cip pretreatment of each effluent was strictly required cod 500 mg l before flowing into the cwwtp after being pretreated by hydrolysis acidification ha and flocculation precipitation fp the industrial effluent was mixed with the municipal wastewater 25000 m3 d to improve the biodegradability and the mixture was subject to sequent anaerobic anoxic oxic a1 a2 o a2 o and membrane bioreactor mbr treatments then 40 of the mbr effluent was further treated by ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro for reclaiming the used water and the others were discharged twenty one aqueous samples each 3 5 l were collected in the cwwtp to characterize the dom composition and transformation with the sampling points described in fig 1 the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane supor pall and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 c for further experiments 2 2 analytical methods all the filtered samples were analyzed in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc ph conductivity cations and anions uv vis full wavelength scan spectra were recorded by an uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was calculated by dividing the absorbance at 254 nm uv254 by doc concentration and e2 e3 was the ratio of absorbance at 250 nm and 365 nm berggren et al 2007 weishaar et al 2003 eem spectra were recorded by a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 humification index hix was calculated by dividing the peak area of the emission wavelengths between 435 and 480 nm by that between 300 and 345 nm both at the excitation wavelength at 254 nm huguet et al 2009 kamjunke et al 2015 biological index bix was calculated at the excitation wavelength of 310 nm by dividing the emission intensity at 380 and 430 nm he et al 2016 kellerman et al 2015 fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of emission intensity at 450 nm and 500 nm under the excitation wavelength of 370 nm mcknight et al 2001 the procedures for all the above analysis were detailed in si text s1 2 3 solid phase extraction solid phase extraction was performed to help further characterize dom of the samples based on the previous study dittmar et al 2008 in brief samples were firstly acidified by hydrochloric acid to ph 2 to improve the recovery of phenolic and carboxylic matter sandron et al 2015 then the acidified samples 100 1000 ml depending on their doc concentration were pumped at 5 ml min through the agilent bond elut ppl cartridges 1 g 6 ml as pre activated with 15 ml methanol hplc grade and 15 ml acidified ultrapure water ph 2 subsequently the cartridges were rinsed with 30 ml acidified ultrapure water to remove the residual salts and dom in the cartridges was eluted by 15 ml hplc methanol the extraction efficiencies in terms of doc of the samples fell in the range of 54 8 79 1 for ft icr ms analysis the 100 μl dom elution was added into 1 ml 50 50 methanol water v v for dilution for acute toxicity test the residual elution 14 9 ml was dried under a nitrogen flow then the dried samples were dissolved in 1 ml 10 dimethylsulfoxide dmso all samples were stored at 20 c in the dark before analysis 2 4 acute toxicity test luminescent bacteria photobacterium t3 purchased from nanjing institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences in the form of freeze dried powder 0 50 g in ampoule bottle was used to test the acute toxicity of dom in different samples through the luminescence inhibition rate bacteria in the ampoule bottle were resuscitated using 1 ml nacl 2 5 and the 10 μl bacteria solution was added into 2 ml samples diluted by 3 nacl and stood for 10 min the luminosity was measured by a biological toxicity analyzer dxy 3 nanjing institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences acute toxicity of dom was expressed by mercury hg toxicity equivalents china epa 1995 weng et al 2018 the blank of 3 nacl and 2 dmso was used as control and each sample was measured in triplicate 2 5 esi ft icr ms analysis a bruker solarix ft icr ms equipped with a 15 0 t superconducting magnet and an esi source was used to characterize the molecular composition of dom samples the extracted samples were continuously injected into the esi source at 120 μl h using a syringe pump and analyzed in negative ionization mode the esi needle voltage and the mass range were set at 3 8 kv and m z 180 1000 da respectively ionized substances of the samples were accumulated in the hexapole ion trap for 0 2 s before being imported into the icr cell four m 32 bit data points were recorded per broadband mass scan and a data set of 150 scans were accumulated in each spectrum each sample was measured in duplicate to prevent the cross contamination of the neighbor samples 50 50 methanol water v v was used to wash the injection syringe and lines three times between the consecutive operation methanol and ppl blank samples were analyzed as the control the instrument was externally calibrated using 10 mm sodium formate solution and the mass spectra were internally recalibrated using a known homologous series of the natural organic matter the entire mass spectra error was less than 0 15 ppm after internal recalibration all formulae were calculated by bruker dataanalysis software version 4 0 and matlab routines kujawinski and behn 2006 kujawinski and longnecker 2016 only the peaks with the signal to noise s n ratio 10 were considered elemental combinations of molecular formulae were set to the criteria of 12c1 100 13c0 1 1h1 100 16o0 50 14n0 10 32s0 4 31p0 2 35cl0 2 and the mass error between the measured and calculated mw was controlled less than 1 ppm elemental ratios of 0 33 h c 2 25 and 0 o c 1 0 were employed to further restrict the formula calculation chance et al 2018 hao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and other elemental restrictions were detailed in si text s2 only molecular formulae coexisting in duplicate were considered to guarantee the reproducibility and reliability of the detection lv et al 2018 riedel and dittmar 2014 and the formulae from the methanol and ppl blank were subtracted 2 6 data analysis molecule centered correlations with spectral indexes and acute toxicity were assessed using spearman rank correlation coefficients which were calculated between spectral indexes acute toxicity and the sum normalized intensity of peaks coexisting in 15 selected samples s5 s19 kellerman et al 2014 li et al 2018 then van krevelen diagrams were visually plotted for each index pearson product moment correlation was used to calculate the pairwise correlations between spectral indexes molecular level parameters and acute toxicity and the results were present as figures generated by the package corrgram in r software lucas et al 2016 false discovery rate fdr was used to correct multiple comparison of large number tests aimed at controlling the fraction of type i errors without unnecessarily increasing the risk of type ii errors benjamini and hochberg 1995 kellerman et al 2014 both p values of spearman and pearson correlation were set at a significant level of p 0 05 and the process was performed in r software using package hmisc additional data analysis was detailed in si text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of dom along the full scale treatment as shown in table 1 and s1 2 compared to municipal wastewater primary effluent mwpe the industrial wastewater primary effluent iwpe was featured with relatively higher doc concentration lower mw higher nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc an index for redox potential of a given formula higher salinity and higher toxicity herein van krevelen diagrams were used to characterize the molecular composition of dom in different units of the combined process with the classification criteria listed in table s3 wu et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the total number of dom formulae dropped down following the unit sequence of the process except for ha especially in the uf and ro processes to further compare the composition of different unit samples the relative abundance plots were depicted on the basis of nine formula classes and eight compound classes fig 3 and tables s4 5 as observed the major substances of all the samples were cho formulae 28 15 45 54 for mwpe the proportion of chon formulae 39 50 was close to cho formulae 39 54 higher than industrial wastewater samples dom of the samples was rich in heteroatoms e g n s p and cl with the proportion of 54 46 63 22 except for ro higher than the river samples at 37 2 56 6 wagner et al 2015 on the other side all the samples were dominated by lignin 38 52 64 73 furthermore the kernel based cumulative density plots violin plots were applied to visualize the distribution of mw and nosc as seen from fig s3 the changes before and after ha and membrane separation uf and ro units were more significant than the bio units a2 o and mbr to further explore the similarity of the samples to each other hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed based on the spectral indexes and molecular level parameters in table 1 hca results indicated that the uf and ro effluents displayed high similarity and could be classified as one group which is distinct from all the other samples another group fig s4a principle component analysis pca was used to determine which variables were responsible for the groupings using the same data as hca sleighter et al 2010 as shown in fig s4b the first principle component pc1 used to reflect the unsaturation of dom samples could contribute to 46 21 of the variance among the samples samples of high unsaturation e g high double bond equivalence dbewa suva254 and o cwa displayed positive pc1 scores while those of high saturation e g high h cwa displayed negative pc1 ones the second principle component pc2 correlated with the mw contributed to 28 39 of the variance samples of high mw had negative pc2 scores while those of low mw e g high e2 e3 had positive pc2 ones as a result the ro effluent low unsaturation and low mw was distributed in the upper left of the pc1 pc2 plot whilst mwpe low unsaturation and high mw was in the lower left and iwpe high unsaturation scattering in the right side fig s4b from spectral indexes table 1 one can see that suva254 of industrial wastewater ranges from 2 88 to 3 68 l mgc 1m 1 and the corresponding e2 e3 ranges from 4 90 to 8 62 comparatively municipal wastewater has lower suva254 and e2 e3 negatively correlated with mw values 0 68 l mgc 1m 1 and 5 62 implying dom in industrial wastewater featured higher aromaticity and lower mw berggren et al 2007 dehaan 1993 weishaar et al 2003 hix values an indicator of the humification extent were all around 4 expect for uf and ro suggesting that dom in aqueous samples were mainly produced by microorganisms and of low humification extent huguet et al 2009 bix that reflects the recent autochthonous contribution of dom was approximately 0 9 expect for mwpe and ro indicating that the samples displayed strong autogenetic source characteristics he et al 2016 fi was developed to evaluate the source of dom and most of its values around 1 9 except for the mwpe and ro samples implied that dom of most samples mainly came from the metabolic process of aquatic organisms while that of the mwpe sample was mainly derived from terrestrial source with the fi value around 1 4 fasching et al 2014 mcknight et al 2001 in the following subsections detailed analysis on every unit will be performed to reveal its impact of dom transformation 3 1 1 ha and fp after ha the mwwa dropped down from 423 47 da to 414 17 da table 1 indicating that dom with higher mw was degraded into lower ones via hydrolysis process simultaneously the noscwa drop from 0 988 to 0 378 indicated that ha can decrease the oxidability of carbonaceous organic matter via acidification process similar changes can be observed from the overall distribution of mw and nosc in fig s3 further kendrick mass defect kmd plot was adopted to characterize dom transformation of ha numerous homologues series of dom formulae that differ by several carboxyl groups are distributed on the same horizontal line as intuitively listed in fig 4 note that after ha treatment large amount of homologous carboxylic acids was produced with n cooh 1737 nearly twice of the virgin one fig 4a indicating acidogenic bacteria played an important role in this process generally the results based on molecular level analysis are consistent with the ha nature chen et al 2007 ucisik and henze 2008 meanwhile ha plays an important role in acute toxicity reduction by 30 3 after ha treatment ferrous sulfate solution feso4 7h2o 20 was used as coagulant in fp as observed in fig 4b for the same homologues series the dom formulae with more ch2 groups were mainly distributed in the right of the kmd ch2 plot and the more ch2 groups the smaller nosc the results showed that 226 homologous ch2 compounds with c 24 and higher nosc values blue dots was completely removed by fp similar conclusion has been proposed in previous study yuan et al 2017 however doc value dropped slightly in this process because of the low relative peak intensities corresponding to semi quantitative concentration with 10 5 order of magnitude of the removed compounds 3 1 2 a2 o and mbr as shown in fig s5 all the samples at different depths of the reactors have similar number of molecular formulae except for two samples a2 3 m and o 3 m of slightly less number to further explore the molecular dissimilarity of dom sampled from different depths bray curtis dissimilarity plots based on relative ft icr ms signal intensities were performed zark and dittmar 2018 and the highest dissimilarity only 23 12 was observed between the samples of a2 0 m and a2 6 m fig s6 overall the sample depth did not exert significant effect on the dom composition in the following discussion all the analysis of kmd plots were based on the samples at 0 m depth the anaerobic unit a1 could effectively decrease the doc and acute toxicity with the efficiency of 45 89 and 26 53 respectively which is similar to the treatment of petrochemical wastewater wu et al 2016 during anaerobic treatment the number of newly produced homologous carboxylic acids accounted for 19 97 of the total compounds with mw mainly distributed in the range of 550 and those completely removed accounted for 7 22 fig s7a and table s6 in addition after a1 treatment a slight increase both in suva254 and dbewa was observed from table 1 possibly because of the formation of higher aromatic dom and the preferential removal of less aromatic ones maizel and remucal 2017 comparatively the anoxic oxic and mbr units did not play significant role in dom transformation for instance the oxic unit a2 only produced 4 30 of the homologous carboxylic acids while the shared ones increased from 72 81 in a1 to 90 74 in a2 figs s7a b s8c d and table s6 besides there was no significant changes of doc concentration and spectral indexes in anoxic and oxic units the above results implied that the rationality of the combined process should be revisited for the sake of operational cost and efficiency in addition the transformation of dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop in different units was characterized at molecular level as illustrated in fig s9a the chemodiversity the total number of molecular formulae of don was similar to dom in fig s5 in terms of dop the total number and dissimilarity of molecular formulae were relatively high in anaerobic stage and low in oxic stage possibly caused by the phosphorus release during the anaerobic unit and absorption during the oxic unit figs s9b and s11 sorm et al 1997 zeng et al 2011 furthermore the molecular dissimilarity of don dop and the coexisting molecular formulae in the samples of s5 s19 increased along the process figs s10 12 3 1 3 uf and ro uf and ro units are widely used for advanced treatment of wastewater in this study uf treatment resulted in 2615 formulae of the mbr effluent removed with the doc drop by 19 2 with the residual one of mw mainly below 580 fig 2 and fig s7 some dom with mw around 600 cannot be completely removed by uf membrane because its efficiency is not only related to the mw of dom but to the composition of dom e g the number of nitrogen and oxygen cortes francisco et al 2014 ro is a robust unit as the terminal step for reuse of reclaimed water which can separate almost all the dom 135 formulae residual only cations and anions from uf effluent resulting in the drop of doc by 94 6 fig s7 and table s2 note that after both membrane units mw of the dom and acute toxicity dropped down simultaneously table 1 3 2 molecule centered correlations with spectral indexes and acute toxicity based on the identified formulae by ft icr ms 1982 molecular formulae coexisting in 15 samples s5 s19 were used for correlation analysis with their composition and distribution illustrated in fig s13 most dom was composed by cho with mw below 540 90 meanwhile they were mainly phenolic and highly unsaturated aliphatic compounds according to the classification criteria of the modified aromaticity index aimod text s4 sum normalized peak intensities were correlated to spectral indexes and acute toxicity with regard to suva254 e2 e3 bix and acute toxicity their correlation with the molecular composition of dom are visually presented in fig 5 as seen polyphenols and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were positively correlated with suva254 whereas aliphatic compounds were negatively correlated with suva254 fig 5a in general dom with lower h c was associated with high suva254 whereas the higher h c one was associated with lower suva254 which is consistent with the results from previous studies kellerman et al 2015 2018 maizel et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017 in addition those positively correlated with e2 e3 were negatively correlated with suva254 and vice versa fig 5a and b therefore dom of higher aromaticity usually have relatively lower mw for the correlation of bix less molecules n 293 of remarkable correlation were compared molecules that were positively associated with bix mainly included polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenolic compounds with the o c ratio ranging from 0 39 to 0 80 indicating their strong autogenetic source characteristics fig 5c those of negative correlation with bix should be recalcitrant to biodegradation in addition 16 9 of the molecules presented a significantly positive correlation with acute toxicity mainly including polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenols 0 32 o c 0 63 as well as aliphatic compounds 0 22 o c 0 56 which should be particularly concerned in viewpoint of the environmental risk of cipww effluent no negatively correlated points are observed in the plot for acute toxicity fig 5d considering the theoretical concentration toxicity relationship as for elemental composition of the correlated molecules in fig 5 they could be represented by cho chon and chos molecules principally 3 3 pairwise correlations between spectral indexes molecular level parameters and acute toxicity the relationships between spectral indexes molecular level parameters and acute toxicity were determined by pearson product moment correlation which are visually depicted by the color correlograms in fig 6 the results showed that suva254 was positively associated with o cwa dbewa and noscwa whereas negatively associated with h cwa similar to the results from previous study weishaar et al 2003 suva254 usually serves as a surrogate measurement for dom aromaticity in drinking water and it seems applicable in the integrated cipww furthermore the four indexes suva254 o cwa dbewa and noscwa were positively correlated with each other except for h cwa which was negatively correlated with others thus we assume that the five indexes can be used to reflect the unsaturation degree of dom and those of higher suva254 o cwa dbewa and or noscwa and lower h cwa have higher degree of unsaturation and vice versa in addition e2 e3 was negatively associated with mwwa similar to the results obtained from water bodies e g natural water wastewater fasching et al 2014 maizel and remucal 2017 in addition hix was positively associated with o cwa and negatively correlated with e2 e3 bix was positively associated with e2 e3 and negatively associated with suva254 fi was positively correlated with suva254 dbewa and noscwa while negatively correlated with e2 e3 and h cwa apparently the correlation of eem indexes with others could favor the better understanding of the dom properties furthermore the acute toxicity was positively correlated with hix o cwa and dbewa implying those of higher unsaturation degree may display higher acute toxicity such pairwise correlations revealed herein can help to utilize some simple and readily available indexes e g suva254 hix to predict the complicated and time consuming ones e g dbewa acute toxicity the above correlation analysis between molecular level parameters spectral indexes and acute toxicity may help better understand the dom properties from a systematic viewpoint however a few limitations still need to be considered first ppl cartridge cannot extract all the dom compounds of a given sample and thus only the extractable molecules could be determined by ft icr ms for data analysis second not all the dom formulae are detectable by esi ft icr ms in negative mode which is greatly dependent upon their ionization efficiency and ion suppression herzsprung et al 2012 wang et al 2017 in spite of the above issues ft icr ms is a powerful tool to reveal the chemical composition of a complex system of concern like authentic wastewater and natural water samples 4 conclusions in the present study the molecular transformation of dom during full scale treatment of integrated cipww in a cwwtp were characterized by esi ft icr ms uv vis and fluorescence spectrometry and acute toxicity test dom of the cipww samples along the combined process ha fp a2 o mbr uf ro was mainly cho compounds and rich in heteroatoms featuring higher unsaturation degree lower mw and higher acute toxicity than municipal wastewater the units of ha and a1 are capable of degrading dom and reducing acute toxicity simultaneously with great changes in dom molecular composition however other units of fp a2 o and mbr did not play significant role in dom transformation the terminal units of uf and ro can remove almost all dom and inorganic salts resulting in the drop of doc by 19 2 and 94 6 respectively in addition molecule centered correlations indicated that acute toxicity was positively correlated with polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenols 0 32 o c 0 63 as well as aliphatic compounds 0 22 o c 0 56 and dom positively correlated with suva254 displayed negative correlation with e2 e3 the pairwise correlation analysis illustrated that suva254 o cwa dbewa and noscwa were positively correlated with each other and h c was negatively correlated with the four indexes in addition e2 e3 was negatively associated with mwwa and acute toxicity was positively correlated with hix o cwa and dbewa this study can shed new light on how to predict the complex and difficultly measured indexes of wastewater samples using the simple and rapidly available ones acknowledgments this study was financially supported from natural science

18873,as one of the key economic modes in china chemical industry park cip has made great contribution to the chinese rapid economic growth concomitantly how to effectively and safely dispose of the cip wastewater cipww has been an unavoidable issue molecular transformation of dissolved organic matter dom in cipww treatment is essential to optimize the employed process and to provide solid basis for risk evaluation of the discharged effluent as well in this study electrospray ionization coupled with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms was used to characterize the molecular transformation of dom during full scale treatment of integrated chemical wastewater in a centralized wastewater treatment plant cwwtp where the combined process follows hydrolysis acidification ha flocculation precipitation fp a2 o membrane bioreactor mbr ultrafiltration uf reverse osmosis ro compared to municipal wastewater dom in cipww exhibited higher unsaturation degree lower molecular weight and higher toxicity in fp unit dom of c 24 and higher nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc values was preferentially removed the ha and anaerobic units are capable of significantly degrading dom resulting in great changes in molecular composition of dom however the anoxic oxic and mbr units only lead to a slight change of the molecular formulae the terminal units of uf and ro can remove most dom with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc declining by 19 2 and 94 6 respectively the correlation between spectral indexes and acute toxicity with the molecular formulae of dom suggested that polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenols were positively correlated with the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 in addition both compounds 0 32 o c 0 63 as well as the aliphatic ones 0 22 o c 0 56 presented positive correlation with acute toxicity further the pairwise correlation analysis illustrated that suva254 o cwa double bond equivalence dbewa and noscwa were positively correlated with each other whereas the acute toxicity was positively correlated with humification index hix o cwa and dbewa graphical abstract image 1 keywords chinese

opening policies chemical industry parks cips have gradually turned to be one of the main economic modes in china in 2012 there were 1185 cips distributed in almost all the provinces of china supporting information si fig s1 xu et al 2014 cips have greatly promoted the development of chinese economy however the trade off between the economic contribution of cips and their environmental impact has gained increasing concern cip is a major source of industrial pollution with the discharge amount and intensity much higher than the decentralized industries hu et al 2019 mao et al 2012 from 2011 to 2015 the industrial wastewater discharged in china remained at 20 billion tons annually of which chemical industry accounted for 20 fig s2 to respond to such urgent situation it is indispensable to effectively treat the wastewater from cips for water reuse or safe discharge into the receiving bodies currently a common model has been developed and widely employed in china cips that is pretreatment of highly contaminated waste effluents in each enterprise in cips followed by collection form integrated chemical industry park wastewater cipww for advanced treatment in centralized wastewater treatment plant cwwtp zhu et al 2015 cipww is usually featured by one or more of the following characteristics large yield high organic matter loadings high salinity poor biodegradation and high toxicity guo et al 2019 li et al 2011 long et al 2018 ma et al 2016 wu et al 2016 zhu et al 2015 the widely used technologies in cwwtp include biological techniques e g hydrolysis acidification a2 o membrane bioreactor oxidation ditch li et al 2015a ma et al 2016 wu et al 2016 physical chemical techniques e g flocculation precipitation membrane separation weng et al 2018 yen et al 2017 and chemical techniques e g fenton ozonation wen et al 2018 generally for a given cwwtp a combined process including physicochemical and biological units is usually proposed in full scale treatment depending on the properties of cipww and the final goal of the treatment discharge or water reuse particularly the transformation of dissolved organic matter dom should be concerned during cipww treatment which is crucial to optimize the combined process currently several spectral methods have been widely employed to characterize the dom properties and its transformation during water treatment including ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy based on the above methods aromaticity molecular weight mw humification degree recent autochthonous contribution and other information on dom could be well available fasching et al 2014 huguet et al 2009 lavonen et al 2015 maizel and remucal 2017 weishaar et al 2003 zhang et al 2012 however they are incompetent for directly identifying dom at molecular level on the other side toxicity tests e g acute toxicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity have been conducted to evaluate the toxicity changes during various treatments of municipal wastewater or industrial wastewater dong et al 2017 kohler et al 2006 ma et al 2018 mišík et al 2011 however the molecular level understanding of cipww associated with the toxicity evaluation is still unclear gaining the molecular level information of cipww is believed to consolidate the base to better understand the combined process and to identify the most likely toxic compounds of the discharged effluent as well very recently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms coupled with electrospray ionization esi has been employed to provide the unambiguously molecular formulae in the complex dom matrices due to the unprecedented ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy he et al 2016 li et al 2016 ohno et al 2010 osterholz et al 2015 wang et al 2017 currently this robust analytical tool has been successfully used to characterize dom composition and or transformation in a variety of environmental samples including river water wagner et al 2015 lake water kellerman et al 2014 cloud water bianco et al 2018 municipal wastewater tseng et al 2013 landfill leachate yuan et al 2017 soil li et al 2018 and smoke particles song et al 2018 all the above study suggested that ft icr ms is a powerful tool to characterize the dom transformation during cipww treatment however very few studies are available on the industrial wastewaters hu et al 2017 li et al 2015b and to the best of our knowledge no reference is available on the integrated cipww particularly the pairwise relationships between the molecular information acute toxicity and the easily available spectral indexes of the wastewater samples which are believed to deeply understand the molecular basis of the latter indexes have not been reported in this study we collected 21 samples throughout a cwwtp and employed ft icr ms to characterize the molecular composition and transformation of dom during full scale treatment of cipww which could be used to identify the contribution of each unit of the combined process meanwhile spectral indexes and acute toxicity were correlated with molecular formulae of dom further we established the pairwise relationships between molecular level parameters spectral indexes and acute toxicity of the samples for the first time this study revealed the transformation behavior of dom from cipww and the correlations of different indexes with molecular information also this study helps to provide fundamental guidance to improve and optimize the combined process of the cwwtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation the test wastewater was sampled from a typical cwwtp located in taixing city jiangsu province of china where influent 15000 m3 d included the mixed effluents from 100 pharmaceutical and chemical enterprises in the cip pretreatment of each effluent was strictly required cod 500 mg l before flowing into the cwwtp after being pretreated by hydrolysis acidification ha and flocculation precipitation fp the industrial effluent was mixed with the municipal wastewater 25000 m3 d to improve the biodegradability and the mixture was subject to sequent anaerobic anoxic oxic a1 a2 o a2 o and membrane bioreactor mbr treatments then 40 of the mbr effluent was further treated by ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro for reclaiming the used water and the others were discharged twenty one aqueous samples each 3 5 l were collected in the cwwtp to characterize the dom composition and transformation with the sampling points described in fig 1 the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane supor pall and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 c for further experiments 2 2 analytical methods all the filtered samples were analyzed in terms of dissolved organic carbon doc ph conductivity cations and anions uv vis full wavelength scan spectra were recorded by an uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was calculated by dividing the absorbance at 254 nm uv254 by doc concentration and e2 e3 was the ratio of absorbance at 250 nm and 365 nm berggren et al 2007 weishaar et al 2003 eem spectra were recorded by a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 humification index hix was calculated by dividing the peak area of the emission wavelengths between 435 and 480 nm by that between 300 and 345 nm both at the excitation wavelength at 254 nm huguet et al 2009 kamjunke et al 2015 biological index bix was calculated at the excitation wavelength of 310 nm by dividing the emission intensity at 380 and 430 nm he et al 2016 kellerman et al 2015 fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of emission intensity at 450 nm and 500 nm under the excitation wavelength of 370 nm mcknight et al 2001 the procedures for all the above analysis were detailed in si text s1 2 3 solid phase extraction solid phase extraction was performed to help further characterize dom of the samples based on the previous study dittmar et al 2008 in brief samples were firstly acidified by hydrochloric acid to ph 2 to improve the recovery of phenolic and carboxylic matter sandron et al 2015 then the acidified samples 100 1000 ml depending on their doc concentration were pumped at 5 ml min through the agilent bond elut ppl cartridges 1 g 6 ml as pre activated with 15 ml methanol hplc grade and 15 ml acidified ultrapure water ph 2 subsequently the cartridges were rinsed with 30 ml acidified ultrapure water to remove the residual salts and dom in the cartridges was eluted by 15 ml hplc methanol the extraction efficiencies in terms of doc of the samples fell in the range of 54 8 79 1 for ft icr ms analysis the 100 μl dom elution was added into 1 ml 50 50 methanol water v v for dilution for acute toxicity test the residual elution 14 9 ml was dried under a nitrogen flow then the dried samples were dissolved in 1 ml 10 dimethylsulfoxide dmso all samples were stored at 20 c in the dark before analysis 2 4 acute toxicity test luminescent bacteria photobacterium t3 purchased from nanjing institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences in the form of freeze dried powder 0 50 g in ampoule bottle was used to test the acute toxicity of dom in different samples through the luminescence inhibition rate bacteria in the ampoule bottle were resuscitated using 1 ml nacl 2 5 and the 10 μl bacteria solution was added into 2 ml samples diluted by 3 nacl and stood for 10 min the luminosity was measured by a biological toxicity analyzer dxy 3 nanjing institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences acute toxicity of dom was expressed by mercury hg toxicity equivalents china epa 1995 weng et al 2018 the blank of 3 nacl and 2 dmso was used as control and each sample was measured in triplicate 2 5 esi ft icr ms analysis a bruker solarix ft icr ms equipped with a 15 0 t superconducting magnet and an esi source was used to characterize the molecular composition of dom samples the extracted samples were continuously injected into the esi source at 120 μl h using a syringe pump and analyzed in negative ionization mode the esi needle voltage and the mass range were set at 3 8 kv and m z 180 1000 da respectively ionized substances of the samples were accumulated in the hexapole ion trap for 0 2 s before being imported into the icr cell four m 32 bit data points were recorded per broadband mass scan and a data set of 150 scans were accumulated in each spectrum each sample was measured in duplicate to prevent the cross contamination of the neighbor samples 50 50 methanol water v v was used to wash the injection syringe and lines three times between the consecutive operation methanol and ppl blank samples were analyzed as the control the instrument was externally calibrated using 10 mm sodium formate solution and the mass spectra were internally recalibrated using a known homologous series of the natural organic matter the entire mass spectra error was less than 0 15 ppm after internal recalibration all formulae were calculated by bruker dataanalysis software version 4 0 and matlab routines kujawinski and behn 2006 kujawinski and longnecker 2016 only the peaks with the signal to noise s n ratio 10 were considered elemental combinations of molecular formulae were set to the criteria of 12c1 100 13c0 1 1h1 100 16o0 50 14n0 10 32s0 4 31p0 2 35cl0 2 and the mass error between the measured and calculated mw was controlled less than 1 ppm elemental ratios of 0 33 h c 2 25 and 0 o c 1 0 were employed to further restrict the formula calculation chance et al 2018 hao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and other elemental restrictions were detailed in si text s2 only molecular formulae coexisting in duplicate were considered to guarantee the reproducibility and reliability of the detection lv et al 2018 riedel and dittmar 2014 and the formulae from the methanol and ppl blank were subtracted 2 6 data analysis molecule centered correlations with spectral indexes and acute toxicity were assessed using spearman rank correlation coefficients which were calculated between spectral indexes acute toxicity and the sum normalized intensity of peaks coexisting in 15 selected samples s5 s19 kellerman et al 2014 li et al 2018 then van krevelen diagrams were visually plotted for each index pearson product moment correlation was used to calculate the pairwise correlations between spectral indexes molecular level parameters and acute toxicity and the results were present as figures generated by the package corrgram in r software lucas et al 2016 false discovery rate fdr was used to correct multiple comparison of large number tests aimed at controlling the fraction of type i errors without unnecessarily increasing the risk of type ii errors benjamini and hochberg 1995 kellerman et al 2014 both p values of spearman and pearson correlation were set at a significant level of p 0 05 and the process was performed in r software using package hmisc additional data analysis was detailed in si text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of dom along the full scale treatment as shown in table 1 and s1 2 compared to municipal wastewater primary effluent mwpe the industrial wastewater primary effluent iwpe was featured with relatively higher doc concentration lower mw higher nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc an index for redox potential of a given formula higher salinity and higher toxicity herein van krevelen diagrams were used to characterize the molecular composition of dom in different units of the combined process with the classification criteria listed in table s3 wu et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the total number of dom formulae dropped down following the unit sequence of the process except for ha especially in the uf and ro processes to further compare the composition of different unit samples the relative abundance plots were depicted on the basis of nine formula classes and eight compound classes fig 3 and tables s4 5 as observed the major substances of all the samples were cho formulae 28 15 45 54 for mwpe the proportion of chon formulae 39 50 was close to cho formulae 39 54 higher than industrial wastewater samples dom of the samples was rich in heteroatoms e g n s p and cl with the proportion of 54 46 63 22 except for ro higher than the river samples at 37 2 56 6 wagner et al 2015 on the other side all the samples were dominated by lignin 38 52 64 73 furthermore the kernel based cumulative density plots violin plots were applied to visualize the distribution of mw and nosc as seen from fig s3 the changes before and after ha and membrane separation uf and ro units were more significant than the bio units a2 o and mbr to further explore the similarity of the samples to each other hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed based on the spectral indexes and molecular level parameters in table 1 hca results indicated that the uf and ro effluents displayed high similarity and could be classified as one group which is distinct from all the other samples another group fig s4a principle component analysis pca was used to determine which variables were responsible for the groupings using the same data as hca sleighter et al 2010 as shown in fig s4b the first principle component pc1 used to reflect the unsaturation of dom samples could contribute to 46 21 of the variance among the samples samples of high unsaturation e g high double bond equivalence dbewa suva254 and o cwa displayed positive pc1 scores while those of high saturation e g high h cwa displayed negative pc1 ones the second principle component pc2 correlated with the mw contributed to 28 39 of the variance samples of high mw had negative pc2 scores while those of low mw e g high e2 e3 had positive pc2 ones as a result the ro effluent low unsaturation and low mw was distributed in the upper left of the pc1 pc2 plot whilst mwpe low unsaturation and high mw was in the lower left and iwpe high unsaturation scattering in the right side fig s4b from spectral indexes table 1 one can see that suva254 of industrial wastewater ranges from 2 88 to 3 68 l mgc 1m 1 and the corresponding e2 e3 ranges from 4 90 to 8 62 comparatively municipal wastewater has lower suva254 and e2 e3 negatively correlated with mw values 0 68 l mgc 1m 1 and 5 62 implying dom in industrial wastewater featured higher aromaticity and lower mw berggren et al 2007 dehaan 1993 weishaar et al 2003 hix values an indicator of the humification extent were all around 4 expect for uf and ro suggesting that dom in aqueous samples were mainly produced by microorganisms and of low humification extent huguet et al 2009 bix that reflects the recent autochthonous contribution of dom was approximately 0 9 expect for mwpe and ro indicating that the samples displayed strong autogenetic source characteristics he et al 2016 fi was developed to evaluate the source of dom and most of its values around 1 9 except for the mwpe and ro samples implied that dom of most samples mainly came from the metabolic process of aquatic organisms while that of the mwpe sample was mainly derived from terrestrial source with the fi value around 1 4 fasching et al 2014 mcknight et al 2001 in the following subsections detailed analysis on every unit will be performed to reveal its impact of dom transformation 3 1 1 ha and fp after ha the mwwa dropped down from 423 47 da to 414 17 da table 1 indicating that dom with higher mw was degraded into lower ones via hydrolysis process simultaneously the noscwa drop from 0 988 to 0 378 indicated that ha can decrease the oxidability of carbonaceous organic matter via acidification process similar changes can be observed from the overall distribution of mw and nosc in fig s3 further kendrick mass defect kmd plot was adopted to characterize dom transformation of ha numerous homologues series of dom formulae that differ by several carboxyl groups are distributed on the same horizontal line as intuitively listed in fig 4 note that after ha treatment large amount of homologous carboxylic acids was produced with n cooh 1737 nearly twice of the virgin one fig 4a indicating acidogenic bacteria played an important role in this process generally the results based on molecular level analysis are consistent with the ha nature chen et al 2007 ucisik and henze 2008 meanwhile ha plays an important role in acute toxicity reduction by 30 3 after ha treatment ferrous sulfate solution feso4 7h2o 20 was used as coagulant in fp as observed in fig 4b for the same homologues series the dom formulae with more ch2 groups were mainly distributed in the right of the kmd ch2 plot and the more ch2 groups the smaller nosc the results showed that 226 homologous ch2 compounds with c 24 and higher nosc values blue dots was completely removed by fp similar conclusion has been proposed in previous study yuan et al 2017 however doc value dropped slightly in this process because of the low relative peak intensities corresponding to semi quantitative concentration with 10 5 order of magnitude of the removed compounds 3 1 2 a2 o and mbr as shown in fig s5 all the samples at different depths of the reactors have similar number of molecular formulae except for two samples a2 3 m and o 3 m of slightly less number to further explore the molecular dissimilarity of dom sampled from different depths bray curtis dissimilarity plots based on relative ft icr ms signal intensities were performed zark and dittmar 2018 and the highest dissimilarity only 23 12 was observed between the samples of a2 0 m and a2 6 m fig s6 overall the sample depth did not exert significant effect on the dom composition in the following discussion all the analysis of kmd plots were based on the samples at 0 m depth the anaerobic unit a1 could effectively decrease the doc and acute toxicity with the efficiency of 45 89 and 26 53 respectively which is similar to the treatment of petrochemical wastewater wu et al 2016 during anaerobic treatment the number of newly produced homologous carboxylic acids accounted for 19 97 of the total compounds with mw mainly distributed in the range of 550 and those completely removed accounted for 7 22 fig s7a and table s6 in addition after a1 treatment a slight increase both in suva254 and dbewa was observed from table 1 possibly because of the formation of higher aromatic dom and the preferential removal of less aromatic ones maizel and remucal 2017 comparatively the anoxic oxic and mbr units did not play significant role in dom transformation for instance the oxic unit a2 only produced 4 30 of the homologous carboxylic acids while the shared ones increased from 72 81 in a1 to 90 74 in a2 figs s7a b s8c d and table s6 besides there was no significant changes of doc concentration and spectral indexes in anoxic and oxic units the above results implied that the rationality of the combined process should be revisited for the sake of operational cost and efficiency in addition the transformation of dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic phosphorus dop in different units was characterized at molecular level as illustrated in fig s9a the chemodiversity the total number of molecular formulae of don was similar to dom in fig s5 in terms of dop the total number and dissimilarity of molecular formulae were relatively high in anaerobic stage and low in oxic stage possibly caused by the phosphorus release during the anaerobic unit and absorption during the oxic unit figs s9b and s11 sorm et al 1997 zeng et al 2011 furthermore the molecular dissimilarity of don dop and the coexisting molecular formulae in the samples of s5 s19 increased along the process figs s10 12 3 1 3 uf and ro uf and ro units are widely used for advanced treatment of wastewater in this study uf treatment resulted in 2615 formulae of the mbr effluent removed with the doc drop by 19 2 with the residual one of mw mainly below 580 fig 2 and fig s7 some dom with mw around 600 cannot be completely removed by uf membrane because its efficiency is not only related to the mw of dom but to the composition of dom e g the number of nitrogen and oxygen cortes francisco et al 2014 ro is a robust unit as the terminal step for reuse of reclaimed water which can separate almost all the dom 135 formulae residual only cations and anions from uf effluent resulting in the drop of doc by 94 6 fig s7 and table s2 note that after both membrane units mw of the dom and acute toxicity dropped down simultaneously table 1 3 2 molecule centered correlations with spectral indexes and acute toxicity based on the identified formulae by ft icr ms 1982 molecular formulae coexisting in 15 samples s5 s19 were used for correlation analysis with their composition and distribution illustrated in fig s13 most dom was composed by cho with mw below 540 90 meanwhile they were mainly phenolic and highly unsaturated aliphatic compounds according to the classification criteria of the modified aromaticity index aimod text s4 sum normalized peak intensities were correlated to spectral indexes and acute toxicity with regard to suva254 e2 e3 bix and acute toxicity their correlation with the molecular composition of dom are visually presented in fig 5 as seen polyphenols and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were positively correlated with suva254 whereas aliphatic compounds were negatively correlated with suva254 fig 5a in general dom with lower h c was associated with high suva254 whereas the higher h c one was associated with lower suva254 which is consistent with the results from previous studies kellerman et al 2015 2018 maizel et al 2017 maizel and remucal 2017 in addition those positively correlated with e2 e3 were negatively correlated with suva254 and vice versa fig 5a and b therefore dom of higher aromaticity usually have relatively lower mw for the correlation of bix less molecules n 293 of remarkable correlation were compared molecules that were positively associated with bix mainly included polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenolic compounds with the o c ratio ranging from 0 39 to 0 80 indicating their strong autogenetic source characteristics fig 5c those of negative correlation with bix should be recalcitrant to biodegradation in addition 16 9 of the molecules presented a significantly positive correlation with acute toxicity mainly including polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenols 0 32 o c 0 63 as well as aliphatic compounds 0 22 o c 0 56 which should be particularly concerned in viewpoint of the environmental risk of cipww effluent no negatively correlated points are observed in the plot for acute toxicity fig 5d considering the theoretical concentration toxicity relationship as for elemental composition of the correlated molecules in fig 5 they could be represented by cho chon and chos molecules principally 3 3 pairwise correlations between spectral indexes molecular level parameters and acute toxicity the relationships between spectral indexes molecular level parameters and acute toxicity were determined by pearson product moment correlation which are visually depicted by the color correlograms in fig 6 the results showed that suva254 was positively associated with o cwa dbewa and noscwa whereas negatively associated with h cwa similar to the results from previous study weishaar et al 2003 suva254 usually serves as a surrogate measurement for dom aromaticity in drinking water and it seems applicable in the integrated cipww furthermore the four indexes suva254 o cwa dbewa and noscwa were positively correlated with each other except for h cwa which was negatively correlated with others thus we assume that the five indexes can be used to reflect the unsaturation degree of dom and those of higher suva254 o cwa dbewa and or noscwa and lower h cwa have higher degree of unsaturation and vice versa in addition e2 e3 was negatively associated with mwwa similar to the results obtained from water bodies e g natural water wastewater fasching et al 2014 maizel and remucal 2017 in addition hix was positively associated with o cwa and negatively correlated with e2 e3 bix was positively associated with e2 e3 and negatively associated with suva254 fi was positively correlated with suva254 dbewa and noscwa while negatively correlated with e2 e3 and h cwa apparently the correlation of eem indexes with others could favor the better understanding of the dom properties furthermore the acute toxicity was positively correlated with hix o cwa and dbewa implying those of higher unsaturation degree may display higher acute toxicity such pairwise correlations revealed herein can help to utilize some simple and readily available indexes e g suva254 hix to predict the complicated and time consuming ones e g dbewa acute toxicity the above correlation analysis between molecular level parameters spectral indexes and acute toxicity may help better understand the dom properties from a systematic viewpoint however a few limitations still need to be considered first ppl cartridge cannot extract all the dom compounds of a given sample and thus only the extractable molecules could be determined by ft icr ms for data analysis second not all the dom formulae are detectable by esi ft icr ms in negative mode which is greatly dependent upon their ionization efficiency and ion suppression herzsprung et al 2012 wang et al 2017 in spite of the above issues ft icr ms is a powerful tool to reveal the chemical composition of a complex system of concern like authentic wastewater and natural water samples 4 conclusions in the present study the molecular transformation of dom during full scale treatment of integrated cipww in a cwwtp were characterized by esi ft icr ms uv vis and fluorescence spectrometry and acute toxicity test dom of the cipww samples along the combined process ha fp a2 o mbr uf ro was mainly cho compounds and rich in heteroatoms featuring higher unsaturation degree lower mw and higher acute toxicity than municipal wastewater the units of ha and a1 are capable of degrading dom and reducing acute toxicity simultaneously with great changes in dom molecular composition however other units of fp a2 o and mbr did not play significant role in dom transformation the terminal units of uf and ro can remove almost all dom and inorganic salts resulting in the drop of doc by 19 2 and 94 6 respectively in addition molecule centered correlations indicated that acute toxicity was positively correlated with polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenols 0 32 o c 0 63 as well as aliphatic compounds 0 22 o c 0 56 and dom positively correlated with suva254 displayed negative correlation with e2 e3 the pairwise correlation analysis illustrated that suva254 o cwa dbewa and noscwa were positively correlated with each other and h c was negatively correlated with the four indexes in addition e2 e3 was negatively associated with mwwa and acute toxicity was positively correlated with hix o cwa and dbewa this study can shed new light on how to predict the complex and difficultly measured indexes of wastewater samples using the simple and rapidly available ones acknowledgments this study was financially supported from natural science

18874,this article reports a study of five designs of vinasse biorefineries that incorporate anaerobic bioreactors followed by a concentration technology such as evaporation reverse osmosis or forward osmosis different techniques of draw solution regeneration evaporation reverse osmosis and membrane distillation were also analyzed exergy analysis a method that evaluates the resource conversion efficiency of systems was used to compare the alternatives the results indicated that among the alternatives analyzed the combination of anaerobic digestion and reverse osmosis presented the highest exergy efficiency 62 however evaporators were the most feasible in terms of costs both alternatives are interesting and the final choice depends on the technology available and local economy in any case the treatment of 491 76 m3 h of vinasse exergy rate of 60513 8 kw to recover 70 of water could reduce external water requirement by 66 and generate 28 additional electricity for the sugarcane plant in this case the water recovery could represent an economy of 8 490 435 76 usd year for the brazilian alcohol industry graphical abstract image 1 keywords vinasse biorefinery resource recovery

employing technologies to convert materials previously considered waste into more valuable products such as biofuels and energy mo and zhang 2013 depending on the by product used it is possible to reclaim nitrogen phosphorus fibers acids and heat among other valuable products in general energy nutrients and water are the three main resource recovery targets guest et al 2009 the benefits of resource recovery include reduction in the extraction of natural resources and production of cleaner energies associated with proper disposal of waste however the challenge is to find or improve processes and technological routes to obtain resources efficiently fernández arévalo et al 2017 a sugarcane plant is a clear example of a biorefinery since energy is produced by burning bagasse a by product of the industrial process in cogeneration systems with profitable outcomes dantas et al 2013 brazil s primary energy sources are fossil fuels hydroelectric power plants and the sugarcane industry the latter accounting for 9 of the electricity supply unica 2018 vinasse is a by product that might improve the energy potential of sugarcane plants and the brazilian energy matrix it is a liquid obtained from the distillation of alcohol it comprises water as its main constituent as well as mineral nutrients and organic matter which make it a suitable raw material for resource recovery however factories have not yet fully explored this potential carpio and souza 2017 vinasse is currently used in fertigation since it supplies water and essential nutrients for sugarcane plants although such a practical approach requires lower investment in comparison with other soil treatments it entails significant expenses pertaining to by product transportation and distribution in the field moreover the long term application of high volumes of vinasse might saturate the soil with minerals reduce its fertility potential and cause environmental problems in the long run rabelo et al 2015 thus the deposition of vinasse in soil and plantation is limited by the capacity of the soil to absorb its constituents researchers have worked on the development of technologies to recover resources from vinasse the most common methods are anaerobic digestion and concentration anaerobic digestion is a pathway to produce methane rich biogas and a nutrient rich supernatant fuess and garcia 2017 while concentration using evaporators and membrane processes produces water that is recycled into a concentrate with high content of nutrients and organic matter amaral et al 2016 however the incorporation of such technologies into a biorefinery requires an evaluation of various configurations to determine the one with the highest overall resource recovery exergy analysis emerges as a valuable tool in this type of study since it measures the sustainability of a system encompassing not only the quantity but also the quality of the input and output streams of the processes dincer and rosen 2013 exergy analysis has been employed to evaluate the efficiency of biorefineries in many studies aghbashlo et al 2018 used exergy analysis to investigate a lignocellulosic biorefinery annexed to a sugar mill for the simultaneous production of lactic acid and electricity using sugarcane bagasse and brown leaves as feedstock dogbe et al 2018 conducted an exergy analysis of the typical sugar mill production processes to identify inefficient components for improvement madeira et al 2017 analyzed the exergetic and economic efficiencies of biohydrogen production using cassava wastewater from a large scale plant lee et al 2017 analyzed a wastewater treatment plant integrated with a combined heat and power generation system using the exergy indicator thus exergy analysis is an efficient technique for analyzing a system s performance encompassing factors pertaining to environmental and ecological impact and sustainable development bilgen and sarikaya 2015 given the potential of vinasse as a source of energy water and nutrients the overall objective of this study was to evaluate distinct technologies in the design of vinasse biorefineries using exergy analysis to evaluate the best alternative focused on the recovery of resources 2 alternatives for the management of vinasse in sugarcane factories fertigation is commonly adopted as a viable alternative for vinasse disposal since it is simple and reduces the use of fertilizers however the continuous application of high volumes of the liquid causes lixiviation of the mineral elements and soil as well as groundwater contamination moore et al 2017 moreover storage transportation and application practices contribute to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and methane oliveira et al 2017 in general the amount of vinasse applied to the soil by fertigation is higher than the recommended dose and the large volumes of effluent produced entail high transportation costs tanker trucks are used to transport most of the vinasse therefore some industries adopt the practice of concentrating vinasse thereby decreasing its volume and recovering water for use in different applications rabelo et al 2015 evaporation has been employed as a method to decrease the volume of vinasse and hence expenditure pertaining to its transport pina et al 2017 however it requires a large amount of steam and is one of the operational units that consumes the most energy in industrial plants carvalho and silva 2011 recent studies have addressed the use of membrane processes such as reverse osmosis and forward osmosis for concentrating vinasse madaeni and zereshki 2010 in reverse osmosis hydraulic pressure is used as the driving force whereas forward osmosis is an osmotically driven process both processes employ some of the highest perm selective membranes a consequence of the dense film that constitutes their morphologies bogler et al 2017 the high amount of electricity required for separation limits the application of reverse osmosis the challenges in forward osmosis are the determination of suitable draw solutions to drive the transmembrane flux and the draw solution regeneration step required johnson et al 2018 several regeneration processes as evaporation reverse osmosis and membrane distillation which is an emerging process based on a temperature gradient created across a microporous hydrophobic membrane can be applied ali et al 2016 the choice of the appropriate method is crucial because it will determine the complexity and energy requirement of the system khayet 2011 membrane filtration usually requires less energy and smaller footprint than evaporators do however a common problem in this process is fouling when significant levels of solids and organic matter are present in the liquid feed anaerobic membrane bioreactors present a reasonable alternative in which the steps of biological treatment and concentration using membrane filtration technology can be combined in a single unit park et al 2015 anaerobic digestion is an efficient biological process for the removal of organic matter and adequate start up of the bioreactor and maintenance of the active biomass results in the generation of methane rich biogas del nery et al 2016 moreover the technical effectiveness of anaerobic digestion has been established and researchers have been working on its continuous improvement moraes et al 2015 evaporators membrane processes and anaerobic bioreactors are the technological alternatives considered in this research for vinasse handling in general they can solve fertigation related problems and also provide advantages such as improvement in the sustainability of the sugarcane industry promotion of water recycling and energy production 3 methodology five different configurations were considered for the design of a vinasse biorefinery aimed at recovering water nutrients and energy all alternatives include anaerobic digestion as the methane production pathway the difference among them lies in the concentration stage for water recycling and production of a nutrient enriched liquid to be directed to fertigation the alternatives are as follows alternative 1 a1 anaerobic digestion evaporation alternative 2 a2 anaerobic digestion reverse osmosis alternative 3 a3 anaerobic digestion forward osmosis evaporation alternative 4 a4 anaerobic digestion forward osmosis reverse osmosis alternative 5 a5 anaerobic digestion forward osmosis membrane distillation fig 1 shows the flowcharts representing each alternative the analyses of the flowcharts consist of material and energy balances followed by exergy analysis as presented in fig 2 which shows an outline of the study the concentrations of the components of vinasse used as data for the simulations were obtained from del nery et al 2018 and measurements were taken at the biological processes laboratory data for which is available in the supplementary material 3 1 mass and energy balances after the characterization of vinasse the material and energy balances were attained for each unit in a continuous and steady state regime as detailed in the supplementary material 3 1 1 anaerobic digestion the balances for anaerobic digestion were obtained for the mesophilic temperature range a storage tank for cooling vinasse from 353 15 k 80 c to 308 15 k 35 c was employed to bring the vinasse to a temperature within the recommended range for anaerobic digestion chernicharo 2007 the calculations for methanogenic nutritional requirement sludge production and generation of biogas in the anaerobic bioreactor were based on the methodology presented by chernicharo 2007 as detailed in the supplementary material sodium bicarbonate in a dosage of 0 3 g nahco3 g cod was used to adjust the ph of the reactor alves et al 2018 the organic removal efficiency was in range 60 80 according to the results of the experiments performed by barros et al 2017 barros et al 2016 and españa gamboa et al 2012 mathematical simulations were conducted by considering that the biogas was composed of methane 60 co2 34 9 i e approximately equal to the values presented by salomon and lora 2009 and h2s 0 1 and water vapor 5 as trace components durán et al 2018 nghiem et al 2017 a spark ignition engine as described by barrera et al 2016 was considered for the conversion of the chemical energy of biogas into electrical energy using a generator set according to barrera et al 2016 this technology can achieve electrical and thermal efficiencies of 41 and 46 based on the lower heating value respectively after balances for the anaerobic digestion unit were obtained the osmotic pressure of the anaerobic digestion effluent was estimated by the van t hoff equation atkins and paula 2010 1 π n r t v where π is the osmotic pressure of the solution kpa n is the number of moles in the solution mol r is the universal constant of the gases kj mol k t is the temperature k and v is the volume m³ 3 1 2 evaporation the study considered the traditional design of a multi effect evaporator with five effects the temperature of the first effect was 388 15 k 115 c and pressure was 1 69 105 pa the balances included analyses of the vapor and liquid streams for the purpose of simplification the thermodynamic properties of vinasse were assumed to be identical to those of water the calculation for a multi effect evaporator was based on the methodology proposed by foust et al 1960 and mccabe et al 1985 as described in the supplementary material evaporator balances in a sugarcane plant usually involve the brix indicator as a parameter to determine the concentration of solids contained in the solution therefore the brix index 1 g solute 100 g solution can express the total solid concentration in the liquid kimball 1991 3 1 3 reverse osmosis the water transmembrane flux in the reverse osmosis unit was calculated using eq 2 where jw is the transmembrane water flux m s a is the water permeability constant m2 s kg δp is the pressure gradient pa and δπ is the osmotic pressure gradient pa baker 2012 2 j w a δ p δ π the specific energy consumed kj m3 i e sec by the reverse osmosis unit was determined using eq 3 zhu et al 2009 3 s e c w p u m p v w a t e r p e r m where v water perm is the flowrate of water that permeates the membrane m³ s and w pump is the work done by the pump kw 3 1 4 forward osmosis the alternatives a3 a4 and a5 were designed using a process of forward osmosis combined with a method for regeneration of the draw solution at first nacl was regarded as a draw solution in the calculation phase since it is a well studied solution widely applied in the development of transmembrane flux models for forward osmosis in the balances for the forward osmosis unit the reverse flux in the membrane was considered as described in the model developed by suh and lee 2013 4 j s b c d s j s w e x p j s k j s w e x p j s j s w k c 0 j s w e x p j s j s w where js is the reverse flux mol m2s b is the solute permeability m s c ds is the concentration of the draw solution mol m3 k is the solute resistivity for diffusion within the support layer s m k is the mass transfer coefficient m s c0 is the concentration of the feed mol m3 and jsw refers to the ratio of the reverse draw solute flux to the water flux mol m3 suh and lee 2013 have detailed the model employed to represent the flux in forward osmosis no external energy is consumed in forward osmosis the flow is governed by the potential chemical difference between the draw solution and the feed the draw solution regeneration methods analyzed in this work are evaporation alternative a3 reverse osmosis a4 and membrane distillation a5 such technologies require some form of energy heat or electricity as input and this was determined to ensure total regeneration of the draw solution at a recovery rate of 50 the evaporation units in a1 and a3 differ in their feed and concentrate streams as follows a1 evaporator unit feed effluent of anaerobic digestion concentrate nutrient enriched liquid a3 evaporator unit feed diluted draw solution concentrate regenerated draw solution likewise the reverse osmosis units in a2 and a4 differ in their feed and concentrate streams as follows a2 reverse osmosis unit feed effluent of anaerobic digestion concentrate nutrient enriched liquid a4 reverse osmosis unit feed diluted draw solution concentrate regenerated draw solution 3 1 5 membrane distillation unlike evaporation and reverse osmosis which were used as the main concentration methods membrane distillation was considered only as a method of regeneration of the draw solution the set of equations to evaluate the process of membrane distillation was presented by jantaporn et al 2017 who derived the model to calculate the specific energy consumption of the process 3 2 exergy analysis vinasse biorefineries may use different configurations to achieve the same objective the exergy analysis was used to compare the technological configurations on the basis of overall efficiency the ambient temperature was chosen to meet 298 15 k 25 c and an atmospheric pressure of 101325 pa 1 atm as established by szargut 1989 and these are essential for the exergy calculation involved in the vinasse processing sequences studied in this work the advantage of this procedure is the comparison based on a single unambiguous quantifiable indicator in this case the answer can be obtained from process efficiencies within the immediate boundaries of the system rather than from environmental impacts on a global scale balkema et al 2002 after the mass and energy balances the exergy contents of the streams were calculated according to the classification in table 1 and by using the equations presented by ptasinski 2016 and tai et al 1986 table 2 the exergy efficiencies of the alternatives were then estimated and compared with each other 3 3 costs estimate a simplified cost analysis was performed based on widely known criteria for evaluating operation investments and financial business decisions npv irr and payback metrics table 3 zore et al 2018 the net present value npv is the present value of all expected cash flows an investment s internal rate of return irr is the discount rate that makes the present value of all expected future cash flows equal to zero the payback period for a project is the length of time it takes to get the money back peterson drake and fabozzi 2002 the cost estimate was based on the following assumptions interest rate of 6 amortized in a period of 20 years yangali quintanilla et al 2011 revenue comes from the sale of biogas energy the reuse of residual heat from sugarcane industry facilities streams was considered commercialization value of the energy generated from biogas usd104 84 mwh ministry of mines and energy 2018 adopted exchange rate brl 3 70 usd1 00 brazilian central bank 2019 the costs were updated to the 2019 base year according to the inflation rate based on the u s consumer price index cpi values official data foundation inflation calculator 2019 the values used in the cost calculations are listed in table 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of composition of the vinasse in the process the relationship between composition of the vinasse and its exergy content was observed from the characterization of the material supplementary material specific exergy of vinasse increases with the concentration of solids represented by brix and cod fig 3 emphasizing that the pollutant load reflects the deviation from the environment in contrast exergy content of vinasse diminishes as the percentage of water increases or concentration of solids diminishes the influence of vinasse composition in the exergy efficiency can be illustrated in table 5 which presents the effects of cod variation in exergy efficiency for the alternative 1 it was observed that the higher the cod of vinasse the greater the exergy efficiency this is because biogas production rises due to the greater amount of organic matter in the vinasse thus the efficiency of the anaerobic bioreactor can directly interfere in the subsequent concentration step for example fig 4 shows that the osmotic pressure diminishes with the increase in the organic removal as it refers to a decrease in the concentration of solids in the liquid this would facilitate the transmembrane flux of water requiring less potential of driving forces or even smaller areas of the membranes 4 2 analysis of the methane production pathway the following results were analyzed based on a scenario with operational conditions as follows 1 2 bx vinasse 70 kg vinasse s and 70 organic removal according to the diagram in fig 5 for the methane production pathway loss of low grade heat from vinasse in the storage tank accounted for 19 of the available energy exergy rate of 6028 kw the rate of exergy destroyed in this step was 1428 kw 4 bicarbonate accounted for only 0 31 of the total exergy input in the methane production pathway the anaerobic digestion effluent was the stream of higher exergy content i e 61 exergy rate of 14694 kw of the total the exergy efficiency of the anaerobic bioreactor was 87 a total of 13 exergy rate of 3346 kw of the exergy destruction is related to irreversibility of the process the biogas conversion unit accounted for 45 of exergy efficiency which is equivalent to the value presented by barrera et al 2016 the electrical and thermal conversion efficiencies of the spark ignition engine were 41 and 46 respectively therefore 12 exergy rate of 3101 kw of the exergy exits the system as energy 53 in the form of heat heat flowrate of 1639 8 kw and 47 in the form of electricity work transfer rate of 1461 6 kw the estimated exergy efficiency of the overall methane production pathway was 74 the efficiency of this stage can be enhanced by the use of heat from the storage tank and improvements in the technologies employed for conversion of biogas into energy 4 3 evaluation of the concentration methods fig 6 shows the diagrams of the concentration methods of each alternative 4 3 1 evaporator the exergy efficiency of the multi effect evaporator in a1 was 32 and the input heat exergy accounted for 68 of that of the low grade energy stream heat flowrate of 39253 kw exergy rate of 30720 kw the vapor exiting the system is an important source of heat and can be recycled back into the plant at an exergy rate content of 3414 kw the exergy rate of recovered water was 2481 kw and that of the nutrient enriched liquid was 8425 kw the system would require a heat flowrate of 43330 kw exergy rate of 35476 kw to achieve a dry solid concentration of 21 bx which is considered a suitable value by carvalho and silva 2011 in this case the removal of water achieved must be 88 thus resulting in an approximately 3 62 kg s concentrated nutrient enriched liquid stream 4 3 2 reverse osmosis the reverse osmosis unit in a2 showed an exergy efficiency of 73 and its electricity requirement of 218 kw represented 1 47 of the total exergy of the input resources the exergy destruction of 27 might be related to concentration polarization fouling formation and the intrinsic irreversibility of the process a membrane area of 14459 m2 was considered in this scenario 4 3 3 forward osmosis the area required for water recovery of 70 in forward osmosis was also 14459 m2 the draw solution input had an exergy rate content of 2539 kw and a flowrate of 176 39 m³ h the forward osmosis unit accounted for 77 of the exergy efficiency however when this technology was coupled with the regeneration methods the efficiency of the system was lower 4 3 4 regeneration methods when evaporation was employed for regeneration of the draw solution a3 the destroyed exergy of the concentration phase forward osmosis evaporation was 64 the exergy efficiencies of the evaporator unit and the total system were 23 and 38 respectively reverse osmosis as a method of regeneration a4 exhibited an exergy efficiency of 70 i e 3 lower than that of the reverse osmosis unit in a2 in this case membrane area of 2000 m2 was considered regeneration of the draw solution required more energy 2410 kw of electricity than did direct water reclamation from the anaerobic digestion effluent 218 kw of electricity the diluted draw solution flowrate 352 80 m³ h was higher than the anaerobic digestion effluent flowrate 234 54 m³ h the concentration method in a4 showed an exergy efficiency of 68 i e the process accounted for 32 of the destroyed exergy a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd module was incorporated in a5 moreover some preheating energy must be supplied to the feed to achieve the desired temperature i e 373 15 k at the module inlet jantaporn et al 2017 the specific energy consumption was 9 72 105 kj m3 277 20 kwh m3 and the input heat flowrate was 48898 kw which is equivalent to an exergy rate of 30788 kw the membrane distillation unit had an exergy efficiency of 14 the exergy efficiency of the concentration system of a5 forward osmosis membrane distillation was 28 accounting for 72 of the destroyed exergy 4 4 comparison of the alternatives as shown in fig 7 in general the alternatives that used heat as an input energy resource showed higher exergy requirements i e the alternatives that employed reverse osmosis a2 and a4 tended to demand less exergy the alternatives a2 reverse osmosis and a4 forward osmosis reverse osmosis showed higher exergy efficiencies 62 and 58 respectively and a5 forward osmosis membrane distillation showed the least 32 fig 8 shows the exergy efficiencies of the different alternatives including the methane production pathway and concentration method in a scenario of 70 kg s of vinasse and 70 organic matter removal fig 9 displays the relationship between total exergy efficiency and water recovery alternatives a2 reverse osmosis and a4 forward osmosis reverse osmosis showed similar exergy efficiencies to achieve water recovery of 70 the exergy efficiency of separation was 83 i e a minimum total exergy rate of 5491 40 kw was required for a partial separation of the components of vinasse although the forward osmosis unit is thermodynamically more favorable than other concentration technologies the regeneration of the draw solution makes the system less efficient such a statement was emphasized by mcgovern and lienhard 2014 who affirmed that reverse osmosis is significantly more energy efficient than forward osmosis due to the latter s theoretical and actual energy requirements for draw solution regeneration the appropriate operation of the process of forward osmosis depends on the choice of draw solution which must present high values of osmotic pressure in this study nacl e g seawater was considered because it is a widely applied solution provides high osmotic pressure and entails low costs however the cost of transporting seawater to sugarcane plants may hamper its use sucrose should also be considered as a draw solution since it is an abundant organic substance in the sugarcane industry on the other hand its osmotic pressure is lower than those of inorganic salts e g osmotic pressure of nacl 4 8 mpa and that of sucrose 2 4 mpa and its application as a solution requires further investigation johnson et al 2018 the results indicate that among the concentration technologies investigated membrane distillation showed the highest exergy destruction whereas forward osmosis was the most exergy efficient however a general analysis revealed that the alternatives a2 and a4 were the most interesting to recover water in terms of exergy efficiency in this case reverse osmosis appears to be the most suitable method of concentration it is a well known technology that can be coupled with biological processes to provide an interesting design for biorefineries if applied to the sugarcane industry it would use the surplus electricity generated from the combustion of bagasse or the burning of methane from anaerobic digestion 4 5 brief study of scenarios two scenarios were studied to simulate the implementation of a vinasse biorefinery comprising anaerobic bioreactor and reverse osmosis units in different types of sugarcane plants scenario 1 the vinasse biorefinery is annexed to an ethanol plant designed by palacios bereche et al 2013 scenario 2 the vinasse biorefinery is annexed to a sugar and alcohol plant presented by ensinas et al 2009 initially the exergy content values of the flowrates of sugarcane water withdrawal surplus energy alcohol production and vinasse in the plants were obtained from palacios bereche et al 2013 and ensinas et al 2009 subsequently the amount of electricity produced from biogas conversion energy consumed by the reverse osmosis unit and the amount of water reclaimed were calculated table 6 shows the exergy of the flowrates for the scenarios considered in scenario 1 if 70 344 23 m³ h of water is recovered by reverse osmosis the external water demand would decline by 66 the biogas produced in the anaerobic bioreactor would generate 6052 kw of electricity which represents a 28 increase in the energy available to the plant the energy requirement of the reverse osmosis unit would represent 1 57 of the surplus power obtained from the combustion of bagasse and biogas in scenario 2 the sugar and ethanol plant studied by ensinas et al 2009 produced less alcohol than did the alcohol factory evaluated by palacios bereche et al 2013 consequently less vinasse was generated and the amount of water available for recovery was also lower in this case the water from vinasse would reduce requirement from external sources by 22 114 41 m³ h of reclaimed water and the electricity generated by methane conversion would represent 12 of the surplus energy generated in the plant by burning bagasse the energy requirement of the reverse osmosis unit corresponded to 1 54 of the surplus energy 4 6 analysis by cost estimate the simplified costs estimates were effectuated for the previous scenarios table 7 shows the investment costs for each technology considered the cost of anaerobic digestion system including biogas cleaning was 1 94 usd m³ biogas produced amongst the concentration methods membrane distillation was the most expensive 4 67 usd m³ water recovered while evaporators and reverse osmosis systems were the cheapest 0 73 1 04 usd m³ water recovered table 8 presents the investment costs for each alternative for the scenario 1 alternatives 1 2 and 3 are feasible from the economic point of view alternative 1 employing evaporators as concentration technology has the most economic feasibility given the higher npv irr and smaller payback period in this case the water recovery could represent an economy of 8 490 435 76 usd year for the brazilin distillery studied in scenario 1 for the scenario 2 with lower vinasse flowrate no scenario would be feasible since the incomes by the sale of electricity from the conversion of biogas would not be enough to cover the investments at first this result shows that for small flow rates other vinasse uses should be contemplated for example animal feed oliveira et al 2013 however the implantation of a biorefinery of vinasse with the system of recovery of water would bring a saving of 2 821 946 65 usd year in this case the use of evaporators alternative 1 would have the lowest cost 5 conclusions five vinasse biorefinery designs were analyzed the alternatives comprised a methane production pathway and different concentration methods the processes evaporation and membrane distillation involving heat as the driving force for water recovery were less efficient since they required significant amounts of energy although forward osmosis can potentially be a more energy efficient method its implementation in the sugarcane industry is hampered by the choice of an efficient method for regeneration of draw solution if the regeneration step is neglected the forward osmosis process has an exergy efficiency of 77 among the options evaluated the processes involving reverse osmosis in which the energy for water separation is in the form of electricity are more exergy efficient i e the resources are better utilized with less exergy destruction however cost estimate shows that evaporators would be more feasible as concentration method because of the reuse of residual heat streams from sugar and alcohol processes and smaller investment cost both evaporators and reverse osmosis membranes are interesting for the concept of a biorefinery the choice of the method will depend on the characteristics of the enterprise and the region in which it will be implemented in the case of brazil the evaporators would be more attractive since reverse osmosis despite being a promising technology is still very expensive other concentration options can be adopted for e g different configurations for evaporators or membranes such as hybrid systems involving ultrafiltration and nanofiltration and other biorefinery arrangements can be devised including biofuel generation by microalgae cultivation the alternatives considered in this study are feasible for industrial application however the potential of biorefineries in the sugarcane industry must be further studied in any case vinasse biorefinery designs can reduce the polluting load of the materials disposed in the soil recycle water and produce biogas taking advantage of the energy potential of the sugar alcohol sector they offer advantages in the economic sphere by promoting the reuse of materials and reducing the demand of external feedstocks and on the environmental front by providing alternative sources of materials and energy declarations of interest none acknowledgments the

18874,this article reports a study of five designs of vinasse biorefineries that incorporate anaerobic bioreactors followed by a concentration technology such as evaporation reverse osmosis or forward osmosis different techniques of draw solution regeneration evaporation reverse osmosis and membrane distillation were also analyzed exergy analysis a method that evaluates the resource conversion efficiency of systems was used to compare the alternatives the results indicated that among the alternatives analyzed the combination of anaerobic digestion and reverse osmosis presented the highest exergy efficiency 62 however evaporators were the most feasible in terms of costs both alternatives are interesting and the final choice depends on the technology available and local economy in any case the treatment of 491 76 m3 h of vinasse exergy rate of 60513 8 kw to recover 70 of water could reduce external water requirement by 66 and generate 28 additional electricity for the sugarcane plant in this case the water recovery could represent an economy of 8 490 435 76 usd year for the brazilian alcohol industry graphical abstract image 1 keywords vinasse biorefinery resource recovery

employing technologies to convert materials previously considered waste into more valuable products such as biofuels and energy mo and zhang 2013 depending on the by product used it is possible to reclaim nitrogen phosphorus fibers acids and heat among other valuable products in general energy nutrients and water are the three main resource recovery targets guest et al 2009 the benefits of resource recovery include reduction in the extraction of natural resources and production of cleaner energies associated with proper disposal of waste however the challenge is to find or improve processes and technological routes to obtain resources efficiently fernández arévalo et al 2017 a sugarcane plant is a clear example of a biorefinery since energy is produced by burning bagasse a by product of the industrial process in cogeneration systems with profitable outcomes dantas et al 2013 brazil s primary energy sources are fossil fuels hydroelectric power plants and the sugarcane industry the latter accounting for 9 of the electricity supply unica 2018 vinasse is a by product that might improve the energy potential of sugarcane plants and the brazilian energy matrix it is a liquid obtained from the distillation of alcohol it comprises water as its main constituent as well as mineral nutrients and organic matter which make it a suitable raw material for resource recovery however factories have not yet fully explored this potential carpio and souza 2017 vinasse is currently used in fertigation since it supplies water and essential nutrients for sugarcane plants although such a practical approach requires lower investment in comparison with other soil treatments it entails significant expenses pertaining to by product transportation and distribution in the field moreover the long term application of high volumes of vinasse might saturate the soil with minerals reduce its fertility potential and cause environmental problems in the long run rabelo et al 2015 thus the deposition of vinasse in soil and plantation is limited by the capacity of the soil to absorb its constituents researchers have worked on the development of technologies to recover resources from vinasse the most common methods are anaerobic digestion and concentration anaerobic digestion is a pathway to produce methane rich biogas and a nutrient rich supernatant fuess and garcia 2017 while concentration using evaporators and membrane processes produces water that is recycled into a concentrate with high content of nutrients and organic matter amaral et al 2016 however the incorporation of such technologies into a biorefinery requires an evaluation of various configurations to determine the one with the highest overall resource recovery exergy analysis emerges as a valuable tool in this type of study since it measures the sustainability of a system encompassing not only the quantity but also the quality of the input and output streams of the processes dincer and rosen 2013 exergy analysis has been employed to evaluate the efficiency of biorefineries in many studies aghbashlo et al 2018 used exergy analysis to investigate a lignocellulosic biorefinery annexed to a sugar mill for the simultaneous production of lactic acid and electricity using sugarcane bagasse and brown leaves as feedstock dogbe et al 2018 conducted an exergy analysis of the typical sugar mill production processes to identify inefficient components for improvement madeira et al 2017 analyzed the exergetic and economic efficiencies of biohydrogen production using cassava wastewater from a large scale plant lee et al 2017 analyzed a wastewater treatment plant integrated with a combined heat and power generation system using the exergy indicator thus exergy analysis is an efficient technique for analyzing a system s performance encompassing factors pertaining to environmental and ecological impact and sustainable development bilgen and sarikaya 2015 given the potential of vinasse as a source of energy water and nutrients the overall objective of this study was to evaluate distinct technologies in the design of vinasse biorefineries using exergy analysis to evaluate the best alternative focused on the recovery of resources 2 alternatives for the management of vinasse in sugarcane factories fertigation is commonly adopted as a viable alternative for vinasse disposal since it is simple and reduces the use of fertilizers however the continuous application of high volumes of the liquid causes lixiviation of the mineral elements and soil as well as groundwater contamination moore et al 2017 moreover storage transportation and application practices contribute to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and methane oliveira et al 2017 in general the amount of vinasse applied to the soil by fertigation is higher than the recommended dose and the large volumes of effluent produced entail high transportation costs tanker trucks are used to transport most of the vinasse therefore some industries adopt the practice of concentrating vinasse thereby decreasing its volume and recovering water for use in different applications rabelo et al 2015 evaporation has been employed as a method to decrease the volume of vinasse and hence expenditure pertaining to its transport pina et al 2017 however it requires a large amount of steam and is one of the operational units that consumes the most energy in industrial plants carvalho and silva 2011 recent studies have addressed the use of membrane processes such as reverse osmosis and forward osmosis for concentrating vinasse madaeni and zereshki 2010 in reverse osmosis hydraulic pressure is used as the driving force whereas forward osmosis is an osmotically driven process both processes employ some of the highest perm selective membranes a consequence of the dense film that constitutes their morphologies bogler et al 2017 the high amount of electricity required for separation limits the application of reverse osmosis the challenges in forward osmosis are the determination of suitable draw solutions to drive the transmembrane flux and the draw solution regeneration step required johnson et al 2018 several regeneration processes as evaporation reverse osmosis and membrane distillation which is an emerging process based on a temperature gradient created across a microporous hydrophobic membrane can be applied ali et al 2016 the choice of the appropriate method is crucial because it will determine the complexity and energy requirement of the system khayet 2011 membrane filtration usually requires less energy and smaller footprint than evaporators do however a common problem in this process is fouling when significant levels of solids and organic matter are present in the liquid feed anaerobic membrane bioreactors present a reasonable alternative in which the steps of biological treatment and concentration using membrane filtration technology can be combined in a single unit park et al 2015 anaerobic digestion is an efficient biological process for the removal of organic matter and adequate start up of the bioreactor and maintenance of the active biomass results in the generation of methane rich biogas del nery et al 2016 moreover the technical effectiveness of anaerobic digestion has been established and researchers have been working on its continuous improvement moraes et al 2015 evaporators membrane processes and anaerobic bioreactors are the technological alternatives considered in this research for vinasse handling in general they can solve fertigation related problems and also provide advantages such as improvement in the sustainability of the sugarcane industry promotion of water recycling and energy production 3 methodology five different configurations were considered for the design of a vinasse biorefinery aimed at recovering water nutrients and energy all alternatives include anaerobic digestion as the methane production pathway the difference among them lies in the concentration stage for water recycling and production of a nutrient enriched liquid to be directed to fertigation the alternatives are as follows alternative 1 a1 anaerobic digestion evaporation alternative 2 a2 anaerobic digestion reverse osmosis alternative 3 a3 anaerobic digestion forward osmosis evaporation alternative 4 a4 anaerobic digestion forward osmosis reverse osmosis alternative 5 a5 anaerobic digestion forward osmosis membrane distillation fig 1 shows the flowcharts representing each alternative the analyses of the flowcharts consist of material and energy balances followed by exergy analysis as presented in fig 2 which shows an outline of the study the concentrations of the components of vinasse used as data for the simulations were obtained from del nery et al 2018 and measurements were taken at the biological processes laboratory data for which is available in the supplementary material 3 1 mass and energy balances after the characterization of vinasse the material and energy balances were attained for each unit in a continuous and steady state regime as detailed in the supplementary material 3 1 1 anaerobic digestion the balances for anaerobic digestion were obtained for the mesophilic temperature range a storage tank for cooling vinasse from 353 15 k 80 c to 308 15 k 35 c was employed to bring the vinasse to a temperature within the recommended range for anaerobic digestion chernicharo 2007 the calculations for methanogenic nutritional requirement sludge production and generation of biogas in the anaerobic bioreactor were based on the methodology presented by chernicharo 2007 as detailed in the supplementary material sodium bicarbonate in a dosage of 0 3 g nahco3 g cod was used to adjust the ph of the reactor alves et al 2018 the organic removal efficiency was in range 60 80 according to the results of the experiments performed by barros et al 2017 barros et al 2016 and españa gamboa et al 2012 mathematical simulations were conducted by considering that the biogas was composed of methane 60 co2 34 9 i e approximately equal to the values presented by salomon and lora 2009 and h2s 0 1 and water vapor 5 as trace components durán et al 2018 nghiem et al 2017 a spark ignition engine as described by barrera et al 2016 was considered for the conversion of the chemical energy of biogas into electrical energy using a generator set according to barrera et al 2016 this technology can achieve electrical and thermal efficiencies of 41 and 46 based on the lower heating value respectively after balances for the anaerobic digestion unit were obtained the osmotic pressure of the anaerobic digestion effluent was estimated by the van t hoff equation atkins and paula 2010 1 π n r t v where π is the osmotic pressure of the solution kpa n is the number of moles in the solution mol r is the universal constant of the gases kj mol k t is the temperature k and v is the volume m³ 3 1 2 evaporation the study considered the traditional design of a multi effect evaporator with five effects the temperature of the first effect was 388 15 k 115 c and pressure was 1 69 105 pa the balances included analyses of the vapor and liquid streams for the purpose of simplification the thermodynamic properties of vinasse were assumed to be identical to those of water the calculation for a multi effect evaporator was based on the methodology proposed by foust et al 1960 and mccabe et al 1985 as described in the supplementary material evaporator balances in a sugarcane plant usually involve the brix indicator as a parameter to determine the concentration of solids contained in the solution therefore the brix index 1 g solute 100 g solution can express the total solid concentration in the liquid kimball 1991 3 1 3 reverse osmosis the water transmembrane flux in the reverse osmosis unit was calculated using eq 2 where jw is the transmembrane water flux m s a is the water permeability constant m2 s kg δp is the pressure gradient pa and δπ is the osmotic pressure gradient pa baker 2012 2 j w a δ p δ π the specific energy consumed kj m3 i e sec by the reverse osmosis unit was determined using eq 3 zhu et al 2009 3 s e c w p u m p v w a t e r p e r m where v water perm is the flowrate of water that permeates the membrane m³ s and w pump is the work done by the pump kw 3 1 4 forward osmosis the alternatives a3 a4 and a5 were designed using a process of forward osmosis combined with a method for regeneration of the draw solution at first nacl was regarded as a draw solution in the calculation phase since it is a well studied solution widely applied in the development of transmembrane flux models for forward osmosis in the balances for the forward osmosis unit the reverse flux in the membrane was considered as described in the model developed by suh and lee 2013 4 j s b c d s j s w e x p j s k j s w e x p j s j s w k c 0 j s w e x p j s j s w where js is the reverse flux mol m2s b is the solute permeability m s c ds is the concentration of the draw solution mol m3 k is the solute resistivity for diffusion within the support layer s m k is the mass transfer coefficient m s c0 is the concentration of the feed mol m3 and jsw refers to the ratio of the reverse draw solute flux to the water flux mol m3 suh and lee 2013 have detailed the model employed to represent the flux in forward osmosis no external energy is consumed in forward osmosis the flow is governed by the potential chemical difference between the draw solution and the feed the draw solution regeneration methods analyzed in this work are evaporation alternative a3 reverse osmosis a4 and membrane distillation a5 such technologies require some form of energy heat or electricity as input and this was determined to ensure total regeneration of the draw solution at a recovery rate of 50 the evaporation units in a1 and a3 differ in their feed and concentrate streams as follows a1 evaporator unit feed effluent of anaerobic digestion concentrate nutrient enriched liquid a3 evaporator unit feed diluted draw solution concentrate regenerated draw solution likewise the reverse osmosis units in a2 and a4 differ in their feed and concentrate streams as follows a2 reverse osmosis unit feed effluent of anaerobic digestion concentrate nutrient enriched liquid a4 reverse osmosis unit feed diluted draw solution concentrate regenerated draw solution 3 1 5 membrane distillation unlike evaporation and reverse osmosis which were used as the main concentration methods membrane distillation was considered only as a method of regeneration of the draw solution the set of equations to evaluate the process of membrane distillation was presented by jantaporn et al 2017 who derived the model to calculate the specific energy consumption of the process 3 2 exergy analysis vinasse biorefineries may use different configurations to achieve the same objective the exergy analysis was used to compare the technological configurations on the basis of overall efficiency the ambient temperature was chosen to meet 298 15 k 25 c and an atmospheric pressure of 101325 pa 1 atm as established by szargut 1989 and these are essential for the exergy calculation involved in the vinasse processing sequences studied in this work the advantage of this procedure is the comparison based on a single unambiguous quantifiable indicator in this case the answer can be obtained from process efficiencies within the immediate boundaries of the system rather than from environmental impacts on a global scale balkema et al 2002 after the mass and energy balances the exergy contents of the streams were calculated according to the classification in table 1 and by using the equations presented by ptasinski 2016 and tai et al 1986 table 2 the exergy efficiencies of the alternatives were then estimated and compared with each other 3 3 costs estimate a simplified cost analysis was performed based on widely known criteria for evaluating operation investments and financial business decisions npv irr and payback metrics table 3 zore et al 2018 the net present value npv is the present value of all expected cash flows an investment s internal rate of return irr is the discount rate that makes the present value of all expected future cash flows equal to zero the payback period for a project is the length of time it takes to get the money back peterson drake and fabozzi 2002 the cost estimate was based on the following assumptions interest rate of 6 amortized in a period of 20 years yangali quintanilla et al 2011 revenue comes from the sale of biogas energy the reuse of residual heat from sugarcane industry facilities streams was considered commercialization value of the energy generated from biogas usd104 84 mwh ministry of mines and energy 2018 adopted exchange rate brl 3 70 usd1 00 brazilian central bank 2019 the costs were updated to the 2019 base year according to the inflation rate based on the u s consumer price index cpi values official data foundation inflation calculator 2019 the values used in the cost calculations are listed in table 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of composition of the vinasse in the process the relationship between composition of the vinasse and its exergy content was observed from the characterization of the material supplementary material specific exergy of vinasse increases with the concentration of solids represented by brix and cod fig 3 emphasizing that the pollutant load reflects the deviation from the environment in contrast exergy content of vinasse diminishes as the percentage of water increases or concentration of solids diminishes the influence of vinasse composition in the exergy efficiency can be illustrated in table 5 which presents the effects of cod variation in exergy efficiency for the alternative 1 it was observed that the higher the cod of vinasse the greater the exergy efficiency this is because biogas production rises due to the greater amount of organic matter in the vinasse thus the efficiency of the anaerobic bioreactor can directly interfere in the subsequent concentration step for example fig 4 shows that the osmotic pressure diminishes with the increase in the organic removal as it refers to a decrease in the concentration of solids in the liquid this would facilitate the transmembrane flux of water requiring less potential of driving forces or even smaller areas of the membranes 4 2 analysis of the methane production pathway the following results were analyzed based on a scenario with operational conditions as follows 1 2 bx vinasse 70 kg vinasse s and 70 organic removal according to the diagram in fig 5 for the methane production pathway loss of low grade heat from vinasse in the storage tank accounted for 19 of the available energy exergy rate of 6028 kw the rate of exergy destroyed in this step was 1428 kw 4 bicarbonate accounted for only 0 31 of the total exergy input in the methane production pathway the anaerobic digestion effluent was the stream of higher exergy content i e 61 exergy rate of 14694 kw of the total the exergy efficiency of the anaerobic bioreactor was 87 a total of 13 exergy rate of 3346 kw of the exergy destruction is related to irreversibility of the process the biogas conversion unit accounted for 45 of exergy efficiency which is equivalent to the value presented by barrera et al 2016 the electrical and thermal conversion efficiencies of the spark ignition engine were 41 and 46 respectively therefore 12 exergy rate of 3101 kw of the exergy exits the system as energy 53 in the form of heat heat flowrate of 1639 8 kw and 47 in the form of electricity work transfer rate of 1461 6 kw the estimated exergy efficiency of the overall methane production pathway was 74 the efficiency of this stage can be enhanced by the use of heat from the storage tank and improvements in the technologies employed for conversion of biogas into energy 4 3 evaluation of the concentration methods fig 6 shows the diagrams of the concentration methods of each alternative 4 3 1 evaporator the exergy efficiency of the multi effect evaporator in a1 was 32 and the input heat exergy accounted for 68 of that of the low grade energy stream heat flowrate of 39253 kw exergy rate of 30720 kw the vapor exiting the system is an important source of heat and can be recycled back into the plant at an exergy rate content of 3414 kw the exergy rate of recovered water was 2481 kw and that of the nutrient enriched liquid was 8425 kw the system would require a heat flowrate of 43330 kw exergy rate of 35476 kw to achieve a dry solid concentration of 21 bx which is considered a suitable value by carvalho and silva 2011 in this case the removal of water achieved must be 88 thus resulting in an approximately 3 62 kg s concentrated nutrient enriched liquid stream 4 3 2 reverse osmosis the reverse osmosis unit in a2 showed an exergy efficiency of 73 and its electricity requirement of 218 kw represented 1 47 of the total exergy of the input resources the exergy destruction of 27 might be related to concentration polarization fouling formation and the intrinsic irreversibility of the process a membrane area of 14459 m2 was considered in this scenario 4 3 3 forward osmosis the area required for water recovery of 70 in forward osmosis was also 14459 m2 the draw solution input had an exergy rate content of 2539 kw and a flowrate of 176 39 m³ h the forward osmosis unit accounted for 77 of the exergy efficiency however when this technology was coupled with the regeneration methods the efficiency of the system was lower 4 3 4 regeneration methods when evaporation was employed for regeneration of the draw solution a3 the destroyed exergy of the concentration phase forward osmosis evaporation was 64 the exergy efficiencies of the evaporator unit and the total system were 23 and 38 respectively reverse osmosis as a method of regeneration a4 exhibited an exergy efficiency of 70 i e 3 lower than that of the reverse osmosis unit in a2 in this case membrane area of 2000 m2 was considered regeneration of the draw solution required more energy 2410 kw of electricity than did direct water reclamation from the anaerobic digestion effluent 218 kw of electricity the diluted draw solution flowrate 352 80 m³ h was higher than the anaerobic digestion effluent flowrate 234 54 m³ h the concentration method in a4 showed an exergy efficiency of 68 i e the process accounted for 32 of the destroyed exergy a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd module was incorporated in a5 moreover some preheating energy must be supplied to the feed to achieve the desired temperature i e 373 15 k at the module inlet jantaporn et al 2017 the specific energy consumption was 9 72 105 kj m3 277 20 kwh m3 and the input heat flowrate was 48898 kw which is equivalent to an exergy rate of 30788 kw the membrane distillation unit had an exergy efficiency of 14 the exergy efficiency of the concentration system of a5 forward osmosis membrane distillation was 28 accounting for 72 of the destroyed exergy 4 4 comparison of the alternatives as shown in fig 7 in general the alternatives that used heat as an input energy resource showed higher exergy requirements i e the alternatives that employed reverse osmosis a2 and a4 tended to demand less exergy the alternatives a2 reverse osmosis and a4 forward osmosis reverse osmosis showed higher exergy efficiencies 62 and 58 respectively and a5 forward osmosis membrane distillation showed the least 32 fig 8 shows the exergy efficiencies of the different alternatives including the methane production pathway and concentration method in a scenario of 70 kg s of vinasse and 70 organic matter removal fig 9 displays the relationship between total exergy efficiency and water recovery alternatives a2 reverse osmosis and a4 forward osmosis reverse osmosis showed similar exergy efficiencies to achieve water recovery of 70 the exergy efficiency of separation was 83 i e a minimum total exergy rate of 5491 40 kw was required for a partial separation of the components of vinasse although the forward osmosis unit is thermodynamically more favorable than other concentration technologies the regeneration of the draw solution makes the system less efficient such a statement was emphasized by mcgovern and lienhard 2014 who affirmed that reverse osmosis is significantly more energy efficient than forward osmosis due to the latter s theoretical and actual energy requirements for draw solution regeneration the appropriate operation of the process of forward osmosis depends on the choice of draw solution which must present high values of osmotic pressure in this study nacl e g seawater was considered because it is a widely applied solution provides high osmotic pressure and entails low costs however the cost of transporting seawater to sugarcane plants may hamper its use sucrose should also be considered as a draw solution since it is an abundant organic substance in the sugarcane industry on the other hand its osmotic pressure is lower than those of inorganic salts e g osmotic pressure of nacl 4 8 mpa and that of sucrose 2 4 mpa and its application as a solution requires further investigation johnson et al 2018 the results indicate that among the concentration technologies investigated membrane distillation showed the highest exergy destruction whereas forward osmosis was the most exergy efficient however a general analysis revealed that the alternatives a2 and a4 were the most interesting to recover water in terms of exergy efficiency in this case reverse osmosis appears to be the most suitable method of concentration it is a well known technology that can be coupled with biological processes to provide an interesting design for biorefineries if applied to the sugarcane industry it would use the surplus electricity generated from the combustion of bagasse or the burning of methane from anaerobic digestion 4 5 brief study of scenarios two scenarios were studied to simulate the implementation of a vinasse biorefinery comprising anaerobic bioreactor and reverse osmosis units in different types of sugarcane plants scenario 1 the vinasse biorefinery is annexed to an ethanol plant designed by palacios bereche et al 2013 scenario 2 the vinasse biorefinery is annexed to a sugar and alcohol plant presented by ensinas et al 2009 initially the exergy content values of the flowrates of sugarcane water withdrawal surplus energy alcohol production and vinasse in the plants were obtained from palacios bereche et al 2013 and ensinas et al 2009 subsequently the amount of electricity produced from biogas conversion energy consumed by the reverse osmosis unit and the amount of water reclaimed were calculated table 6 shows the exergy of the flowrates for the scenarios considered in scenario 1 if 70 344 23 m³ h of water is recovered by reverse osmosis the external water demand would decline by 66 the biogas produced in the anaerobic bioreactor would generate 6052 kw of electricity which represents a 28 increase in the energy available to the plant the energy requirement of the reverse osmosis unit would represent 1 57 of the surplus power obtained from the combustion of bagasse and biogas in scenario 2 the sugar and ethanol plant studied by ensinas et al 2009 produced less alcohol than did the alcohol factory evaluated by palacios bereche et al 2013 consequently less vinasse was generated and the amount of water available for recovery was also lower in this case the water from vinasse would reduce requirement from external sources by 22 114 41 m³ h of reclaimed water and the electricity generated by methane conversion would represent 12 of the surplus energy generated in the plant by burning bagasse the energy requirement of the reverse osmosis unit corresponded to 1 54 of the surplus energy 4 6 analysis by cost estimate the simplified costs estimates were effectuated for the previous scenarios table 7 shows the investment costs for each technology considered the cost of anaerobic digestion system including biogas cleaning was 1 94 usd m³ biogas produced amongst the concentration methods membrane distillation was the most expensive 4 67 usd m³ water recovered while evaporators and reverse osmosis systems were the cheapest 0 73 1 04 usd m³ water recovered table 8 presents the investment costs for each alternative for the scenario 1 alternatives 1 2 and 3 are feasible from the economic point of view alternative 1 employing evaporators as concentration technology has the most economic feasibility given the higher npv irr and smaller payback period in this case the water recovery could represent an economy of 8 490 435 76 usd year for the brazilin distillery studied in scenario 1 for the scenario 2 with lower vinasse flowrate no scenario would be feasible since the incomes by the sale of electricity from the conversion of biogas would not be enough to cover the investments at first this result shows that for small flow rates other vinasse uses should be contemplated for example animal feed oliveira et al 2013 however the implantation of a biorefinery of vinasse with the system of recovery of water would bring a saving of 2 821 946 65 usd year in this case the use of evaporators alternative 1 would have the lowest cost 5 conclusions five vinasse biorefinery designs were analyzed the alternatives comprised a methane production pathway and different concentration methods the processes evaporation and membrane distillation involving heat as the driving force for water recovery were less efficient since they required significant amounts of energy although forward osmosis can potentially be a more energy efficient method its implementation in the sugarcane industry is hampered by the choice of an efficient method for regeneration of draw solution if the regeneration step is neglected the forward osmosis process has an exergy efficiency of 77 among the options evaluated the processes involving reverse osmosis in which the energy for water separation is in the form of electricity are more exergy efficient i e the resources are better utilized with less exergy destruction however cost estimate shows that evaporators would be more feasible as concentration method because of the reuse of residual heat streams from sugar and alcohol processes and smaller investment cost both evaporators and reverse osmosis membranes are interesting for the concept of a biorefinery the choice of the method will depend on the characteristics of the enterprise and the region in which it will be implemented in the case of brazil the evaporators would be more attractive since reverse osmosis despite being a promising technology is still very expensive other concentration options can be adopted for e g different configurations for evaporators or membranes such as hybrid systems involving ultrafiltration and nanofiltration and other biorefinery arrangements can be devised including biofuel generation by microalgae cultivation the alternatives considered in this study are feasible for industrial application however the potential of biorefineries in the sugarcane industry must be further studied in any case vinasse biorefinery designs can reduce the polluting load of the materials disposed in the soil recycle water and produce biogas taking advantage of the energy potential of the sugar alcohol sector they offer advantages in the economic sphere by promoting the reuse of materials and reducing the demand of external feedstocks and on the environmental front by providing alternative sources of materials and energy declarations of interest none acknowledgments the
