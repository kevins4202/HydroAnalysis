11165,in hybrid maize zea mays l seed production both the kernel quality and the germination rate which are positively related to kernel weight kw are very important water deficit can change the source sink ratio ssr and thus affects kw to create a water saving irrigation program that facilitates the production of high quality seed it is necessary to properly model the kw water relationship irrigation experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 in an arid region of northwest china to investigate the effects of deficit irrigation on maize plant biomass and yield and pollination experiments were conducted in 2016 to obtain a wide range of ssr and kw data analysis of the results showed that water deficit at the vegetative or flowering stages reduced post flowering biomass gain pbg and kernel number kn thus significantly affecting ssr at the grain filling stage it reduced pbg but had no significant effect on kn thus reducing ssr only the treatment of no irrigation in the grain filling stage in 2015 significantly reduced kw the jensen model can accurately simulate the relationship between pbg and relative evapotranspiration at each growth stage the water sensitivity index of pbg in the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages were respectively 0 48 0 48 0 97 and 0 16 based on the experimental data of 2016 the hyperbolic upper upkw and lower lowkw limit equations were created for kw as a function of ssr using boundary analysis upkw and lowkw increased as ssr increased but the difference between upkw and lowkw first increased and then decreased as ssr increased when ssr was 0 upkw was 178 39 mg and lowkw was 155 56 mg when ssr is not less than 867 23 mg kernel 1 upkw and lowkw are both 326 97 mg which is the potential kw combined with the kn water model the models developed in this study can be used to develop a water saving and irrigation program that produces high quality seed keywords kernel weight source sink ratio post flowering biomass gain evapotranspiration maize for seed production 1 introduction in the hexi corridor located in the arid region of northwest china water is a scarce resource due to the low rainfall and high rate of evaporation the hexi corridor is well suited for hybrid maize seed production with a large day night temperature difference sufficient thermal time and isolated oases maize inbred lines have become the main irrigated crop in the region wang et al 2017 to improve water use efficiency wue and protect the ecology of this region scientifically based irrigation programs need to be developed for maize inbred lines hybrid maize seed quality and germination rate are very important and they are positively related to kernel weight kw which is a major factor in determining yield borrás et al 2002 guan et al 2013 water deficit can alter the post flowering source sink ratio ssr and thus affect kw a satisfactory irrigation program for maize inbreds must not only ensure high yield and wue but also guarantee that kw meets or exceeds the threshold for germination rate standards thus it is important to study the relationship between kw and water deficit at each growth stage of the maize inbreds to create a high quality water saving irrigation program the effect of water deficit on maize kw has been extensively studied ouattar et al 1987 found that short term water deficit during the lag and linear filling phases of kernel development and water deficit during the period after linear filling up to physiological maturity did not significantly affect kw however long term water deficit from after the lag phase to physiological maturity decreased kw by 50 çakir 2004 showed that water deficit at different growth stages could possibly reduce kw but the effects differed in different years aydinsakir et al 2013 showed that reducing the irrigation water amount by 50 over the whole growth period significantly decreased kw hammad et al 2015 found that kw significantly decreased when water deficit occurred at the vegetative stages v2 and v16 and reproductive stage r1 wang et al 2017 found that there was no significant difference between full irrigation and water deficit irrigation during the vegetative and flowering stages these studies show that the effect of water deficit on kw at different growth stages is complex this complexity is because kw is largely governed by ssr which is the ratio of post flowering biomass gain pbg to kernel number kn since pbg and kn are differently and individually affected by water deficit their combined effect complicates the response of kw to water deficit quantification of the pbg water kn water and kw ssr relationships will facilitate better analysis of the response of kw to water deficit at each growth stage pbg is the difference between biomass at physiological maturity and biomass at the end of the flowering stage there have been many studies of the effect of water deficit on maize biomass boote 2013 bouazzama et al 2012 çakir 2004 jurgens et al 1978 sinclair et al 1990 but few studies of the effect of water deficit on pbg crop water production functions which originally related crop yield to evapotranspiration at different growth stages have been used to determine irrigation programs blank 1975 jensen 1968 kang et al 2017 minhas et al 1974 stewart et al 1975 chen et al 2014 used the forms of crop water production functions to quantify the effects of water deficit at different growth stages on the fruit quality of tomato plants we examine whether crop water production functions can be used to quantify the effects of water deficit on pbg at different growth stages then combined with kn we can quantify the effects of water deficit on ssr wang et al 2017 analyzed the effects of water deficit on maize inbred flowering and kn based on the results they developed a water flowering model to estimate kn of maize inbreds under different irrigation treatments wang et al 2018 borrás and otegui 2001 and tanaka and maddonni 2008 developed models of the kw ssr relationships by examining the effects of defoliation shading different plant densities and pollination methods however they did not consider the effect of water deficit and at a particular value of ssr differences in kw were large and up to 100 mg when the kw ssr relationship is used as the basis of an irrigation program there is a large probability that actual kw will be less than estimated kw which will result in a large number of seeds having a low germination rate therefore a kw ssr relationship which can precisely maintain desired kw when creating an optimal irrigation program needs to be developed to guarantee kw and germination rate this study aims 1 to investigate the response of pbg to water deficit at each growth stage 2 to model the pbg water relationship and 3 to develop upper and lower bounds for the kw ssr relationship and so to create a foundation for a water saving irrigation program for maize inbreds that produces high quality hybrid seed 2 material and methods 2 1 field experiment the experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2016 with maize inbreds grown for hybrid seed funong series at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province of northwest china detailed information of the station and crop management can be found in wang et al 2017 the female inbreds were planted on 15 apr 2014 16 apr 2015 and 24 apr 2016 kernels were harvested on 20 sept 2014 15 sept 2015 and 15 sept 2016 there were 9 irrigation treatments in 2014 and 11 irrigation treatments in 2015 during the vegetative v flowering f grain filling g and ripening r stages table 1 shows the different irrigation treatments in 2014 and 2015 there was no irrigation during establishment stage because soil moisture had been recharged by winter irrigation in the previous year border irrigation was used in 2014 and 2015 and all plots were irrigated in synchrony with treatment v2f2 wang et al 2017 the irrigation pipe broke when irrigating during the flowering stage in 2014 so the two treatments v2f1 and v2f0 became invalid the two treatments were not included when analyzing the effects of deficit irrigation on crop evapotranspiration et pbg ssr or kw but they were used in model calibration and validation the maize inbreds were irrigated every 10 15 d in 2016 using drip irrigation under plastic film mulch there were four irrigation treatments table 1 the quantity of water used in the full irrigation treatment was the difference between evapotranspiration et and rainfall during the interval before irrigation et was calculated by e t k c e t 0 allen et al 1998 where kc the crop coefficient of each growth stage was defined by jiang et al 2014 and et0 reference crop evapotranspiration was calculated by the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 penman 1948 six pollination treatments were set up for each irrigation treatment at the flowering stage in 2016 to vary kn and give different ssr and kw values for subsequent analysis fig 1 pollination was performed manually with sufficient pollen between 09 00 and 10 00 h each treatment had six replicates pbg is the difference between biomass at the end of flowering and biomass at the stage of physiological maturity at the end of the flowering stage and at the end of the ripening stage in each year from 2014 to 2016 six plants from each treatment were oven dried to measure the above ground biomass kn and kw were measured according to the procedure described in wang et al 2017 meteorological data were obtained from an automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp jiang et al 2014 soil water content was measured by a trime pico probe tdr imko germany actual crop et was calculated by the water balance method using average soil moisture change in the 0 100 cm soil layer kang et al 2000 the contribution of groundwater to soil moisture was negligible in the study area as the groundwater table is 25 m below the surface there was no surface runoff or deep percolation during irrigation 2 2 pbg water relationship four crop water production functions were used as models the jensen model jensen 1968 the minhas model minhas et al 1974 the blank model blank 1975 and the stewart model stewart et al 1975 model predictions were compared to simulate the effects of water deficit at the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages on pbg and the best one was chosen as an index of the pbg water relationship jensen model 1 p b g p b g c k i 1 n e t i e t c k i

at the ith growth stage of the full irrigation treatment δi λi ki and zi are the water deficit sensitivity indexes of pbg at each growth stage i is the growth stage and n is the number of growth stages if water deficit occurs in the establishment stage the maize will fail to develop so water deficit sensitivity was calculated only over the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages 2 3 kw ssr relationship upper and lower limits the relationship between kw and ssr was determined using boundary line analysis li et al 2016 kw ssr points were grouped in intervals of 50 mg kernel 1 of ssr in each group kw in the 95th percentile or higher was considered to be an upper limit point and kw in the 5th percentile or lower was considered to be a lower limit point borrás and otegui 2001 and maddonni et al 1998 used segmented linear functions to represent the relationship between kw and ssr this is a straightforward method but the number of segments and the inflexion points are hard to determine moreover segmented linear functions cannot reflect the continuity of crop growth a continuous nonlinear model can overcome these drawbacks meade et al 2013 borrás et al 2004 and borrás and gambín 2010 represented the dependence of kernel biomass accumulation on the availability of assimilates by a hyperbolic relationship so in this study kw values within each set of limit points were ﬁtted with hyperbolic curves through the least squares method using the corresponding ssr values 5 u p k w u p m s s r k u p u p 0 s s r k u p 6 l o w k w l o w m s s r k l o w l o w

sets of field experiment data from 2014 and validated using the 11 sets of field experiment data from 2015 as the ranges of kw and ssr in the experiment of 2016 were larger than the ranges of 2014 and

and kernel weight table 2 shows the evapotranspiration et at each growth stage of the maize inbreds in 2014 and 2015 seasonal et varied from 307 to 478 mm depending on irrigation amounts and meteorological influences over two years et was highest for the full irrigation treatment v2f2 and water deficit reduced et at each corresponding growth stage seasonal et varied among the different irrigation treatments et at the establishment vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages respectively accounted for 7 32 11 60 14 53 30 88 24 29 37 03 19 47 27 96 and 2 83 15 85 of seasonal et water deficit inhibits plant root water uptake and leads to reduced stomatal opening thereby decreasing plant transpiration kang et al 1998 it also increases soil resistance and thus decreases soil evaporation turner 1975 et decreases when water deficit inhibits photosynthesis through decreased leaf area li et al 2018 leaves grow rapidly during the vegetative and early flowering stages of maize development so water deficit during these periods will inhibit leaf growth water deficit during the late flowering and grain filling stages accelerates leaf senescence çakir 2004 clearly water deficit at the vegetative flowering or grain filling stages not only decreases et at the time but also affects et in subsequent stages table 3 shows that pbg was greatest for the full irrigation treatment v2f2 with values of 58 58 70 65 g treatments v1f1 v0f2 and v0f0 in 2014 and 2015 and treatments v2f0 v1f0 and v0f1 significantly decreased pbg pbg was lowest for treatment v0f0 with a value of 17 78 22 72 g which was 61 22 74 83 less than for the v2f2 treatment there was no significant difference in pbg between treatments g0 and v2f2 in 2014 due to sufficient rainfall in the grain filling stage but pbg for treatment g0 decreased significantly in 2015 the vegetative stage is the most important period for the growth of maize stem and leaves water deficit at this stage can inhibit the growth of vegetative organs and thus reduce photosynthate at the late growth stage çakir 2004 when water deficit occurs during the vegetative and flowering stages a decrease in kn can affect leaf synthesis of dry matter and result in lower plant biomass at physiological maturity borrás and otegui 2001 kiniry et al 1992 çakir 2004 showed that water deficit at flowering accelerated leaf senescence and thus decreased biomass accumulation after flowering plant biomass increases rapidly after flowering because the grain filling stage is the most important and active period for kernel biomass accumulation water deficit during this growth stage can decrease leaf photosynthesis chaves et al 2009 corrêa de souza et al 2013 saglam et al 2014 and accelerate leaf senescence nesmith and ritchie 1992 thus resulting in decreased biomass after flowering by the ripening stage dry matter in the kernel is almost at its maximum the main activities are dehydration and drying so water deficit has little influence on plant biomass during this stage the effect of water deficit during the vegetative and flowering stages on kn was demonstrated by wang et al 2017 different water treatments produced significant differences in ssr however the responses of ssr to different irrigation treatments were inconsistent between 2014 and 2015 because water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages can differentially and separately affect both pbg and kn water deficit at the grain filling and ripening stages had no significant effect on kn but at the grain filling stage it significantly reduced pbg thus ssr for treatment g0 was low in 2014 and 2015 there was no significant difference in kw among all treatments in 2014 and the average kw was 257 24 mg in 2015 the average kw for treatment g0 was 248 mg and was significantly less than the average kw for treatment v2f2 there was no significant difference in kw among other treatments in 2015 photosynthate and assimilate stored in stems and leaves can be released and transported to kernels borrás et al 2004 which explains the similarities in kw 3 2 pbg water relationship table 4 shows the water sensitivity indexes of pbg at the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages given by the jensen minhas blank and stewart models eq 1 4 which were calibrated using the 9 irrigation treatments for 2014 the blank model gave the highest value of r 2 but it showed negative water sensitivity in the ripening stage which is not realistic for the jensen and stewart models r 2 0 98 which is higher than for the minhas model the water sensitivity indexes which were calibrated using the ﬁeld data of 2014 were validated with the ﬁeld experimental data obtained in 2015 fig 2 compares observed pbg and the values predicted by the four models the jensen model was determined to be the best one to predicted the pbg water relationship with b 1 r 2 0 65 and rrmse 0 1360 table 4 shows that the pbg water sensitivity indexes at the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages were respectively 0 48 0 48 0 97 and 0 16 water deficit during the vegetative and flowering stages can affect biomass both at the end of flowering and at physiological maturity while it can significantly decrease biomass after flowering the results show that pbg was most sensitive to water deficit during the grain filling stage table 5 3 3 kw ssr relationship upper and lower limits the upper upkw r 2 0 79 rrmse 0 0493 and lower lowkw r 2 0 96 rrmse 0 0368 limits for the kw ssr relationship were calibrated using the experimental data of 2016 fig 3 observed kw of for each treatment in 2014 and 2015 was between upkw and lowkw which were calculated from observed ssr upkw and lowkw both increased as ssr increased but the difference between upkw and lowkw first increased and then decreased as ssr increased when ssr 0 upkw 178 39 mg and lowkw 155 56 mg when ssr 867 23 mg kernel 1 upkw lowkw 326 97 mg which is the potential kw borrás and otegui 2001 and tanaka and maddonni 2008 modeled the relationship between kw and ssr as a two stage linear function when ssr was below the break point value kw increased as ssr increased when ssr was above the break point value kw was constant but in the two studies there was a large range of kw values for a single ssr value especially when ssr was in the range 200 300 mg kernel 1 borrás et al 2004 investigated the relationship between relative changes in kw and relative changes in ssr they showed that the model in which kw was most sensitive to ssr was very different from the model in which kw was most insensitive to ssr this suggests that the upper and lower bounded kw ssr model is better than the single kw ssr model when creating an irrigation program to maximize maize kernel quality for seed production kernel growth is limited by the assimilate supply source or by the assimilate storage capacity sink some studies have used a hyperbolic model for the kw ssr relationship when ssr was small the growth of the kernel was source limited when ssr was larger kernel growth was source sink limited as ssr continues to increase kernel growth becomes sink limited borrás and gambín 2010 borrás et al 2004 assimilate stored in the leaves and stem will be transported to kernels if ssr 0 daie 1988 maddonni et al 1998 uhart and andrade 1995 the transport capability may differ between plants and thus will result in differences in kw we found that the upkw was 178 39 mg and lowkw was 155 56 mg when ssr was 0 which is similar to the results 175 mg by ouattar et al 1987 when photosynthesis during the grain filling stage had stopped because of water deficit when ssr was greater the kernel was source sink limited the storage and release of assimilates is more complicated daie 1988 maddonni et al 1998 and may differ among individual plants which will result in larger differences between upkw and lowkw as ssr continues to increase photosynthates remain stored in the leaves and stem except for what is required for grain filling in this condition kernels are sink limited shown by a smaller difference between upkw and lowkw borrás and otegui 2001 and tanaka and maddonni 2008 found that when ssr 312 588 mg kernel 1 potential kw was actualized at 295 6 338 3 mg however borrás et al 2004 showed that when there was sufficient photosynthate kw only increased by 15 as ssr doubled these results show that kw gradually reaches the potential kw value we found that when the ssr 867 23 mg kernel 1 kw was 326 97 mg which is similar to the results 295 6 338 3 mg by borrás and otegui 2001 and tanaka and maddonni 2008 but the ssr value corresponding to potential kw was greater in this study 4 conclusions in this study we estimated the potential and minimum kw under different water regimes in hybrid maize seed production this is important in the development of water saving irrigation program that produces high quality seed because the minimum kw can strictly constrain kw to this end we did three aspects of work firstly we analysis the effect of water deficit on kw and found water deficit during the vegetative or flowering stages reduced post flowering biomass gain pbg and kernel number kn and thereby significantly affected ssr water deficit during the grain filling stage reduced pbg but had no significant effect on kn and thereby reduced ssr only the treatment with no irrigation in the grain filling stage in 2015 significantly reduced kw secondly the jensen model was selected to accurately represented the relationship between pbg and relative evapotranspiration for each growth stage the water sensitivity index of pbg in the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages is respectively 0 48 0 48 0 97 and 0 16 thirdly based on the experimental data of 2016 a hyperbolic boundary analysis model was developed to estimate the upper upkw and lower lowkw limits of kw at different ssr values upkw and lowkw both increased as ssr increased but the difference between upkw and lowkw first increased and then decreased as ssr increased when ssr was 0 upkw was 178 39 mg and lowkw was 155 56 mg when ssr was not less than 867 23 mg kernel 1 upkw and lowkw are both equalto 326 97 mg which is the potential kw acknowledgements we are grateful for financial support from the national natural

the jensen model jensen 1968 the minhas model minhas et al 1974 the blank model blank 1975 and the stewart model stewart et al 1975 model predictions were compared to simulate the effects of water deficit at the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages on pbg and the best one was chosen as an index of the pbg water relationship jensen model 1 p b g p b g c k i 1 n e t i e t c k i

at the ith growth stage of the full irrigation treatment δi λi ki and zi are the water deficit sensitivity indexes of pbg at each growth stage i is the growth stage and n is the number of growth stages if water deficit occurs in the establishment stage the maize will fail to develop so water deficit sensitivity was calculated only over the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages 2 3 kw ssr relationship upper and lower limits the relationship between kw and ssr was determined using boundary line analysis li et al 2016 kw ssr points were grouped in intervals of 50 mg kernel 1 of ssr in each group kw in the 95th percentile or higher was considered to be an upper limit point and kw in the 5th percentile or lower was considered to be a lower limit point borrás and otegui 2001 and maddonni et al 1998 used segmented linear functions to represent the relationship between kw and ssr this is a straightforward method but the number of segments and the inflexion points are hard to determine moreover segmented linear functions cannot reflect the continuity of crop growth a continuous nonlinear model can overcome these drawbacks meade et al 2013 borrás et al 2004 and borrás and gambín 2010 represented the dependence of kernel biomass accumulation on the availability of assimilates by a hyperbolic relationship so in this study kw values within each set of limit points were ﬁtted with hyperbolic curves through the least squares method using the corresponding ssr values 5 u p k w u p m s s r k u p u p 0 s s r k u p 6 l o w k w l o w m s s r k l o w l o w

sets of field experiment data from 2014 and validated using the 11 sets of field experiment data from 2015 as the ranges of kw and ssr in the experiment of 2016 were larger than the ranges of 2014 and 2015 the kw ssr relationship was calibrated using the data from 2016 and validated using the data from 2014 and 2015 the regression coefficient b the coefficient of determination r 2 and the relative root mean square error rrmse between the measured data and estimated results were used to evaluate the performance of the models they were calculated by coucheney et al 2015 yang et al 2014 7 b i 1 n

and kernel weight table 2 shows the evapotranspiration et at each growth stage of the maize inbreds in 2014 and 2015 seasonal et varied from 307 to 478 mm depending on irrigation amounts and meteorological influences over two years et was highest for the full irrigation treatment v2f2 and water deficit reduced et at each corresponding growth stage seasonal et varied among the different irrigation treatments et at the establishment vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages respectively accounted for 7 32 11 60 14 53 30 88 24 29 37 03 19 47 27 96 and 2 83 15 85 of seasonal et water deficit inhibits plant root water uptake and leads to reduced stomatal opening thereby decreasing plant transpiration kang et al 1998 it also increases soil resistance and thus decreases soil evaporation turner 1975 et decreases when water deficit inhibits photosynthesis through decreased leaf area li et al 2018 leaves grow rapidly during the vegetative and early flowering stages of maize development so water deficit during these periods will inhibit leaf growth water deficit during the late flowering and grain filling stages accelerates leaf senescence çakir 2004 clearly water deficit at the vegetative flowering or grain filling stages not only decreases et at the time but also affects et in subsequent stages table 3 shows that pbg was greatest for the full irrigation treatment v2f2 with values of 58 58 70 65 g treatments v1f1 v0f2 and v0f0 in 2014 and 2015 and treatments v2f0 v1f0 and v0f1 significantly decreased pbg pbg was lowest for treatment v0f0 with a value of 17 78 22 72 g which was 61 22 74 83 less than for the v2f2 treatment there was no significant difference in pbg between treatments g0 and v2f2 in 2014 due to sufficient rainfall in the grain filling stage but pbg for treatment g0 decreased significantly in 2015 the vegetative stage is the most important period for the growth of maize stem and leaves water deficit at this stage can inhibit the growth of vegetative organs and thus reduce photosynthate at the late growth stage çakir 2004 when water deficit occurs during the vegetative and flowering stages a decrease in kn can affect leaf synthesis of dry matter and result in lower plant biomass at physiological maturity borrás and otegui 2001 kiniry et al 1992 çakir 2004 showed that water deficit at flowering accelerated leaf senescence and thus decreased biomass accumulation after flowering plant biomass increases rapidly after flowering because the grain filling stage is the most important and active period for kernel biomass accumulation water deficit during this growth stage can decrease leaf photosynthesis chaves et al 2009 corrêa de souza et al 2013 saglam et al 2014 and accelerate leaf senescence nesmith and ritchie 1992 thus resulting in decreased biomass after flowering by the ripening stage dry matter in the kernel is almost at its maximum the main activities are dehydration and drying so water deficit has little influence on plant biomass during this stage the effect of water deficit during the vegetative and flowering stages on kn was demonstrated by wang et al 2017 different water treatments produced significant differences in ssr however the responses of ssr to different irrigation treatments were inconsistent between 2014 and 2015 because water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages can differentially and separately affect both pbg and kn water deficit at the grain filling and ripening stages had no significant effect on kn but at the grain filling stage it significantly reduced pbg thus ssr for treatment g0 was low in 2014 and 2015 there was no significant difference in kw among all treatments in 2014 and the average kw was 257 24 mg in 2015 the average kw for treatment g0 was 248 mg and was significantly less than the average kw for treatment v2f2 there was no significant difference in kw among other treatments in 2015 photosynthate and assimilate stored in stems and leaves can be released and transported to kernels borrás et al 2004 which explains the similarities in kw 3 2 pbg water relationship table 4 shows the water sensitivity indexes of pbg at the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages given by the jensen minhas blank and stewart models eq 1 4 which were calibrated using the 9 irrigation treatments for 2014 the blank model gave the highest value of r 2 but it showed negative water sensitivity in the ripening stage which is not realistic for the jensen and stewart models r 2 0 98 which is higher than for the minhas model the water sensitivity indexes which were calibrated using the ﬁeld data of 2014 were validated with the ﬁeld experimental data obtained in 2015 fig 2 compares observed pbg and the values predicted by the four models the jensen model was determined to be the best one to predicted the pbg water relationship with b 1 r 2 0 65 and rrmse 0 1360 table 4 shows that the pbg water sensitivity indexes at the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages were respectively 0 48 0 48 0 97 and 0 16 water deficit during the vegetative and flowering stages can affect biomass both at the end of flowering and at physiological maturity while it can significantly decrease biomass after flowering the results show that pbg was most sensitive to water deficit during the grain filling stage table 5 3 3 kw ssr relationship upper and lower limits the upper upkw r 2 0 79 rrmse 0 0493 and lower lowkw r 2 0 96 rrmse 0 0368 limits for the kw ssr relationship were calibrated using the experimental data of 2016 fig 3 observed kw of for each treatment in 2014 and 2015 was between upkw and lowkw which were calculated from observed ssr upkw and lowkw both increased as ssr increased but the difference between upkw and lowkw first increased and then decreased as ssr increased when ssr 0 upkw 178 39 mg and lowkw 155 56 mg when ssr 867 23 mg kernel 1 upkw lowkw 326 97 mg which is the potential kw borrás and otegui 2001 and tanaka and maddonni 2008 modeled the relationship between kw and ssr as a two stage linear function when ssr was below the break point value kw increased as ssr increased when ssr was above the break point value kw was constant but in the two studies there was a large range of kw values for a single ssr value especially when ssr was in the range 200 300 mg kernel 1 borrás et al 2004 investigated the relationship between relative changes in kw and relative changes in ssr they showed that the model in which kw was most sensitive to ssr was very different from the model in which kw was most insensitive to ssr this suggests that the upper and lower bounded kw ssr model is better than the single kw ssr model when creating an irrigation program to maximize maize kernel quality for seed production kernel growth is limited by the assimilate supply source or by the assimilate storage capacity sink some studies have used a hyperbolic model for the kw ssr relationship when ssr was small the growth of the kernel was source limited when ssr was larger kernel growth was source sink limited as ssr continues to increase kernel growth becomes sink limited borrás and gambín 2010 borrás et al 2004 assimilate stored in the leaves and stem will be transported to kernels if ssr 0 daie 1988 maddonni et al 1998 uhart and andrade 1995 the transport capability may differ between plants and thus will result in differences in kw we found that the upkw was 178 39 mg and lowkw was 155 56 mg when ssr was 0 which is similar to the results 175 mg by ouattar et al 1987 when photosynthesis during the grain filling stage had stopped because of water deficit when ssr was greater the kernel was source sink limited the storage and release of assimilates is more complicated daie 1988 maddonni et al 1998 and may differ among individual plants which will result in larger differences between upkw and lowkw as ssr continues to increase photosynthates remain stored in the leaves and stem except for what is required for grain filling in this condition kernels are sink limited shown by a smaller difference between upkw and lowkw borrás and otegui 2001 and tanaka and maddonni 2008 found that when ssr 312 588 mg kernel 1 potential kw was actualized at 295 6 338 3 mg however borrás et al 2004 showed that when there was sufficient photosynthate kw only increased by 15 as ssr doubled these results show that kw gradually reaches the potential kw value we found that when the ssr 867 23 mg kernel 1 kw was 326 97 mg which is similar to the results 295 6 338 3 mg by borrás and otegui 2001 and tanaka and maddonni 2008 but the ssr value corresponding to potential kw was greater in this study 4 conclusions in this study we estimated the potential and minimum kw under different water regimes in hybrid maize seed production this is important in the development of water saving irrigation program that produces high quality seed because the minimum kw can strictly constrain kw to this end we did three aspects of work firstly we analysis the effect of water deficit on kw and found water deficit during the vegetative or flowering stages reduced post flowering biomass gain pbg and kernel number kn and thereby significantly affected ssr water deficit during the grain filling stage reduced pbg but had no significant effect on kn and thereby reduced ssr only the treatment with no irrigation in the grain filling stage in 2015 significantly reduced kw secondly the jensen model was selected to accurately represented the relationship between pbg and relative evapotranspiration for each growth stage the water sensitivity index of pbg in the vegetative flowering grain filling and ripening stages is respectively 0 48 0 48 0 97 and 0 16 thirdly based on the experimental data of 2016 a hyperbolic boundary analysis model was developed to estimate the upper upkw and lower lowkw limits of kw at different ssr values upkw and lowkw both increased as ssr increased but the difference between upkw and lowkw first increased and then decreased as ssr increased when ssr was 0 upkw was 178 39 mg and lowkw was 155 56 mg when ssr was not less than 867 23 mg kernel 1 upkw and lowkw are both equalto 326 97 mg which is the potential kw acknowledgements we are grateful for financial support from the national natural

11166,irrigation has been promoted as a strategy to reduce poverty and improve livelihoods in southern africa households livelihood strategies within small scale irrigation schemes have become increasingly complex and diversified strategies consist of farm income from rain fed and irrigated cropping as well as livestock and an increasing dependence on off farm income the success of these strategies depends on the household s ability to make decisions about how to utilize its financial labour land and water resources this study explores the dynamics of decision making in households on farm household income within six small scale irrigation schemes across three southern african countries household survey data n 402 was analyzed using ordered probit and ordinary least squares regression focus group discussions and field observations provided qualitative data on decision making in the six schemes we found strong support for the notion that decision making dynamics strongly influence total household income households make trade offs between irrigation dryland livestock and off farm work when they allocate their labour resources to maximize household income as opposed to maximizing the income from any individual component of their livelihood strategy such as irrigation combined with the impact of the small plot size of irrigated land this is likely to result in sub optimal benefits from expensive investments in irrigation infrastructure policy makers must consider this when developing and implementing new policies keywords irrigation southern africa livelihood strategies household income gender balance in decision making 1 introduction increasing the productivity and profitability of small scale irrigation systems in developing countries is critical to improve food security and well being of small scale irrigators and their communities in the past few decades in sub saharan africa ssa agriculture has been a contributor to reducing poverty davis et al 2017 in rural areas livelihood diversification is increasingly dependent on off farm activities and has been associated with increased household income and poverty alleviation davis et al 2017 ellis 2000 ellis and allison 2004 manero 2016 farming households and their decision making are central to the development challenge of alleviating rural poverty in developing countries booysen et al 2013 on a daily basis households have to make decisions about the allocation of their labour land water and capital resources between the different income earning activities decisions are often taken by different household members who may not all be present on farm decisions might be sub optimal for a particular income earning activity and therefore for the family member undertaking it but optimal for overall household well being income diversification and the balance of decision making across household members constitute what we define as the dynamics of household decision making within small scale irrigation schemes income diversification includes rain fed cropping irrigation livestock and off farm 1 1 off farm activities are not related to household farm operations they include working for other farmers or businesses within the local community working away or running a small business activities off farm activities vary from being seasonal to a degree of permanency ellis and allison 2004 consequently many men between the ages of 30 60 are absent from irrigation schemes cousins 2013 and women approximately 50 of the agricultural labour force are often the principal farmers bryceson 2002 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011a women s involvement in decision making for various farm and household activities has been studied in the context of property ownership gendered management systems innovation and food security women s empowerment and landscape management doss et al 2014 meinzen dick et al 2012 mutenje et al 2016 peterman et al 2015 pierce colfer et al 2015 whilst different crops have been considered in these studies there is no explicit differentiation between irrigated and rainfed production and whether the decision making dynamics are associated with irrigation households there is also a gap in how this dynamic influences overall household income and the differing roles of female decision making in irrigation schemes in africa this paper fills this gap using on farm surveys from six small scale irrigation schemes in southern africa and addresses three research questions i are traditional decision making norms reflected in contemporary irrigator households in southern africa ii what influences the gender balance of household decision making and iii how do decision making dynamics influence household income this knowledge is important especially as irrigation is presented as one way to improve livelihoods and economic development in rural africa xie et al 2014 participation in decision making both intra household and within irrigation communities and management is associated with access to knowledge and empowerment and has the potential to change gender norms meinzen dick et al 2011 stern et al 2016 van koppen and hussain 2007 the paper first discusses the literature on livelihood strategies and farm household decision making dynamics section three provides background on the six irrigation schemes location and demographics and outlines the collection of data using household surveys and focus group discussions the construction of a decision index and the modelling of influences section four presents the results and discusses 1 the overall decision making index for each country and for four production types rainfed irrigated crops cattle small stock 2 the influences on the decision making index overall and by production type 3 the influence of the decision making index on income and 4 insights from the focus group discussions 2 livelihood strategies and the decision making dynamics of farm households 2 1 livelihood strategies and income diversification household income diversification is widespread regardless of location farm size or wealth bryceson 2002 ellis 2000 in contrast to other regions the largest share of household income in africa is derived from agriculture approximately two thirds for 92 of households davis et al 2017 off farm income represents about one third of earnings for 70 of ssa households with few households relying on remittances davis et al 2017 in particular off farm income is beneficial for reducing reliance on natural resources and alleviating poverty and increasingly important for driving growth in yields ellis and allison 2004 proctor and lucchesi 2012 whilst agricultural income is the dominant regional income source the proportion varies significantly across countries and irrigation schemes for example agricultural income accounted for 73 49 and 27 of household income within six schemes in tanzania zimbabwe and mozambique respectively manero 2016 on the other hand a study of smallholders in kwazulu natal found farming contributed to 14 of household income sinyolo et al 2016 findings by manero 2016 suggested that agriculture only households have lower incomes with comparatively higher income households better able to diversify into off farm income earning activities ellis and allison 2004 as more household members take up off farm activities the traditional divisions of labour economic rights and roles dissolve bryceson 2002 for example young people have mixed livelihoods that include off farm work with a greater proportion of 15 24 year olds working off farm compared to other age groups zuo et al 2018 additionally whilst it has been argued that off farm work is more prevalent for men a recent study shows similar proportions of young men and women working off farm bryceson 2002 zuo et al 2018 the out migration of males and feminization of agriculture in ssa has resulted in increased roles and responsibilities for women bryceson 2002 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011b lastarria cornhiel 2006 despite this change women left on the farm may have little decision making power ellis and allison 2004 however this may be connected to their reluctance to report their decision making power and also whether they are de facto or de jure households lastarria cornhiel 2006 2 2 patterns in management and decision making the household is the basic unit of production and makes many critical farming decisions de sherbinin et al 2008 unitary and collective models are used in farming household research however both approaches oversimplify the complexity of households decision making the former assumes that the household represents others opinions and overlooks gender and age differences that can create divergent preferences and power asymmetries de sherbinin et al 2008 van koppen and hussain 2007 hussain 2007 this study draws predominantly on the collective model where it is assumed that decision making takes place between two separate individuals commonly a husband and a wife but also involves other household members this model allows consideration of both cooperative and non cooperative bargaining which together offer several useful characterizations of intra household decision making independent action by spouses may or may not be pareto efficient where individuals have different preferences and bargaining power those with more bargaining power will have more control over assets and decision making which may change over time anderson et al 2017 doss and meinzen dick 2015 in a non farm context in south africa booysen et al 2013 find a mix of decision making models depending on household characteristics collective was more likely in large households a unitary and non cooperative model was more likely in female headed households a collective and joint model was more likely where household heads were older and bargaining was more cooperative where household heads were more educated this variation in decision making models potentially also applies in rural settings other studies have explored the impacts of information on multiple household members how they work collectively to meet their needs and the role of social context norms and rules in multiple domains household community state and market lambrecht 2017 household head categorization is also important for policy quisumbing et al 2014 the most frequent categorization is whether households are male or female headed shaner et al 1982 disaggregating female headed households into de jure and de facto provides increased understanding of how these households differ in relation to endowments and structural constraints de la o campos et al 2016 de jure female headed households are often the poorest and most disadvantaged food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011b based on who has the greatest level of farm managerial control in relation to investments production subunits labour allocation and profit categorizations include male managed female managed separately managed and jointly managed all four systems exist in africa however within ssa male managed systems dominate and jointly managed systems are less prevalent compared to asia and latin america meinzen dick et al 2012 female headed households comprise approximately 25 in ssa with the proportion varying across countries for example 26 in mozambique 43 in zimbabwe and 25 in tanzania food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011a b jointness is frequently used in the literature as an indicator of gender equality ideally if assets are owned jointly by men and women and decisions are made jointly then there is likely to be less gender inequality however establishing the jointness of decision making is complex people tend to select joint with further discussions revealing that one person makes most of the decisions meinzen dick et al 2012 and jointness can represent conflict as well as cooperation njuki et al 2014 input into decision making may be a more valuable indicator of empowerment with women valuing substantial input and consensus more highly doss et al 2014 in households where women are more educated and less involved in field work there is a higher degree of consensus about which spouse has decision making authority anderson et al 2017 2 3 influences on household decision making the literature identifies a range of socioeconomic influences on decision making including age marital status children education farming experience time spent on farm economic contribution attitude ownership of assets income farm size family structure networks doss et al 2014 doss and meinzen dick 2015 mutenje et al 2016 remittances agricultural terms of trade matshe and young 2004 extension availability quality wheeler et al 2017 and health and practical mobility anderson et al 2017 djurfeldt et al 2018 this list reflects a range of livelihood capitals ellis 2000 and underscores the highly heterogeneous nature of farming households and the complexity of influences on decision making control of household assets particularly land has a significant influence on decision making it is critical for a woman s bargaining power and for improved outcomes in agricultural households doss and meinzen dick 2015 quisumbing 2010 in africa although men own the majority of individually owned assets there is also a significant amount of joint land ownership johnson et al 2016 the latter positively influences female participation in farm decision making and the relationship is stronger where there is sole female ownership doss et al 2014 however there is stronger evidence of increased female participation in decision making rather than female influence on decision making outcomes meinzen dick et al 2011 more specifically it has been found that women in malawi with a higher decision making power index based on level of involvement in key farm decisions marketing and household expenditure had a greater influence on farming practice selection mutenje et al 2013 female participation in decision making was positively influenced by education both female and male marital status and skills training but negatively influenced by religion and informal networks the gender balance of decision making is influenced by changing patterns of farm management through urbanization increased out migration and mixing of groups with different norms njuki et al 2014 as a result gender divisions in labour and decision making have been described as eroding and less rigid meinzen dick et al 2012 peters 1986 in particular the social norms that influence land access and decision making are dynamic and evolving as markets and the value of inputs change lambrecht 2017 2 4 division of labour and its influence on household decision making traditionally many work patterns have been entrenched along gender lines in african agriculture for example men care for cattle and work the land while women undertake other arable tasks care for small livestock and dairy cattle and perform household activities peters 1986 the inclusion of dairy cattle reflects that women look after livestock housed and fed around the home food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011b in ssa women have responsibility for food crops while men have primary responsibility for cash crops with women providing the labour mehra and esim 1997 a tanzanian study found that men prefer to irrigate high value crops that can be harvested in bulk and sold in larger volumes whereas women prefer crops that can be harvested in smaller quantities over a longer period for home consumption or selling locally for regular income njuki et al 2014 another tanzanian study found that women had higher input into minor household expenditure food production and cash crops and the lowest input into major household expenditure doss et al 2014 overall we concur with mcgregor et al 2001 that drawing from more than one methodology provides a better understanding of the integrated nature of household decision making this paper therefore models decision making of multiple household members across all household income domains to acknowledge the diversity of household headship and incorporates qualitative data to provide further insight 3 methodology 3 1 location details this study used mixed methods and collected quantitative extensive household surveys and qualitative follow on interviews in focus groups data from households in six irrigation schemes two each in mozambique zimbabwe and tanzania these households are part of a project funded by the australian centre for international agricultural research to increase irrigation water productivity and profitability the selection of countries followed a scoping study of nine african countries and considered local expertise favourable policies and institutions and the potential to increase food production schemes were selected based on institutional capacity ability to improve agricultural practices accessibility and collaboration with local agencies the schemes differ in number of irrigators irrigated plot size gender age of household heads hh and dependence on off farm work table 1 in tanzania males dominate as hhs whereas females dominate in zimbabwe and there are more non married de facto households in mozambique for more details about the schemes and irrigation within the countries see mdemu et al 2017 for tanzania moyo et al 2017 for zimbabwe and de sousa et al 2017 for mozambique 3 2 household quantitative survey households on the six schemes were surveyed in 2014 using a questionnaire this was based on various findings from the literature in depth local knowledge about irrigation and agriculture in the three countries and informed by discussions with irrigators extension officers and local leaders the survey was checked by all research and government organizations involved including experienced local leaders extension officers and irrigators before it was piloted with around ten households the survey was designed to collect a broad range of quantitative data on household demographics and production and included specific questions on household decision making enumerators were trained to ensure the questionnaire was administered consistently through face to face interviews with households in the three smallest schemes we attempted to survey all households whereas in each of the three larger schemes 100 households were purposefully recruited and stratified on plot location upstream middle or downstream and resource endowment the interviews were of approximately two hours duration and undertaken with hhs and or other main decision makers female participation was encouraged while a man was frequently the hh he was often not available consequently the gender balance among the respondents was relatively even 59 men from the perspective of analyzing decision making in farm households with increasingly complex livelihood strategies this sample was considered ideal as it included a relatively even number of men and women whether they were the hh or not the stratification and sampling resulted in a survey of 402 households across the three countries covering 478 irrigated plots 255 solely controlled by males 173 by females and 301 rain fed plots 158 solely controlled by males 119 by females the survey s decision making questions were with respect to four production types irrigated crops rain fed crops cattle and smaller stock e g sheep goats chicken and ducks for each farmers had to answer six decision making questions 24 in total on i what crops to grow or animals to raise ii implement use iii purchase and use of inputs iv work times v when and where to sell produce and vi use of farming proceeds the respondent could choose who made the decision from a provided list household head husband wife son daughter parent grandchild husband and wife or other such as other joint combinations 3 3 focus group qualitative research following on from the large scale quantitative surveys and the findings from their analysis we conducted focus groups within the schemes to gain additional insights on irrigated farm decision making and gender dynamics two focus groups were conducted within each scheme in july september 2016 the aim was to obtain insights on levels of input into decision making on the schemes whether decision making involves cooperative or non cooperative behaviour between spouses who makes the final decision and the importance of household members engagement in income diversification one focus group was with females only predominantly from female headed households and one was with women and men from male headed households mixed group this provided the maximum opportunity to explore the balance in household decision making and other factors that influence the decision making dynamics the discussions focused on five themes community level household level technology access water governance and irrigation impacts researchers noted key points on flip charts and took verbatim notes of individual statements the focus groups used sindebele in zimbabwe swahili in tanzania and changana in mozambique 3 4 farm decision variable and regression analysis the gender balance of decision making was determined by coding the responses to the 24 decision questions 1 female 0 joint and 1 male each of these variables was then rescaled to create a gender balance decision making index for each of the four production types either 1 all female all six decisions made by a female 2 mainly female 2 or 3 decisions made by a female 3 balanced 4 mainly male or 5 all male hence an increase in this index indicates more male decision making besides reflecting the level of male or female involvement in decision making this index also allows for a more nuanced understanding of decision making dynamics reflecting whether decision making was unitary either 1 or 5 or collaborative 2 4 taking the average of the four production types we created an overall index of the gender balance of decision making it was not always possible to identify the gender if the decision maker was a parent grandchildren or others these answers accounted for around 5 of total responses with the majority of them being parent to avoid excluding these observations we classified them as balanced 2 2 an index for each production type was also created the indexes of these six aspects are highly correlated and highly correlated with the overall index correlation coefficient 0 84 we therefore report the overall index ordered probit regression 3 3 results were obtained using both ordered logit and ordered probit models the test results between the two models were very similar albeit ordered probit had slightly higher explanatory power hence the ordered probit results are reported here modelled the influences on the gender balance of decision making equation 1 namely 1 y x β ε the dependent variable y is a latent variable measuring the exact but unobserved extent of the gender balance of decision making x is a vector of independent variables representing the socio economic and property characteristics of the households β a vector of parameters and ε an error term appendix a provides descriptive statistics we observe y 1 all female if y μ1 y 2 mainly female if μ1 y μ2 y 3 balanced if μ2 y μ3 y 4 mainly male if μ3 y μ4 and y 5 all male if μ4 y where y is a rough categorization of y μ1 μ2 μ3 and u4 are parameters to be estimated ordinary least squares ols regression equations 2 modelled how the decision making dynamic as well as other factors influence the six types of household income 2 i w δ ν equation 2 was estimated for each income type i w is a vector of independent variables δ is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ν is an error term pre testing suggested that income should take a logarithmic form for a better fit we tested whether the decision making index was endogenous with household income using the gender of hh as a valid instrument for example it is possible to argue that differences in household income help drive the gender balance based on the literature where higher assets income owned by females are associated with greater female decision making however results suggested that the decision making index was not endogenous with any type of household income 4 4 the endogeneity test was implemented after a two stage least squares regression under the null hypothesis that the specified endogenous regressor gender decision making index is exogenous for each of the household income models the null hypothesis could not be rejected at the 0 05 significance level again independent variables are based on the literature we also accounted for other potential influences by including a dummy for hh being single or widowed and number of males in the household 4 results and discussion 4 1 overview table 2 provides an overview of the gender balance of household decision making by country 5 5 results for zimbabwe and tanzania are included in appendix b figures for mozambique are not disaggregated due to low numbers the husband and or the wife predominantly make farm decisions with other household members making a smaller proportion ranging from 8 for cattle to 12 for irrigation looking at the overall decision making across all three countries there is a surprisingly even proportion across the decision categories with only a small skewness toward male dominated decision making from 16 23 however large differences exist amongst the three countries table 2 and the schemes appendix b in tanzania men make most decisions and this probably reflects social norms females make most decisions in zimbabwe which probably reflects that many men work away however both countries report 20 balanced decision making balanced decision making was rare in mozambique with decisions made mostly by men in one scheme and mostly by females in the scheme where a large proportion of men work away in south africa in zimbabwe female only decision making is likely if the female hh is widowed households where females make all the decisions accounted for 56 of widowed hhs compared to 18 amongst other households in mozambique and zimbabwe production type clearly influences the gender balance of decision making whereas all decisions are male dominated in tanzania across all schemes decision making about cattle is male dominated while small stock is female dominated except for mozambique these findings are consistent with the literature peters 1986 apart from small stock female decision making is highest for irrigation particularly in zimbabwe and mozambique where the proportion of all female decision making is higher than for any other production and higher than male only this is a new finding not previously reported in the literature we analyzed how respondents gender was associated with the ranking of decision making table 3 to assess whether males report decision making differently to females the majority of female respondents 74 report either female only or more female decision making whereas male respondents report male dominated or joint as many female respondents are de jure hh we excluded widowed hh and found that now 62 reported female only or more female decision making excluding widowed hh equal decision making is almost even but women still rate female decision making higher this probably reflects the prevalence of de facto female hhs in this category who have an increased role in decision making this is contrary to the findings of ellis and allison 2004 but consistent with bryceson 2002 and lastarria cornhiel 2006 reflecting this male hh respondents were more likely to be spending more time on farm hence were more involved in decision making we further tested the impact of collaborative decision making by combining more female equal and more male into one category called collaborative not reported in table 3 this analysis suggests that there were no significant differences between male and female respondents in their rating of collaborative decision making this adds nuance to booysen et al s 2013 urban findings in this rural setting the balance in collaborative decision making between a husband and wife depends on the hh s gender which in turn depends on the presence of the male in the household 4 2 modelling the influences on the dynamics of decision making overall and production types table 4 presents the results of the ordered probit decision making regression and table 5 the ols income regression the regressions have no serious multicollinearity and the use of robust standard errors mitigated the issue of heteroscedasticity the mckelvey zavoina r2 for the ordered probit models and r2 for the ols models are all satisfactory indicating overall model fitness the ordered probit regression identified a wide range of influences on the gender balance of decision making one of the strongest findings is the significant difference between the countries the comparison is tanzania this is both with respect to variations in the overall decision making index and the individual production indexes across all decision types except cattle females play a significantly greater role in zimbabwe than in tanzania in mozambique females play a significantly greater role in overall and rain fed decision making while they have a significantly lesser role in small livestock decision making where the hh was male decisions were significantly more likely to be male dominated which is consistent with the finding that in male managed farming systems men are completely or mostly controlling production and decision making doss and meinzen dick 2015 van koppen and hussain 2007 hussain 2007 other factors are also significant i the larger the percentage of farm work carried out by the hh the more males dominate rain fed and cattle decisions ii if the hh is widowed most likely a female cattle decisions are less likely to be male dominated and iii the larger the percentage of males the more men dominate small stock decision making the last finding was unexpected and suggests that the more male dominated the household the more men infringe on the traditionally female dominated area of small stock peters 1986 this study confirms the link often made in the literature between decision making and control over farmland doss et al 2014 there is a significant and negative relationship between the total size of land not owned by males only and the overall decision making index there is a similar relationship between the rain fed and irrigated areas not owned by males only and the index for rain fed and irrigated production that is females have a larger role in decision making if they formally have full or part control over the land the focus group discussions across all schemes repeatedly highlighted that men predominantly control land and that it was difficult to talk about the control of land this supports the finding of meinzen dick et al 2011 4 3 modelling the influence of the dynamics of the decision making environment on income the dynamics of decision making influenced income in several ways table 5 total income was higher if decisions were made more by females more by males or by males only the estimated magnitude was 98 86 and 142 respectively the literature suggests that de facto female headed households are the poorest households as they do not benefit from off farm incomes and have fewer assets and human resources de sousa et al 2017 safilios rothschild 1985 however our models did not find significant differences between widowed and married hhs or between single and married hhs if decisions were made by males only on farm income was higher than if decisions were made by females only estimated 199 this is probably due to the additional availability of labour however this might also reflect that some absent male hhs make decisions by mobile phone and regularly participate in farm work during weekends and critical farm periods male off farm work provides significant income allowing for the purchase of inputs and hiring of non family labour as was found in mozambique de sousa et al 2017 this potentially allows better links to markets through the household having a presence in town if decisions are made more by females or more by males off farm income is estimated at 148 or 204 higher than if decisions are made by females only these two categories of decision making reflect that male heads of households work off farm but are still involved in farm decision making there are no significant relationships between the decision making index for the individual production types and the income from these productions as is recognized in the literature ellis and allison 2004 manero 2016 off farm work is very important for household well being both for supporting farm production by financing farm inputs but also to pay for health and education reflecting this we found that the larger the proportion of farm work carried out by the hh i e the hh is working less off farm the lower the total and off farm income additionally we found that irrigation accounts for 65 of farm income and 42 of household income across the six schemes our findings show clear evidence of the complexity of households livelihood strategies and the importance of the dynamics of decision making on total on farm and off farm income this suggests that when households allocate their labour resources they make trade offs between the dryland irrigation and livestock components of their farm and their off farm activities that is they focus on maximizing their overall return rather than the return from individual livelihood strategies total income is lower when there is a larger proportion of males in the household which at first sounds counterintuitive this probably reflects that in a household with a high proportion of males there are more children attending school traditionally rural households prioritize the education of male children this leaves less time for on or off farm work by male children male children are also less productive around the house as they neither fetch water nor look after younger siblings but still require care thereby reducing women s time for farm work there are also significant country differences in income for all production types and compared to tanzania in zimbabwe farm income was lower while off farm income was higher and rain fed income was significantly lower in mozambique the influence of ownership of productive resources was as expected i the larger the rain fed area the higher the total farm and rain fed income ii the larger the irrigated area the higher the total farm and irrigation incomes iii the more cattle the higher total farm and livestock income iv the more other livestock the higher the total and other livestock incomes v the more poultry the higher the farm income vi having a borehole water pump was associated with higher total income vii having a generator was associated with higher farm and irrigated crop incomes and viii having a car motorbike or borehole water pump was associated with higher off farm income points six seven and eight suggest resource ownership increases income which allows the household to acquire more assets and increases the ability to earn money the use of motorbikes as taxis is widespread especially in tanzania a household s borehole or water pump significantly reduces the time spent fetching water this increases time available for fieldwork facilitates more irrigated crop production at the house plot and enables more time for off farm activities 4 4 focus group findings in zimbabwe both female only and mixed focus groups report that decision making about the use of water and money was joint however in both schemes the female only focus group reported that sometimes men overruled women and spent money for their own pleasure beer or cigarettes also that most household arguments were over how to spend scarce resources some women said that women made most decisions in the households where the men were absent and as long as the work was completed there was no interference from men despite the quantitative findings of predominantly male decision making it was the tanzanian women who spoke most and appeared more confident during visits and in focus groups this might suggest that women in male dominated households are active in decision making and are more interested in having substantial input and consensus rather than reporting whether a decision is joint doss et al 2014 we cannot answer definitely but it is interesting to posit whether women are under reporting their decision making involvement lastarria cornhiel 2006 potentially to support consensus and or because they are confident of their influence the discussions suggested that joint decision making was most common for irrigation management and farm work however men were mainly responsible for finding markets as found by njuki et al 2014 men primarily made the decisions about spending money with a tanzanian farmer stating that men dominate in control of income earned from irrigated crops so as to save money for investing in the next season male farmer aged 50 magozi male farmers argued that women have unnecessary expenditures such as buying new clothes and luxury things which is why they have to control income male farmer aged 24 magozi whereas women argued that they have necessary expenses e g clothes cooking tools and often secretly sell crops to obtain money these opinions lend support to the notion that african households are less likely to pool income lastarria cornhiel 2006 despite this evidence of non cooperation in both tanzania and zimbabwe women reported that the level of domestic conflict had reduced during the project as income increased and this has improved marriage and power relations between men and women female farmer aged 40 kiwere male farmer aged 48 magozi in mozambique discussions suggested that most farmers are now women as men increasingly work in towns or in south africa while some absent men make decisions in de facto female headed household women make most of the day to day decisions most women stressed that they are acting on male advice even though they do most of the fieldwork make the day to day decisions and take a separate share of the profit we share the decision about what to produce and how but most of the time he is the one leading when it is time to harvest he is always present and making the deals but i am the one keeping the money and at the end i get a small share and the rest is managed by him female farmer aged 35 silalatshani another female mentioned the women are the ones spending more time in the field but all the decisions have already been made at home the men have more decision making power in the household since i am the one in the plot i remain in control of the production but i cannot say the same about the land it is complicated to talk about the control of the land female farmer aged 79 25 de setembro while men dominate decision making women participate most in fieldwork meetings and gathering of farming information focus group discussions also repeatedly touched on the division of work within the household and many women mentioned that women have a larger role in decision making if the hh works off farm focus groups and field observations in all three countries confirm our quantitative findings that women do most of the farm work especially when it comes to irrigation in zimbabwe many mentioned that women and men grow much the same crops under irrigation however when the project introduced the notion of high value crops it was women that were most active in adopting them to increase their income to invest in farming improve food security nutrition and their children s education this is inconsistent with the literature that indicates women s existing labour roles may limit their ability to take advantage of new opportunities doss et al 2014 the uptake of high value irrigated crops represents a change of mind set from subsistence to commercial farming with part of the surplus used for education and food security bjornlund et al 2018 in addition growing higher value cash crops should increase women s bargaining power and their influence on decision making doss and meinzen dick 2015 the discussion around livestock reflects the quantitative findings and the literature peters 1985 men mainly look after cattle and donkeys while women take care of goats and chickens for example men s first priority is large livestock like cattle then consumption us women value crop production more than men somehow large livestock comes last to our priorities but we also have a saying that a homestead without chickens shows the absence of a woman female farmer aged over 65 mkoba women also reported that the introduction of soil moisture monitoring tools had allowed them to significantly reduce their time spent irrigating often by more than 50 this time has reportedly been used to tend the home garden and small livestock to improve food security and household income increase their yield through more weeding or increase their off farm income activities e g baking buns for sale income diversification empowers women and strengthens their bargaining position this supports the importance of diversified incomes as identified by manero 2016 in tanzania 5 conclusion this study explores how household decision making dynamics influence household income in six small scale irrigation schemes in southern africa while many of the traditional norms still prevail fundamental changes are emerging as the dynamic of decision making changes due to increased livelihood diversification and the introduction of high value crops household income is influenced by how a household allocates their labour resources between on farm and off farm work and the gender balance of decision making female only decision making households had the lowest total and farm income this probably reflects that de jure female headed households without the support of a husband have no off farm income and fewer labour resources households where men made all the decisions had the highest total and farm income however households with a higher female than male contribution to decision making ran a close second which probably reflects that these are de facto female headed households receiving extra income from off farm and with access to extra farm labour during critical farming periods in conclusion our findings clearly support that households decision making dynamics strongly influence total household income rather than maximizing the income from any individual component of their livelihood strategy households make trade offs between irrigation dryland and off farm work and allocate their labour resources to maximize household income hence resource allocation decisions are not always made to ensure the maximum benefits from investments in irrigation infrastructure and consequently irrigation will not realise its potential and anticipated contribution to improving rural livelihoods and food security in many african countries a fundamental paradigm shift in agricultural land and water policies is needed as well as considering net social benefits at the basin scale policies need to have a strong focus on making irrigation profitable so that it becomes a primary source of income farming households will then have confidence to reallocate resources to this activity for irrigation schemes to become profitable there needs to be a transition from growing staples to commercial crops so that household income can meet food health and educational needs policies need to facilitate basin level hydrological and environmental considerations a consolidation of farming plots into viable units security of land tenure improved market and transport linkages so crops meet market demand and attract higher prices and access to better agronomic and irrigation information including a focus on female provided education nevertheless transitioning small scale irrigation schemes into financially viable units is and will continue to be a challenging and complex process acknowledgments this study was part of the project increasing irrigation water productivity in mozambique tanzania and zimbabwe through on farm

11166,irrigation has been promoted as a strategy to reduce poverty and improve livelihoods in southern africa households livelihood strategies within small scale irrigation schemes have become increasingly complex and diversified strategies consist of farm income from rain fed and irrigated cropping as well as livestock and an increasing dependence on off farm income the success of these strategies depends on the household s ability to make decisions about how to utilize its financial labour land and water resources this study explores the dynamics of decision making in households on farm household income within six small scale irrigation schemes across three southern african countries household survey data n 402 was analyzed using ordered probit and ordinary least squares regression focus group discussions and field observations provided qualitative data on decision making in the six schemes we found strong support for the notion that decision making dynamics strongly influence total household income households make trade offs between irrigation dryland livestock and off farm work when they allocate their labour resources to maximize household income as opposed to maximizing the income from any individual component of their livelihood strategy such as irrigation combined with the impact of the small plot size of irrigated land this is likely to result in sub optimal benefits from expensive investments in irrigation infrastructure policy makers must consider this when developing and implementing new policies keywords irrigation southern africa livelihood strategies household income gender balance in decision making 1 introduction increasing the productivity and profitability of small scale irrigation systems in developing countries is critical to improve food security and well being of small scale irrigators and their communities in the past few decades in sub saharan africa ssa agriculture has been a contributor to reducing poverty davis et al 2017 in rural areas livelihood diversification is increasingly dependent on off farm activities and has been associated with increased household income and poverty alleviation davis et al 2017 ellis 2000 ellis and allison 2004 manero 2016 farming households and their decision making are central to the development challenge of alleviating rural poverty in developing countries booysen et al 2013 on a daily basis households have to make decisions about the allocation of their labour land water and capital resources between the different income earning activities decisions are often taken by different household members who may not all be present on farm decisions might be sub optimal for a particular income earning activity and therefore for the family member undertaking it but optimal for overall household well being income diversification and the balance of decision making across household members constitute what we define as the dynamics of household decision making within small scale irrigation schemes income diversification includes rain fed cropping irrigation livestock and off farm 1 1 off farm activities are not related to household farm operations they include working for other farmers or businesses within the local community working away or running a small business activities off farm activities vary from being seasonal to a degree of permanency ellis and allison 2004 consequently many men between the ages of 30 60 are absent from irrigation schemes cousins 2013 and women approximately 50 of the agricultural labour force are often the principal farmers bryceson 2002 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011a women s involvement in decision making for various farm and household activities has been studied in the context of property ownership gendered management systems innovation and food security women s empowerment and landscape management doss et al 2014 meinzen dick et al 2012 mutenje et al 2016 peterman et al 2015 pierce colfer et al 2015 whilst different crops have been considered in these studies there is no explicit differentiation between irrigated and rainfed production and whether the decision making dynamics are associated with irrigation households there is also a gap in how this dynamic influences overall household income and the differing roles of female decision making in irrigation schemes in africa this paper fills this gap using on farm surveys from six small scale irrigation schemes in southern africa and addresses three research questions i are traditional decision making norms reflected in contemporary irrigator households in southern africa ii what influences the gender balance of household decision making and iii how do decision making dynamics influence household income this knowledge is important especially as irrigation is presented as one way to improve livelihoods and economic development in rural africa xie et al 2014 participation in decision making both intra household and within irrigation communities and management is associated with access to knowledge and empowerment and has the potential to change gender norms meinzen dick et al 2011 stern et al 2016 van koppen and hussain 2007 the paper first discusses the literature on livelihood strategies and farm household decision making dynamics section three provides background on the six irrigation schemes location and demographics and outlines the collection of data using household surveys and focus group discussions the construction of a decision index and the modelling of influences section four presents the results and discusses 1 the overall decision making index for each country and for four production types rainfed irrigated crops cattle small stock 2 the influences on the decision making index overall and by production type 3 the influence of the decision making index on income and 4 insights from the focus group discussions 2 livelihood strategies and the decision making dynamics of farm households 2 1 livelihood strategies and income diversification household income diversification is widespread regardless of location farm size or wealth bryceson 2002 ellis 2000 in contrast to other regions the largest share of household income in africa is derived from agriculture approximately two thirds for 92 of households davis et al 2017 off farm income represents about one third of earnings for 70 of ssa households with few households relying on remittances davis et al 2017 in particular off farm income is beneficial for reducing reliance on natural resources and alleviating poverty and increasingly important for driving growth in yields ellis and allison 2004 proctor and lucchesi 2012 whilst agricultural income is the dominant regional income source the proportion varies significantly across countries and irrigation schemes for example agricultural income accounted for 73 49 and 27 of household income within six schemes in tanzania zimbabwe and mozambique respectively manero 2016 on the other hand a study of smallholders in kwazulu natal found farming contributed to 14 of household income sinyolo et al 2016 findings by manero 2016 suggested that agriculture only households have lower incomes with comparatively higher income households better able to diversify into off farm income earning activities ellis and allison 2004 as more household members take up off farm activities the traditional divisions of labour economic rights and roles dissolve bryceson 2002 for example young people have mixed livelihoods that include off farm work with a greater proportion of 15 24 year olds working off farm compared to other age groups zuo et al 2018 additionally whilst it has been argued that off farm work is more prevalent for men a recent study shows similar proportions of young men and women working off farm bryceson 2002 zuo et al 2018 the out migration of males and feminization of agriculture in ssa has resulted in increased roles and responsibilities for women bryceson 2002 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011b lastarria cornhiel 2006 despite this change women left on the farm may have little decision making power ellis and allison 2004 however this may be connected to their reluctance to report their decision making power and also whether they are de facto or de jure households lastarria cornhiel 2006 2 2 patterns in management and decision making the household is the basic unit of production and makes many critical farming decisions de sherbinin et al 2008 unitary and collective models are used in farming household research however both approaches oversimplify the complexity of households decision making the former assumes that the household represents others opinions and overlooks gender and age differences that can create divergent preferences and power asymmetries de sherbinin et al 2008 van koppen and hussain 2007 hussain 2007 this study draws predominantly on the collective model where it is assumed that decision making takes place between two separate individuals commonly a husband and a wife but also involves other household members this model allows consideration of both cooperative and non cooperative bargaining which together offer several useful characterizations of intra household decision making independent action by spouses may or may not be pareto efficient where individuals have different preferences and bargaining power those with more bargaining power will have more control over assets and decision making which may change over time anderson et al 2017 doss and meinzen dick 2015 in a non farm context in south africa booysen et al 2013 find a mix of decision making models depending on household characteristics collective was more likely in large households a unitary and non cooperative model was more likely in female headed households a collective and joint model was more likely where household heads were older and bargaining was more cooperative where household heads were more educated this variation in decision making models potentially also applies in rural settings other studies have explored the impacts of information on multiple household members how they work collectively to meet their needs and the role of social context norms and rules in multiple domains household community state and market lambrecht 2017 household head categorization is also important for policy quisumbing et al 2014 the most frequent categorization is whether households are male or female headed shaner et al 1982 disaggregating female headed households into de jure and de facto provides increased understanding of how these households differ in relation to endowments and structural constraints de la o campos et al 2016 de jure female headed households are often the poorest and most disadvantaged food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011b based on who has the greatest level of farm managerial control in relation to investments production subunits labour allocation and profit categorizations include male managed female managed separately managed and jointly managed all four systems exist in africa however within ssa male managed systems dominate and jointly managed systems are less prevalent compared to asia and latin america meinzen dick et al 2012 female headed households comprise approximately 25 in ssa with the proportion varying across countries for example 26 in mozambique 43 in zimbabwe and 25 in tanzania food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011a b jointness is frequently used in the literature as an indicator of gender equality ideally if assets are owned jointly by men and women and decisions are made jointly then there is likely to be less gender inequality however establishing the jointness of decision making is complex people tend to select joint with further discussions revealing that one person makes most of the decisions meinzen dick et al 2012 and jointness can represent conflict as well as cooperation njuki et al 2014 input into decision making may be a more valuable indicator of empowerment with women valuing substantial input and consensus more highly doss et al 2014 in households where women are more educated and less involved in field work there is a higher degree of consensus about which spouse has decision making authority anderson et al 2017 2 3 influences on household decision making the literature identifies a range of socioeconomic influences on decision making including age marital status children education farming experience time spent on farm economic contribution attitude ownership of assets income farm size family structure networks doss et al 2014 doss and meinzen dick 2015 mutenje et al 2016 remittances agricultural terms of trade matshe and young 2004 extension availability quality wheeler et al 2017 and health and practical mobility anderson et al 2017 djurfeldt et al 2018 this list reflects a range of livelihood capitals ellis 2000 and underscores the highly heterogeneous nature of farming households and the complexity of influences on decision making control of household assets particularly land has a significant influence on decision making it is critical for a woman s bargaining power and for improved outcomes in agricultural households doss and meinzen dick 2015 quisumbing 2010 in africa although men own the majority of individually owned assets there is also a significant amount of joint land ownership johnson et al 2016 the latter positively influences female participation in farm decision making and the relationship is stronger where there is sole female ownership doss et al 2014 however there is stronger evidence of increased female participation in decision making rather than female influence on decision making outcomes meinzen dick et al 2011 more specifically it has been found that women in malawi with a higher decision making power index based on level of involvement in key farm decisions marketing and household expenditure had a greater influence on farming practice selection mutenje et al 2013 female participation in decision making was positively influenced by education both female and male marital status and skills training but negatively influenced by religion and informal networks the gender balance of decision making is influenced by changing patterns of farm management through urbanization increased out migration and mixing of groups with different norms njuki et al 2014 as a result gender divisions in labour and decision making have been described as eroding and less rigid meinzen dick et al 2012 peters 1986 in particular the social norms that influence land access and decision making are dynamic and evolving as markets and the value of inputs change lambrecht 2017 2 4 division of labour and its influence on household decision making traditionally many work patterns have been entrenched along gender lines in african agriculture for example men care for cattle and work the land while women undertake other arable tasks care for small livestock and dairy cattle and perform household activities peters 1986 the inclusion of dairy cattle reflects that women look after livestock housed and fed around the home food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011b in ssa women have responsibility for food crops while men have primary responsibility for cash crops with women providing the labour mehra and esim 1997 a tanzanian study found that men prefer to irrigate high value crops that can be harvested in bulk and sold in larger volumes whereas women prefer crops that can be harvested in smaller quantities over a longer period for home consumption or selling locally for regular income njuki et al 2014 another tanzanian study found that women had higher input into minor household expenditure food production and cash crops and the lowest input into major household expenditure doss et al 2014 overall we concur with mcgregor et al 2001 that drawing from more than one methodology provides a better understanding of the integrated nature of household decision making this paper therefore models decision making of multiple household members across all household income domains to acknowledge the diversity of household headship and incorporates qualitative data to provide further insight 3 methodology 3 1 location details this study used mixed methods and collected quantitative extensive household surveys and qualitative follow on interviews in focus groups data from households in six irrigation schemes two each in mozambique zimbabwe and tanzania these households are part of a project funded by the australian centre for international agricultural research to increase irrigation water productivity and profitability the selection of countries followed a scoping study of nine african countries and considered local expertise favourable policies and institutions and the potential to increase food production schemes were selected based on institutional capacity ability to improve agricultural practices accessibility and collaboration with local agencies the schemes differ in number of irrigators irrigated plot size gender age of household heads hh and dependence on off farm work table 1 in tanzania males dominate as hhs whereas females dominate in zimbabwe and there are more non married de facto households in mozambique for more details about the schemes and irrigation within the countries see mdemu et al 2017 for tanzania moyo et al 2017 for zimbabwe and de sousa et al 2017 for mozambique 3 2 household quantitative survey households on the six schemes were surveyed in 2014 using a questionnaire this was based on various findings from the literature in depth local knowledge about irrigation and agriculture in the three countries and informed by discussions with irrigators extension officers and local leaders the survey was checked by all research and government organizations involved including experienced local leaders extension officers and irrigators before it was piloted with around ten households the survey was designed to collect a broad range of quantitative data on household demographics and production and included specific questions on household decision making enumerators were trained to ensure the questionnaire was administered consistently through face to face interviews with households in the three smallest schemes we attempted to survey all households whereas in each of the three larger schemes 100 households were purposefully recruited and stratified on plot location upstream middle or downstream and resource endowment the interviews were of approximately two hours duration and undertaken with hhs and or other main decision makers female participation was encouraged while a man was frequently the hh he was often not available consequently the gender balance among the respondents was relatively even 59 men from the perspective of analyzing decision making in farm households with increasingly complex livelihood strategies this sample was considered ideal as it included a relatively even number of men and women whether they were the hh or not the stratification and sampling resulted in a survey of 402 households across the three countries covering 478 irrigated plots 255 solely controlled by males 173 by females and 301 rain fed plots 158 solely controlled by males 119 by females the survey s decision making questions were with respect to four production types irrigated crops rain fed crops cattle and smaller stock e g sheep goats chicken and ducks for each farmers had to answer six decision making questions 24 in total on i what crops to grow or animals to raise ii implement use iii purchase and use of inputs iv work times v when and where to sell produce and vi use of farming proceeds the respondent could choose who made the decision from a provided list household head husband wife son daughter parent grandchild husband and wife or other such as other joint combinations 3 3 focus group qualitative research following on from the large scale quantitative surveys and the findings from their analysis we conducted focus groups within the schemes to gain additional insights on irrigated farm decision making and gender dynamics two focus groups were conducted within each scheme in july september 2016 the aim was to obtain insights on levels of input into decision making on the schemes whether decision making involves cooperative or non cooperative behaviour between spouses who makes the final decision and the importance of household members engagement in income diversification one focus group was with females only predominantly from female headed households and one was with women and men from male headed households mixed group this provided the maximum opportunity to explore the balance in household decision making and other factors that influence the decision making dynamics the discussions focused on five themes community level household level technology access water governance and irrigation impacts researchers noted key points on flip charts and took verbatim notes of individual statements the focus groups used sindebele in zimbabwe swahili in tanzania and changana in mozambique 3 4 farm decision variable and regression analysis the gender balance of decision making was determined by coding the responses to the 24 decision questions 1 female 0 joint and 1 male each of these variables was then rescaled to create a gender balance decision making index for each of the four production types either 1 all female all six decisions made by a female 2 mainly female 2 or 3 decisions made by a female 3 balanced 4 mainly male or 5 all male hence an increase in this index indicates more male decision making besides reflecting the level of male or female involvement in decision making this index also allows for a more nuanced understanding of decision making dynamics reflecting whether decision making was unitary either 1 or 5 or collaborative 2 4 taking the average of the four production types we created an overall index of the gender balance of decision making it was not always possible to identify the gender if the decision maker was a parent grandchildren or others these answers accounted for around 5 of total responses with the majority of them being parent to avoid excluding these observations we classified them as balanced 2 2 an index for each production type was also created the indexes of these six aspects are highly correlated and highly correlated with the overall index correlation coefficient 0 84 we therefore report the overall index ordered probit regression 3 3 results were obtained using both ordered logit and ordered probit models the test results between the two models were very similar albeit ordered probit had slightly higher explanatory power hence the ordered probit results are reported here modelled the influences on the gender balance of decision making equation 1 namely 1 y x β ε the dependent variable y is a latent variable measuring the exact but unobserved extent of the gender balance of decision making x is a vector of independent variables representing the socio economic and property characteristics of the households

μ4 and y 5 all male if μ4 y where y is a rough categorization of y μ1 μ2 μ3 and u4 are parameters to be estimated ordinary least squares ols regression equations 2 modelled how the decision making dynamic as well as other factors influence the six types of household income 2 i w δ ν equation 2 was estimated for each income type i w is a vector of independent variables δ is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ν is an error term pre testing suggested that income should take a logarithmic form for a better fit we tested whether the decision making index was endogenous with household income using the gender of hh as a valid instrument for example it is possible to argue that differences in household income help drive the gender balance based on the literature where higher assets income owned by females are associated with greater female decision making however results suggested that the decision making index was not endogenous with any type of household income 4 4 the endogeneity test was implemented after a two stage least squares regression under the null hypothesis that the specified endogenous regressor gender decision making index is exogenous for each of the household income models the null hypothesis could not be rejected at the 0 05 significance level again independent variables are based on the literature we also accounted for other potential influences by including a dummy for hh being single or widowed and number of males in the household 4 results and discussion 4 1 overview table 2 provides an overview of the gender balance of household decision making by country 5 5 results for zimbabwe and tanzania are included in appendix b figures for mozambique are not disaggregated due to low numbers the husband and or the wife predominantly make farm decisions with other household members making a smaller proportion ranging from 8 for cattle to 12 for irrigation looking at the overall decision making across all three countries there is a surprisingly even proportion across the decision categories with only a small skewness toward male dominated decision making from 16 23 however large differences exist amongst the three countries table 2 and the schemes appendix b in tanzania men make most decisions and this probably reflects social norms females make most decisions in zimbabwe which probably reflects that many men work away however both countries report 20 balanced decision making balanced decision making was rare in mozambique with decisions made mostly by men in one scheme and mostly by females in the scheme where a large proportion of men work away in south africa in zimbabwe female only decision making is likely if the female hh is widowed households where females make all the decisions accounted for 56 of widowed hhs compared to 18 amongst other households in mozambique and zimbabwe production type clearly influences the gender balance of decision making whereas all decisions are male dominated in tanzania across all schemes decision making about cattle is male dominated while small stock is female dominated except for mozambique these findings are consistent with the literature peters 1986 apart from small stock female decision making is highest for irrigation particularly in zimbabwe and mozambique where the proportion of all female decision making is higher than for any other production and higher than male only this is a new finding not previously reported in the literature we analyzed how respondents gender was associated with the ranking of decision making table 3 to assess whether males report decision making differently to females the majority of female respondents 74 report either female only or more female decision making whereas male respondents report male dominated or joint as many female respondents are de jure hh we excluded widowed hh and found that now 62 reported female only or more female decision making excluding widowed hh equal decision making is almost even but women still rate female decision making higher this probably reflects the prevalence of de facto female hhs in this category who have an increased role in decision making this is contrary to the findings of ellis and allison 2004 but consistent with bryceson 2002 and lastarria cornhiel 2006 reflecting this male hh respondents were more likely to be spending more time on farm hence were more involved in decision making we further tested the impact of collaborative decision making by combining more female equal and more male into one category called collaborative not reported in table 3 this analysis suggests that there were no significant differences between male and female respondents in their rating of collaborative decision making this adds nuance to booysen et al s 2013 urban findings in this rural setting the balance in collaborative decision making between a husband and wife depends on the hh s gender which in turn depends on the presence of the male in the household 4 2 modelling the influences on the dynamics of decision making overall and production types table 4 presents the results of the ordered probit decision making regression and table 5 the ols income regression the regressions have no serious multicollinearity and the use of robust standard errors mitigated the issue of heteroscedasticity the mckelvey zavoina r2 for the ordered probit models and r2 for the ols models are all satisfactory indicating overall model fitness the ordered probit regression identified a wide range of influences on the gender balance of decision making one of the strongest findings is the significant difference between the countries the comparison is tanzania this is both with respect to variations in the overall decision making index and the individual production indexes across all decision types except cattle females play a significantly greater role in zimbabwe than in tanzania in mozambique females play a significantly greater role in overall and rain fed decision making while they have a significantly lesser role in small livestock decision making where the hh was male decisions were significantly more likely to be male dominated which is consistent with the finding that in male managed farming systems men are completely or mostly controlling production and decision making doss and meinzen dick 2015 van koppen and hussain 2007 hussain 2007 other factors are also significant i the larger the percentage of farm work carried out by the hh the more males dominate rain fed and cattle decisions ii if the hh is widowed most likely a female cattle decisions are less likely to be male dominated and iii the larger the percentage of males the more men dominate small stock decision making the last finding was unexpected and suggests that the more male dominated the household the more men infringe on the traditionally female dominated area of small stock peters 1986 this study confirms the link often made in the literature between decision making and control over farmland doss et al 2014 there is a significant and negative relationship between the total size of land not owned by males only and the overall decision making index there is a similar relationship between the rain fed and irrigated areas not owned by males only and the index for rain fed and irrigated production that is females have a larger role in decision making if they formally have full or part control over the land the focus group discussions across all schemes repeatedly highlighted that men predominantly control land and that it was difficult to talk about the control of land this supports the finding of meinzen dick et al 2011 4 3 modelling the influence of the dynamics of the decision making environment on income the dynamics of decision making influenced income in several ways table 5 total income was higher if decisions were made more by females more by males or by males only the estimated magnitude was 98 86 and 142 respectively the literature suggests that de facto female headed households are the poorest households as they do not benefit from off farm incomes and have fewer assets and human resources de sousa et al 2017 safilios rothschild 1985 however our models did not find significant differences between widowed and married hhs or between single and married hhs if decisions were made by males only on farm income was higher than if decisions were made by females only estimated 199 this is probably due to the additional availability of labour however this might also reflect that some absent male hhs make decisions by mobile phone and regularly participate in farm work during weekends and critical farm periods male off farm work provides significant income allowing for the purchase of inputs and hiring of non family labour as was found in mozambique de sousa et al 2017 this potentially allows better links to markets through the household having a presence in town if decisions are made more by females or more by males off farm income is estimated at 148 or 204 higher than if decisions are made by females only these two categories of decision making reflect that male heads of households work off farm but are still involved in farm decision making there are no significant relationships between the decision making index for the individual production types and the income from these productions as is recognized in the literature ellis and allison 2004 manero 2016 off farm work is very important for household well being both for supporting farm production by financing farm inputs but also to pay for health and education reflecting this we found that the larger the proportion of farm work carried out by the hh i e the hh is working less off farm the lower the total and off farm income additionally we found that irrigation accounts for 65 of farm income and 42 of household income across the six schemes our findings show clear evidence of the complexity of households livelihood strategies and the importance of the dynamics of decision making on total on farm and off farm income this suggests that when households allocate their labour resources they make trade offs between the dryland irrigation and livestock components of their farm and their off farm activities that is they focus on maximizing their overall return rather than the return from individual livelihood strategies total income is lower when there is a larger proportion of males in the household which at first sounds counterintuitive this probably reflects that in a household with a high proportion of males there are more children attending school traditionally rural households prioritize the education of male children this leaves less time for on or off farm work by male children male children are also less productive around the house as they neither fetch water nor look after younger siblings but still require care thereby reducing women s time for farm work there are also significant country differences in income for all production types and compared to tanzania in zimbabwe farm income was lower while off farm income was higher and rain fed income was significantly lower in mozambique the influence of ownership of productive resources was as expected i the larger the rain fed area the higher the total farm and rain fed income ii the larger the irrigated area the higher the total farm and irrigation incomes iii the more cattle the higher total farm and livestock income iv the more other livestock the higher the total and other livestock incomes v the more poultry the higher the farm income vi having a borehole water pump was associated with higher total income vii having a generator was associated with higher farm and irrigated crop incomes and viii having a car motorbike or borehole water pump was associated with higher off farm income points six seven and eight suggest resource ownership increases income which allows the household to acquire more assets and increases the ability to earn money the use of motorbikes as taxis is widespread especially in tanzania a household s borehole or water pump significantly reduces the time spent fetching water this increases time available for fieldwork facilitates more irrigated crop production at the house plot and enables more time for off farm activities 4 4 focus group findings in zimbabwe both female only and mixed focus groups report that decision making about the use of water and money was joint however in both schemes the female only focus group reported that sometimes men overruled women and spent money for their own pleasure beer or cigarettes also that most household arguments were over how to spend scarce resources some women said that women made most decisions in the households where the men were absent and as long as the work was completed there was no interference from men despite the quantitative findings of predominantly male decision making it was the tanzanian women who spoke most and appeared more confident during visits and in focus groups this might suggest that women in male dominated households are active in decision making and are more interested in having substantial input and consensus rather than reporting whether a decision is joint doss et al 2014 we cannot answer definitely but it is interesting to posit whether women are under reporting their decision making involvement lastarria cornhiel 2006 potentially to support consensus and or because they are confident of their influence the discussions suggested that joint decision making was most common for irrigation management and farm work however men were mainly responsible for finding markets as found by njuki et al 2014 men primarily made the decisions about spending money with a tanzanian farmer stating that men dominate in control of income earned from irrigated crops so as to save money for investing in the next season male farmer aged 50 magozi male farmers argued that women have unnecessary expenditures such as buying new clothes and luxury things which is why they have to control income male farmer aged 24 magozi whereas women argued that they have necessary expenses e g clothes cooking tools and often secretly sell crops to obtain money these opinions lend support to the notion that african households are less likely to pool income lastarria cornhiel 2006 despite this evidence of non cooperation in both tanzania and zimbabwe women reported that the level of domestic conflict had reduced during the project as income increased and this has improved marriage and power relations between men and women female farmer aged 40 kiwere male farmer aged 48 magozi in mozambique discussions suggested that most farmers are now women as men increasingly work in towns or in south africa while some absent men make decisions in de facto female headed household women make most of the day to day decisions most women stressed that they are acting on male advice even though they do most of the fieldwork make the day to day decisions and take a separate share of the profit we share the decision about what to produce and how but most of the time he is the one leading when it is time to harvest he is always present and making the deals but i am the one keeping the money and at the end i get a small share and the rest is managed by him female farmer aged 35 silalatshani another female mentioned the women are the ones spending more time in the field but all the decisions have already been made at home the men have more decision making power in the household since i am the one in the plot i remain in control of the production but i cannot say the same about the land it is complicated to talk about the control of the land female farmer aged 79 25 de setembro while men dominate decision making women participate most in fieldwork meetings and gathering of farming information focus group discussions also repeatedly touched on the division of work within the household and many women mentioned that women have a larger role in decision making if the hh works off farm focus groups and field observations in all three countries confirm our quantitative findings that women do most of the farm work especially when it comes to irrigation in zimbabwe many mentioned that women and men grow much the same crops under irrigation however when the project introduced the notion of high value crops it was women that were most active in adopting them to increase their income to invest in farming improve food security nutrition and their children s education this is inconsistent with the literature that indicates women s existing labour roles may limit their ability to take advantage of new opportunities doss et al 2014 the uptake of high value irrigated crops represents a change of mind set from subsistence to commercial farming with part of the surplus used for education and food security bjornlund et al 2018 in addition growing higher value cash crops should increase women s bargaining power and their influence on decision making doss and meinzen dick 2015 the discussion around livestock reflects the quantitative findings and the literature peters 1985 men mainly look after cattle and donkeys while women take care of goats and chickens for example men s first priority is large livestock like cattle then consumption us women value crop production more than men somehow large livestock comes last to our priorities but we also have a saying that a homestead without chickens shows the absence of a woman female farmer aged over 65 mkoba women also reported that the introduction of soil moisture monitoring tools had allowed them to significantly reduce their time spent irrigating often by more than 50 this time has reportedly been used to tend the home garden and small livestock to improve food security and household income increase their yield through more weeding or increase their off farm income activities e g baking buns for sale income diversification empowers women and strengthens their bargaining position this supports the importance of diversified incomes as identified by manero 2016 in tanzania 5 conclusion this study explores how household decision making dynamics influence household income in six small scale irrigation schemes in southern africa while many of the traditional norms still prevail fundamental changes are emerging as the dynamic of decision making changes due to increased livelihood diversification and the introduction of high value crops household income is influenced by how a household allocates their labour resources between on farm and off farm work and the gender balance of decision making female only decision making households had the lowest total and farm income this probably reflects that de jure female headed households without the support of a husband have no off farm income and fewer labour resources households where men made all the decisions had the highest total and farm income however households with a higher female than male contribution to decision making ran a close second which probably reflects that these are de facto female headed households receiving extra income from off farm and with access to extra farm labour during critical farming periods in conclusion our findings clearly support that households decision making dynamics strongly influence total household income rather than maximizing the income from any individual component of their livelihood strategy households make trade offs between irrigation dryland and off farm work and allocate their labour resources to maximize household income hence resource allocation decisions are not always made to ensure the maximum benefits from investments in irrigation infrastructure and consequently irrigation will not realise its potential and anticipated contribution to improving rural livelihoods and food security in many african countries a fundamental paradigm shift in agricultural land and water policies is needed as well as considering net social benefits at the basin scale policies need to have a strong focus on making irrigation profitable so that it becomes a primary source of income farming households will then have confidence to reallocate resources to this activity for irrigation schemes to become profitable there needs to be a transition from growing staples to commercial crops so that household income can meet food health and educational needs policies need to facilitate basin level hydrological and environmental considerations a consolidation of farming plots into viable units security of land tenure improved market and transport linkages so crops meet market demand and attract higher prices and access to better agronomic and irrigation information including a focus on female provided education nevertheless transitioning small scale irrigation schemes into financially viable units is and will continue to be a challenging and complex process acknowledgments this study was part of the project increasing irrigation water productivity in mozambique tanzania and zimbabwe through on farm

11167,jujube ziziphus jujuba mill is one of the most optimal fruit trees for economy and ecology in many semiarid regions however with water as a scarce resource the strategy for irrigation and applied nitrogen napp management need to be identified the goal of this project was to determine the effects of irrigation and napp on jujube yield water use efficiency wue and agronomic nitrogen use efficiency anue and the optimal level of soil water content swc and napp for jujube under surge root irrigation sri in a semiarid region experiments were conducted during the jujube growing seasons may october of 2014 and 2015 in northern shaanxi in china that included three levels of swc i e 60 85 θ i1 mass water content simplified as θ 50 75 θ i2 40 65 θ i3 and four levels of napp i e 0 75 n1 0 50 n2 0 25 n3 and 0 00 kg n plant 1 n4 the treatments were arranged in a strip plot design with complete randomized blocks with three replications for both years irrigation and napp had significant p 0 05 effects on yield wue and anue while the interaction effect of irrigation and napp on wue and anue was significant p 0 05 and significant on yield in 2014 but not in 2015 in both years maximum yield 10 16 and 9 81 kg plant 1 respectively occurred in 60 85 θ and 0 50 kg n plant 1 maximum wue were 3 75 4 43kg m 3 when swc level and napp were 40 65 θ and 0 50 kg n plant 1 while maximum anue were 2 21 2 88 kg kg 1 when swc level and napp rate were 50 75 θ and 0 25 kg n plant 1 respectively the dualistic and quadric regression equations of irrigation amount and rate of napp indicate that the yield wue and anue of jujube cannot reach the maximum at the same time irrigation napp input optimization model shows that three combinations of likelihood functions can all be used for the comprehensive management of sri for jujube considering the coupling effects of irrigation and napp on yield wue and anue in 2014 and 2015 the swc level shall be controlled in 50 75 θ and the napp rate is 0 42 kg n plant 1 which can be as the suitable strategy of irrigation and napp management for the maximum comprehensive benefits of yield wue and anue for jujube under sri in a semiarid region keywords surge root irrigation yield water use efficiency agronomic nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction irrigation and nitrogen management play a significant role in crop growth development and ultimately yield in semiarid regions considering the effects of irrigation and nitrogen optimizing irrigation amount and n applied napp on crop are critical for sustainable agricultural management mahajan et al 2012 because of lack of sufficient water for irrigation high irrigation costs high fertilizer expenses and environmental concerns such as environmental pollution due to excessive use of napp badr et al 2012 seassau et al 2010 according to some phytochemical studier jujube fruit contains various constituents such as protein vitamins sugar organic acids and minerals which play a significant role in prevention of oxidative stress and it has been reported to make a significant decline in triglyceride ldl and cholesterol levels hoseinifar et al 2018 shirdel et al 2009 due to its appealing taste and flavor jujube fruit is appreciated by the consumers and has long been used in traditional medicine while also can be processed into jujube juice jujube cake and other products yao 2013 ji et al 2017 jujube tree is the main fruit tree grown in northern shaanxi province china which is cultivated over 90 000 ha because of its multiple uses easy management early bearing and wide adaptations to environmental conditions she et al 2015 galindo et al 2015 but the shortage of water resource and the poor soil in the regions seriously restrict the development of jujube industry gao et al 2018a proper irrigation is essential to achieve an acceptable jujube yield and associated revenue surge root irrigation sri is a new technology of micro irrigation which is similar with subsurface drip irrigation sdi it can directly send the water and fertilizer to crop roots and has the advantages of small evaporation long service life and labor saving etc ismail and almarshadi 2013 wu et al 2010 compared with sdi sri has a larger flow wider flow channel of the emitter better hydraulic performance and anti blocking ability which is especially suitable for the irrigation of economic trees niu 2013 several studies have assessed the advantages of sri in jujube cultivating zhang et al 2010 che et al 2012 nitrogen is a dominant nutrient for the growth and productivity of crop massignam et al 2009 sincik et al 2013 without applied n napp the crop yield should be limited by the available nitrogen within the soil nitrogen can improve the root system so that water and nitrogen absorption are facilitated hence efficient use of napp in crop production is critical for obtaining optimum crop productivity sandhu et al 2012 djaman et al 2018 wu et al 2018 various studies of the effect of different levels of napp on crop have showed that this element is an important factor affecting the crop s growth yield and quality wang et al 2018 geng et al 2016 some of these results have been contradictory especially with respect to proper rate of napp the common conlusion therefore is that napp should be applied in accordance with the amount of soil water sincik et al 2013 the understanding of the coupling effects of irrigation and napp along with the crop s ability to efficiently use these resources is of crucial importance for improving the use efficiency of water and napp while maintaining high yield the coupling effects of irrigation and napp on maize and rice which were cultivated in clay loam gheysari et al 2009 haefele et al 2008 tomato that was grown in india with a sandy loam soil texture hebbar et al 2004 have all shown that there is an optimal level of napp for each irrigation level and proper irrigation amount will reduce n loss and enhance crop growth and yield zotarelli et al 2009 however sri is a new irrigation technology there are only a few studies on the effects of irrigation on jujube while the coupling effects of irrigation and napp on jujube under sri have not been reported which restricts the popularization and application of sri in production thus this study was conducted with the following objectives i to quantify and to describe the response of yield wue and anue to irrigation amounts and napp rates ii to establish the quantitative relation of yield water and napp utilization efficiency and irrigation napp input iii to determine the optimal level of irrigation and napp to yield wue and anue based on the comprehensive benefits for jujube which can achieve the purpose of high yield and water and napp saving under sri in a semiarid region 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental location and growth conditions field experiments were conducted during the jujube growing seasons may october of 2014 and 2015 the experiments were located at the jujube demonstration orchard with micro irrigation in the yuanzhi mountains yulin city shaanxi province 37 39 38 05 n 109 49 110 29 e this area is a typical hilly gully region of the loess plateau which has a semiarid climate and the soil of the experimental location is classified as sandy loam with good hydraulic properties gao et al 2018b based on 30 years meteorological data 1986 2015 in jujube growing seasons the annual effective rainfalls at 25 50 75 and 95 were 352 283 9 235 7 and 201 6 mm while 307 6 and 185 0 mm in 2014 and 2015 table 1 which belonged to a normal and a drought year respectively the highest mean daily temperatures in 2014 and 2015 were 28 53 and 31 19 c respectively the daily mean temperature was 15 c for 144 days in 2014 and 140 days in 2015 fig 1 moreover the groundwater was more than 50 m below the ground level in the experimental location table 2 is the distribution of soil particle sizes and physicochemical parameters 2 2 experimental design the variety of jujube is pear jujube which was planted on april 2008 with a plant density of 1665 plants ha 1 and the height was 2 0 2 5 m jujube growth has four stages germination frondescence flowering fruit bearing fruit filling and fruit maturation the timing of these stages varies annually but generally germination frondescence is from early may to early june flowering fruit bearing is from mid june to mid july fruit filling is from late july to mid september and maturation is from late september to mid october respectively more than 90 of the tree absorbent roots 2 mm in diameter were distributed within the depth of 60 cm ma et al 2014 therefore the depth of swc controlled in this study was 60 cm pear jujube trees are drought tolerant and suitable swc is 40 85 θ mass water content simplified as θ dai 2013 and the local jujube farmers often use a rate of urea of 0 50 kg n plant 1 based on this the experimental treatments were a combination of three irrigation levels and four levels of napp three levels of irrigation amounts were applied based on swc i e 60 85 θ i1 50 75 θ i2 40 65 θ i3 and four napp levels were 0 75 n1 0 50 n2 0 25 n3 and 0 00 n4 kg n plant 1 for a total of 12 treatments each treatment contained three jujubes and arranged in a strip plot design according to complete randomized blocks with three replications we selected 108 healthy vigorous and uniformly sized jujubes with isolated trees were set between each treatment standard agronomic measures such as trimming girdling spraying insecticide and weed control were the same for all treatments the irrigation water was obtained from a deep well that had a suitable water quality for jujube growth a water meter nominal diameter 25 mm was used to control the irrigation levels for each treatment and a venturi fertilizer injector was used to apply napp in the form of urea 46 7 n via irrigation water by sri reference to wang et al 2008 a mixture of monopotassium phosphate 0 60 kg plant 1 potassium sulfate 0 60 kg plant 1 and 50 of napp of the corresponding treatment was applied as a basal fertilizer in mid april while the other 50 of napp was applied at the end of the germination frondescence stage in both years jujube didn t irrigated during the flowering fruit bearing stage to prevent excessive growth and the physiological activities of the trees during fruit maturation was slow due to the rapidly decreasing temperature at the end of the growing season so not irrigated also each jujube had two emitters 25 cm from the trunk buried at a depth of 35 cm and positioned east and west of the tree figs 2 and 3 a 5 0 l h 1 flow rate was maintained for each emitter and the wetting ratio was 0 3 volume ratio the swc and napp rate for each growth stage of the jujube are shown in table 3 2 3 monitoring contents and calculating items 2 3 1 meteorological factors air temperature relative air humidity atmospheric pressure intensity of solar radiation wind velocity wind direction and rainfall were recorded by an automated weather station every minute record 1 time for every 30 min 2 3 2 soil water content swc swc was measured at soil depths of 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm with trime t3 tubular tdr imko ltd de during the germination frondescence and fruit filling stages we calculated the average volumetric swc in 60 cm and converted it to the mass water content 2 3 3 yield the yield of jujube from each treatment was weighed immediately after harvesting the harvest dates were october 11 12 in 2014 and october 15 16 in 2015 2 3 4 evapotranspiration etc and wue 1 etc mm was calculated as oliver et al 2014 1 etc pr u i d r δw where pr u i d r and δw are effective rainfall recharge of underground water irrigation

technique using spss statistical software v 21 0 spss inc 2013 data from each year were analyzed separately the significance of the treatment effect was determined using the f test and comparisons of means were carried out using the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 applied water and etc the theoretical optimal amount of a single irrigation is 11 979 mm but the actual amount is 12 00 mm for the convenience of management i1 i2 and i3 were applied 15 12 and 7 times in 2014 with total amounts of 180 144 and 84 mm respectively i1 i2 and i3 were applied 19 16 and 10 times in 2015 with total amounts of 228 192 and 120 mm respectively when the irrigation amounts were i1 i2 and i3 the etc were 479 6 450 3 and 391 5 mm in 2014 and 412 9 376 9 304 9 mm in 2015 respectively table 4 3 2 effects of irrigation on yield wue and anue the results indicated that irrigation amounts had a significant effect on yield p 0 01 wue p 0 01 and anue p 0 05 in 2014 and p 0 01 in 2015 in both years as the increase of irrigation amounts the yield of jujube increased gradually while the wue declined and the anue was the highest when irrigation level was i2 except for i2n1 and i2n2 in 2014 table 4 the yield and wue were more sensitive to an increase in irrigation 3 3 effects of napp levels on yield wue and anue the yield wue and anue were significantly affected by napp levels p 0 01 in 2014 and 2015 in both years with the increment of napp levels from n4 to n2 the yields increased by 9 36 13 22 10 85 16 83 respectively but reduced when napp levels from n2 to n1 wue increased by 8 62 13 29 10 91 16 58 respectively when napp levels from n4 to n2 and reduced from n2 to n1 the yield and wue showed a slightly stronger response to the increase in n however the anue was the highest when napp level was n3 in 2014 except for i1n3 and highest at n2 treatment in 2015 except for i2n2 table 4 3 4 interaction effects of irrigation and napp levels on yield wue and anue during both years irrigation and napp levels had significant interaction effects on wue p 0 05 and anue p 0 05 in 2014 and p 0 01 in 2015 and significant on yield in 2014 but not in 2015 table 4 in both years the highest yield occurred at i1n2 treatment with 10 16 and 9 81 kg plant 1 the highest wue occurred at i3n2 treatment with 3 75 and 4 43 kg m 3 and the anue treated by i2n3 was the highest which were 2 21 and 2 88 kg kg 1 respectively table 4 3 5 model development and evaluation several simple models were developed based on the data obtained in two years to predict the yield wue and anue as a function of irrigation amount and napp rate after designing the models in matlab v 7 14 matlab inc 2012 toolbox the best model was selected based on statistical strength simplicity investment of irrigation water and napp and the regression equations for jujube yield wue and anue were shown in table 5 the predicted and measured data also had a signification correlation r2 0 88 rmse 0 40 and p 0 05 hence these models were able to predict the yield wue and anue with an acceptable accuracy when i1 and i3 were the upper and lower limits of swc and n1 and n4 were the upper and lower limits of napp in 2014 and 2015 respectively taking the amount of irrigation and napp rate as the independent variable the yield wue and anue of jujube were employed as the response variables based on the least squares method the data were analyzed and a binary quadratic regression equation was established table 5 to calculate the amounts of irrigation and napp needed to maximize the above parameters table 6 it was found difficult to obtain the maximum jujube yield wue and anue simultaneously the maximum jujube yield of 10 80 and 9 84 kg plant 1 were achieved when 1 06 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 59 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2014 and 1 31 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 58 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2015 were applied respectively whilst the wue were maximized at 3 72 and 4 44 kg m 3 with the application of 0 66 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 60 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2014 and 0 88 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation and 0 61 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2015 respectively the largest anue of 2 22 and 2 55 kg kg 1 were obtained when 0 69 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 40 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2014 and 1 19 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 33 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2015 were applied respectively table 6 3 6 the strategy for irrigation napp management based on comprehensive benefits increasing jujube yield is of great significance to increase the farmers income while increasing wue and anue can help farmers reduce the inputs of irrigation and napp which would also be of great benefit to the sustainable development of agriculture because the yield wue and anue could not reach their maxima at the same time and there must have a choice in the actual jujube cultivation so the suitable strategy of irrigation and napp management for maximizing the comprehensive benefits of yield wue and anue for jujube under sri must be determined which can achieve the purpose of high yield and irrigation water and napp saving combinations of likelihood functions were used for parameter estimation he 2008 of which c1 was the addition combination c2 was the multiplication combination and c3 was the mean square root combination and were calculated as 5 c 1 1 k i 1 k y i 6 c 2 i 1 k y i 7 c 3 1 k i 1 k y i 2 1 2 where yi is relative yield relative wue or relative anue and k is the number of targets 3 for this test yield wue and anue have different units that cannot be directly compared therefore needed to be normalized that is to use the yield wue and anue of respective treatment to divide the maximum value to get the relative yield the relative wue and the corresponding anue assume that the yield wue and anue have same weights for the three combinations eqs 5 7 the investment of water and napp and the targets of c1 c2 and c3 can be obtained fig 4 in 2014 and 2015 the irrigation amounts difference of three combinations was within 5 and the difference of the jujube napp rate in c1 combination was the minimum therefore c1 combination can be considered better assume that the irrigating frequency of optimal irrigation amount was the same as i2 the corresponding swc of optimal irrigation levels was 50 72 θ and 50 75 θ in 2014 and 2015 respectively which doesn t exceed 3 of the difference of i2 therefore it is reasonable that the irrigating frequency of optimal irrigation amount was the same as i2 through the analysis when the swc is 50 75 θ and napp rate is 0 42 kg n plant 1 compared with c1 the amplitude of variation of yield wue and anue is smaller than 5 in both years table7 integrate the yield wue and anue analyses under sri for jujube in 2014 and 2015 the suitable strategy of irrigation napp management which is applicable for sdi of jujube in north of shaanxi is to control the swc within 50 75 θ napp rate of 0 42 kg n plant 1 and it may achieve the multiple targets of water saving fertilizer saving and yield increase 4 discussion this paper studies the effects of irrigation napp supply on jujube yield and water and nitrogen utilization efficiency and finally determines the soil moisture level and napp rate for maximizing the comprehensive benefits of yield wue and anue under sri for jujube through irrigation napp input optimization model to provide the scientific basis for jujube field management qiang et al 2015 reported that the jujube yield ranged from 9 05 to 12 22 kg plant 1 while the wue of jujube ranged from 3 70 to 4 30 kg m 3 reported by zhang et al 2010 in a semiarid region under sri similar to the range reported in our study 4 1 effects of irrigation on yield wue and anue water had a significant effect p 0 05 on yield wue and anue of jujube in 2014 and 2015 table 3 and the most positive response to an increase in irrigation was the yield followed by wue and anue improving the yield is one of the main purposes of irrigation napp management hou et al 2013 as expected the yield increased gradually along with the amount of irrigation increased when the amount of irrigation is within a reasonable range and it has been confirmed by other studies and also showed that a water deficit decreased yield sezenet et al 2011 galindo et al 2015 but the growth rate was different among different stages which was significant when from i3 to i2 while not significant from i2 to i1 the wue was decreased as the increase of irrigation amounts and not significant in the stage of i3 to i2 while significant from i2 to i1 the highest of anue occurred at i2 in both years similar results have been found for other crops including potato badr et al 2012 onion patel and rajput 2009 and tomato ismail et al 2008 it indicated that sri can increase the yield wue and anue but the irrigation amount must be suitable this was because as the increase of irrigation amount the proportion of soil water and air was becoming small gradually which can affect the root system s growth characteristics and then affect crop yield wue and anue bhattarai et al 2008 abuarab et al 2013 4 2 effects of napp on yield wue and anue n is the main constituent element of chlorophyll when the crop is lack of n the chlorophyll content in the body will be decreased along with the weakness of photosynthesis intensity and the reduction of photosynthetic product so the crop yield will be reduced chen et al 2011 napp had a very significant effect p 0 01 on yield wue and anue table 4 similar to what was found by shu et al 2016 of jujube trees applying different rates of napp under the condition of straw mulching in the loess plateau the highest yield and wue were obtained for n2 level 0 50 kg n plant 1 yang 2011 showed that considering the yield fruit quality and wue of jujube trees the napp should been controlled in the range of 0 49 0 82 kg n plant 1 under surface drip irrigation in the loess plateau our result is within this range the rate of napp from n3 to n2 could increase jujube yield and wue significantly p 0 05 but decreased from n2 to n1 it indicated that only a reasonable level of napp can improve the yield and wue while excessive n application not only cannot increase the yield but also reduce the wue appropriate rate of napp can effectively increase the photosynthesis rate of crops promote the optimal distribution of crop photosynthetic products among different organs of crops and ultimately increase crop yield and when the napp rate exceeds the reasonable range although the biomass and nitrogen uptake of the crop are high but the proportion of photosynthetic products distributed to the reproductive organs decreases which would result in a decrease in yield xue et al 2015 yao et al 2015 other scholars have the similar conclusion on other crops such as orange cantarella et al 2003 and grape boman 1995 the influence of n level on anue was different between two years it may cause by climate difference between two years 4 3 interaction effects of irrigation and napp on yield wue and anue the interaction effects of water and napp on wue and anue were significant and significant on yield in 2014 but not in 2015 the difference of effect on yield may be due to the difference in climate between the two years some researchers have reported that the interaction effects of water and n on yield and water and n utilization efficiency of other crop were all significant such as sunflower kiani et al 2016 and tomato du et al 2017 different with this study in addition to irrigation method the crop type and soil condition may be responsible for these contradictory results as well as meteorological factors 4 4 model development and evaluation the models that were developed in this study show the importance of the interaction of water and napp for estimating the yield wue and anue these models can be used as a reference for performance optimization for similar climatic conditions the model showed that there were optimum irrigation amount and rate of napp which can get the maximum of yield wue and anue increasing the irrigation amount and napp higher than these optimum levels did not improve yield wue and anue and in some cases had an opposite effect when the yield is highest the wue reduced 5 40 8 82 than maximum wue while the anue reduced 38 75 31 44 than maximum anue in both years respectively it means that the risk of environmental pollution caused by loss of n is very high when the yield is the highest therefore it s very necessary to determine the strategy for irrigation napp management based on the economic and environmental benefits 4 5 the strategy for irrigation n management based on comprehensive benefits previous research has shown that the maximum likelihood method can be used to solute the problem of comprehensive benefits wu et al 2015 which is confirmed by this study the results show that control the swc within 50 75 θ n application rate of 0 42 kg n plant 1 may achieve the multiple targets of water saving fertilizer saving and yield increase the rate of napp decreased compared with the actual napp rate of jujube growers but this article assumed the weights of yield wue and anue was same in actual production people should focus on the actual situation 5 conclusions irrigation levels and n rates are two of the most important factors for optimizing yield wue and anue of jujube in a semiarid region our results with jujube revealed that irrigation amounts and napp levels all had significant effects on the yield wue and anue of jujube and the interaction effects of irrigation amounts and napp levels had significant effects on wue and anue and significant on yield in 2014 but not in 2015 the study demonstrated that yield wue and anue were determined not only by irrigation levels but also by the rate of napp and there was an optimal level of napp for each level of irrigation therefore the rate of napp should be adjusted to the irrigation level as shown in the present study it was different to obtain the maximum yield wue and anue simultaneously the regression equations showed controlling the swc within 50 75 θ and napp rate of 0 42 kg n plant 1 can considered as the best strategy for irrigation and napp management under jujube sri in a semiarid region where water is a limiting factor this will result in maximum the comprehensive benefits of yield wue and anue which can enhance crop production in water stress scarce environments further studies are needed to evaluate the behavior of crops under irrigation with different cultivars soil moisture conservation options such as tillage planting methods and mulching and different forms of n to develop irrigation scheduling and fertilizer guidelines for sri tailored to site specific conditions acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key r d program no

p 0 05 effects on yield wue and anue while the interaction effect of irrigation and napp on wue and anue was significant p 0 05 and significant on yield in 2014 but not in 2015 in both years maximum yield 10 16 and 9 81 kg plant 1 respectively occurred in 60 85 θ and 0 50 kg n plant 1 maximum wue were 3 75 4 43kg m 3 when swc level and napp were 40 65 θ and 0 50 kg n plant 1 while maximum anue were 2 21 2 88 kg kg 1 when swc level and napp rate were 50 75 θ and 0 25 kg n plant 1 respectively the dualistic and quadric regression equations of irrigation amount and rate of napp indicate that the yield wue and anue of jujube cannot reach the maximum at the same time irrigation napp input optimization model shows that three combinations of likelihood functions can all be used for the comprehensive management of sri for jujube considering the coupling effects of irrigation and napp on yield wue and anue in 2014 and 2015 the swc level shall be controlled in 50 75 θ and the napp rate is 0 42 kg n plant 1 which can be as the suitable strategy of irrigation and napp management for the maximum comprehensive benefits of yield wue and anue for jujube under sri in a semiarid region keywords surge root irrigation yield water use efficiency agronomic nitrogen use efficiency 1 introduction irrigation and nitrogen management play a significant role in crop growth development and ultimately yield in semiarid regions considering the effects of irrigation and nitrogen optimizing irrigation amount and n applied napp on crop are critical for sustainable agricultural management mahajan et al 2012 because of lack of sufficient water for irrigation high irrigation costs high fertilizer expenses and environmental concerns such as environmental pollution due to excessive use of napp badr et al 2012 seassau et al 2010 according to some phytochemical studier jujube fruit contains various constituents such as protein vitamins sugar organic acids and minerals which play a significant role in prevention of oxidative stress and it has been reported to make a significant decline in triglyceride ldl and cholesterol levels hoseinifar et al 2018 shirdel et al 2009 due to its appealing taste and flavor jujube fruit is appreciated by the consumers and has long been used in traditional medicine while also can be processed into jujube juice jujube cake and other products yao 2013 ji et al 2017 jujube tree is the main fruit tree grown in northern shaanxi province china which is cultivated over 90 000 ha because of its multiple uses easy management early bearing and wide adaptations to environmental conditions she et al 2015 galindo et al 2015 but the shortage of water resource and the poor soil in the regions seriously restrict the development of jujube industry gao et al 2018a proper irrigation is essential to achieve an acceptable jujube yield and associated revenue surge root irrigation sri is a new technology of micro irrigation which is similar with subsurface drip irrigation sdi it can directly send the water and fertilizer to crop roots and has the advantages of small evaporation long service life and labor saving etc ismail and almarshadi 2013 wu et al 2010 compared with sdi sri has a larger flow wider flow channel of the emitter better hydraulic performance and anti blocking ability which is especially suitable for the irrigation of economic trees niu 2013 several studies have assessed the advantages of sri in jujube cultivating zhang et al 2010 che et al 2012 nitrogen is a dominant nutrient for the growth and productivity of crop massignam et al 2009 sincik et al 2013 without applied n napp the crop yield should be limited by the available nitrogen within the soil nitrogen can improve the root system so that water and nitrogen absorption are facilitated hence efficient use of napp in crop production is critical for obtaining optimum crop productivity sandhu et al 2012 djaman et al 2018 wu et al 2018 various studies of the effect of different levels of napp on crop have showed that this element is an important factor affecting the crop s growth yield and quality wang et al 2018 geng et al 2016 some of these results have been contradictory especially with respect to proper rate of napp the common conlusion therefore is that napp should be applied in accordance with the amount of soil water sincik et al 2013 the understanding of the coupling effects of irrigation and napp along with the crop s ability to efficiently use these resources is of crucial importance for improving the use efficiency of water and napp while maintaining high yield the coupling effects of irrigation and napp on maize and rice which were cultivated in clay loam gheysari et al 2009 haefele et al 2008 tomato that was grown in india with a sandy loam soil texture hebbar et al 2004 have all shown that there is an optimal level of napp for each irrigation level and proper irrigation amount will reduce n loss and enhance crop growth and yield zotarelli et al 2009 however sri is a new irrigation technology there are only a few studies on the effects of irrigation on jujube while the coupling effects of irrigation and napp on jujube under sri have not been reported which restricts the popularization and application of sri in production thus this study was conducted with the following objectives i to quantify and to describe the response of yield wue and anue to irrigation amounts and napp rates ii to establish the quantitative relation of yield water and napp utilization efficiency and irrigation napp input iii to determine the optimal level of irrigation and napp to yield wue and anue based on the comprehensive benefits for jujube which can achieve the purpose of high yield and water and napp saving under sri in a semiarid region 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental location and growth conditions field experiments were conducted during the jujube growing seasons may october of 2014 and 2015 the experiments were located at the jujube demonstration orchard with micro irrigation in the yuanzhi mountains yulin city shaanxi province 37 39 38 05 n 109 49 110 29 e this area is a typical hilly gully region of the loess plateau which has a semiarid climate and the soil of the experimental location is classified as sandy loam with good hydraulic properties gao et al 2018b based on 30 years meteorological data 1986 2015 in jujube growing seasons the annual effective rainfalls at 25 50 75 and 95 were 352 283 9 235 7 and 201 6 mm while 307 6 and 185 0 mm in 2014 and 2015 table 1 which belonged to a normal and a drought year respectively the highest mean daily temperatures in 2014 and 2015 were 28 53 and 31 19 c respectively the daily mean temperature was 15 c for 144 days in 2014 and 140 days in 2015 fig 1 moreover the groundwater was more than 50 m below the ground level in the experimental location table 2 is the distribution of soil particle sizes and physicochemical parameters 2 2 experimental design the variety of jujube is pear jujube which was planted on april 2008 with a plant density of 1665 plants ha 1 and the height was 2 0 2 5 m jujube growth has four stages germination frondescence flowering fruit bearing fruit filling and fruit maturation the timing of these stages varies annually but generally germination frondescence is from early may to early june flowering fruit bearing is from mid june to mid july fruit filling is from late july to mid september and maturation is from late september to mid october respectively more than 90 of the tree absorbent roots 2 mm in diameter were distributed within the depth of 60 cm ma et al 2014 therefore the depth of swc controlled in this study was 60 cm pear jujube trees are drought tolerant and suitable swc is 40 85 θ mass water content simplified as θ dai 2013 and the local jujube farmers often use a rate of urea of 0 50 kg n plant 1 based on this the experimental treatments were a combination of three irrigation levels and four levels of napp three levels of irrigation amounts were applied based on swc i e 60 85 θ i1 50 75 θ i2 40 65 θ i3 and four napp levels were 0 75 n1 0 50 n2 0 25 n3 and 0 00 n4 kg n plant 1 for a total of 12 treatments each treatment contained three jujubes and arranged in a strip plot design according to complete randomized blocks with three replications we selected 108 healthy vigorous and uniformly sized jujubes with isolated trees were set between each treatment standard agronomic measures such as trimming girdling spraying insecticide and weed control were the same for all treatments the irrigation water was obtained from a deep well that had a suitable water quality for jujube growth a water meter nominal diameter 25 mm was used to control the irrigation levels for each treatment and a venturi fertilizer injector was used to apply napp in the form of urea 46 7 n via irrigation water by sri reference to wang et al 2008 a mixture of monopotassium phosphate 0 60 kg plant 1 potassium sulfate 0 60 kg plant 1 and 50 of napp of the corresponding treatment was applied as a basal fertilizer in mid april while the other 50 of napp was applied at the end of the germination frondescence stage in both years jujube didn t irrigated during the flowering fruit bearing stage to prevent excessive growth and the physiological activities of the trees during fruit maturation was slow due to the rapidly decreasing temperature at the end of the growing season so not irrigated also each jujube had two emitters 25 cm from the trunk buried at a depth of 35 cm and positioned east and west of the tree figs 2 and 3 a 5 0 l h 1 flow rate was maintained for each emitter and the wetting ratio was 0 3 volume ratio the swc and napp rate for each growth stage of the jujube are shown in table 3 2 3 monitoring contents and calculating items 2 3 1 meteorological factors air temperature relative air humidity atmospheric pressure intensity of solar radiation wind velocity wind direction and rainfall were recorded by an automated weather station every minute record 1 time for every 30 min 2 3 2 soil water content swc swc was measured at soil depths of 10 20 30 40 and 60 cm with trime t3 tubular tdr imko ltd de during the germination frondescence and fruit filling stages we calculated the average volumetric swc in 60 cm and converted it to the mass water content 2 3 3 yield the yield of jujube from each treatment was weighed immediately after harvesting the harvest dates were october 11 12 in 2014 and october 15 16 in 2015 2 3 4 evapotranspiration etc and wue 1 etc mm was calculated as oliver et al 2014 1 etc pr u i d r δw where pr u i d r and δw are effective rainfall recharge of underground water irrigation deep percolation runoff and the difference of swc between the beginning and the end of the experiment mm respectively the underground water at experimental location was over 50 m and no runoff was generated during the growing season so u and r were neglected eq 1 could thus be simplified as 2 etc pr i d δw 2 wue kg m 3 was calculated as payero et al 2008 3 wue y etc where y is yield kg plant 1

corresponding irrigaition treatment kg plant 1 and fapp is the amount of urea applied kg n plant 1 2 3 6 statistical analyses the data were analyzed with the help of analysis of variance anova technique using spss statistical software v 21 0 spss inc 2013 data from each year were analyzed separately the significance of the treatment effect was determined using the f test and comparisons of means were carried out using the least significant difference lsd at the 5 level of significance 3 results 3 1 applied water and etc the theoretical optimal amount of a single irrigation is 11 979 mm but the actual amount is 12 00 mm for the convenience of management i1 i2 and i3 were applied 15 12 and 7 times in 2014 with total amounts of 180 144 and 84 mm respectively i1 i2 and i3 were applied 19 16 and 10 times in 2015 with total amounts of 228 192 and 120 mm respectively when the irrigation amounts were i1 i2 and i3 the etc were 479 6 450 3 and 391 5 mm in 2014 and 412 9 376 9 304 9 mm in 2015 respectively table 4 3 2 effects of irrigation on yield wue and anue the results indicated that irrigation amounts had a significant effect on yield p 0 01 wue p 0 01 and anue p 0 05 in 2014 and p 0 01 in 2015 in both years as the increase of irrigation amounts the yield of jujube increased gradually while the wue declined and the anue was the highest when irrigation level was i2 except for i2n1 and i2n2 in 2014 table 4 the yield and wue were more sensitive to an increase in irrigation 3 3 effects of napp levels on yield wue and anue the yield wue and anue were significantly affected by napp levels p 0 01 in 2014 and 2015 in both years with the increment of napp levels from n4 to n2 the yields increased by 9 36 13 22 10 85 16 83 respectively but reduced when napp levels from n2 to n1 wue increased by 8 62 13 29 10 91 16 58 respectively when napp levels from n4 to n2 and reduced from n2 to n1 the yield and wue showed a slightly stronger response to the increase in n however the anue was the highest when napp level was n3 in 2014 except for i1n3 and highest at n2 treatment in 2015 except for i2n2 table 4 3 4 interaction effects of irrigation and napp levels on yield wue and anue during both years irrigation and napp levels had significant interaction effects on wue p 0 05 and anue p 0 05 in 2014 and p 0 01 in 2015 and significant on yield in 2014 but not in 2015 table 4 in both years the highest yield occurred at i1n2 treatment with 10 16 and 9 81 kg plant 1 the highest wue occurred at i3n2 treatment with 3 75 and 4 43 kg m 3 and the anue treated by i2n3 was the highest which were 2 21 and 2 88 kg kg 1 respectively table 4 3 5 model development and evaluation several simple models were developed based on the data obtained in two years to predict the yield wue and anue as a function of irrigation amount and napp rate after designing the models in matlab v 7 14 matlab inc 2012 toolbox the best model was selected based on statistical strength simplicity investment of irrigation water and napp and the regression equations for jujube yield wue and anue were shown in table 5 the predicted and measured data also had a signification correlation r2 0 88 rmse 0 40 and p 0 05 hence these models were able to predict the yield wue and anue with an acceptable accuracy when i1 and i3 were the upper and lower limits of swc and n1 and n4 were the upper and lower limits of napp in 2014 and 2015 respectively taking the amount of irrigation and napp rate as the independent variable the yield wue and anue of jujube were employed as the response variables based on the least squares method the data were analyzed and a binary quadratic regression equation was established table 5 to calculate the amounts of irrigation and napp needed to maximize the above parameters table 6 it was found difficult to obtain the maximum jujube yield wue and anue simultaneously the maximum jujube yield of 10 80 and 9 84 kg plant 1 were achieved when 1 06 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 59 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2014 and 1 31 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 58 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2015 were applied respectively whilst the wue were maximized at 3 72 and 4 44 kg m 3 with the application of 0 66 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 60 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2014 and 0 88 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation and 0 61 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2015 respectively the largest anue of 2 22 and 2 55 kg kg 1 were obtained when 0 69 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 40 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2014 and 1 19 m 3 plant 1 of irrigation water and 0 33 kg n plant 1 of napp rate in 2015 were applied respectively table 6 3 6 the strategy for irrigation napp management based on comprehensive benefits increasing jujube yield is of great significance to increase the farmers income while increasing wue and anue can help farmers reduce the inputs of irrigation and napp which would also be of great benefit to the sustainable development of agriculture because the yield wue and anue could not reach their maxima at the same time and there must have a choice in the actual jujube cultivation so the suitable strategy of irrigation and napp management for maximizing the comprehensive benefits of yield wue and anue for jujube under sri must be determined which can achieve the purpose of high yield and irrigation water and napp saving combinations of likelihood functions were used for parameter estimation he 2008 of which c1 was the addition combination c2 was the multiplication combination and c3 was the mean square root combination and were calculated as 5 c 1 1 k i 1 k y i 6 c 2 i 1 k y i 7 c 3 1 k i 1 k y i 2 1 2 where yi is relative yield relative wue or relative anue and k is the number of targets 3 for this test yield wue and anue have different units that cannot be directly compared therefore needed to be normalized that is to use the yield wue and anue of respective treatment to divide the maximum value to get the relative yield the relative wue and the corresponding anue assume that the yield wue and anue have same weights for the three combinations eqs 5 7 the investment of water and napp and the targets of c1 c2 and c3 can be obtained fig 4 in 2014 and 2015 the irrigation amounts difference of three combinations was within 5 and the difference of the jujube napp rate in c1 combination was the minimum therefore c1 combination can be considered better assume that the irrigating frequency of optimal irrigation amount was the same as i2 the corresponding swc of optimal irrigation levels was 50 72 θ and 50 75 θ in 2014 and 2015 respectively which doesn t exceed 3 of the difference of i2 therefore it is reasonable that the irrigating frequency of optimal irrigation amount was the same as i2 through the analysis when the swc is 50 75 θ and napp rate is 0 42 kg n plant 1 compared with c1 the amplitude of variation of yield wue and anue is smaller than 5 in both years table7 integrate the yield wue and anue analyses under sri for jujube in 2014 and 2015 the suitable strategy of irrigation napp management which is applicable for sdi of jujube in north of shaanxi is to control the swc within 50 75 θ napp rate of 0 42 kg n plant 1 and it may achieve the multiple targets of water saving fertilizer saving and yield increase 4 discussion this paper studies the effects of irrigation napp supply on jujube yield and water and nitrogen utilization efficiency and finally determines the soil moisture level and napp rate for maximizing the comprehensive benefits of yield wue and anue under sri for jujube through irrigation napp input optimization model to provide the scientific basis for jujube field management qiang et al 2015 reported that the jujube yield ranged from 9 05 to 12 22 kg plant 1 while the wue of jujube ranged from 3 70 to 4 30 kg m 3 reported by zhang et al 2010 in a semiarid region under sri similar to the range reported in our study 4 1 effects of irrigation on yield wue and anue water had a significant effect p 0 05 on yield wue and anue of jujube in 2014 and 2015 table 3 and the most positive response to an increase in irrigation was the yield followed by wue and anue improving the yield is one of the main purposes of irrigation napp management hou et al 2013 as expected the yield increased gradually along with the amount of irrigation increased when the amount of irrigation is within a reasonable range and it has been confirmed by other studies and also showed that a water deficit decreased yield sezenet et al 2011 galindo et al 2015 but the growth rate was different among different stages which was significant when from i3 to i2 while not significant from i2 to i1 the wue was decreased as the increase of irrigation amounts and not significant in the stage of i3 to i2 while significant from i2 to i1 the highest of anue occurred at i2 in both years similar results have been found for other crops including potato badr et al 2012 onion patel and rajput 2009 and tomato ismail et al 2008 it indicated that sri can increase the yield wue and anue but the irrigation amount must be suitable this was because as the increase of irrigation amount the proportion of soil water and air was becoming small gradually which can affect the root system s growth characteristics and then affect crop yield wue and anue bhattarai et al 2008 abuarab et al 2013 4 2 effects of napp on yield wue and anue n is the main constituent element of chlorophyll when the crop is lack of n the chlorophyll content in the body will be decreased along with the weakness of photosynthesis intensity and the reduction of photosynthetic product so the crop yield will be reduced chen et al 2011 napp had a very significant effect p 0 01 on yield wue and anue table 4 similar to what was found by shu et al 2016 of jujube trees applying different rates of napp under the condition of straw mulching in the loess plateau the highest yield and wue were obtained for n2 level 0 50 kg n plant 1 yang 2011 showed that considering the yield fruit quality and wue of jujube trees the napp should been controlled in the range of 0 49 0 82 kg n plant 1 under surface drip irrigation in the loess plateau our result is within this range the rate of napp from n3 to n2 could increase jujube yield and wue significantly p 0 05 but decreased from n2 to n1 it indicated that only a reasonable level of napp can improve the yield and wue while excessive n application not only cannot increase the yield but also reduce the wue appropriate rate of napp can effectively increase the photosynthesis rate of crops promote the optimal distribution of crop photosynthetic products among different organs of crops and ultimately increase crop yield and when the napp rate exceeds the reasonable range although the biomass and nitrogen uptake of the crop are high but the proportion of photosynthetic products distributed to the reproductive organs decreases which would result in a decrease in yield xue et al 2015 yao et al 2015 other scholars have the similar conclusion on other crops such as orange cantarella et al 2003 and grape boman 1995 the influence of n level on anue was different between two years it may cause by climate difference between two years 4 3 interaction effects of irrigation and napp on yield wue and anue the interaction effects of water and napp on wue and anue were significant and significant on yield in 2014 but not in 2015 the difference of effect on yield may be due to the difference in climate between the two years some researchers have reported that the interaction effects of water and n on yield and water and n utilization efficiency of other crop were all significant such as sunflower kiani et al 2016 and tomato du et al 2017 different with this study in addition to irrigation method the crop type and soil condition may be responsible for these contradictory results as well as meteorological factors 4 4 model development and evaluation the models that were developed in this study show the importance of the interaction of water and napp for estimating the yield wue and anue these models can be used as a reference for performance optimization for similar climatic conditions the model showed that there were optimum irrigation amount and rate of napp which can get the maximum of yield wue and anue increasing the irrigation amount and napp higher than these optimum levels did not improve yield wue and anue and in some cases had an opposite effect when the yield is highest the wue reduced 5 40 8 82 than maximum wue while the anue reduced 38 75 31 44 than maximum anue in both years respectively it means that the risk of environmental pollution caused by loss of n is very high when the yield is the highest therefore it s very necessary to determine the strategy for irrigation napp management based on the economic and environmental benefits 4 5 the strategy for irrigation n management based on comprehensive benefits previous research has shown that the maximum likelihood method can be used to solute the problem of comprehensive benefits wu et al 2015 which is confirmed by this study the results show that control the swc within 50 75 θ n application rate of 0 42 kg n plant 1 may achieve the multiple targets of water saving fertilizer saving and yield increase the rate of napp decreased compared with the actual napp rate of jujube growers but this article assumed the weights of yield wue and anue was same in actual production people should focus on the actual situation 5 conclusions irrigation levels and n rates are two of the most important factors for optimizing yield wue and anue of jujube in a semiarid region our results with jujube revealed that irrigation amounts and napp levels all had significant effects on the yield wue and anue of jujube and the interaction effects of irrigation amounts and napp levels had significant effects on wue and anue and significant on yield in 2014 but not in 2015 the study demonstrated that yield wue and anue were determined not only by irrigation levels but also by the rate of napp and there was an optimal level of napp for each level of irrigation therefore the rate of napp should be adjusted to the irrigation level as shown in the present study it was different to obtain the maximum yield wue and anue simultaneously the regression equations showed controlling the swc within 50 75 θ and napp rate of 0 42 kg n plant 1 can considered as the best strategy for irrigation and napp management under jujube sri in a semiarid region where water is a limiting factor this will result in maximum the comprehensive benefits of yield wue and anue which can enhance crop production in water stress scarce environments further studies are needed to evaluate the behavior of crops under irrigation with different cultivars soil moisture conservation options such as tillage planting methods and mulching and different forms of n to develop irrigation scheduling and fertilizer guidelines for sri tailored to site specific conditions acknowledgments this study was supported by the national key r d program no

11168,three dairy farm systems in china and in new zealand nz varying in intensity based on level of use of brought in crop feeds were selected from surveyed data nitrogen n emissions were estimated using country specific n and life cycle assessment models milk production per cow increased with increased use of grain based feeds but there was no whole system difference in energy and land use resource efficiency the n footprint reactive n emissions kg 1 milk for cradle to farm gate was 1 3 2 3 times higher for the housed cow chinese farm systems than the year round pasture grazing nz farm systems associated with greater emissions of all forms of reactive n the n footprint decreased with increased feed use and milk production in both countries mainly due to decreased ammonia emissions there were similar trends in carbon c footprint total greenhouse gas emissions of milk except within nz where there was no change with feeding level in nz the n loss to water kg 1 milk increased due to the contribution from feed crops the source of feed was an important determinant of environmental impacts and changing to low n footprint feeds decreased the n footprint of milk by up to 10 in both countries however manure management was the dominant contributor to the n footprint for all farms and particularly in china mitigation analysis of chinese farm systems showed the potential to decrease the n footprint of milk by over 30 with improved manure management practices particularly from utilizing manure that is currently discharged the largest mitigation potential up to 25 in nz was from ceasing n fertilizer use on pasture and relying on clover n2 fixation scenario analysis for late autumn winter housing of cows in nz decreased n loss to water but greatly increased ammonia emissions resulting in an increase in n and c footprints of up to 21 thus chinese dairy farms can improve environmental efficiency through sourcing low impact feeds improved manure management and integrating manure recycling with feed crops in contrast nz farms can improve environmental efficiency through efficient use of grazed legume based pastures rather than using crop feeds or cow housing systems keywords ammonia crop feeds dairy greenhouse gases nitrate nitrogen emissions 1 introduction dairy production is important for provision of milk and meat but meeting future demands will require an increase in global production e g tilman and clark 2014 this is being met through an increase in area under dairy farming but in particular by an intensification of production on existing dairy land gerber et al 2011 a key input for increased dairy production is an increase in the quantity of brought in feeds used on dairy farms and this is associated with an increase in milk production per cow in china where milk demand has increased markedly changes in milk production have been associated with a decrease in the number of small farms which had significant use of feed by products to an increase in the number of large scale dairy farms with greater use of concentrates zhang et al 2017 similarly in new zealand nz which is the largest global exporter of dairy products there has been an increase in the use of brought in feeds to supplement the predominant reliance on year round grazing of perennial grass clover pastures e g clark et al 2007 this has been determined in part by the large increase in global demand for milk particularly from china which has had an effect on feed use and environmental emissions bai et al 2018 previous studies on environmental emissions through the life cycle of milk to consumers have shown that most emissions are associated with the cradle to farm gate stage e g 70 in thoma et al 2013 dairy farming leads to significant emissions of reactive nitrogen n to the environment this includes nitrate leaching to groundwater and transfer to surface waters which is an important environmental issue affecting water quality in many areas globally cameron et al 2013 other reactive n emissions to the environment are ammonia nh3 nitrous oxide n2o a greenhouse gas and nitrogen oxides nox these gaseous n emissions can have a significant effect on air quality including effects on climate change smogs and ozone formation e g sutton et al 2011 in recent years there has been an emphasis on reporting n emissions to the environment on an n footprint basis whereby an n footprint is the sum of the total n emissions per kg of product or service e g leach et al 2012 the main focus of this has been on the n emissions associated with an average person s lifestyle covering food and energy consumption leip et al 2014 extended this to represent the n footprint associated with the production of various food types which accounted for the n emissions associated with the production of food and feed crops as well as for a livestock production system however they did not include a full life cycle assessment lca and therefore did not account for all background emission such as for the production of key inputs such as n fertilizer and all inputs associated with feed crops for livestock production these background emissions can be a significant contributor to total n emissions to the environment as well as to the carbon footprint total greenhouse gas emissions of livestock products e g ledgard et al 2011 in one of the few detailed lca studies that includes the reactive n footprint rotz et al 2015 evaluated beef production systems and found that the cattle breeding stage was a major contributor to the total n footprint there have been no detailed lca based studies on the n footprint of dairy production although various lca studies have accounted for some environmental impacts associated with n emissions e g thomassen et al 2008 recently leap 2018 produced guidelines on assessment of n flows and impact assessment of livestock systems and identified the n footprint as a useful indicator of n related emissions from livestock production the objectives of this study were to compare contrasting dairy farming systems in china and nz varying in farming intensity and amount and types of brought in feeds used for the n and c footprints of milk and to evaluate mitigation options to decrease these footprints 2 material and methods 2 1 system boundary and co products in this study the system boundary was the cradle to

allocation based on idf 2015 where manure was sold as a co product for its fertilizer value from some chinese farms it was treated as a residual fao 2016 with subsequent off farm emissions assumed to apply to their use such as on horticultural crops idf 2015 in practice the latter was small at 1 for all farm systems wei 2016 2 2 farm systems china three farm systems were defined for shaanxi hebei and beijing regions ranging from a relatively small farm using significant roughage feeds through to a large intensive farm reliant on concentrates table 1 these case study farms were selected from groups of farms in each region as being representative of the types of farm systems defined all farms operated year round confined housing systems with feed brought in from various off farm areas the farm systems were actual farms that were identified as being a typical representative farm in each region based on previous farm surveys wang et al 2016 wei 2016 the shaanxi farm had 170 milking cows and 250 replacements while the hebei and beijing farms had 321 and 1220 milking cows respectively table 1 the milk yield as fat and protein corrected milk fpcm idf 2015 from the shaanxi hebei and beijing farms was 5 8 7 3 and 8 5 t cow 1 yr 1 respectively new zealand three average farm systems were identified within the waikato region table 1 which is the largest milk producing region of nz 23 of total production dairynz 2017 farm data was collected from over 210 waikato dairy farms and the farms were grouped into low medium and high brought in feed categories based on approximately 0 10 10 20 and 20 40 of the cow s diet being from the brought in feed average farm data from the surveyed farms for each feed category was used for all analyses and showed an increase in average milk production per cow from 4 6 to 5 0 and 6 1 t cow 1 yr 1 for the low medium and high feed categories respectively on all surveyed farms across all feed categories the main feed source was from year round grazing of perennial grass clover pastures the average farm systems were assumed to operate a seasonal milk supply system which will have applied for most of the survey farms with cows all calving in early spring lactating through to the following late autumn and being non lactating through winter when they were on maintenance feeding all replacement animals were reared on land off farm between weaning and near 2 year old prior to first calving which was assumed to be that for an average beef finishing farm beef lambnz 2017 2 3 feeds animal feed intake and manure management china all feeds were derived from crops produced off farm and the crop data for site of production crop yields and inputs were based on published data table 2 the amount of each crop brought in and typical published data on its composition were used to calculate the intake assuming total utilization by animals of feed energy and nutrients by all animals note that in table 1 concentrates are not defined directly but were split into their constituents for purposes of specific data analysis for the shaanxi farm it was assumed that concentrates were made from 50 maize grain 22 soybean meal and 28 wheat grain based on related survey data wang et al 2016 for the hebei farm it was assumed that concentrates were made from 52 maize grain 19 soybean meal and 29 bran while for the beijing farm concentrates were assumed to be from 44 maize grain 28 soybean meal and 29 wheat grain wei 2016 data for wheat bran was based on that for wheat grain after allocation based on global average data while data for leymus chinensis hay was based on published yield data and an assumption of no n fertilizer application the amount of n excreted by animals was calculated from the difference between total intake based on diet composition and average n concentration of feeds table 2 and retention in milk and animal growth mfe 2017 using published data on nutrient concentrations in milk and live weight excreta deposited in the animal housing area was collected into a manure management system on all farms and was assumed to be subjected to passive composting for up to 3 months after which it was transported and applied to cropland however based on national data it was assumed that 20 of manure was discharged directly to water wei 2016 volatile solids in manure excreted by each animal category was determined based on feed organic matter intake and its digestibility ipcc 2006 and was used in calculation of manure methane emissions new zealand the total feed energy intake for all animal classes was calculated according to the nz ghg inventory energy based model using data on animal milk production live weight and growth mfe 2017 the total brought in feeds were obtained from farm survey data and a wastage non utilisation factor was applied according to feed type and feeding method dairynz 2012 the amount of pasture intake via grazing was then derived by difference between total requirements and intake from brought in feeds this method was used because of the difficulty in directly quantifying pasture intake by grazing animals published data on the energy and nutrient concentrations of feeds were used dairynz 2012 with feed intake data to derive the energy and nutrient intake by all animal classes the amount of n excreted by animals was calculated from the difference between total intake and retention in milk and animal growth using measured values for n in milk and animal tissue the excreted n was then partitioned into urine and dung according to the average n concentration in the diet with approximately 68 to urine mfe 2017 the milking cows spend an average of 5 time in yards and milking shed during the year and up to an additional 10 of time on feed pad areas on high feed input farms this data was used to apportion the amount of excreta n that was collected into the manure management system it was assumed that this was collected into holding ponds and sprayed directly out onto pasture within a week of collection 2 4 nitrogen emissions china the leaching and runoff losses of n from manure and fertilizer applied to land as nitrate were calculated using an emission factor of 3 wang et al 2018 table 3 ammonia and direct nitrous oxide n2o emission factors for n in manure and fertilizer were based on published data from local research indirect n2o were calculated using ipcc 2006 values but were not used in the n footprint estimation to avoid double counting already included in ammonia and n loss to water data emissions of n2o from crop residues were not accounted for due to lack of additional crop data background n emissions from the production and transportation distribution of inputs used on farms were calculated based on data from the ecoinvent database version 3 3 wernet et al 2016 and adjusted for country specific components e g for electricity table 4 for consistency the same average data on n emissions from urea production were used for china and nz based primarily on nz data table 4 nox emissions from fuel use excluded transportation of feeds from crop land to farms and therefore will have significantly underestimated the total nox emissions new zealand ammonia and n2o emission from animal urine and dung deposited during grazing and in manure and fertilizer applied onto pasture were calculated using emission factors from nz specific research that are included in the nz ghg inventory model mfe 2017 table 3 nox emissions from fuel combustion were calculated using equations from the ecoinvent database emissions of n2o from crop residues were based on crop specific residue yields for nz crops and ipcc 2006 emission factors the n losses from leaching and runoff from grazed pasture were calculated using the nz specific overseer nutrient budgets model wheeler et al 2003 ledgard et al 2004 it has been developed and validated based on field research in grazed pasture systems with n leaching being determined for all n sources the magnitude of loss is affected by soil and climate parameters and for this study typical soil free draining allophanic and rainfall 1100 mm year 1 factors for the waikato region were assumed life cycle assessment lca modelling using simapro lca software https simapro com accounted for background n emissions from the production and transportation distribution of inputs on farms including use of the ecoinvent database with adjustment for country specific factors 2 5 nitrogen mitigations three potential mitigation practices to reduce n emissions were evaluated for all farms these were different for china and nz and were based on hotspot analyses indicating where significant reductions could occur for china the mitigations focused on changes to feed type and manure management practices the first mitigation involved replacing wheat and maize grain feeds 737 1306 kg dm cow table 1 with maize silage lower carbon footprint per kg dm and assuming that the small decrease in dietary protein concentration from this change would not impact on milk production in the second mitigation it was assumed that 20 of the manure that was being discharged to waterways was being captured and utilized for simplicity it was assumed that it was used on food or feed crops other than for dairy farms at no cost thus it was treated as a residual where subsequent emissions after land application are assigned to that other crop and therefore excluded from this analysis fao 2016 the third mitigation involved decreasing n losses from manure during housing and storage this covered reduced time of manure in the housing stage with assumed decrease in nh3 and n2o emissions by 10 and 50 respectively hou et al 2015 acidification of manure during storage with assumed decrease in nh3 by 75 but increased n2o emission by 15 hou et al 2015 and additives during the manure composting stage with assumed decrease in nh3 and n2o emissions by 42 and 32 respectively wang et al 2017 mitigations for the nz farms involved changes to feed type n fertilizer reduction and strategic use of cow housing in autumn winter the first mitigation involved replacing palm kernel expeller pke and cereal grains with maize silage lower n footprint per kg dm on an equivalent metabolizable energy basis and assuming no impact on milk production for the second mitigation all n fertilizer applied to pasture was removed so that n inputs were solely from n2 fixation by clover in the pastures the decrease in pasture intake by animals equivalent to 10 kg dm kg 1 fertilizer n was assumed to result in a decrease in cow numbers and milk production based on analyses using the farmax dairy farm production model bryant et al 2010 for the third mitigation it was assumed that dairy cows were strategically housed for four months from late autumn during late lactation and the non lactating winter period excreta was assumed to be collected into a manure management system with manure being composted and applied to pasture in the following spring summer period this targeted reducing n leaching to waterways which is an environmental issue in nz 2 6 ghg emissions china enteric methane emissions were calculated from feed energy intake section 2 3 and an emission factor of 6 5 ipcc 2006 methane emissions from manure from the housing and storage stages were calculated using the volatile solids composition section 2 3 and methane conversion factors for composted manure from ipcc 2006 nitrous oxide emissions were defined in section 2 4 carbon dioxide emissions from urea applied to soil ipcc 2006 were accounted for as well as emissions from production and use of fuel electricity fertilizer production pesticide production shipping and feed transportation using country specific data where appropriate table 4 new zealand animal methane emissions were calculated using feed dm intake and the nz specific emission factor of 21 6 g ch4 kg 1 dm intake mfe 2017 which equates to the same 6 5 of energy intake as used for china dung methane emissions were based on the dung dm yields and an nz specific methane emission factor of 0 98 g ch4 kg 1 dung dm mfe 2017 nitrous oxide emissions were defined in section 2 4 carbon dioxide emissions from multiple sources accounted for nz specific data table 3 2 7 impact assessment the carbon footprint of milk was calculated from the total ghg emissions kg co2 equivalents co2 eq multiplied by the allocation factor between milk and live weight sold for meat idf 2015 divided by the kg fpcm the characterization factors for the carbon footprint in co2 eq were ch4 biogenic 27 75 ch4 fossil 30 5 n2o 265 and co2 1 myhre et al 2013 the n footprint was calculated from the sum of all reactive n emissions on a kg n equivalents basis multiplied by the allocation factor and divided by the kg fpcm 3 results and discussion 3 1 dairy farm productivity within china the less intensive shaanxi farm had the lowest milk production per cow and was associated with greater relative consumption of roughages e g maize silage hay than grain or concentrates table 1 the beijing farm had high milk production per cow with greater use of grain based feeds but had a high apparent replacement rate with relatively high sales of cull cows in nz the average high brought in feed farm had intake by cows of brought in feeds constituting 38 of their diet compared to only 7 on the low feed input farms but the former was associated with 33 higher milk production per cow thus a key feature of intensification was the use of quality feeds to increase per cow productivity on farm energy fuel and electricity use was relatively high on the chinese farms and levels of energy consumption per t fpcm were similar across the three farm systems similarly energy use per kg fpcm was similar across the three nz farms but levels of use per kg fpcm were less than half that of the chinese farms this can be attributed to most of the feed intake by cows being from grazing of perennial pasture while all feed in china had to be collected stored and fed to the cows which were housed year round use of total land area per tonne of fpcm produced was lower for the nz farms due to the relatively high pasture production 9 11 t dm ha 1 yr 1 assuming approximately 80 utilization during grazing compared to much lower annual yields for grain crops in china tables 1 2 this was most evident for soybean meal which required 0 4 ha per t dm after accounting for allocation for soy oil the beijing farm used more lower yielding crop feeds e g more cereal grains than maize silage and used a significant component of leymus chinensis hay from low yielding grassland in the north east china nahs 2014 thus while the milk production efficiency increased in the intensive beijing farm there was no increase in efficiency of use of energy or land resources the land use of 0 19 0 22 ha t 1 fpcm is near the middle of the range of 0 12 0 25 ha t 1 fpcm for a study of 25 housed cow farms on the north china plain wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 showed that there have been large changes in farm type in china over the past few decades from dominance of small low producing farms to many large intensive farms like the beijing farm this study indicates that while the milk production efficiency increased on the intensive farm system there was no increase in efficiency of use of energy or land resources however this will be highly dependent on the feed sources used 3 2 nitrogen losses as affected by feed type the magnitude of n losses per hectare varied with different types of feeds and the forms of n loss were mainly from n leaching runoff to water and ammonia emissions table 5 estimated losses of n to water mainly nitrate leaching were relatively low 10 kg n ha 1 for the crops used in china due predominantly to their production on fine textured soils in a low rainfall region but with some irrigation yang et al 2015 in contrast n loss to water was often the main n loss from feeds grown in nz due to their production on free draining soils in moderately high rainfall non irrigated areas there was a wide range in the estimated n leaching per hectare for feed crops used in nz ranging from 5 kg n ha for pasture silage to 80 kg n ha from palm crops schmidt 2007 however for crop feeds that are by products the n leaching losses used in analyses in this study were allocated based on economic allocation fao 2016 for example for pke the estimated n loss to water after allocation was equivalent to 3 1 kg n t 1 dm this compares with 0 4 and 1 5 kg n t 1 dm for nz pasture silage and maize silage respectively the corresponding range for feeds used in china was 0 2 1 7 kg n t 1 dm thus the choice of feed type in dairy production systems affects the overall level of n loss to water the n loss as ammonia was generally relatively greater than that for the n loss to water from crops in china whereas this was reversed for crops used in nz the absolute ammonia n loss per hectare was generally lower for the chinese cereal crops relative differences in n losses between crops in china were similar for the different forms of n loss in contrast in nz ammonia loss per hectare or per t dm for maize silage was higher than for palm or pke while the corresponding n loss to water was lowest for maize silage this can be attributed to the low ammonia emissions from palm due to low n fertilizer mainly ammonium sulphate use and high rainfall drainage conditions schmidt 2007 the total loss of reactive n i e n footprint per t dm for maize silage in china was one third of that for nz but for other chinese grain crops it was of a similar magnitude to that for nz maize silage and pke table 5 the n footprint of alfalfa from usa was low although it did not account for nox emissions from transport to china which would have added approximately 0 05 0 1 kg nox n kg 1 fpcm one factor contributing to the low n footprint of milk for the beijing farm was that 30 of the diet was from leymus chinensis hay sourced from northeast china and inner mongolia and it was assumed that the grass was unfertilized and had a nil n footprint for production transportation would have added approximately 0 01 kg nox n kg 1 fpcm to the beijing farm 3 3 nitrogen footprint as affected by dairy system and intensity the n footprint of milk was higher for all chinese farms than for nz farms and decreased with increased intensity of production through greater crop feed use and milk production per cow in both countries table 6 results for the chinese farms were influenced in part by the feed types used the shaanxi farm had relatively high maize silage use with a lower n footprint per kg dm than for the cereal grains the low n footprint for the beijing farm was influenced by the relatively high use of leymus chinensis hay and greater use of alfalfa both with nil low n footprints per kg dm although this was underestimated as noted in the previous section the n footprint of milk was dominated by ammonia at 55 72 of the total n footprint for the chinese farms and 48 57 for the nz farms the second main contributor was n loss to water at 24 38 and 38 46 for chinese and nz farms respectively the decrease in n footprint with intensification was driven by relatively large decreases in ammonia and n2o emissions per kg fpcm in contrast nox emissions increased with intensification associated with greater fuel use for feed production n loss to water decreased with intensification in china but increased with increased brought in feed use in nz the latter was associated with moderately high n leaching from areas used to grow feed crops particularly for the main crops of maize silage and pke table 5 which contributed 20 to the total system n loss to water when those crops were brought onto the high feed input farm they led to greater n cycling through the cows and an increase in on farm n leaching of 43 although this was associated with an increase in fpcm production per on farm hectare of 61 loss of n to water from grazed pastures in nz is determined mainly by the amount of n excreted on pasture in animal urine e g ledgard et al 2009 and this was increased with the feeding of brought in feeds on farm in china an important contributor was the direct discharge of 20 of manure n to water wei 2016 the main reason for the higher n footprint from the chinese farms was the much higher ammonia emissions which were predominantly from manure fig 1 when manure is collected stored and treated on the chinese farms there are high ammonia emissions of up to 40 table 3 whereas corresponding emissions from effluent and animal excreta deposited on land in nz is 10 the latter is due to direct contact with soils which have high ph buffering capacity resulting in lower increase in ph after hydrolysis and adsorption of ammonium e g saggar et al 2013 feed production was also a significant contributor to ammonia emissions associated with losses following application of n fertilizer to soil 11 16 of total ammonia loss for china and 35 41 of total for nz fig 1b other dairy system modelling has shown greater ammonia emissions from housed cow systems than with grazing jarvis and ledgard 2002 rotz et al 2009 emissions of n2o t 1 fpcm from chinese farms were 1 5 to 2 fold higher than from nz farms in china there was a similar relative contribution from feed production from n fertilizer use and manure management while in nz it was mainly from effluent and excreta application 58 73 of total fig 1c the overall use of fertilizer n i e on all crops and pastures in chinese production systems was higher than on nz systems at 19 26 versus 9 10 kg fertilizer n t 1 fpcm which is the main reason for the higher n2o emissions from feed production for manure the emission factors for housing collection and storage are slightly higher table 3 than those for effluent or excreta deposited during grazing in nz it should be noted that it was assumed that following composting of the manure in china it was sold at nominal cost to other producers mainly for horticulture and therefore no account was made of the various n emissions due to land application of manure i e they would be assigned with those other crops emissions of nox from chinese farms were up to 2 3 fold higher than from nz farms which was primarily associated with greater fuel use for feed production and feeding to housed cows on chinese farms fig 1d in china the other main contributor to nox emissions was n fertilizer manufacturing on nz farms nox was from fuel use on farm or for making off farm crops as well as from energy use associated with fertilizer production note that much of the emissions under feed production for nz in fig 1d are from fertilizer production and are included there and not under the fertilizer production box which refers to fertilizer on the dairy farm only many other studies of n losses from dairy farm systems have not included nox emissions and these analyses indicated that it may be underestimating total reactive n emissions by about 1 3 however while this is relatively small it can be environmentally significant due to its contribution to smog and photochemical ozone formation since it is a strong oxidizing agent that reacts with volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere e g epa 1999 over the whole n footprint the dominant contributor from chinese farms was the manure management system at 79 87 mostly from housing and treatment stages of the total followed by feed production at 11 17 and energy related emissions at up to 3 fig 1 the corresponding breakdown for nz farms was manure management excreta plus dairy effluent after land application at 63 70 feed production at 29 36 and energy at 1 of the total the significance of manure management to n losses has also been highlighted in other studies e g powell and rotz 2015 hou et al 2015 leip et al 2014 provided a summary of the n footprint of different human food products using partial lca and excluding nox emissions in europe and calculated an average for european milk of approximately 20 kg n kg 1 milk range c 10 50 kg n kg 1 milk this study by leip et al 2014 used a soil n budget approach and also accounted for non reactive n2 emissions which was one of the main contributors to the total n footprint values powell and rotz 2015 estimated the reactive n footprint of milk from two housed usa dairy systems at 7 9 g n kg 1 milk although it was unclear how comprehensive the analysis was and whether it accounted for background n emissions these estimates are generally in the range of values found in the present study 3 4 nitrogen footprint mitigation for each of the dairy production systems three mitigation practices were modelled to identify the potential for reducing the n footprint of milk for chinese farms the brought in crop feeds varied in their n footprint per kg dm and therefore the effect of replacing wheat and maize grain feeds with maize silage with a low n footprint was evaluated this decreased the n footprint of milk by 3 10 fig 2 being highest for the beijing farm and depended on the relative amount of feed changed which varied between 18 and 29 of the diet further reduction could be achieved by using more low n feeds but would require focus on linking changes with optimization of animal dietary requirements to avoid protein and nutrient limitations e g hristov et al 2011 the other two mitigations on chinese farms involved changes in manure management utilisation of the 20 of manure that was discharged to waterways reduced the n footprint of milk by 19 32 across farms due to a reduction in the n loss to water changing the timing and treatment of manure at all three manure management steps housing storage and processing reduced the n footprint of milk by 11 14 these mitigations illustrate the importance of improved manure management practices to achieve reduced environmental impacts from dairy farm systems in china as also highlighted by bai et al 2017 potentially the three mitigations could be combined which would result in an overall estimated decrease in n footprint of 40 55 across the three farms for the nz farms the mitigations focused on feed type n fertilizer use on pastures and strategic use of animal housing changing imported pke and cereal grain feeds to maize silage was estimated to decrease the n footprint of milk by 2 9 fig 2 this was mainly associated with reduced n loss to water the second mitigation of ceasing n fertilizer use on pasture and relying fully on clover n2 fixation decreased farm milk production by 3 12 but decreased the n footprint of milk by 17 25 this was due to a decrease in all forms of n loss previous research has shown that this can be associated with a large decrease in n leaching to water in a grazed farm system but with possible effects on decreased production and profitability ledgard et al 1999 changing from cows grazing year round to being strategically housed for four months increased the n footprint of milk by 19 21 this was associated with a decrease in n loss to water of 24 34 but an increase in ammonia emissions of approximately 70 similar n pollution swapping effects have been estimated from animal housing systems in other system modelling studies e g rotz et al 2009 3 5 carbon footprint of milk for the chinese farms a reduction in n footprint of milk with intensification and mitigation practices coincided with corresponding reductions in the carbon footprint of milk fig 3 the mitigation involving a change from grain feeds to maize silage gave a larger relative reduction in the carbon footprint of milk than for the n footprint 6 16 versus 3 10 respectively in contrast the two manure management mitigations only decreased the carbon footprint of milk by 1 3 associated with decreased n2o emissions combining all three mitigations gave an estimated decrease in carbon footprint of milk of 7 17 across the three farms in all cases the carbon footprint was dominated by methane mainly from animal enteric emissions with n2o and co2 having similar emissions on a co2 equivalent basis table 6 wang et al 2018 also showed a small decrease in the carbon footprint of milk in china with increased milk production per cow and changes in manure management the nz farms showed little difference in carbon footprint of milk with increased use of brought in feeds while increased feed inputs in the high input farm decreased methane and n2o emissions per kg fpcm due to increased per cow production this was countered by the increase in co2 emissions from the production and transport of the feeds changing brought in feeds to predominantly maize silage decreased the carbon footprint of milk due to the reduced feed production co2 emissions omitting n fertilizer use on pastures gave the largest reduction in carbon footprint of milk by 3 11 mainly due to reduced n2o and co2 emissions from the use and production of fertilizer n while the strategic use of animal housing decreased n leaching the manure management system was associated with an increase in indirect n2o emissions due to increased ammonia emissions and an estimated increase in manure ch4 emissions rotz et al 2009 also estimated a lower carbon footprint of milk from year round grazing compared to an annual confined housing system in north east usa 4 conclusions chinese dairy farms have been changing to large intensive housed systems and this study aligns with others indicating an improvement in productivity through increased per cow milk production however this was not associated with an improvement in energy or land resource use efficiency but was associated with a reduction in the n and carbon footprints of milk the nz dairy farm systems based on year round grazing showed some increase in per cow production when intensified with feed from off farm crops however it showed no change in resource use efficiency or in the carbon footprint of milk the n footprint of milk decreased largely due to reduced nh3 emissions but there was an increase in n loss to water which is the main environmental issue of concern within nz the source of feed was an important determinant of resource use and environmental impacts and changing to low n footprint feeds was estimated to decrease the n footprint of milk by up to 10 in both countries however manure management was the dominant contributor to the n footprint for all farms particularly in china mitigation analysis showed the potential to decrease the n footprint of milk by over 30 with improved manure management practices particularly from utilizing manure that is currently discharged to water improved fertilizer management can decrease the n footprint and the largest potential reduction in nz of up to 28 was from ceasing the use of n fertilizer use on pasture and switching to clover derived n2 fixation the use of more than two fold higher fertilizer n per kg fpcm for feed production in china indicates some potential for more optimal use of n fertilizer particularly on cereal grain crops the chinese and nz dairy systems are markedly different and this study showed potential for improvement in both but through very different practices chinese dairy farms can improve environmental efficiency through sourcing low impact feeds and in particular through improved manure management and integrating manure recycling with feed crops for dairy production farms in nz can improve environmental efficiency through focus on efficient use of grazed legume based pastures rather than using crop feeds or cow stand off housing systems 
11168,three dairy farm systems in china and in new zealand nz varying in intensity based on level of use of brought in crop feeds were selected from surveyed data nitrogen n emissions were estimated using country specific n and life cycle assessment models milk production per cow increased with increased use of grain based feeds but there was no whole system difference in energy and land use resource efficiency the n footprint reactive n emissions kg 1 milk for cradle to farm gate was 1 3 2 3 times higher for the housed cow chinese farm systems than the year round pasture grazing nz farm systems associated with greater emissions of all forms of reactive n the n footprint decreased with increased feed use and milk production in both countries mainly due to decreased ammonia emissions there were similar trends in carbon c footprint total greenhouse gas emissions of milk except within nz where there was no change with feeding level in nz the n loss to water kg 1 milk increased due to the contribution from feed crops the source of feed was an important determinant of environmental impacts and changing to low n footprint feeds decreased the n footprint of milk by up to 10 in both countries however manure management was the dominant contributor to the n footprint for all farms and particularly in china mitigation analysis of chinese farm systems showed the potential to decrease the n footprint of milk by over 30 with improved manure management practices particularly from utilizing manure that is currently discharged the largest mitigation potential up to 25 in nz was from ceasing n fertilizer use on pasture and relying on clover n2 fixation scenario analysis for late autumn winter housing of cows in nz decreased n loss to water but greatly increased ammonia emissions resulting in an increase in n and c footprints of up to 21 thus chinese dairy farms can improve environmental efficiency through sourcing low impact feeds improved manure management and integrating manure recycling with feed crops in contrast nz farms can improve environmental efficiency through efficient use of grazed legume based pastures rather than using crop feeds or cow housing systems keywords ammonia crop feeds dairy greenhouse gases nitrate nitrogen emissions 1 introduction dairy production is important for provision of milk and meat but meeting future demands will require an increase in global production e g tilman and clark 2014 this is being met through an increase in area under dairy farming but in particular by an intensification of production on existing dairy land gerber et al 2011 a key input for increased dairy production is an increase in the quantity of brought in feeds used on dairy farms and this is associated with an increase in milk production per cow in china where milk demand has increased markedly changes in milk production have been associated with a decrease in the number of small farms which had significant use of feed by products to an increase in the number of large scale dairy farms with greater use of concentrates zhang et al 2017 similarly in new zealand nz which is the largest global exporter of dairy products there has been an increase in the use of brought in feeds to supplement the predominant reliance on year round grazing of perennial grass clover pastures e g clark et al 2007 this has been determined in part by the large increase in global demand for milk particularly from china which has had an effect on feed use and environmental emissions bai et al 2018 previous studies on environmental emissions through the life cycle of milk to consumers have shown that most emissions are associated with the cradle to farm gate stage e g 70 in thoma et al 2013 dairy farming leads to significant emissions of reactive nitrogen n to the environment this includes nitrate leaching to groundwater and transfer to surface waters which is an important environmental issue affecting water quality in many areas globally cameron et al 2013 other reactive n emissions to the environment are ammonia nh3 nitrous oxide n2o a greenhouse gas and nitrogen oxides nox these gaseous n emissions can have a significant effect on air quality including effects on climate change smogs and ozone formation e g sutton et al 2011 in recent years there has been an emphasis on reporting n emissions to the environment on an n footprint basis whereby an n footprint is the sum of the total n emissions per kg of product or service e g leach et al 2012 the main focus of this has been on the n emissions associated with an average person s lifestyle covering food and energy consumption leip et al 2014 extended this to represent the n footprint associated with the production of various food types which accounted for the n emissions associated with the production of food and feed crops as well as for a livestock production system however they did not include a full life cycle assessment lca and therefore did not account for all background emission such as for the production of key inputs such as n fertilizer and all inputs associated with feed crops for livestock production these background emissions can be a significant contributor to total n emissions to the environment as well as to the carbon footprint total greenhouse gas emissions of livestock products e g ledgard et al 2011 in one of the few detailed lca studies that includes the reactive n footprint rotz et al 2015 evaluated beef production systems and found that the cattle breeding stage was a major contributor to the total n footprint there have been no detailed lca based studies on the n footprint of dairy production although various lca studies have accounted for some environmental impacts associated with n emissions e g thomassen et al 2008 recently leap 2018 produced guidelines on assessment of n flows and impact assessment of livestock systems and identified the n footprint as a useful indicator of n related emissions from livestock production the objectives of this study were to compare contrasting dairy farming systems in china and nz varying in farming intensity and amount and types of brought in feeds used for the n and c footprints of milk and to evaluate mitigation options to decrease these footprints 2 material and methods 2 1 system boundary and co products in this study the system boundary was the cradle to

apply to their use such as on horticultural crops idf 2015 in practice the latter was small at 1 for all farm systems wei 2016 2 2 farm systems china three farm systems were defined for shaanxi hebei and beijing regions ranging from a relatively small farm using significant roughage feeds through to a large intensive farm reliant on concentrates table 1 these case study farms were selected from groups of farms in each region as being representative of the types of farm systems defined all farms operated year round confined housing systems with feed brought in from various off farm areas the farm systems were actual farms that were identified as being a typical representative farm in each region based on previous farm surveys wang et al 2016 wei 2016 the shaanxi farm had 170 milking cows and 250 replacements while the hebei and beijing farms had 321 and 1220 milking cows respectively table 1 the milk yield as fat and protein corrected milk fpcm idf 2015 from the shaanxi hebei and beijing farms was 5 8 7 3 and 8 5 t cow 1 yr 1 respectively new zealand three average farm systems were identified within the waikato region table 1 which is the largest milk producing region of nz 23 of total production dairynz 2017 farm data was collected from over 210 waikato dairy farms and the farms were grouped into low medium and high brought in feed categories based on approximately 0 10 10 20 and 20 40 of the cow s diet being from the brought in feed average farm data from the surveyed farms for each feed category was used for all analyses and showed an increase in average milk production per cow from 4 6 to 5 0 and 6 1 t cow 1 yr 1 for the low medium and high feed categories respectively on all surveyed farms across all feed categories the main feed source was from year round grazing of perennial grass clover pastures the average farm systems were assumed to operate a seasonal milk supply system which will have applied for most of the survey farms with cows all calving in early spring lactating through to the following late autumn and being non lactating through winter when they were on maintenance feeding all replacement animals were reared on land off farm between weaning and near 2 year old prior to first calving which was assumed to be that for an average beef finishing farm beef lambnz 2017 2 3 feeds animal feed intake and manure management china all feeds were derived from crops produced off farm and the crop data for site of production crop yields and inputs were based on published data table 2 the amount of each crop brought in and typical published data on its composition were used to calculate the intake assuming total utilization by animals of feed energy and nutrients by all animals note that in table 1 concentrates are not defined directly but were split into their constituents for purposes of specific data analysis for the shaanxi farm it was assumed that concentrates were made from 50 maize grain 22 soybean meal and 28 wheat grain based on related survey data wang et al 2016 for the hebei farm it was assumed that concentrates were made from 52 maize grain 19 soybean meal and 29 bran while for the beijing farm concentrates were assumed to be from 44 maize grain 28 soybean meal and 29 wheat grain wei 2016 data for wheat bran was based on that for wheat grain after allocation based on global average data while data for leymus chinensis hay was based on published yield data and an assumption of no n fertilizer application the amount of n excreted by animals was calculated from the difference between total intake based on diet composition and average n concentration of feeds table 2 and retention in milk and animal growth mfe 2017 using published data on nutrient concentrations in milk and live weight excreta deposited in the animal housing area was collected into a manure management system on all farms and was assumed to be subjected to passive composting for up to 3 months after which it was transported and applied to cropland however based on national data it was assumed that 20 of manure was discharged directly to water wei 2016 volatile solids in manure excreted by each animal category was determined based on feed organic matter intake and its digestibility ipcc 2006 and was used in calculation of manure methane emissions new zealand the total feed energy intake for all animal classes was calculated according to the nz ghg inventory energy based model using data on animal milk production live weight and growth mfe 2017 the total brought in feeds were obtained from farm survey data and a wastage non utilisation factor was applied according to feed type and feeding method dairynz 2012 the amount of pasture intake via grazing was then derived by difference between total requirements and intake from brought in feeds this method was used because of the difficulty in directly quantifying pasture intake by grazing animals published data on the energy and nutrient concentrations of feeds were used dairynz 2012 with feed intake data to derive the energy and nutrient intake by all animal classes the amount of n excreted by animals was calculated from the difference between total intake and retention in milk and animal growth using measured values for n in milk and animal tissue the excreted n was then partitioned into urine and dung according to the average n concentration in the diet with approximately 68 to urine mfe 2017 the milking cows spend an average of 5 time in yards and milking shed during the year and up to an additional 10 of time on feed pad areas on high feed input farms this data was used to apportion the amount of excreta n that was collected into the manure management system it was assumed that this was collected into holding ponds and sprayed directly out onto pasture within a week of collection 2 4 nitrogen emissions china the leaching and runoff losses of n from manure and fertilizer applied to land as nitrate were calculated using an emission factor of 3 wang et al 2018 table 3 ammonia and direct nitrous oxide n2o emission factors for n in manure and fertilizer were based on published data from local research indirect n2o were calculated using ipcc 2006 values but were not used in the n footprint estimation to avoid double counting already included in ammonia and n loss to water data emissions of n2o from crop residues were not accounted for due to lack of additional crop data background n emissions from the production and transportation distribution of inputs used on farms were calculated based on data from the ecoinvent database version 3 3 wernet et al 2016 and adjusted for country specific components e g for electricity table 4 for consistency the same average data on n emissions from urea production were used for china and nz based primarily on nz data table 4 nox emissions from fuel use excluded transportation of feeds from crop land to farms and therefore will have significantly underestimated the total nox emissions new zealand ammonia and n2o emission from animal urine and dung deposited during grazing and in manure and fertilizer applied onto pasture were calculated using emission factors from nz specific research that are included in the nz ghg inventory model mfe 2017 table 3 nox emissions from fuel combustion were calculated using equations from the ecoinvent database emissions of n2o from crop residues were based on crop specific residue yields for nz crops and ipcc 2006 emission factors the n losses from leaching and runoff from grazed pasture were calculated using the nz specific overseer nutrient budgets model wheeler et al 2003 ledgard et al 2004 it has been developed and validated based on field research in grazed pasture systems with n leaching being determined for all n sources the magnitude of loss is affected by soil and climate parameters and for this study typical soil free draining allophanic and rainfall 1100 mm year 1 factors for the waikato region were assumed life cycle assessment lca modelling using simapro lca software https simapro com accounted for background n emissions from the production and transportation distribution of inputs on farms including use of the ecoinvent database with adjustment for country specific factors 2 5 nitrogen mitigations three potential mitigation practices to reduce n emissions were evaluated for all farms these were different for china and nz and were based on hotspot analyses indicating where significant reductions could occur for china the mitigations focused on changes to feed type and manure management practices the first mitigation involved replacing wheat and maize grain feeds 737 1306 kg dm cow table 1 with maize silage lower carbon footprint per kg dm and assuming that the small decrease in dietary protein concentration from this change would not impact on milk production in the second mitigation it was assumed that 20 of the manure that was being discharged to waterways was being captured and utilized for simplicity it was assumed that it was used on food or feed crops other than for dairy farms at no cost thus it was treated as a residual where subsequent emissions after land application are assigned to that other crop and therefore excluded from this analysis fao 2016 the third mitigation involved decreasing n losses from manure during housing and storage this covered reduced time of manure in the housing stage with assumed decrease in nh3 and n2o emissions by 10 and 50 respectively hou et al 2015 acidification of manure during storage with assumed decrease in nh3 by 75 but increased n2o emission by 15 hou et al 2015 and additives during the manure composting stage with assumed decrease in nh3 and n2o emissions by 42 and 32 respectively wang et al 2017 mitigations for the nz farms involved changes to feed type n fertilizer reduction and strategic use of cow housing in autumn winter the first mitigation involved replacing palm kernel expeller pke and cereal grains with maize silage lower n footprint per kg dm on an equivalent metabolizable energy basis and assuming no impact on milk production for the second mitigation all n fertilizer applied to pasture was removed so that n inputs were solely from n2 fixation by clover in the pastures the decrease in pasture intake by animals equivalent to 10 kg dm kg 1 fertilizer n was assumed to result in a decrease in cow numbers and milk production based on analyses using the farmax dairy farm production model bryant et al 2010 for the third mitigation it was assumed that dairy cows were strategically housed for four months from late autumn during late lactation and the non lactating winter period excreta was assumed to be collected into a manure management system with manure being composted and applied to pasture in the following spring summer period this targeted reducing n leaching to waterways which is an environmental issue in nz 2 6 ghg emissions china enteric methane emissions were calculated from feed energy intake section 2 3 and an emission factor of 6 5 ipcc 2006 methane emissions from manure from the housing and storage stages were calculated using the volatile solids composition section 2 3 and methane conversion factors for composted manure from ipcc 2006 nitrous oxide emissions were defined in section 2 4 carbon dioxide emissions from urea applied to soil ipcc 2006 were accounted for as well as emissions from production and use of fuel electricity fertilizer production pesticide production shipping and feed transportation using country specific data where appropriate table 4 new zealand animal methane emissions were calculated using feed dm intake and the nz specific emission factor of 21 6 g ch4 kg 1 dm intake mfe 2017 which equates to the same 6 5 of energy intake as used for china dung methane emissions were based on the dung dm yields and an nz specific methane emission factor of 0 98 g ch4 kg 1 dung dm mfe 2017 nitrous oxide emissions were defined in section 2 4 carbon dioxide emissions from multiple sources accounted for nz specific data table 3 2 7 impact assessment the carbon footprint of milk was calculated from the total ghg emissions kg co2 equivalents co2 eq multiplied by the allocation factor between milk and live weight sold for meat idf 2015 divided by the kg fpcm the characterization factors for the carbon footprint in co2 eq were ch4 biogenic 27 75 ch4 fossil 30 5 n2o 265 and co2 1 myhre et al 2013 the n footprint was calculated from the sum of all reactive n emissions on a kg n equivalents basis multiplied by the allocation factor and divided by the kg fpcm 3 results and discussion 3 1 dairy farm productivity within china the less intensive shaanxi farm had the lowest milk production per cow and was associated with greater relative consumption of roughages e g maize silage hay than grain or concentrates table 1 the beijing farm had high milk production per cow with greater use of grain based feeds but had a high apparent replacement rate with relatively high sales of cull cows in nz the average high brought in feed farm had intake by cows of brought in feeds constituting 38 of their diet compared to only 7 on the low feed input farms but the former was associated with 33 higher milk production per cow thus a key feature of intensification was the use of quality feeds to increase per cow productivity on farm energy fuel and electricity use was relatively high on the chinese farms and levels of energy consumption per t fpcm were similar across the three farm systems similarly energy use per kg fpcm was similar across the three nz farms but levels of use per kg fpcm were less than half that of the chinese farms this can be attributed to most of the feed intake by cows being from grazing of perennial pasture while all feed in china had to be collected stored and fed to the cows which were housed year round use of total land area per tonne of fpcm produced was lower for the nz farms due to the relatively high pasture production 9 11 t dm ha 1 yr 1 assuming approximately 80 utilization during grazing compared to much lower annual yields for grain crops in china tables 1 2 this was most evident for soybean meal which required 0 4 ha per t dm after accounting for allocation for soy oil the beijing farm used more lower yielding crop feeds e g more cereal grains than maize silage and used a significant component of leymus chinensis hay from low yielding grassland in the north east china nahs 2014 thus while the milk production efficiency increased in the intensive beijing farm there was no increase in efficiency of use of energy or land resources the land use of 0 19 0 22 ha t 1 fpcm is near the middle of the range of 0 12 0 25 ha t 1 fpcm for a study of 25 housed cow farms on the north china plain wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 showed that there have been large changes in farm type in china over the past few decades from dominance of small low producing farms to many large intensive farms like the beijing farm this study indicates that while the milk production efficiency increased on the intensive farm system there was no increase in efficiency of use of energy or land resources however this will be highly dependent on the feed sources used 3 2 nitrogen losses as affected by feed type the magnitude of n losses per hectare varied with different types of feeds and the forms of n loss were mainly from n leaching runoff to water and ammonia emissions table 5 estimated losses of n to water mainly nitrate leaching were relatively low 10 kg n ha 1 for the crops used in china due predominantly to their production on fine textured soils in a low rainfall region but with some irrigation yang et al 2015 in contrast n loss to water was often the main n loss from feeds grown in nz due to their production on free draining soils in moderately high rainfall non irrigated areas there was a wide range in the estimated n leaching per hectare for feed crops used in nz ranging from 5 kg n ha for pasture silage to 80 kg n ha from palm crops schmidt 2007 however for crop feeds that are by products the n leaching losses used in analyses in this study were allocated based on economic allocation fao 2016 for example for pke the estimated n loss to water after allocation was equivalent to 3 1 kg n t 1 dm this compares with 0 4 and 1 5 kg n t 1 dm for nz pasture silage and maize silage respectively the corresponding range for feeds used in china was 0 2 1 7 kg n t 1 dm thus the choice of feed type in dairy production systems affects the overall level of n loss to water the n loss as ammonia was generally relatively greater than that for the n loss to water from crops in china whereas this was reversed for crops used in nz the absolute ammonia n loss per hectare was generally lower for the chinese cereal crops relative differences in n losses between crops in china were similar for the different forms of n loss in contrast in nz ammonia loss per hectare or per t dm for maize silage was higher than for palm or pke while the corresponding n loss to water was lowest for maize silage this can be attributed to the low ammonia emissions from palm due to low n fertilizer mainly ammonium sulphate use and high rainfall drainage conditions schmidt 2007 the total loss of reactive n i e n footprint per t dm for maize silage in china was one third of that for nz but for other chinese grain crops it was of a similar magnitude to that for nz maize silage and pke table 5 the n footprint of alfalfa from usa was low although it did not account for nox emissions from transport to china which would have added approximately 0 05 0 1 kg nox n kg 1 fpcm one factor contributing to the low n footprint of milk for the beijing farm was that 30 of the diet was from leymus chinensis hay sourced from northeast china and inner mongolia and it was assumed that the grass was unfertilized and had a nil n footprint for production transportation would have added approximately 0 01 kg nox n kg 1 fpcm to the beijing farm 3 3 nitrogen footprint as affected by dairy system and intensity the n footprint of milk was higher for all chinese farms than for nz farms and decreased with increased intensity of production through greater crop feed use and milk production per cow in both countries table 6 results for the chinese farms were influenced in part by the feed types used the shaanxi farm had relatively high maize silage use with a lower n footprint per kg dm than for the cereal grains the low n footprint for the beijing farm was influenced by the relatively high use of leymus chinensis hay and greater use of alfalfa both with nil low n footprints per kg dm although this was underestimated as noted in the previous section the n footprint of milk was dominated by ammonia at 55 72 of the total n footprint for the chinese farms and 48 57 for the nz farms the second main contributor was n loss to water at 24 38 and 38 46 for chinese and nz farms respectively the decrease in n footprint with intensification was driven by relatively large decreases in ammonia and n2o emissions per kg fpcm in contrast nox emissions increased with intensification associated with greater fuel use for feed production n loss to water decreased with intensification in china but increased with increased brought in feed use in nz the latter was associated with moderately high n leaching from areas used to grow feed crops particularly for the main crops of maize silage and pke table 5 which contributed 20 to the total system n loss to water when those crops were brought onto the high feed input farm they led to greater n cycling through the cows and an increase in on farm n leaching of 43 although this was associated with an increase in fpcm production per on farm hectare of 61 loss of n to water from grazed pastures in nz is determined mainly by the amount of n excreted on pasture in animal urine e g ledgard et al 2009 and this was increased with the feeding of brought in feeds on farm in china an important contributor was the direct discharge of 20 of manure n to water wei 2016 the main reason for the higher n footprint from the chinese farms was the much higher ammonia emissions which were predominantly from manure fig 1 when manure is collected stored and treated on the chinese farms there are high ammonia emissions of up to 40 table 3 whereas corresponding emissions from effluent and animal excreta deposited on land in nz is 10 the latter is due to direct contact with soils which have high ph buffering capacity resulting in lower increase in ph after hydrolysis and adsorption of ammonium e g saggar et al 2013 feed production was also a significant contributor to ammonia emissions associated with losses following application of n fertilizer to soil 11 16 of total ammonia loss for china and 35 41 of total for nz fig 1b other dairy system modelling has shown greater ammonia emissions from housed cow systems than with grazing jarvis and ledgard 2002 rotz et al 2009 emissions of n2o t 1 fpcm from chinese farms were 1 5 to 2 fold higher than from nz farms in china there was a similar relative contribution from feed production from n fertilizer use and manure management while in nz it was mainly from effluent and excreta application 58 73 of total fig 1c the overall use of fertilizer n i e on all crops and pastures in chinese production systems was higher than on nz systems at 19 26 versus 9 10 kg fertilizer n t 1 fpcm which is the main reason for the higher n2o emissions from feed production for manure the emission factors for housing collection and storage are slightly higher table 3 than those for effluent or excreta deposited during grazing in nz it should be noted that it was assumed that following composting of the manure in china it was sold at nominal cost to other producers mainly for horticulture and therefore no account was made of the various n emissions due to land application of manure i e they would be assigned with those other crops emissions of nox from chinese farms were up to 2 3 fold higher than from nz farms which was primarily associated with greater fuel use for feed production and feeding to housed cows on chinese farms fig 1d in china the other main contributor to nox emissions was n fertilizer manufacturing on nz farms nox was from fuel use on farm or for making off farm crops as well as from energy use associated with fertilizer production note that much of the emissions under feed production for nz in fig 1d are from fertilizer production and are included there and not under the fertilizer production box which refers to fertilizer on the dairy farm only many other studies of n losses from dairy farm systems have not included nox emissions and these analyses indicated that it may be underestimating total reactive n emissions by about 1 3 however while this is relatively small it can be environmentally significant due to its contribution to smog and photochemical ozone formation since it is a strong oxidizing agent that reacts with volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere e g epa 1999 over the whole n footprint the dominant contributor from chinese farms was the manure management system at 79 87 mostly from housing and treatment stages of the total followed by feed production at 11 17 and energy related emissions at up to 3 fig 1 the corresponding breakdown for nz farms was manure management excreta plus dairy effluent after land application at 63 70 feed production at 29 36 and energy at 1 of the total the significance of manure management to n losses has also been highlighted in other studies e g powell and rotz 2015 hou et al 2015 leip et al 2014 provided a summary of the n footprint of different human food products using partial lca and excluding nox emissions in europe and calculated an average for european milk of approximately 20 kg n kg 1 milk range c 10 50 kg n kg 1 milk this study by leip et al 2014 used a soil n budget approach and also accounted for non reactive n2 emissions which was one of the main contributors to the total n footprint values powell and rotz 2015 estimated the reactive n footprint of milk from two housed usa dairy systems at 7 9 g n kg 1 milk although it was unclear how comprehensive the analysis was and whether it accounted for background n emissions these estimates are generally in the range of values found in the present study 3 4 nitrogen footprint mitigation for each of the dairy production systems three mitigation practices were modelled to identify the potential for reducing the n footprint of milk for chinese farms the brought in crop feeds varied in their n footprint per kg dm and therefore the effect of replacing wheat and maize grain feeds with maize silage with a low n footprint was evaluated this decreased the n footprint of milk by 3 10 fig 2 being highest for the beijing farm and depended on the relative amount of feed changed which varied between 18 and 29 of the diet further reduction could be achieved by using more low n feeds but would require focus on linking changes with optimization of animal dietary requirements to avoid protein and nutrient limitations e g hristov et al 2011 the other two mitigations on chinese farms involved changes in manure management utilisation of the 20 of manure that was discharged to waterways reduced the n footprint of milk by 19 32 across farms due to a reduction in the n loss to water changing the timing and treatment of manure at all three manure management steps housing storage and processing reduced the n footprint of milk by 11 14 these mitigations illustrate the importance of improved manure management practices to achieve reduced environmental impacts from dairy farm systems in china as also highlighted by bai et al 2017 potentially the three mitigations could be combined which would result in an overall estimated decrease in n footprint of 40 55 across the three farms for the nz farms the mitigations focused on feed type n fertilizer use on pastures and strategic use of animal housing changing imported pke and cereal grain feeds to maize silage was estimated to decrease the n footprint of milk by 2 9 fig 2 this was mainly associated with reduced n loss to water the second mitigation of ceasing n fertilizer use on pasture and relying fully on clover n2 fixation decreased farm milk production by 3 12 but decreased the n footprint of milk by 17 25 this was due to a decrease in all forms of n loss previous research has shown that this can be associated with a large decrease in n leaching to water in a grazed farm system but with possible effects on decreased production and profitability ledgard et al 1999 changing from cows grazing year round to being strategically housed for four months increased the n footprint of milk by 19 21 this was associated with a decrease in n loss to water of 24 34 but an increase in ammonia emissions of approximately 70 similar n pollution swapping effects have been estimated from animal housing systems in other system modelling studies e g rotz et al 2009 3 5 carbon footprint of milk for the chinese farms a reduction in n footprint of milk with intensification and mitigation practices coincided with corresponding reductions in the carbon footprint of milk fig 3 the mitigation involving a change from grain feeds to maize silage gave a larger relative reduction in the carbon footprint of milk than for the n footprint 6 16 versus 3 10 respectively in contrast the two manure management mitigations only decreased the carbon footprint of milk by 1 3 associated with decreased n2o emissions combining all three mitigations gave an estimated decrease in carbon footprint of milk of 7 17 across the three farms in all cases the carbon footprint was dominated by methane mainly from animal enteric emissions with n2o and co2 having similar emissions on a co2 equivalent basis table 6 wang et al 2018 also showed a small decrease in the carbon footprint of milk in china with increased milk production per cow and changes in manure management the nz farms showed little difference in carbon footprint of milk with increased use of brought in feeds while increased feed inputs in the high input farm decreased methane and n2o emissions per kg fpcm due to increased per cow production this was countered by the increase in co2 emissions from the production and transport of the feeds changing brought in feeds to predominantly maize silage decreased the carbon footprint of milk due to the reduced feed production co2 emissions omitting n fertilizer use on pastures gave the largest reduction in carbon footprint of milk by 3 11 mainly due to reduced n2o and co2 emissions from the use and production of fertilizer n while the strategic use of animal housing decreased n leaching the manure management system was associated with an increase in indirect n2o emissions due to increased ammonia emissions and an estimated increase in manure ch4 emissions rotz et al 2009 also estimated a lower carbon footprint of milk from year round grazing compared to an annual confined housing system in north east usa 4 conclusions chinese dairy farms have been changing to large intensive housed systems and this study aligns with others indicating an improvement in productivity through increased per cow milk production however this was not associated with an improvement in energy or land resource use efficiency but was associated with a reduction in the n and carbon footprints of milk the nz dairy farm systems based on year round grazing showed some increase in per cow production when intensified with feed from off farm crops however it showed no change in resource use efficiency or in the carbon footprint of milk the n footprint of milk decreased largely due to reduced nh3 emissions but there was an increase in n loss to water which is the main environmental issue of concern within nz the source of feed was an important determinant of resource use and environmental impacts and changing to low n footprint feeds was estimated to decrease the n footprint of milk by up to 10 in both countries however manure management was the dominant contributor to the n footprint for all farms particularly in china mitigation analysis showed the potential to decrease the n footprint of milk by over 30 with improved manure management practices particularly from utilizing manure that is currently discharged to water improved fertilizer management can decrease the n footprint and the largest potential reduction in nz of up to 28 was from ceasing the use of n fertilizer use on pasture and switching to clover derived n2 fixation the use of more than two fold higher fertilizer n per kg fpcm for feed production in china indicates some potential for more optimal use of n fertilizer particularly on cereal grain crops the chinese and nz dairy systems are markedly different and this study showed potential for improvement in both but through very different practices chinese dairy farms can improve environmental efficiency through sourcing low impact feeds and in particular through improved manure management and integrating manure recycling with feed crops for dairy production farms in nz can improve environmental efficiency through focus on efficient use of grazed legume based pastures rather than using crop feeds or cow stand off housing systems 
11169,water supply and demand policies have associated with different implications for sustainable groundwater management these policies are adopted aimed to improve the welfare of the water beneficiaries accordingly this study has analyzed the effects of improvement on the irrigation systems efficiency and the internalization of external effects of groundwater extraction in a dynamic market framework in qazvin plain for this purpose firstly water supply and demand functions are estimated and the effects of applying two different scenarios have been evaluated using the dynamic programming model the spatial lag model has been used to estimate the groundwater extraction function and internalization of external effects of groundwater extraction according to the results improvement of irrigation systems has a more effective role in improving aquifer status also applying internalization scenario on the 50 year horizon will reduce the present value of the welfare of the exploiters by 33 while improving irrigation system will increase their welfare level by 143 also this policy can reduce the rate of water table reduction in the aquifer accordingly it is recommended that supportive policies be developed by the government to improve the efficiency of irrigation systems keywords water market efficiency improvement external effect qazvin plain 1 introduction today the issue of water scarcity is strongly felt after the green revolution in agriculture and consequently the increase in water use in agriculture and hence najafi alamdarlo et al 2018 water scarcity control approaches have focused on water supply management in most developing countries hadjigeorgalis 2009 the objective of water supply management is to increase access to secure and high quality water marston and cai 2016 but the adoption of water demand management approaches by the united nations was proposed with increasing water scarcity in this approach consumption reduction is emphasized by increasing water use efficiency marston and cai 2016 and promote water use technology bjornlund et al 2009 the development of irrigation technologies prevents water loss in the fields and is partially effective in solving the water scarcity in agriculture norouzi and chizari 2006 valizadeh et al 2018 azamzadeh shouraki et al 2013 nazari et al 2018 non interference in groundwater management leads to its inappropriate allocation because its accessibility and ease of use have increased the natural resource and destroyed it in some areas niamnsi and mbue 2009 also reducing groundwater storage has a significant impact on other natural resources hatton and evans 1998 one of the important tools to manage water demand is its allocation based on market components easter et al 1999 the existence of the water market will lead to optimal water allocation johansson et al 2002 and risk reduction grafton and horne 2014 the dynamic nature of groundwater resources causes the spatial external effects where its economic value may be neglected pfeiffer and lin 2012 external effects occur when the use of a resource affects the benefit or costs of other operators oecd 1993 therefore the extraction of water by an operator reduces water table water availability and increases the cost of extraction for other operators pfeiffer and lin 2012 internalization is a process in which the economic value of external effects is calculated and included in the beneficiaries decisions therefore in designing mathematical models of groundwater exploitation the economic value of these external effects should be considered in this study internalization is considered as a policy that reduces the volume of water extracted by each beneficiary there is a consensus about this issue that groundwater extraction is always associated with external effects in this regard chakravorty et al 1995 have examined the spatial effects of water transfer and its impacts on the water market chakravorty and umetsu 2003 have also evaluated groundwater management in two groups of modern and traditional exploiters using a spatial model and dynamic programming esteban and albiac 2011 have believed that interference in the water market has led to more sustainability for groundwater management brill and burness 1994 concluded that the external effects will result in different perceptions in a free and controlled competition on the other hand water market based modeling is the best way to understand the external effects of groundwater extraction and its internalization in these models groundwater supply and demand are obtained and the effects of different policies on it can be analyzed market based tools are considered as one of the most important applied methods for allocating and reallocating water grafton and horne 2014 creating a market for water and allocation based on it can lead to higher utility for water users gómez limón and martinez 2006 increased efficiency and social welfare easter and hearne 1995 and increase the ability to deal with destructive effects of drought for consumers zaman et al 2009 many water market studies have used mathematical programming models weinberg et al 1993 garrido 2000 pujol et al 2005 zekri and easter 2005 the similarity of these studies is related to the use of an economic model for estimation of the water demand function and then an examination of how it is exchanged with other producers pitafi and roumasset 2009 reviewed the role of water allocation on market components using a dynamic water market modeling li et al 2014 believe that there are many effective factors on the effectiveness of the water market and emphasized the relationship between the farm and water use in its reallocation calatrava and corrido 2005 conclude that creating a market for water especially in areas with unstable water conditions requires strong supports from upstream institutions to ensure its effectiveness palazzo and brozovíc 2014 express that spatial effects should be considered to develop the groundwater market according to research literature this study was carried out aimed to study the effects of supply and demand policies on the welfare of groundwater beneficiaries for this purpose reducing consumption for groundwater by improving the irrigation system efficiency is considered as a demand side policy supply side policy refers to the internalization of external effects in groundwater extraction the challenge between these two policies can be associated with different outcomes in groundwater management the contribution of this study is to consider the supply and demand side policy simultaneously also the spatial econometric method is used to estimate the groundwater equation of motion the process of present study is organized as follows the second section explains the methodology in the third section the results are discussed 2 material and methods in the present study the methodology consists of five sections in the first part the study area is described in the second section how to obtain the groundwater demand and supply function is addressed the third section describes the method of determining the groundwater flow equation using the spatial econometric technique and in the fourth section the dynamic model of the groundwater market is expressed in the fifth section demand and supply side scenarios are explained the symbols used in this study are as follows table 1 2 1 case study there were 4236 deep wells in qazvin in of 2014 2015 data collected from 3909 wells were used in this study of these 1 185 cases had a modern irrigation system and 2 724 of them had a traditional irrigation system a modern irrigation system means the use of pressurized irrigation systems this type of irrigation often involves two micro irrigation and sprinkler irrigation methods by the end of 2017 about 34 000 hectares of land in this plain equipped with a pressurized irrigation system iran s ministry of agriculture 2017 the efficiency of this type of irrigation has been reported at about 70 the traditional irrigation method is the surface irrigation of the farm in this method the water utilization efficiency is low most farms in the qazvin plain are irrigating with this method generally the average water efficiency in the agricultural lands of qazvin plain is about 45 in fig 1 the location of the wells in the study area is shown using the gis software the characteristics of wells are shown in table 2 in terms of modern and traditional irrigation system the amount of water extraction is lower in the wells which use the modern irrigation system and the water level is also higher in these wells this can also justify the use of modern irrigation techniques the characteristics of crops are presented at the bottom of table 2 the crop cultivation area is about 159 000 hectares in total 1336 million cubic meters of water are used in this plain of which 17 percent are from surface water and 83 percent of groundwater resources industry and municipal sectors assigned 4 2 and 8 2 of total water consumption in the plain respectively iran water resources management company 2018 fig 2 shows the water consumption of each section the share of agricultural sector in the groundwater extraction of qazvin province has decreased from 88 5 in 2002 2003 to 83 in 2015 2016 the amount of groundwater extraction in the province has also reduced from 1 85 to 1 03 billion cubic meters much of this decline was due to the decline in the discharge of the exploitation wells during the same period fig 1 these factors have led to a 28 3 meter reduction in groundwater table over the past 20 years fig 3 shows the average cumulative of changes in groundwater table in qazvin aquifer considering the importance of groundwater in the qazvin plain and the damages imposed to it farmers have faced a real decline in real profitability in this region and increased extraction costs mortazavi et al 2018 getting informed about this condition has worried farmers and the government about the future of agriculture therefore some plains are arisen for supplying more water and its demand management 2 2 groundwater demand and supply function groundwater demand function is the relationship between the price of water and its quantity in many studies mathematical programming has been used to extract this function a very practical method to simulate farmer behavior at farm level is positive mathematical programming pmp model this model has been used in many studies howitt 1995 arfini and paris 1995 schmit and sinabell 2005 howitt 2005 lauwers et al 2007 medellín and azuara 2006 medellín azuara et al 2012 mosavi 2014 the pmp model is a three step process which can be calibrated based on a nonlinear cost function based on the number of inputs and outputs observed howitt 2005 in the first stage a linear programming model is designed in which the inputs shadow price is obtained the inputs used in this study include groundwater surface water machinery seeds chemical pesticides fertilizers and land the second step is related to the estimation of the production function and the quadratic cost function the use of the maximum entropy method is one of the modeling approaches in the pmp model this method is introduced by paris and howitt 1998 and designed based on substitution between inputs the third step uses a pmp model calibrated using a nonlinear objective function in order to solve the pmp model the gams software package and the conopt3 algorithm are used in order to obtain the water demand function the amount of available water is reduced to a certain extent and finally the relationship between the shadow price of water and its consumption is obtained medellín azuara et al 2010 groundwater supply is in fact a groundwater extraction function the main factor in determining the groundwater extraction is the water table provencher and burt 1993 in a study have estimated the groundwater extraction function koundouri 2004 has reported that the economic hydrological and crop factors are effective on groundwater extraction and further estimated a final cost function based on groundwater height brozovic et al 2010 in their study have investigated the effects of time and space on groundwater extraction they concluded that if the aquifer area is small the single cell aquifer model will provide an acceptable solution but this model can t be used for large aquifers in fact groundwater supply is a function of groundwater extraction the water height in the well is considered as the most important factor in determining the energy supply function the water supply function has been used in many studies according to the results reported by provencher and burt 1993 salcedo et al 2013 foster et al 2017 the water supply function can be considered as a function of hours of pump engine function energy price water flow rate water height maintenance and repair costs in the water extraction function calculating the cost of energy required to raise a cubic meter of groundwater is considered as the most important factor esteban and albiac 2011 according to the result reported by najafi alamdarlo et al 2016 balali et al 2011 and esteban and albiac 2011 the groundwater exploitation function is considered as follows 1 t c i c 0 c 1 s l h i in eq 1 t c i is the cost of water extraction from the ith well c 0 is the fixed cost of water extraction and c 1 is the cost of energy needed to raise a cubic meter of water to one meter sl is height above sea level and h i shows the water height per well by obtaining the function parameters the groundwater supply function can be achieved 2 3 groundwater equation of motion and its estimation groundwater extraction is always associated with external effects gardner et al 1997 and provencher and burt 1993 in their studies addressed four types of external effects due to groundwater extraction and introduced it as a common natural resource their effects include external strategic effects external effects of storage potential external effects and external effects of risk nevertheless groundwater flow across different parts of the earth is done based on hydrological rules which depends on the aquifer s physical characteristics freeze and cherry 1979 accordingly loaiciga 2004 in his study developed the theis 1935 inequality equation which is x r t u 4 π t a α l n t β to consider the adjacent effects therefore the equation is also rewritten as follows 2 x j t u j 4 π t a α j j l n t β j j k 1 k j n u l 4 π t a α j k l n t β j k where in eq 2 α and β are the estimating equation coefficients domenico 1972 expanded the theis 1935 equation as follows 3 x t r 1 r 2 r j u 1 4 π t a w t 1 r 1 u 2 4 π t a w t 2 r 2 u n 4 π t a w t n r n in eq 3 the pumping rate varies over time and for each well brozovic et al 2010 have considered the dynamic relationship of water level with respect to the distance between wells as eq 4 4 x t 1 j n 1 t i 1 j u n i u n 1 i 4 π t a w t n 1 r i j therefore the temporal and spatial parameters affect water extraction in the following pfeiffer and lin 2012 describe the groundwater equation of motion considering spatial effects as follows 5 s i t g w i g w i j i θ j i s j g according to eq 5 the rate of changes in aquifer s groundwater depends on extraction aquifer natural recharge and water pumping rate from all adjacent locations here θ j i is a parameter that determines the amount of intake water from the adjacent regions and is determined by the equation k j s j g s i g x j i pfeiffer and lin 2012 many factors can affect the θ j i value which sometimes makes it difficult to estimate janmaat 2005 this study was carried out aimed to develop a method to obtain this parameter box and jenkins 1970 who have played a major role in the development of time series models believe that the behavior of a variable over time is the best indicator to explain the behavior of that variable in future periods accordingly and considering that the groundwater flow equation actually has an autoregressive process balali et al 2011 therefore the spatial econometric method can be used for estimation of the parameter θ j i since groundwater is a hydrologic variable therefore it is necessary to consider spatial dependence in estimating its supply function jamali jaghdani and brümmer 2011 spatial econometrics can be used to estimate spatial dependence anselin 1988 in the estimation of spatial econometric methods spatial lag spatial errors and spatial durbin model are often used which are subsets of general nesting spatial vega and elhorst 2015 accordingly if there is a n 1 vector of variables then a gns model can be represented as follows 6 y ρ w y x β w x γ φ φ ω w φ ε in eq 6 w y is spatila lag variable w is weighted spatial matrix n n and γ is a parameter that measures cross effects of independent variables w x in adjacent regions β is independent variable coefficient ω is spatial lag coefficient in residuals and ε represent the residuals in this equation if ρ γ 0 then model is spatial error if ω γ 0 model is spatial lag and if ω 0 model is spatial durbin accordingly a spatial lag model is considered as follows to develop a groundwater extraction model 7 w i β 1 θ i j m w j β 2 x i ε i in eq 7 x i indicates the effective variables on the rate of water extraction operating hours energy prices flow rate etc m is also an adjacency matrix which can be determined by the distance between two wells the estimated value of θ j i parameter can indicate the external effects of water extraction from a well on the extraction amount of adjacent wells the most important point in these models is to determine the proximity matrix in this study the adjacency matrix is determined by considering the distance between two wells and it is standardized by the 1 d i j 2 anselin and bera 1998 d i j represents the distance between the two wells i and j in the spatial econometrics the dependence between the regions should be tested balta ozkan et al 2015 moran 1950 test and lagrange coefficients can be used to determine spatial dependencies according to the above mentioned the groundwater water table δ h t r α 1 w t a s change as follow 8 h i t h i t 1 r α 1 w i t θ i j w j t a s in eq 8 the water table in the ith well depends on the amount of water extracted from adjacent wells w j t in addition to the characteristics of the aquifer and the rate of water extraction from that well the value of θ i j is determined using the estimation of the eq 7 2 4 dynamic market modeling for groundwater a dynamic market is considered for the objective function in order to model the effects of considering scenarios which is maximized with respect to the groundwater equation of motion here the model is developed aimed to maximize the expected value of welfare due to the extraction and use of groundwater for this purpose the dynamic model is developed as follows najafi alamdarlo et al 2016 knapp and baerenklau 2006 esteban an albiac 2011 balali et al 2011 koundouri 2004 9 m a x s p i t t 0 t i o i k 0 k 1 1 τ t α 1 w i k t 0 5 α 2 w i k t 2 c 0 c 1 h i k t w i k t s t h i k t h i k t 1 r φ 1 w i k t a s h i k t 0 h 0 i k t in eq 9 t represents time i represents the user and k represents the type of irrigation system modern and flooding τ is discount rate α 1 and α 2 are intercept and slope of groundwater demand function w is the amount of water consumption c 0 and c 1 are intercept and slope of groundwater supply function h is water table in each well r is natural recharge φ is return flow coefficient to the aquifer a is aquifer area s is the storavity coefficient and h 0 is the initial water table eq 9 has been developed for a mode in which the external effects of adjacent wells extraction are not considered according to the approach used in the studies carried out by esteban and albiac 2011 and knapp and baerenklau 2006 external effects can be entered the objective function so in this case the internalization of the external effects of groundwater extraction will be done as follow 10 1 m a x s p i t t 0 t i o i k 0 k 1 1 τ t α 1 w i k t 0 5 α 2 w i k t 2 c 0 c 1 h i k t w i k t s p w θ i j

equations 10 1 to 10 5 j represents the wells adjacent to the ith well s p w indicates the shadow price of each unit of water obtained from the pmp model the value of s p w θ i j actually represents the economic value of external effects of water extraction from each well also h i k t is the amount of area under cultivation of each product t h i k t i s the total area under cultivation and ρ i k t is the water requirement of each product per hectare this generalized model will have the ability to internalize the external effects due to water extraction and will consider all adjacent wells 2 5 scenarios in this study two scenarios are used to assess the welfare effects of different policies in the water market in the first scenario water demand reduces due to improved irrigation system efficiency for this purpose irrigation efficiency in the field is increased from 45 in flooding irrigation to 70 in modern irrigation in this case the total groundwater demand decreases according to the second scenario external effects of extraction are considered in the water supply function in this case the irrigation system efficiency is not changed but the external effects of extraction are considered in the water supply function internalization creates a social water supply function and reduces the amount of groundwater supplied any change in the groundwater supply and demand function leads to a change in welfare surplus griffin 2006 a summary of the type of each of the scenarios is presented in table 3 the models required in gams software have been developed in order to estimate these models and study the effects of these scenarios and the results of applying these scenarios have been analyzed using statistics and data collected 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of groundwater demand function a positive mathematical programming pmp model was used to estimate the groundwater demand function the relationship between shadow price and groundwater quantity was considered as a demand function for this purpose the amount of resource inventory on the right of the groundwater constraint was deducted by one unit and then the groundwater shadow price is obtained in each change this process has done for two separate models for both modern and traditional irrigation system in the benchmark status quo the groundwater shadow price in traditional irrigation mode is obtained equal to 2153 13 and it was 3343 92 rials per cubic meter in the modern mode accordingly the groundwater demand function in qazvin plain is estimated as follows fig 4 considering these two functions obtained in fig 4 the values of intercept and the slope of the linear water demand function can be achieved in both the modern and traditional modes for each product for this purpose the values obtained from the water shadow price and the amount of water demand in each scenario and each product are fitted in the form of a linear regression table 4 shows the results of the estimation in both types of irrigation systems red beans potatoes pinto beans rice and sugar beet have the highest slope of groundwater demand function respectively therefore if groundwater prices rise the demand for water from these crops will be reduced further this means that other crops are less responsive to water price changes because these products are part of the farmer s permanent cropping pattern and their change is hard to come by in general the water demand function in the modern irrigation system has a greater elasticity due to more sensitivity of these farmers to the change in water price 3 2 obtaining the groundwater supply function according to the calculations the total cost of extraction per cubic meter of water is 670 rials given the amount of water consumed per hectare the cost of using groundwater is 1600 rials hectare this number is equivalent to the intercept component in the groundwater supply function there is another component in the cost function that actually forms the slope of the supply function this parameter is the cost of raising a cubic meter of groundwater to a meter esteban and albiac 2011 based on the relationship between the groundwater extracting cost and water table the slope of the supply function is 0 000018 accordingly the value of intercept and slop for the groundwater supply function will be as table 5 3 3 estimation of external effects and groundwater equation of motion in this section estimates of the groundwater equation of motion are given this estimation represents the economic value of external effects for this purpose spatial econometrics and spatial lag models slm have been used table 6 shows the results of this estimation the estimation is based on the least squares method in the first model and models ii and iii are estimated based on spatial error and spatial lag models the increase in discharge rate the annual operating hours and energy consumption lead to increase the amount of water extracted but whatever the water table is higher it has the reverse effect on the amount of water extracted moran statistics and lagrange coefficients are significant in spatial models models ii and iii it indicates the effect of spatial lag and spatial error in the model estimated coefficients are not significantly different in the three models but the most important feature of spatial econometrics is that it reveals the amount of spatial effects in model iii the value of the spatial lag coefficient of the variable rho is 0 0667 in fact this coefficient indicates that if one cubic meter is extracted from the jth adjacent well the amount of 0 0667 cubic meters of the ith water extraction will be reduced now if this coefficient is multiplied by the shadow value of the groundwater 2153 3 rials m3 then the monetary value of the external effects equal to 143 7 rials per cubic meter s p w θ i j 2153 13 0 0667 143 7 this estimation of the external effects of groundwater extraction indicate the value of s p w θ i j in relation to equation 10 1 or 10 2 it will be used to optimize the model and internalize the external effects in the following the s p w θ i j value can be used to internalize the external effects of groundwater extraction in the form of dynamic programming model groundwater market model 3 4 selecting a suitable policy groundwater market the effects of adopting each scenario on the beneficiaries have been assessed in the dynamic groundwater market 10 1 to 10 5 the cumulative average of change in water table in each scenario is shown in fig 5 the changes over the past 51 years has shown that water table decreased by 34 3 m now if the same trend continues for the future continue the current status or traditional irrigation system the water table will decrease more severely to the extent that there is no longer any economic efficiency for extraction if irrigation systems are improved and demand for groundwater decreases scenario a it can reduce the rate of water table reduction in the aquifer applying scenario b internalization and reduction in water supply have the ability to slow down the decline in water table but it is less than the other scenario scenario a therefore reducing water demand and improving irrigation efficiency will have a more significant impact on preventing in groundwater table reduction this phenomenon can be due to lack of sufficient development of agricultural sector in the qazvin plain because the exploiters of groundwater do not have enough ability to internalize external effects hence the effectiveness of this policy is less the groundwater availability and consumption in each scenario is shown in fig 6 continuing the current status can make it difficult for more access to groundwater than the other two scenarios but adopting scenario a and improving irrigation systems would be more reliable in the sustainability of groundwater supply in qazvin plain fig 7 shows how to change the cropping pattern in each scenario the continuation of the current status causes a cropping pattern over the next 50 years drives into crops that have fewer water requirements but the farmers benefit will also less these changes will actually threaten the welfare of farmers in the region the internalization of external effects related to groundwater extraction scenario b will also make this situation worse the cropping pattern becomes more restrictive six crops are eliminated this situation can make the welfare of farmers worse but in scenario a improving the efficiency of irrigation system the cropping pattern preserves varies and the cultivation area of crops with higher profits will expand this situation can lead to improved welfare conditions for farmers the amount of cultivating area of each crop is shown in table 7 the continuation of the current trend will increase the cultivation area of wheat barley alfalfa red bean and pinto bean these products have less gross income per hectare in scenario b corn tomatoes maize sugar beet rice and potatoes have been eliminated from the crop pattern these crops also have more gross income in cropping pattern scenario a and the use of modern irrigation system will result in an appropriate combination of cropping patterns and the cultivation area of profitable crops increases the present value of the social surplus in groundwater market consumer supplier surplus in scenario a is also greater than scenario b accordingly improving irrigation systems can lead to an increase in the welfare of exploiters from groundwater while it also leads to more groundwater sustainability another way to choose the best scenario is to make cost benefit analysis in this method the weighted average of revenues and operational costs are calculated for each cropping pattern the results show that scenario a has the highest gross margin and more benefits to the farmer per hectare accordingly the benefit cost ratio in this scenario is also 1 75 therefore scenario a is selected as the best suggestion 4 conclusion the occurrence of water crises and reduced access in iran has made it necessary to adopt multilateral policies in water management accordingly this study was carried out aimed to analyze the effects of policies adopted in the field of groundwater demand and supply in the framework of a dynamic groundwater market therefore firstly the groundwater supply function groundwater extraction function was estimated in qazvin plain then positive mathematical planning model pmp was used to obtain groundwater demand function in the next step the external effects of groundwater extraction were estimated by developing the groundwater equation of motion and using the spatial econometric method two scenarios in the groundwater market were analyzed the first scenario is related to reducing irrigation water demand by improving the irrigation system efficiency scenario a this scenario will reduce total consumption of water reduced groundwater supply was evaluated as another scenario in the model scenario b applying these two scenarios in the groundwater market is associated with different consequences according to the results of the estimation one cubic meter of groundwater extraction would cause damage to adjacency wells about 0 0667 cubic meters this damage will cause a loss of 143 7 rials per cubic meter of groundwater the internalization of this damage leads to reduce the groundwater supply but it is not so much that it can slow down reduction in water table in the aquifer therefore the policy of internalization of damages caused by extraction will not have the ability to sustain groundwater in the qazvin plain this finding isn t consistent with the study of esteban and albiac 2011 therefore improving irrigation systems and reduced water demand will have a better effect in this scenario the combination of the future cropping pattern will tend to products with higher profitability the welfare of the groundwater exploiters will increase and the rate of water table reduction in the aquifer will be reduced hence the adoption of this policy will lead to increase the sustainability of groundwater exploitation the cost benefit analysis also shows that this scenario is the best choice one of the factors that make this policy more effective is related to the low welfare of agricultural water users in the plain farmers don t have enough ability to internalize external effects economically but applying support policies by government and improved irrigation systems can lead to satisfactory results in the field of groundwater the results of this study indicate applying subsidy policies is strongly recommended to improve the irrigation systems efficiency in the region this finding isn t consistent with the results of scheierling et al 2006 which argues that subsidy policies can t protect water finally the groundwater market formation can be used as an economic tool to improve the aquifer conditions in the qazvin plain but its success depends on the kind of policies applied to it groundwater market policies generally have to be supportive because the welfare level of groundwater users in qazvin plain is low and this can challenge the internalization of groundwater extraction accordingly improving the irrigation system efficiency in a 50 year horizon will increase the welfare level by 143 but the internalization of external effects will be associated with a 33 loss 
11169,water supply and demand policies have associated with different implications for sustainable groundwater management these policies are adopted aimed to improve the welfare of the water beneficiaries accordingly this study has analyzed the effects of improvement on the irrigation systems efficiency and the internalization of external effects of groundwater extraction in a dynamic market framework in qazvin plain for this purpose firstly water supply and demand functions are estimated and the effects of applying two different scenarios have been evaluated using the dynamic programming model the spatial lag model has been used to estimate the groundwater extraction function and internalization of external effects of groundwater extraction according to the results improvement of irrigation systems has a more effective role in improving aquifer status also applying internalization scenario on the 50 year horizon will reduce the present value of the welfare of the exploiters by 33 while improving irrigation system will increase their welfare level by 143 also this policy can reduce the rate of water table reduction in the aquifer accordingly it is recommended that supportive policies be developed by the government to improve the efficiency of irrigation systems keywords water market efficiency improvement external effect qazvin plain 1 introduction today the issue of water scarcity is strongly felt after the green revolution in agriculture and consequently the increase in water use in agriculture and hence najafi alamdarlo et al 2018 water scarcity control approaches have focused on water supply management in most developing countries hadjigeorgalis 2009 the objective of water supply management is to increase access to secure and high quality water marston and cai 2016 but the adoption of water demand management approaches by the united nations was proposed with increasing water scarcity in this approach consumption reduction is emphasized by increasing water use efficiency marston and cai 2016 and promote water use technology bjornlund et al 2009 the development of irrigation technologies prevents water loss in the fields and is partially effective in solving the water scarcity in agriculture norouzi and chizari 2006 valizadeh et al 2018 azamzadeh shouraki et al 2013 nazari et al 2018 non interference in groundwater management leads to its inappropriate allocation because its accessibility and ease of use have increased the natural resource and destroyed it in some areas niamnsi and mbue 2009 also reducing groundwater storage has a significant impact on other natural resources hatton and evans 1998 one of the important tools to manage water demand is its allocation based on market components easter et al 1999 the existence of the water market will lead to optimal water allocation johansson et al 2002 and risk reduction grafton and horne 2014 the dynamic nature of groundwater resources causes the spatial external effects where its economic value may be neglected pfeiffer and lin 2012 external effects occur when the use of a resource affects the benefit or costs of other operators oecd 1993 therefore the extraction of water by an operator reduces water table water availability and increases the cost of extraction for other operators pfeiffer and lin 2012 internalization is a process in which the economic value of external effects is calculated and included in the beneficiaries decisions therefore in designing mathematical models of groundwater exploitation the economic value of these external effects should be considered in this study internalization is considered as a policy that reduces the volume of water extracted by each beneficiary there is a consensus about this issue that groundwater extraction is always associated with external effects in this regard chakravorty et al 1995 have examined the spatial effects of water transfer and its impacts on the water market chakravorty and umetsu 2003 have also evaluated groundwater management in two groups of modern and traditional exploiters using a spatial model and dynamic programming esteban and albiac 2011 have believed that interference in the water market has led to more sustainability for groundwater management brill and burness 1994 concluded that the external effects will result in different perceptions in a free and controlled competition on the other hand water market based modeling is the best way to understand the external effects of groundwater extraction and its internalization in these models groundwater supply and demand are obtained and the effects of different policies on it can be analyzed market based tools are considered as one of the most important applied methods for allocating and reallocating water grafton and horne 2014 creating a market for water and allocation based on it can lead to higher utility for water users gómez limón and martinez 2006 increased efficiency and social welfare easter and hearne 1995 and increase the ability to deal with destructive effects of drought for consumers zaman et al 2009 many water market studies have used mathematical programming models weinberg et al 1993 garrido 2000 pujol et al 2005 zekri and easter 2005 the similarity of these studies is related to the use of an economic model for estimation of the water demand function and then an examination of how it is exchanged with other producers pitafi and roumasset 2009 reviewed the role of water allocation on market components using a dynamic water market modeling li et al 2014 believe that there are many effective factors on the effectiveness of the water market and emphasized the relationship between the farm and water use in its reallocation calatrava and corrido 2005 conclude that creating a market for water especially in areas with unstable water conditions requires strong supports from upstream institutions to ensure its effectiveness palazzo and brozovíc 2014 express that spatial effects should be considered to develop the groundwater market according to research literature this study was carried out aimed to study the effects of supply and demand policies on the welfare of groundwater beneficiaries for this purpose reducing consumption for groundwater by improving the irrigation system efficiency is considered as a demand side policy supply side policy refers to the internalization of external effects in groundwater extraction the challenge between these two policies can be associated with different outcomes in groundwater management the contribution of this study is to consider the supply and demand side policy simultaneously also the spatial econometric method is used to estimate the groundwater equation of motion the process of present study is organized as follows the second section explains the methodology in the third section the results are discussed 2 material and methods in the present study the methodology consists of five sections in the first part the study area is described in the second section how to obtain the groundwater demand and supply function is addressed the third section describes the method of determining the groundwater flow equation using the spatial econometric technique and in the fourth section the dynamic model of the groundwater market is expressed in the fifth section demand and supply side scenarios are explained the symbols used in this study are as follows table 1 2 1 case study there were 4236 deep wells in qazvin in of 2014 2015 data collected from 3909 wells were used in this study of these 1 185 cases had a modern irrigation system and 2 724 of them had a traditional irrigation system a modern irrigation system means the use of pressurized irrigation systems this type of irrigation often involves two micro irrigation and sprinkler irrigation methods by the end of 2017 about 34 000 hectares of land in this plain equipped with a pressurized irrigation system iran s ministry of agriculture 2017 the efficiency of this type of irrigation has been reported at about 70 the traditional irrigation method is the surface irrigation of the farm in this method the water utilization efficiency is low most farms in the qazvin plain are irrigating with this method generally the average water efficiency in the agricultural lands of qazvin plain is about 45 in fig 1 the location of the wells in the study area is shown using the gis software the characteristics of wells are shown in table 2 in terms of modern and traditional irrigation system the amount of water extraction is lower in the wells which use the modern irrigation system and the water level is also higher in these wells this can also justify the use of modern irrigation techniques the characteristics of crops are presented at the bottom of table 2 the crop cultivation area is about 159 000 hectares in total 1336 million cubic meters of water are used in this plain of which 17 percent are from surface water and 83 percent of groundwater resources industry and municipal sectors assigned 4 2 and 8 2 of total water consumption in the plain respectively iran water resources management company 2018 fig 2 shows the water consumption of each section the share of agricultural sector in the groundwater extraction of qazvin province has decreased from 88 5 in 2002 2003 to 83 in 2015 2016 the amount of groundwater extraction in the province has also reduced from 1 85 to 1 03 billion cubic meters much of this decline was due to the decline in the discharge of the exploitation wells during the same period fig 1 these factors have led to a 28 3 meter reduction in groundwater table over the past 20 years fig 3 shows the average cumulative of changes in groundwater table in qazvin aquifer considering the importance of groundwater in the qazvin plain and the damages imposed to it farmers have faced a real decline in real profitability in this region and increased extraction costs mortazavi et al 2018 getting informed about this condition has worried farmers and the government about the future of agriculture therefore some plains are arisen for supplying more water and its demand management 2 2 groundwater demand and supply function groundwater demand function is the relationship between the price of water and its quantity in many studies mathematical programming has been used to extract this function a very practical method to simulate farmer behavior at farm level is positive mathematical programming pmp model this model has been used in many studies howitt 1995 arfini and paris 1995 schmit and sinabell 2005 howitt 2005 lauwers et al 2007 medellín and azuara 2006 medellín azuara et al 2012 mosavi 2014 the pmp model is a three step process which can be calibrated based on a nonlinear cost function based on the number of inputs and outputs observed howitt 2005 in the first stage a linear programming model is designed in which the inputs shadow price is obtained the inputs used in this study include groundwater surface water machinery seeds chemical pesticides fertilizers and land the second step is related to the estimation of the production function and the quadratic cost function the use of the maximum entropy method is one of the modeling approaches in the pmp model this method is introduced by paris and howitt 1998 and designed based on substitution between inputs the third step uses a pmp model calibrated using a nonlinear objective function in order to solve the pmp model the gams software package and the conopt3 algorithm are used in order to obtain the water demand function the amount of available water is reduced to a certain extent and finally the relationship between the shadow price of water and its consumption is obtained medellín azuara et al 2010 groundwater supply is in fact a groundwater extraction function the main factor in determining the groundwater extraction is the water table provencher and burt 1993 in a study have estimated the groundwater extraction function koundouri 2004 has reported that the economic hydrological and crop factors are effective on groundwater extraction and further estimated a final cost function based on groundwater height brozovic et al 2010 in their study have investigated the effects of time and space on groundwater extraction they concluded that if the aquifer area is small the single cell aquifer model will provide an acceptable solution but this model can t be used for large aquifers in fact groundwater supply is a function of groundwater extraction the water height in the well is considered as the most important factor in determining the energy supply function the water supply function has been used in many studies according to the results reported by provencher and burt 1993 salcedo et al 2013 foster et al 2017 the water supply function can be considered as a function of hours of pump engine function energy price water flow rate water height maintenance and repair costs in the water extraction function calculating the cost of energy required to raise a cubic meter of groundwater is considered as the most important factor esteban and albiac 2011 according to the result reported by najafi alamdarlo et al 2016 balali et al 2011 and esteban and albiac 2011 the groundwater exploitation function is considered as follows 1 t c i c 0 c 1 s l h i in eq 1 t c i is the cost of water extraction from the ith well c 0 is the fixed cost of water extraction and c 1 is the cost of energy needed to raise a cubic meter of water to one meter sl is height above sea level and h i shows the water height per well by obtaining the function parameters the groundwater supply function can be achieved 2 3 groundwater equation of motion and its estimation groundwater extraction is always associated with external effects gardner et al 1997 and provencher and burt 1993 in their studies addressed four types of external effects due to groundwater extraction and introduced it as a common natural resource their effects include external strategic effects external effects of storage potential external effects and external effects of risk nevertheless groundwater flow across different parts of the earth is done based on hydrological rules which depends on the aquifer s physical characteristics freeze and cherry 1979 accordingly loaiciga 2004 in his study developed the theis 1935 inequality equation which is x r t u 4 π t a α l n t β to consider the adjacent effects therefore the equation is also rewritten as follows 2 x j t u j 4 π t a α j j l n t β j j k 1 k j n u l 4 π t a α j k l n t β j k where in eq 2 α and β are the estimating equation coefficients domenico 1972 expanded the theis 1935 equation as follows 3 x t r 1 r 2 r j u 1 4 π t a w t 1 r 1 u 2 4 π t a w t 2 r 2 u n 4 π t a w t n r n in eq 3 the pumping rate varies over time and for each well brozovic et al 2010 have considered the dynamic relationship of water level with respect to the distance between wells as eq 4 4 x t 1 j n 1 t i 1 j u n i u n 1 i 4 π t a w t n 1 r i j therefore the temporal and spatial parameters affect water extraction in the following pfeiffer and lin 2012 describe the groundwater equation of motion considering spatial effects as follows 5 s i t g w i g w i j i θ j i s j g according to eq 5 the rate of changes in aquifer s groundwater depends on extraction aquifer natural recharge and water pumping rate from all adjacent locations here θ j i is a parameter that determines the amount of intake water from the adjacent regions and is determined by the equation k j s j g s i g x j i pfeiffer and lin 2012 many factors can affect the θ j i value which sometimes makes it difficult to estimate janmaat 2005 this study was carried out aimed to develop a method to obtain this parameter box and jenkins 1970 who have played a major role in the development of time series models believe that the behavior of a variable over time is the best indicator to explain the behavior of that variable in future periods accordingly and considering that the groundwater flow equation actually has an autoregressive process balali et al 2011 therefore the spatial econometric method can be used for estimation of the parameter θ j i since groundwater is a hydrologic variable therefore it is necessary to consider spatial dependence in estimating its supply function jamali jaghdani and brümmer 2011 spatial econometrics can be used to estimate spatial dependence anselin 1988 in the estimation of spatial econometric methods spatial lag spatial errors and spatial durbin model are often used which are subsets of general nesting spatial vega and elhorst 2015 accordingly if there is a n 1 vector of variables then a gns model can be represented as follows 6 y ρ w y x β w x γ φ φ ω w φ ε in eq 6 w y is spatila lag variable w is weighted spatial matrix n n and γ is a parameter that measures cross effects of independent variables w x in adjacent regions β is independent variable coefficient ω is spatial lag coefficient in residuals and ε represent the residuals in this equation if ρ γ 0 then model is spatial error if ω γ 0 model is spatial lag and if ω 0 model is spatial durbin accordingly a spatial lag model is considered as follows to develop a groundwater extraction model 7 w i β 1 θ i j m w j β 2 x i ε i in eq 7 x i indicates the effective variables on the rate of water extraction operating hours energy prices flow rate etc m is also an adjacency matrix which can be determined by the distance between two wells the estimated value of θ j i parameter can indicate the external effects of water extraction from a well on the extraction amount of adjacent wells the most important point in these models is to determine the proximity matrix in this study the adjacency matrix is determined by considering the distance between two wells and it is standardized by the 1 d i j 2 anselin and bera 1998 d i j represents the distance between the two wells i and j in the spatial econometrics the dependence between the regions should be tested balta ozkan et al 2015 moran 1950 test and lagrange coefficients can be used to determine spatial dependencies according to the above mentioned the groundwater water table δ h t r α 1 w t a s change as follow 8 h i t h i t 1 r α 1 w i t θ i j w j t a s in eq 8 the water table in the ith well depends on the amount of water extracted from adjacent wells w j t in addition to the characteristics of the aquifer and the rate of water extraction from that well the value of θ i j is determined using the estimation of the eq 7 2 4 dynamic market modeling for groundwater a dynamic market is considered for the objective function in order to model the effects of considering scenarios which is maximized with respect to the groundwater equation of motion here the model is developed aimed to maximize the expected value of welfare due to the extraction and use of groundwater for this purpose the dynamic model is developed as follows najafi alamdarlo et al 2016 knapp and baerenklau 2006 esteban an albiac 2011 balali et al 2011 koundouri 2004 9 m a x s p i t t 0 t i o i k 0 k 1 1 τ t α 1 w i k t 0 5 α 2 w i k t 2 c 0 c 1 h i k t w i k t s t h i k t h i k t 1 r φ 1 w i k t a s h i k t 0 h 0 i k t in eq 9 t represents time i represents the user and k represents the type of irrigation system modern and flooding τ is discount rate α 1 and α 2 are intercept and slope of groundwater demand function w is the amount of water consumption c 0 and c 1 are intercept and slope of groundwater supply function h is water table in each well r is natural recharge φ is return flow coefficient to the aquifer a is aquifer area s is the storavity coefficient and h 0 is the initial water table eq 9 has been developed for a mode in which the external effects of adjacent wells extraction are not considered according to the approach used in the studies carried out by esteban and albiac 2011 and knapp and baerenklau 2006 external effects can be entered the objective function so in this case the internalization of the external effects of groundwater extraction will be done as follow 10 1 m a x s p i t t 0 t i o i k 0 k 1 1 τ t α 1 w i k t 0 5 α 2 w i k t 2 c 0 c 1 h i k t w i k t s p w θ i j

equations 10 1 to 10 5 j represents the wells adjacent to the ith well s p w indicates the shadow price of each unit of water obtained from the pmp model the value of s p w θ i j actually represents the economic value of external effects of water extraction from each well also h i k t is the amount of area under cultivation of each product t h i k t i s the total area under cultivation and ρ i k t is the water requirement of each product per hectare this generalized model will have the ability to internalize the external effects due to water extraction and will consider all adjacent wells 2 5 scenarios in this study two scenarios are used to assess the welfare effects of different policies in the water market in the first scenario water demand reduces due to improved irrigation system efficiency for this purpose irrigation efficiency in the field is increased from 45 in flooding irrigation to 70 in modern irrigation in this case the total groundwater demand decreases according to the second scenario external effects of extraction are considered in the water supply function in this case the irrigation system efficiency is not changed but the external effects of extraction are considered in the water supply function internalization creates a social water supply function and reduces the amount of groundwater supplied any change in the groundwater supply and demand function leads to a change in welfare surplus griffin 2006 a summary of the type of each of the scenarios is presented in table 3 the models required in gams software have been developed in order to estimate these models and study the effects of these scenarios and the results of applying these scenarios have been analyzed using statistics and data collected 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of groundwater demand function a positive mathematical programming pmp model was used to estimate the groundwater demand function the relationship between shadow price and groundwater quantity was considered as a demand function for this purpose the amount of resource inventory on the right of the groundwater constraint was deducted by one unit and then the groundwater shadow price is obtained in each change this process has done for two separate models for both modern and traditional irrigation system in the benchmark status quo the groundwater shadow price in traditional irrigation mode is obtained equal to 2153 13 and it was 3343 92 rials per cubic meter in the modern mode accordingly the groundwater demand function in qazvin plain is estimated as follows fig 4 considering these two functions obtained in fig 4 the values of intercept and the slope of the linear water demand function can be achieved in both the modern and traditional modes for each product for this purpose the values obtained from the water shadow price and the amount of water demand in each scenario and each product are fitted in the form of a linear regression table 4 shows the results of the estimation in both types of irrigation systems red beans potatoes pinto beans rice and sugar beet have the highest slope of groundwater demand function respectively therefore if groundwater prices rise the demand for water from these crops will be reduced further this means that other crops are less responsive to water price changes because these products are part of the farmer s permanent cropping pattern and their change is hard to come by in general the water demand function in the modern irrigation system has a greater elasticity due to more sensitivity of these farmers to the change in water price 3 2 obtaining the groundwater supply function according to the calculations the total cost of extraction per cubic meter of water is 670 rials given the amount of water consumed per hectare the cost of using groundwater is 1600 rials hectare this number is equivalent to the intercept component in the groundwater supply function there is another component in the cost function that actually forms the slope of the supply function this parameter is the cost of raising a cubic meter of groundwater to a meter esteban and albiac 2011 based on the relationship between the groundwater extracting cost and water table the slope of the supply function is 0 000018 accordingly the value of intercept and slop for the groundwater supply function will be as table 5 3 3 estimation of external effects and groundwater equation of motion in this section estimates of the groundwater equation of motion are given this estimation represents the economic value of external effects for this purpose spatial econometrics and spatial lag models slm have been used table 6 shows the results of this estimation the estimation is based on the least squares method in the first model and models ii and iii are estimated based on spatial error and spatial lag models the increase in discharge rate the annual operating hours and energy consumption lead to increase the amount of water extracted but whatever the water table is higher it has the reverse effect on the amount of water extracted moran statistics and lagrange coefficients are significant in spatial models models ii and iii it indicates the effect of spatial lag and spatial error in the model estimated coefficients are not significantly different in the three models but the most important feature of spatial econometrics is that it reveals the amount of spatial effects in model iii the value of the spatial lag coefficient of the variable rho is 0 0667 in fact this coefficient indicates that if one cubic meter is extracted from the jth adjacent well the amount of 0 0667 cubic meters of the ith water extraction will be reduced now if this coefficient is multiplied by the shadow value of the groundwater 2153 3 rials m3 then the monetary value of the external effects equal to 143 7 rials per cubic meter s p w θ i j 2153 13 0 0667 143 7 this estimation of the external effects of groundwater extraction indicate the value of s p w θ i j in relation to equation 10 1 or 10 2 it will be used to optimize the model and internalize the external effects in the following the s p w θ i j value can be used to internalize the external effects of groundwater extraction in the form of dynamic programming model groundwater market model 3 4 selecting a suitable policy groundwater market the effects of adopting each scenario on the beneficiaries have been assessed in the dynamic groundwater market 10 1 to 10 5 the cumulative average of change in water table in each scenario is shown in fig 5 the changes over the past 51 years has shown that water table decreased by 34 3 m now if the same trend continues for the future continue the current status or traditional irrigation system the water table will decrease more severely to the extent that there is no longer any economic efficiency for extraction if irrigation systems are improved and demand for groundwater decreases scenario a it can reduce the rate of water table reduction in the aquifer applying scenario b internalization and reduction in water supply have the ability to slow down the decline in water table but it is less than the other scenario scenario a therefore reducing water demand and improving irrigation efficiency will have a more significant impact on preventing in groundwater table reduction this phenomenon can be due to lack of sufficient development of agricultural sector in the qazvin plain because the exploiters of groundwater do not have enough ability to internalize external effects hence the effectiveness of this policy is less the groundwater availability and consumption in each scenario is shown in fig 6 continuing the current status can make it difficult for more access to groundwater than the other two scenarios but adopting scenario a and improving irrigation systems would be more reliable in the sustainability of groundwater supply in qazvin plain fig 7 shows how to change the cropping pattern in each scenario the continuation of the current status causes a cropping pattern over the next 50 years drives into crops that have fewer water requirements but the farmers benefit will also less these changes will actually threaten the welfare of farmers in the region the internalization of external effects related to groundwater extraction scenario b will also make this situation worse the cropping pattern becomes more restrictive six crops are eliminated this situation can make the welfare of farmers worse but in scenario a improving the efficiency of irrigation system the cropping pattern preserves varies and the cultivation area of crops with higher profits will expand this situation can lead to improved welfare conditions for farmers the amount of cultivating area of each crop is shown in table 7 the continuation of the current trend will increase the cultivation area of wheat barley alfalfa red bean and pinto bean these products have less gross income per hectare in scenario b corn tomatoes maize sugar beet rice and potatoes have been eliminated from the crop pattern these crops also have more gross income in cropping pattern scenario a and the use of modern irrigation system will result in an appropriate combination of cropping patterns and the cultivation area of profitable crops increases the present value of the social surplus in groundwater market consumer supplier surplus in scenario a is also greater than scenario b accordingly improving irrigation systems can lead to an increase in the welfare of exploiters from groundwater while it also leads to more groundwater sustainability another way to choose the best scenario is to make cost benefit analysis in this method the weighted average of revenues and operational costs are calculated for each cropping pattern the results show that scenario a has the highest gross margin and more benefits to the farmer per hectare accordingly the benefit cost ratio in this scenario is also 1 75 therefore scenario a is selected as the best suggestion 4 conclusion the occurrence of water crises and reduced access in iran has made it necessary to adopt multilateral policies in water management accordingly this study was carried out aimed to analyze the effects of policies adopted in the field of groundwater demand and supply in the framework of a dynamic groundwater market therefore firstly the groundwater supply function groundwater extraction function was estimated in qazvin plain then positive mathematical planning model pmp was used to obtain groundwater demand function in the next step the external effects of groundwater extraction were estimated by developing the groundwater equation of motion and using the spatial econometric method two scenarios in the groundwater market were analyzed the first scenario is related to reducing irrigation water demand by improving the irrigation system efficiency scenario a this scenario will reduce total consumption of water reduced groundwater supply was evaluated as another scenario in the model scenario b applying these two scenarios in the groundwater market is associated with different consequences according to the results of the estimation one cubic meter of groundwater extraction would cause damage to adjacency wells about 0 0667 cubic meters this damage will cause a loss of 143 7 rials per cubic meter of groundwater the internalization of this damage leads to reduce the groundwater supply but it is not so much that it can slow down reduction in water table in the aquifer therefore the policy of internalization of damages caused by extraction will not have the ability to sustain groundwater in the qazvin plain this finding isn t consistent with the study of esteban and albiac 2011 therefore improving irrigation systems and reduced water demand will have a better effect in this scenario the combination of the future cropping pattern will tend to products with higher profitability the welfare of the groundwater exploiters will increase and the rate of water table reduction in the aquifer will be reduced hence the adoption of this policy will lead to increase the sustainability of groundwater exploitation the cost benefit analysis also shows that this scenario is the best choice one of the factors that make this policy more effective is related to the low welfare of agricultural water users in the plain farmers don t have enough ability to internalize external effects economically but applying support policies by government and improved irrigation systems can lead to satisfactory results in the field of groundwater the results of this study indicate applying subsidy policies is strongly recommended to improve the irrigation systems efficiency in the region this finding isn t consistent with the results of scheierling et al 2006 which argues that subsidy policies can t protect water finally the groundwater market formation can be used as an economic tool to improve the aquifer conditions in the qazvin plain but its success depends on the kind of policies applied to it groundwater market policies generally have to be supportive because the welfare level of groundwater users in qazvin plain is low and this can challenge the internalization of groundwater extraction accordingly improving the irrigation system efficiency in a 50 year horizon will increase the welfare level by 143 but the internalization of external effects will be associated with a 33 loss
