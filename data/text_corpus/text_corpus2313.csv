11565,due to water scarcity water saving practices wsps are being implemented in the irrigation districts of the upper yellow river basin causing a series of consequences e g the reduction of field irrigation amount and groundwater depth gwd increase the impacts of irrigation water reduction and gwd increase in canal systems with heterogeneous land covers is complex and remains unclear thus the need to be elucidated to efficiently promote wsps based on the two year field observations in 2012 and 2013 and former studies the hydrus dualkc model which has been well calibrated and validated in a typical canal system in hetao was used to predict the changes in transpiration evaporation and salt accumulation considering scenarios with various gwds and irrigation strategies results showed that under present irrigation scheduling plant transpiration of maize watermelon tamarisk and sunflower had an initial slight increase then reached a peak value and finally decreased in the two years with gwd increase while soil evaporation and salt accumulation both declined continuously based on integration results from the three crops and the natural vegetation simulation scenarios an optimum gwd of between 1 7 2 3 m for the crop fields and 1 4 2 0 m for the natural land was recommended with optimum gwd 15 30 of water diversion from the yellow river during the growing season can be saved each year when considering the irrigation strategies salt accumulation increased and crop transpiration declined with irrigation reduction yet the impact on soil evaporation was limited it also showed that only sunflower had the potential to reduce irrigation amount about 20 future water saving should pay more attention to the water delivery process and the optimization of irrigation during the non growing season an additional irrigation to watermelon during its development stage and a pre season irrigation to tamarisk can largely improve their growth and the recommended irrigation depths were 100 mm and 250 mm respectively these results can be reference criterion for the further implementation of wsps keywords model simulation irrigation strategies optimum groundwater depth heterogeneous land covers agro ecosystem salt accumulation 1 introduction improving irrigation management for water saving is a focus on world agricultural production this is especially true for the yellow river basin in china which has suffered critical water shortages and resulting large losses and severe damage to both the economy and the environment ren et al 2016 the hetao irrigation district hetao is a typical arid irrigated region in the upper yellow river basin for a long time excessive water diversions coupled with poor irrigation and drainage practices have caused shallow water tables and resulting severe water logging and secondary salinity problems large volumes of diverted water have been wasted through canal seepage and leakage field deep percolation and runoff as well as evaporation due to water scarcity and low water use efficiency water saving practices wsps in hetao have been and continue to be promoted by the government at both the irrigation district and farm levels the application of wsps causes a decline of groundwater table that favors the control of water logging and salinity xu et al 2010 however it also brings about new problems such as degradation of natural vegetation and increasing risk of drought shallow groundwater exerts strong effects on vegetation that can maintain yield stability or even enhance productivity if it becomes a water source during water deficit periods nosetto et al 2009 however it can also hamper vegetation growth when it is too shallow due to waterlogging and root anoxia or may even cause severe soil salinization ayars et al 2006 kahlown et al 2005 the appropriate irrigation for a given crop field is also closely related to the groundwater depth gwd therefore irrigation management strategies and adoption of wsps should well consider the groundwater table management for arid areas with shallow water table note that this is a somewhat more complex issue for irrigated areas in the upper yellow river basin because of the special farmland use rights i e household contract responsibility system tan et al 2006 in china the cropland has been divided into small farms resulting in a fragmented crop distribution landscape wu et al 2005 ren et al 2016 various kinds of crops e g wheat maize sunflower and melon are planted in adjacent and small plots and they may be rotated every one or two years fig 1 at the same time natural patches of grass woods shrub and marsh within and surrounding the croplands also play an important part in the landscape ren et al 2017 all of the above factors make the land cover rather fragmented and heterogeneous various crops and plants have different phenological characteristics and thus distinct irrigation and management strategies that may occur in adjacent areas what is more they are confronted with the same important external environment i e the groundwater table in local agro ecosystem understanding and quantifying the impact of groundwater influences on vegetation growth and searching for an optimum gwd and appropriate irrigation strategies are critical to minimize risks and maximize benefits in shallow groundwater areas in croplands many studies have addressed the effects of gwds on soils and crops growth in different regions of the world e g benz et al 1981 kang et al 2001 ayars et al 2006 some studies also discussed optimum gwds and irrigation strategies for crop growth zipper et al 2015 kahlown et al 2005 xu et al 2013 williamson and kriz 1970 demonstrated that it is necessary to know at least the crop species soil characteristics and watering procedure to specify an optimum water table depth among crop attributes root growth and distribution and tolerance to waterlogging and salinity are of key importance in regulating groundwater influences nosetto et al 2009 in natural ecosystems much of the research on vegetation water use from shallow ground water as well as the ecological water table depth has been done as well feng et al 2012 li et al 2015 cui and shao 2005 these studies provide knowledge of the interaction between shallow groundwater and vegetation water uptake appropriate gwd and irrigation management strategies for a certain crop or certain natural vegetation were proposed however it is difficult to extend and generalize the results because of different soil types irrigation regimes plant rooting patterns and salinity tolerances depth and fluctuations of water tables and climatic conditions moreover due to heterogeneous land cover patterns and the regional effect of the groundwater table results of the former studies focusing on a certain land cover may be unsuitable for irrigation districts in the upper yellow river basin appropriate groundwater management in an agro ecosystem should consider the growth of different crops and the sustainability of natural vegetation simultaneously when it comes to the control of gwd drainage engineers are generally concerned with removing excess soil water and lowering the water table as rapidly as economically feasible irrespective of the type of crops plant scientists on the other hand have generally studied the water and aeration requirements of specific crops under laboratory or field experimental conditions neglecting its applicability in the field with heterogeneous land covers to our knowledge there are few reported studies that determine optimal gwd and irrigation management strategies with comprehensive consideration of fragmented crops natural vegetation and the lateral groundwater exchange at the scale of canal irrigation system particularly for research in the upper yellow river basin wang et al 2004 pereira et al 2007 xu et al 2013 research based on a canal system can provide a more realistic view on water table and irrigation management because the whole agro ecosystem in a district is more comparable to a representative irrigation canal system which contains various kinds of land cover not a single crop thus the results can be of practical significance in real agro ecosystems in arid irrigated areas with shallow water tables the optimum gwd should achieve the following objectives 1 reducing salt accumulation as much as possible to improve soil conditions 2 reducing non beneficial bare soil evaporation to increase water use efficiency 3 favoring crop growth combined with appropriate irrigation to increase yields or at least no reduction and 4 maintain the sustainability of natural patches within and surrounding the croplands consequently the determination of optimum gwd and irrigation strategies for an agro ecosystem involves ground water quality vegetation salt tolerance canal delivery management irrigation frequency and the nature of the vadose zone this level of complexity makes it impossible to conduct field experiments that can fully consider all the factors at once ayars et al 2006 moreover the control of the groundwater level in the field is difficult and costly in field experiments in this study a simulation model which has been calibrated and validated in a typical agro ecosystem of hetao ren et al 2016 2017 was adopted to explore series of simulation scenarios in order to obtain optimum groundwater and irrigation management strategies systematic comparison and analysis of the simulation results were conducted therefore the objectives of this paper were 1 to simulate water and salt dynamics and to assess irrigation water use under various groundwater table and irrigation scenarios in an irrigation canal system of hetao upper yellow river basin and 2 to further propose an optimum groundwater and irrigation management strategy for hetao and other arid irrigation districts of the upper yellow river basin which could provide comprehensive consideration of the cultivation of various crops and the sustainability of natural lands for the whole agro ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and experiment 2 1 1 location land cover and irrigation water use in hetao the hetao covers an area of 1 12 mha and is located upstream of the yellow river north china the plain elevation in hetao varies from 1007 to 1050 m above mean sea level msl and exhibits a small slope in the direction of southwest to northeast the groundwater table is shallow with depth ranging between 0 5 3 0 m during the year and it has a very small hydraulic gradient of 0 10 0 25 regionally soil is mainly formed from alluvial deposits with a silt loam texture hetao has an arid to semi arid continental climate the average annual precipitation is 160 mm while 20 cm pan evaporation averages 2240 mm annually the mean annual temperature is 8 2 c and there are 135 150 frost free days and 3100 3300 h of sunshine per year feng et al 2005 the hetao includes 0 57 mha of agricultural area irrigated by the yellow river the predominant crops grown are sunflower maize wheat and some vegetables their distribution is highly fragmented because of smallholder land use rights another important land use type in hetao is natural land which covers an area about half as large as that of the agricultural land the natural land is mainly sparse grassland with scattered shrubs or abandoned cultivated land caused by high soil salinization it exhibits a patchy distribution within and surrounding the croplands and the species composition of the vegetation is simple with most of them being salt tolerant vegetation such as tamarix chinensis phragmites australis elymus dahuricus and suaeda salsa the natural land is important to biodiversity in hetao it is also important to keep the natural succession of the agro ecosystem in recent decades with the development of irrigated agriculture and the growing seriousness of environmental problems the habitat suitable for plant growth is degrading the rest of the lands are scattered sand dunes residential land and water bodies ren et al 2017 because of land fragmentation the land cover is highly heterogeneous and may significantly influence the eco hydrological processes in hetao due to the arid climate conditions agriculture in this area relies heavily on irrigation and irrigation water of about 5 billion m3 per year is mainly drawn from the yellow river the hetao has a complete system to convey irrigation water to the croplands generally there are 4 6 irrigation periods during the growing season based on the climate and river water conditions the first irrigation is mainly applied to sunflower and vegetables including watermelon fields as pre sowing irrigation for salt leaching and soil moisture recharge water is also applied during this event for wheat growth during the tillering stage but not for maize since the plants are too small the second event is only for wheat the third is for almost all crops except vegetables while the fourth and fifth are mainly for maize and sunflower the sixth if it occurs is for maize only normally irrigation is never applied to natural lands and the other areas with the shallow water table heterogeneous land cover and various irrigation schedules the irrigation water use in hetao is rather complicated during a water diversion only some crop fields are irrigated the over irrigation and large percolation as well as the canal seepage raise the groundwater table quickly soon the water table in the nearby non irrigated fields is also affected through lateral groundwater migration as a result the groundwater table in the whole croplands is elevated at the same time a more regional scale groundwater lateral flow from croplands to the non irrigated natural lands and the other areas begins to develop even though there is no water purposely applied to the non irrigated crops and natural vegetation their water depletion can be supplemented by water table rise and capillary rise at the same time substantial groundwater consumption by vegetation may lower the water table triggering lateral groundwater flows from the surrounding environment and or deeper aquifers heuperman 1999 jobbagy and jackson 2004 the lateral groundwater migration within the croplands and between the croplands and natural lands is frequent and intense in this way the percolated water from the irrigated fields is significantly reused and the water use efficiency can be increased to some extent however it also brings disadvantages such as salt accumulation and a large amount of non beneficial bare soil evaporation ren et al 2016 this is especially true for the natural lands because they are not irrigated during the entire growing season the natural lands have been recognized as the main dry drainage area in hetao accommodating the excess percolation water and salt wu et al 2009 yu et al 2016 2 1 2 the representative study area and field observations the yangchang canal command area yca fig 1 is a representative unit ru for investigating the agro hydrological processes of hetao it covers an area of about 20 ha located in the western region of hetao 40 48 40 n 107 05 15 e 1038 5 m altitude the area is divided into many pieces of small cropland ranging from 546 m2 to 6345 m2 and natural land in the southwest sunflower maize wheat and some vegetables are cultivated and account for 30 31 7 and 32 of crop area respectively while tamarisk tamarix chinensis lour is the dominant vegetation in the natural areas the crops are irrigated by surface basin irrigation and the natural land is not irrigated field observations were conducted for the main crops maize sunflower and watermelon and the natural vegetation tamarisk during 2012 and 2013 in yca a total of 7 observation wells with 4 in the farmland and 3 in the natural land fig 1 were installed at a depth of 3 0 m to monitor and sample groundwater daily meteorological data crop development stages fig 2 growth parameters and yield were measured and recorded the soil water and salt dynamics were also monitored to a depth of 100 cm soil physical properties including particle size distribution water content at saturation and field capacity θs θfc cm3cm 3 dry bulk density and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks cm d 1 were also measured in situ or in the laboratory irrigation was recorded and measured in the field table 1 ren et al 2016 the soil classified as silt loam is representative of soils in hetao 2 2 model description the hydrus dualkc model as described in ren et al 2016 2017 was selected as the simulation model in this model the dualkc approach allen et al 1998 was integrated into hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2009 to calculate the potential evaporation and transpiration rates for the implementation of the atmospheric boundary condition and a mechanistic approach i e a two stage calculation method from the dualkc approach for calculating actual soil evaporation was also introduced to the hydrus code it is a more practical method and has greater flexibility to address variable conditions e g the soil is not fully covered by crops partly wetted or mulched by different materials and natural vegetation grown on poor conditions the model has been calibrated and validated both in the main crop fields ren et al 2016 and the natural land ren et al 2017 in yca initial conditions were set in the model with measured soil water content and soil salinity concentration the daily precipitation irrigation as well as the potential transpiration tp and evaporation ep rates estimated using the dualkc approach were used for the atmospheric boundary condition the lower boundary condition was defined as time variable pressure head deduced from the water table depth the solute transport upper and lower boundary conditions were defined as concentration flux using the measured salt concentration of irrigation water and groundwater respectively soil hydraulic parameters van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 and solute transport parameters table 2 root water uptake parameters feddes et al 1978 dirksen and augustijn 1988 table 3 and evaporation parameters allen et al 1998 table 4 have been well calibrated and validated in ren et al 2016 2017 simulation results showed that model performance was generally good for all three crops and tamarisk thus it is reliable and useful for analyzing the hydrological processes and evaluating the future water table and irrigation conditions in the irrigation canal system 2 3 scenario simulation for assessing the impact of irrigation and gwd changes various gwd scenarios and irrigation strategies were designed and simulated using the hydrus dualkc scenario analysis was conducted to investigate reasonable groundwater depths and appropriate irrigation strategies for growth of three crops and tamarisk in hetao the simulation scenarios are summarized and listed in table 5 with a detailed description in the following part in all of these scenarios the plant growth initial soil water and salt profile simulation period climate and all the other parameters relative to the year 2012 and 2013 were set the same as those adopted in ren et al 2016 2017 to represent site conditions small elevation differences exist among the fields in yca due to local topographic variations and the natural land was found to be about 30 cm lower than the surrounding farmland ren et al 2017 therefore the gwds in each of the fields may be different while the water table levels will be more consistent because they are not far from each other and have rapid hydraulic connection fig 3 so the gwd scenarios for maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk in the two years were set taking the data of 2012 and 2013 as the references i e gwd would drop 0 present 20 40 60 80 100 and 150 cm based on the 2012 and 2013 reference depth of each vegetation deeper gwd scenarios were not considered as according to previous studies gwd exceeding 250 cm would significantly reduce capillary rise and its effect on crop growth is negligible hao et al 2014 xu et al 2013 in the future the tamarisk may adapt to the increased gwd scenarios and its root may elongate to re establish contact with the new water table gasry 1963 di tomaso 1998 nippert et al 2010 thus potential root length increase scenario simulations corresponding to all the gwd strategies for tamarisk were also conducted ren et al 2017 the present irrigation schedule adopted in yca is typical in hetao and has been used for more than 20 years the actual irrigation date and amount each year may be adjusted slightly according to rainfall farmers experience and river water conditions as shown in table 1 in order to tackle water shortage issues the chinese government started an irrigation district rehabilitation program focused on water savings and the aim of the program at hetao is to reduce water diversion from the yellow river from 5 billion m3 to 4 billion m3 or less while keeping the same agricultural production therefore the reduction of future irrigation amount is inevitable based on irrigation scheduling table 1 for two representative years the dry year 2012 and the wet year 2013 another two reduced irrigation strategies set to 80 and 60 of the present irrigation amount were considered for the seven gwd scenarios for the three irrigated crops they are noted as 1 0ir 0 8ir and 0 6ir based on previous studies watermelon only had a pre planting irrigation and it was mainly dependent on the capillary rise and thus suffered water salt stress during the growth period ren et al 2016 lei et al 2003 this was related to that watermelon was unsuitable to flood irrigation as it may result in root and fruit rot or even dead plants especially in the fruit period however some agronomic measures e g through ridging and trenching or furrow irrigation can be applied to tackle these irrigation problems but with more labor input required thus an additional irrigation of various depths during watermelon s development stage third irrigation events in yca were also simulated and assessed in the future scenarios in order to elucidate the impacts of artificial watering on soil water salt dynamics and to determine how to alleviate salt stress on the natural land we also evaluated the influence of a preseason irrigation event of various amounts at the initial stages of tamarisk growth during the first irrigation these additional irrigation scenarios were only conducted with three critical gwd strategies present r 0 and increases of 40 r 40 and 100 r 100 cm in order to have a quantitative comparison of these scenarios indicators including relative evaporation i e the ratio of actual to potential evaporation ea ep and the ratio of salt accumulation i e the ratio of salt increment to initial salt storage δs sini were used to evaluate water use efficiency and salt accumulation respectively given that the amount of dry matter produced by any plant and the water it transpires are proportional and that this relation is constant for each plant species or variety under a given set of growing conditions arkley 1963 relative transpiration the ratio of actual to potential transpiration ta tp was used to assess plant growth conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 transpiration under present irrigation scheduling the actual transpiration ta of maize watermelon tamarisk and sunflower had a slight increase at first then reached peak values at about r 40 cm and finally decreased both in the two years with the gwd increase fig 4 relative transpiration ta tp for maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk ranged between 0 89 0 93 0 94 0 99 0 90 0 96 and 0 69 0 73 in 2012 and 0 80 0 81 0 95 0 99 0 60 0 67 and 0 58 0 65 in 2013 respectively the comparison of crop transpiration between scenarios considering salt stress and regardless of salt stress suggested that soil salinization had the larger impact on crop growth scenario results showed that the watermelon in 2013 was the crop that suffered the most serious water salt stress it was because the watermelon had only once pre season irrigation during the simulation period and the precipitation was rather scarce in 2013 the ta tp values of sunflower were above 0 90 consistently in both years indicating that it was seldom stressed the reason may be that sunflower is more salt tolerant than maize and watermelon and it also has the largest irrigation depths even though the salt tolerance of tamarisk was far higher than the three crops it suffered the most severe stress in both years this was because the tamarisk in natural patches had never been irrigated and the initial salt content in the root zone was very high in the future if the root of tamarisk elongated and adapted to the deeper gwd scenarios the plant transpiration would be increased significantly as shown in fig 4d this resulted from the soil solution concentration in the deeper layers being much lower than the upper layers the increased root length could extract more water of good quality thus salt stress was greatly alleviated all the vegetation in 2012 had relatively mild water salt stress due to the significantly higher precipitation especially for watermelon it benefited the most from the 80 mm rainfall on june 26 27th right after the third irrigation this was the inspiration for creating additional irrigation scenarios for watermelon relative transpiration for most of the vegetation declined more steeply as the water table deepened below the optimum band in the dry year 2013 suggesting a stronger positive groundwater influence during this period watermelon was also the crop for which ta tp declined the most with gwd increase indicating it was more dependent on groundwater than the other vegetation under present irrigation strategy under the present gwd conditions the irrigation reduction strategies 0 8ir and 0 6ir for maize and watermelon showed an obvious decrease in ta especially in the dry year 2013 fig 4a and c the ta tp of maize decreased from 0 89 to 0 88 and 0 85 in 2012 and from 0 81 to 0 77 and 0 73 in 2013 for the 0 8ir and 0 6ir strategies respectively that of watermelon also decreased from 0 93 to 0 91 and 0 89 in 2012 and from 0 66 to 0 62 and 0 58 in 2013 for sunflower the 0 8ir and 0 6ir strategies didn t show much difference from the present strategy in 2012 in 2013 the 0 8ir was almost the same as the present strategy while the 0 6ir began to have an obvious reduction it implied that the irrigation amount for sunflower was too large especially in the wet year 2012 and a reduction e g 0 8ir might not affect its growth even in the dry year 2013 for maize and watermelon it seemed the current irrigation amount was not sufficient and didn t have much water saving potential under current irrigation scheduling when further considering the gwd increase the shape of ta tp curve in 0 8ir and 0 6ir strategies for each crop were similar to the present irrigation scenarios 1 0ir and generally the lower the irrigation depths the lower the ta tp curves fig 4 3 2 evaporation and salt accumulation simulations showed that soil evaporation and salt accumulation declined continuously with increased gwd for all four vegetation types with the current irrigation conditions fig 4 soil evaporation decreased sharply at the beginning of the gwd increase and gradually changed to mild declines when the gwd increased from r 0 to r 150 cm the relative evaporation ea ep for maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk respectively decreased from 0 73 to 0 28 0 81 0 45 0 62 0 29 and 0 51 0 17 in 2012 and from 0 62 to 0 32 0 81 0 52 0 62 0 26 and 0 52 0 14 in 2013 the ratio of salt accumulation δs sini respectively decreased from 0 15 to 0 11 0 05 to 0 43 0 46 to 0 2 and 0 39 0 06 in 2012 and from 0 10 to 0 06 0 13 to 0 38 0 18 to 0 3 and 0 66 0 15 in 2013 note that the negative values of δs sini represented the decrease of salt storage in the soil profile when considering the irrigation reduction strategies 0 8ir and 0 6ir in the irrigated croplands soil evaporation almost remained the same with the present irrigation conditions implying that soil evaporation was not sensitive to the irrigation amount however salt accumulation showed a significant increase with reduction of irrigation amount for example under the present gwd in 2012 the 0 8ir and 0 6ir irrigation strategies increased δs sini from 0 15 to 0 34 and 0 49 for maize from 0 05 to 0 09 and 0 22 for sunflower and from 0 46 to 0 50 and 0 55 for watermelon this was because sufficient irrigation could leach more salts into the deeper layers if the irrigation amount was reduced although the salt stress might reduce transpiration and further limit the upward salt flux the ultimate salt accumulation would still be larger thus the ratio of salt accumulation δs sini was the largest for the non irrigated natural land and the seldom irrigated watermelon field under the present irrigation conditions if the gwd of maize increases 90 cm in 2012 and 70 cm in 2013 or watermelon increases 80 cm in 2012 and 50 cm in 2013 the salt content in the root zone 0 90 cm would not increase the sunflower fields were already in a desalinated status in both years because of excessive irrigation and the desalting effect was enhanced with gwd increase therefore a deeper gwd and larger irrigation amount would be better for salt control also the root increase of tamarisk would not have a significant effect on soil evaporation and salt accumulation fig 4d 3 3 additional irrigation strategies for watermelon and natural land under the present gwd conditions if an additional irrigation was applied to watermelon during the third irrigation events plant transpiration increased significantly with the increased irrigation depth in the dry year 2013 fig 5 the increase rate was remarkably high with irrigation depths from 0 to 10 cm in 2012 as a large rainfall occurred in the third irrigation period and also can supplement the water deficit the additional irrigation didn t make too much difference when the additional irrigation depth exceeded 100 mm the ta was even reduced in 2012 this may be caused by waterlogging positive effects of additional irrigation were obviously greater during drier years in contrast negative effects waterlogging were more likely to happen in wet years thus an additional irrigation depth of 10 cm was recommended for watermelon if the gwd increased to gwd 40 or gwd 100 cm the crop transpiration was only slightly affected while bare soil evaporation and salt accumulation can be reduced significantly for all the irrigation strategies pre season irrigation can significantly improve tamarisk growth fig 6 under the present gwd the ta tp increased sharply from about 0 7 0 92 in 2012 and from 0 60 to 0 80 in 2013 with an irrigation depth increase from 0 to 250 mm then the increase rates gradually become smaller with ta tp increasing from 0 92 to 0 95 in 2012 and from 0 80 to 0 91 in 2013 when irrigation depth further increased to 500 mm the gwd scenarios gwd 40 and gwd 100 were similar and both obviously superior to the present conditions in promoting transpiration the ta tp of gwd 40 and gwd 100 scenarios increased by about 0 03 compared to present values in both years moreover the deeper gwd scenarios can also substantially reduce non beneficial bare soil evaporation and root zone salt buildup additional irrigation increased tamarisk transpiration more significantly in the dry year 2013 from the perspective of promoting plant growth and saving water an irrigation depth of 250 mm for pre season irrigation and a deeper gwd was recommended for the tamarisk 3 4 optimum groundwater depth and irrigation strategies in order to maintain agricultural production and the sustainability of natural patches as well as to save water the gwd in the natural land should be kept at a reasonable level for improving vegetation growth and reducing bare soil evaporation and root zone salt accumulation in a canal system with heterogeneous land cover and almost the same groundwater conditions efforts should be made to coordinate the growth of all main crops and the natural vegetation under present irrigation schedules an optimum gwd shouldn t have adverse effects on vegetation growth so plant transpiration of each crop shouldn t be worse than present based on this a suitable gwd range for each crop can be defined as shown in fig 4 the gwd for which ta tp reached the peak value for each plant was also identified at the same time to reduce bare soil evaporation and root zone salt accumulation it is obvious that the gwd should be kept as deep as possible thus the gwd from the peak value point to the end of the suitable gwd is defined as the optimum interval in this way it not only can reduce non beneficial bare soil evaporation and salt accumulation but it can also improve vegetation growth to some extent as a result the optimum gwd ranges in 2012 were respectively from r 60 to r 150 cm for maize from r 40 to r 100 cm for sunflower from r 40 to r 100 cm for watermelon and from r 40 to r 100 cm for tamarisk during 2013 those were respectively from r 40 to r 100 cm for maize from r 20 to r 40 cm for sunflower from r 40 to r 80 cm for watermelon and from r 40 to r 100 cm for tamarisk based on above comprehensive analysis and result comparison the gwd between r 40 cm and r 100 cm could be regarded as the optimum gwd range for the studied irrigation system due to its general applicability for all three crop types and the natural vegetation the final optimum gwd interval is also very good to tamarisk if its root length increased with the gwd fig 4d eventually the seasonal mean values for optimum gwds were about 170 230 cm in the croplands and about 140 200 cm in the natural land according to previous literature pereira et al 2007 xu et al 2013 hao et al 2014 a targeted gwd of 100 150 cm was proposed for wheat and maize in the nearby qingtongxia irrigation district qid the optimum gwd obtained in this paper is a little deeper than that from the qid which may be because the gwd scenarios in this study were fluctuating while in the qid studies they were constant ren et al 2017 ruan et al 2008 concluded that excessive lowering of the groundwater table mainly when that depth exceeds 3 m would bring negative impacts on crop productivity and the environment due to reduced capillary rise in hetao referring to the previous studies it seems the optimum gwd for the complex agro ecosystem in this study is reasonable and appropriate with optimum gwd vegetation growth would not be negatively affected and it can even be improved to some extent further the bare soil evaporation and salt accumulation can be reduced by 26 48 and 45 100 this indicated that 50 100 mm depth of water consumption could be saved accounting for 15 30 of water diversion from the yellow river during the growing season each year irrigation scenarios showed that reduction of irrigation for maize and watermelon would obviously reduce their transpiration while for sunflower the reduced strategy 0 8ir would not affect its growth therefore except for 20 of the irrigation water for sunflower that can be saved there was almost no water saving potential during the growing season thus under the present irrigation frequency the wsps should pay more attention to the water delivery processes and the optimization of irrigation during the non growing season i e pre season irrigation and autumn irrigation these two irrigations accounted for more than 50 of total water diversion from the yellow river per year and were the controlling factors to the gwd if the irrigation water is sufficient during the third irrigation event a 100 mm additional irrigation for watermelon can significantly improve its growth conditions a pre season irrigation of 250 mm to the natural land is also helpful to sustain ecosystem health note that this is suggested to be adopted every few years on the natural lands only if it is necessary under optimum gwd ranges scenarios r 40 cm and r 100 cm the positive effects of additional irrigation are obviously enhanced as shown in fig 6 4 conclusions the well calibrated hydrus dualkc model was applied to assess the effects of future groundwater depth gwd scenarios and irrigation strategies on the main crops maize sunflower watermelon and natural vegetation tamarisk in a canal system of hetao china the consequences of water table decline and irrigation reduction were predicted and analyzed an optimal gwd range and appropriate irrigation suggestions were provided for the irrigation system with various land covers results showed that under present irrigation scheduling transpiration ta of maize watermelon tamarisk and sunflower had a slight increase at first then reached peak values at about r 40 cm and finally decreased over the two years with gwd increase soil evaporation and salt accumulation both declined continuously the reduced irrigation strategies 0 8ir and 0 6ir for maize and watermelon showed an obvious decrease in ta especially in the dry year 2013 while for sunflower the 0 8ir strategy was almost the same as for 1 0ir yet the 0 6ir scenario began to reduce transpiration salt accumulation increased with the irrigation reduction yet soil evaporation was marginally affected the integrated results from scenario simulations showed that the current gwd should be further increased 40 100 cm i e from r 40 to r 100 cm to obtain the optimum target improving vegetation growth and reducing bare soil evaporation and salt accumulation as a result an optimum gwd of between 1 7 2 3 m for the crops and 1 4 2 0 m for the natural land was recommended with optimum gwds there is the potential that 15 30 of water diversions from the yellow river can be reduced during the growing season each year irrigation reduction scenarios also showed that only sunflower had the potential to save about 20 of the water applied irrigation water to other vegetation was just enough or even inadequate in the dry year an additional irrigation to watermelon during its development stage the third irrigation period and a pre season irrigation to tamarisk the first irrigation period can greatly improve their growth and the recommended irrigation depths were 100 mm and 250 mm

11565,due to water scarcity water saving practices wsps are being implemented in the irrigation districts of the upper yellow river basin causing a series of consequences e g the reduction of field irrigation amount and groundwater depth gwd increase the impacts of irrigation water reduction and gwd increase in canal systems with heterogeneous land covers is complex and remains unclear thus the need to be elucidated to efficiently promote wsps based on the two year field observations in 2012 and 2013 and former studies the hydrus dualkc model which has been well calibrated and validated in a typical canal system in hetao was used to predict the changes in transpiration evaporation and salt accumulation considering scenarios with various gwds and irrigation strategies results showed that under present irrigation scheduling plant transpiration of maize watermelon tamarisk and sunflower had an initial slight increase then reached a peak value and finally decreased in the two years with gwd increase while soil evaporation and salt accumulation both declined continuously based on integration results from the three crops and the natural vegetation simulation scenarios an optimum gwd of between 1 7 2 3 m for the crop fields and 1 4 2 0 m for the natural land was recommended with optimum gwd 15 30 of water diversion from the yellow river during the growing season can be saved each year when considering the irrigation strategies salt accumulation increased and crop transpiration declined with irrigation reduction yet the impact on soil evaporation was limited it also showed that only sunflower had the potential to reduce irrigation amount about 20 future water saving should pay more attention to the water delivery process and the optimization of irrigation during the non growing season an additional irrigation to watermelon during its development stage and a pre season irrigation to tamarisk can largely improve their growth and the recommended irrigation depths were 100 mm and 250 mm respectively these results can be reference criterion for the further implementation of wsps keywords model simulation irrigation strategies optimum groundwater depth heterogeneous land covers agro ecosystem salt accumulation 1 introduction improving irrigation management for water saving is a focus on world agricultural production this is especially true for the yellow river basin in china which has suffered critical water shortages and resulting large losses and severe damage to both the economy and the environment ren et al 2016 the hetao irrigation district hetao is a typical arid irrigated region in the upper yellow river basin for a long time excessive water diversions coupled with poor irrigation and drainage practices have caused shallow water tables and resulting severe water logging and secondary salinity problems large volumes of diverted water have been wasted through canal seepage and leakage field deep percolation and runoff as well as evaporation due to water scarcity and low water use efficiency water saving practices wsps in hetao have been and continue to be promoted by the government at both the irrigation district and farm levels the application of wsps causes a decline of groundwater table that favors the control of water logging and salinity xu et al 2010 however it also brings about new problems such as degradation of natural vegetation and increasing risk of drought shallow groundwater exerts strong effects on vegetation that can maintain yield stability or even enhance productivity if it becomes a water source during water deficit periods nosetto et al 2009 however it can also hamper vegetation growth when it is too shallow due to waterlogging and root anoxia or may even cause severe soil salinization ayars et al 2006 kahlown et al 2005 the appropriate irrigation for a given crop field is also closely related to the groundwater depth gwd therefore irrigation management strategies and adoption of wsps should well consider the groundwater table management for arid areas with shallow water table note that this is a somewhat more complex issue for irrigated areas in the upper yellow river basin because of the special farmland use rights i e household contract responsibility system tan et al 2006 in china the cropland has been divided into small farms resulting in a fragmented crop distribution landscape wu et al 2005 ren et al 2016 various kinds of crops e g wheat maize sunflower and melon are planted in adjacent and small plots and they may be rotated every one or two years fig 1 at the same time natural patches of grass woods shrub and marsh within and surrounding the croplands also play an important part in the landscape ren et al 2017 all of the above factors make the land cover rather fragmented and heterogeneous various crops and plants have different phenological characteristics and thus distinct irrigation and management strategies that may occur in adjacent areas what is more they are confronted with the same important external environment i e the groundwater table in local agro ecosystem understanding and quantifying the impact of groundwater influences on vegetation growth and searching for an optimum gwd and appropriate irrigation strategies are critical to minimize risks and maximize benefits in shallow groundwater areas in croplands many studies have addressed the effects of gwds on soils and crops growth in different regions of the world e g benz et al 1981 kang et al 2001 ayars et al 2006 some studies also discussed optimum gwds and irrigation strategies for crop growth zipper et al 2015 kahlown et al 2005 xu et al 2013 williamson and kriz 1970 demonstrated that it is necessary to know at least the crop species soil characteristics and watering procedure to specify an optimum water table depth among crop attributes root growth and distribution and tolerance to waterlogging and salinity are of key importance in regulating groundwater influences nosetto et al 2009 in natural ecosystems much of the research on vegetation water use from shallow ground water as well as the ecological water table depth has been done as well feng et al 2012 li et al 2015 cui and shao 2005 these studies provide knowledge of the interaction between shallow groundwater and vegetation water uptake appropriate gwd and irrigation management strategies for a certain crop or certain natural vegetation were proposed however it is difficult to extend and generalize the results because of different soil types irrigation regimes plant rooting patterns and salinity tolerances depth and fluctuations of water tables and climatic conditions moreover due to heterogeneous land cover patterns and the regional effect of the groundwater table results of the former studies focusing on a certain land cover may be unsuitable for irrigation districts in the upper yellow river basin appropriate groundwater management in an agro ecosystem should consider the growth of different crops and the sustainability of natural vegetation simultaneously when it comes to the control of gwd drainage engineers are generally concerned with removing excess soil water and lowering the water table as rapidly as economically feasible irrespective of the type of crops plant scientists on the other hand have generally studied the water and aeration requirements of specific crops under laboratory or field experimental conditions neglecting its applicability in the field with heterogeneous land covers to our knowledge there are few reported studies that determine optimal gwd and irrigation management strategies with comprehensive consideration of fragmented crops natural vegetation and the lateral groundwater exchange at the scale of canal irrigation system particularly for research in the upper yellow river basin wang et al 2004 pereira et al 2007 xu et al 2013 research based on a canal system can provide a more realistic view on water table and irrigation management because the whole agro ecosystem in a district is more comparable to a representative irrigation canal system which contains various kinds of land cover not a single crop thus the results can be of practical significance in real agro ecosystems in arid irrigated areas with shallow water tables the optimum gwd should achieve the following objectives 1 reducing salt accumulation as much as possible to improve soil conditions 2 reducing non beneficial bare soil evaporation to increase water use efficiency 3 favoring crop growth combined with appropriate irrigation to increase yields or at least no reduction and 4 maintain the sustainability of natural patches within and surrounding the croplands consequently the determination of optimum gwd and irrigation strategies for an agro ecosystem involves ground water quality vegetation salt tolerance canal delivery management irrigation frequency and the nature of the vadose zone this level of complexity makes it impossible to conduct field experiments that can fully consider all the factors at once ayars et al 2006 moreover the control of the groundwater level in the field is difficult and costly in field experiments in this study a simulation model which has been calibrated and validated in a typical agro ecosystem of hetao ren et al 2016 2017 was adopted to explore series of simulation scenarios in order to obtain optimum groundwater and irrigation management strategies systematic comparison and analysis of the simulation results were conducted therefore the objectives of this paper were 1 to simulate water and salt dynamics and to assess irrigation water use under various groundwater table and irrigation scenarios in an irrigation canal system of hetao upper yellow river basin and 2 to further propose an optimum groundwater and irrigation management strategy for hetao and other arid irrigation districts of the upper yellow river basin which could provide comprehensive consideration of the cultivation of various crops and the sustainability of natural lands for the whole agro ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and experiment 2 1 1 location land cover and irrigation water use in hetao the hetao covers an area of 1 12 mha and is located upstream of the yellow river north china the plain elevation in hetao varies from 1007 to 1050 m above mean sea level msl and exhibits a small slope in the direction of southwest to northeast the groundwater table is shallow with depth ranging between 0 5 3 0 m during the year and it has a very small hydraulic gradient of 0 10 0 25 regionally soil is mainly formed from alluvial deposits with a silt loam texture hetao has an arid to semi arid continental climate the average annual precipitation is 160 mm while 20 cm pan evaporation averages 2240 mm annually the mean annual temperature is 8 2 c and there are 135 150 frost free days and 3100 3300 h of sunshine per year feng et al 2005 the hetao includes 0 57 mha of agricultural area irrigated by the yellow river the predominant crops grown are sunflower maize wheat and some vegetables their distribution is highly fragmented because of smallholder land use rights another important land use type in hetao is natural land which covers an area about half as large as that of the agricultural land the natural land is mainly sparse grassland with scattered shrubs or abandoned cultivated land caused by high soil salinization it exhibits a patchy distribution within and surrounding the croplands and the species composition of the vegetation is simple with most of them being salt tolerant vegetation such as tamarix chinensis phragmites australis elymus dahuricus and suaeda salsa the natural land is important to biodiversity in hetao it is also important to keep the natural succession of the agro ecosystem in recent decades with the development of irrigated agriculture and the growing seriousness of environmental problems the habitat suitable for plant growth is degrading the rest of the lands are scattered sand dunes residential land and water bodies ren et al 2017 because of land fragmentation the land cover is highly heterogeneous and may significantly influence the eco hydrological processes in hetao due to the arid climate conditions agriculture in this area relies heavily on irrigation and irrigation water of about 5 billion m3 per year is mainly drawn from the yellow river the hetao has a complete system to convey irrigation water to the croplands generally there are 4 6 irrigation periods during the growing season based on the climate and river water conditions the first irrigation is mainly applied to sunflower and vegetables including watermelon fields as pre sowing irrigation for salt leaching and soil moisture recharge water is also applied during this event for wheat growth during the tillering stage but not for maize since the plants are too small the second event is only for wheat the third is for almost all crops except vegetables while the fourth and fifth are mainly for maize and sunflower the sixth if it occurs is for maize only normally irrigation is never applied to natural lands and the other areas with the shallow water table heterogeneous land cover and various irrigation schedules the irrigation water use in hetao is rather complicated during a water diversion only some crop fields are irrigated the over irrigation and large percolation as well as the canal seepage raise the groundwater table quickly soon the water table in the nearby non irrigated fields is also affected through lateral groundwater migration as a result the groundwater table in the whole croplands is elevated at the same time a more regional scale groundwater lateral flow from croplands to the non irrigated natural lands and the other areas begins to develop even though there is no water purposely applied to the non irrigated crops and natural vegetation their water depletion can be supplemented by water table rise and capillary rise at the same time substantial groundwater consumption by vegetation may lower the water table triggering lateral groundwater flows from the surrounding environment and or deeper aquifers heuperman 1999 jobbagy and jackson 2004 the lateral groundwater migration within the croplands and between the croplands and natural lands is frequent and intense in this way the percolated water from the irrigated fields is significantly reused and the water use efficiency can be increased to some extent however it also brings disadvantages such as salt accumulation and a large amount of non beneficial bare soil evaporation ren et al 2016 this is especially true for the natural lands because they are not irrigated during the entire growing season the natural lands have been recognized as the main dry drainage area in hetao accommodating the excess percolation water and salt wu et al 2009 yu et al 2016 2 1 2 the representative study area and field observations the yangchang canal command area yca fig 1 is a representative unit ru for investigating the agro hydrological processes of hetao it covers an area of about 20 ha located in the western region of hetao 40 48 40 n 107 05 15 e 1038 5 m altitude the area is divided into many pieces of small cropland ranging from 546 m2 to 6345 m2 and natural land in the southwest sunflower maize wheat and some vegetables are cultivated and account for 30 31 7 and 32 of crop area respectively while tamarisk tamarix chinensis lour is the dominant vegetation in the natural areas the crops are irrigated by surface basin irrigation and the natural land is not irrigated field observations were conducted for the main crops maize sunflower and watermelon and the natural vegetation tamarisk during 2012 and 2013 in yca a total of 7 observation wells with 4 in the farmland and 3 in the natural land fig 1 were installed at a depth of 3 0 m to monitor and sample groundwater daily meteorological data crop development stages fig 2 growth parameters and yield were measured and recorded the soil water and salt dynamics were also monitored to a depth of 100 cm soil physical properties including particle size distribution water content at saturation and field capacity θs θfc cm3cm 3 dry bulk density and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks cm d 1 were also measured in situ or in the laboratory irrigation was recorded and measured in the field table 1 ren et al 2016 the soil classified as silt loam is representative of soils in hetao 2 2 model description the hydrus dualkc model as described in ren et al 2016 2017 was selected as the simulation model in this model the dualkc approach allen et al 1998 was integrated into hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2009 to calculate the potential evaporation and transpiration rates for the implementation of the atmospheric boundary condition and a mechanistic approach i e a two stage calculation method from the dualkc approach for calculating actual soil evaporation was also introduced to the hydrus code it is a more practical method and has greater flexibility to address variable conditions e g the soil is not fully covered by crops partly wetted or mulched by different materials and natural vegetation grown on poor conditions the model has been calibrated and validated both in the main crop fields ren et al 2016 and the natural land ren et al 2017 in yca initial conditions were set in the model with measured soil water content and soil salinity concentration the daily precipitation irrigation as well as the potential transpiration tp and evaporation ep rates estimated using the dualkc approach were used for the atmospheric boundary condition the lower boundary condition was defined as time variable pressure head deduced from the water table depth the solute transport upper and lower boundary conditions were defined as concentration flux using the measured salt concentration of irrigation water and groundwater respectively soil hydraulic parameters van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 and solute transport parameters table 2 root water uptake parameters feddes et al 1978 dirksen and augustijn 1988 table 3 and evaporation parameters allen et al 1998 table 4 have been well calibrated and validated in ren et al 2016 2017 simulation results showed that model performance was generally good for all three crops and tamarisk thus it is reliable and useful for analyzing the hydrological processes and evaluating the future water table and irrigation conditions in the irrigation canal system 2 3 scenario simulation for assessing the impact of irrigation and gwd changes various gwd scenarios and irrigation strategies were designed and simulated using the hydrus dualkc scenario analysis was conducted to investigate reasonable groundwater depths and appropriate irrigation strategies for growth of three crops and tamarisk in hetao the simulation scenarios are summarized and listed in table 5 with a detailed description in the following part in all of these scenarios the plant growth initial soil water and salt profile simulation period climate and all the other parameters relative to the year 2012 and 2013 were set the same as those adopted in ren et al 2016 2017 to represent site conditions small elevation differences exist among the fields in yca due to local topographic variations and the natural land was found to be about 30 cm lower than the surrounding farmland ren et al 2017 therefore the gwds in each of the fields may be different while the water table levels will be more consistent because they are not far from each other and have rapid hydraulic connection fig 3 so the gwd scenarios for maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk in the two years were set taking the data of 2012 and 2013 as the references i e gwd would drop 0 present 20 40 60 80 100 and 150 cm based on the 2012 and 2013 reference depth of each vegetation deeper gwd scenarios were not considered as according to previous studies gwd exceeding 250 cm would significantly reduce capillary rise and its effect on crop growth is negligible hao et al 2014 xu et al 2013 in the future the tamarisk may adapt to the increased gwd scenarios and its root may elongate to re establish contact with the new water table gasry 1963 di tomaso 1998 nippert et al 2010 thus potential root length increase scenario simulations corresponding to all the gwd strategies for tamarisk were also conducted ren et al 2017 the present irrigation schedule adopted in yca is typical in hetao and has been used for more than 20 years the actual irrigation date and amount each year may be adjusted slightly according to rainfall farmers experience and river water conditions as shown in table 1 in order to tackle water shortage issues the chinese government started an irrigation district rehabilitation program focused on water savings and the aim of the program at hetao is to reduce water diversion from the yellow river from 5 billion m3 to 4 billion m3 or less while keeping the same agricultural production therefore the reduction of future irrigation amount is inevitable based on irrigation scheduling table 1 for two representative years the dry year 2012 and the wet year 2013 another two reduced irrigation strategies set to 80 and 60 of the present irrigation amount were considered for the seven gwd scenarios for the three irrigated crops they are noted as 1 0ir 0 8ir and 0 6ir based on previous studies watermelon only had a pre planting irrigation and it was mainly dependent on the capillary rise and thus suffered water salt stress during the growth period ren et al 2016 lei et al 2003 this was related to that watermelon was unsuitable to flood irrigation as it may result in root and fruit rot or even dead plants especially in the fruit period however some agronomic measures e g through ridging and trenching or furrow irrigation can be applied to tackle these irrigation problems but with more labor input required thus an additional irrigation of various depths during watermelon s development stage third irrigation events in yca were also simulated and assessed in the future scenarios in order to elucidate the impacts of artificial watering on soil water salt dynamics and to determine how to alleviate salt stress on the natural land we also evaluated the influence of a preseason irrigation event of various amounts at the initial stages of tamarisk growth during the first irrigation these additional irrigation scenarios were only conducted with three critical gwd strategies present r 0 and increases of 40 r 40 and 100 r 100 cm in order to have a quantitative comparison of these scenarios indicators including relative evaporation i e the ratio of actual to potential evaporation ea ep and the ratio of salt accumulation i e the ratio of salt increment to initial salt storage δs sini were used to evaluate water use efficiency and salt accumulation respectively given that the amount of dry matter produced by any plant and the water it transpires are proportional and that this relation is constant for each plant species or variety under a given set of growing conditions arkley 1963 relative transpiration the ratio of actual to potential transpiration ta tp was used to assess plant growth conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 transpiration under present irrigation scheduling the actual transpiration ta of maize watermelon tamarisk and sunflower had a slight increase at first then reached peak values at about r 40 cm and finally decreased both in the two years with the gwd increase fig 4 relative transpiration ta tp for maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk ranged between 0 89 0 93 0 94 0 99 0 90 0 96 and 0 69 0 73 in 2012 and 0 80 0 81 0 95 0 99 0 60 0 67 and 0 58 0 65 in 2013 respectively the comparison of crop transpiration between scenarios considering salt stress and regardless of salt stress suggested that soil salinization had the larger impact on crop growth scenario results showed that the watermelon in 2013 was the crop that suffered the most serious water salt stress it was because the watermelon had only once pre season irrigation during the simulation period and the precipitation was rather scarce in 2013 the ta tp values of sunflower were above 0 90 consistently in both years indicating that it was seldom stressed the reason may be that sunflower is more salt tolerant than maize and watermelon and it also has the largest irrigation depths even though the salt tolerance of tamarisk was far higher than the three crops it suffered the most severe stress in both years this was because the tamarisk in natural patches had never been irrigated and the initial salt content in the root zone was very high in the future if the root of tamarisk elongated and adapted to the deeper gwd scenarios the plant transpiration would be increased significantly as shown in fig 4d this resulted from the soil solution concentration in the deeper layers being much lower than the upper layers the increased root length could extract more water of good quality thus salt stress was greatly alleviated all the vegetation in 2012 had relatively mild water salt stress due to the significantly higher precipitation especially for watermelon it benefited the most from the 80 mm rainfall on june 26 27th right after the third irrigation this was the inspiration for creating additional irrigation scenarios for watermelon relative transpiration for most of the vegetation declined more steeply as the water table deepened below the optimum band in the dry year 2013 suggesting a stronger positive groundwater influence during this period watermelon was also the crop for which ta tp declined the most with gwd increase indicating it was more dependent on groundwater than the other vegetation under present irrigation strategy under the present gwd conditions the irrigation reduction strategies 0 8ir and 0 6ir for maize and watermelon showed an obvious decrease in ta especially in the dry year 2013 fig 4a and c the ta tp of maize decreased from 0 89 to 0 88 and 0 85 in 2012 and from 0 81 to 0 77 and 0 73 in 2013 for the 0 8ir and 0 6ir strategies respectively that of watermelon also decreased from 0 93 to 0 91 and 0 89 in 2012 and from 0 66 to 0 62 and 0 58 in 2013 for sunflower the 0 8ir and 0 6ir strategies didn t show much difference from the present strategy in 2012 in 2013 the 0 8ir was almost the same as the present strategy while the 0 6ir began to have an obvious reduction it implied that the irrigation amount for sunflower was too large especially in the wet year 2012 and a reduction e g 0 8ir might not affect its growth even in the dry year 2013 for maize and watermelon it seemed the current irrigation amount was not sufficient and didn t have much water saving potential under current irrigation scheduling when further considering the gwd increase the shape of ta tp curve in 0 8ir and 0 6ir strategies for each crop were similar to the present irrigation scenarios 1 0ir and generally the lower the irrigation depths the lower the ta tp curves fig 4 3 2 evaporation and salt accumulation simulations showed that soil evaporation and salt accumulation declined continuously with increased gwd for all four vegetation types with the current irrigation conditions fig 4 soil evaporation decreased sharply at the beginning of the gwd increase and gradually changed to mild declines when the gwd increased from r 0 to r 150 cm the relative evaporation ea ep for maize sunflower watermelon and tamarisk respectively decreased from 0 73 to 0 28 0 81 0 45 0 62 0 29 and 0 51 0 17 in 2012 and from 0 62 to 0 32 0 81 0 52 0 62 0 26 and 0 52 0 14 in 2013 the ratio of salt accumulation δs sini respectively decreased from 0 15 to 0 11 0 05 to 0 43 0 46 to 0 2 and 0 39 0 06 in 2012 and from 0 10 to 0 06 0 13 to 0 38 0 18 to 0 3 and 0 66 0 15 in 2013 note that the negative values of δs sini represented the decrease of salt storage in the soil profile when considering the irrigation reduction strategies 0 8ir and 0 6ir in the irrigated croplands soil evaporation almost remained the same with the present irrigation conditions implying that soil evaporation was not sensitive to the irrigation amount however salt accumulation showed a significant increase with reduction of irrigation amount for example under the present gwd in 2012 the 0 8ir and 0 6ir irrigation strategies increased δs sini from 0 15 to 0 34 and 0 49 for maize from 0 05 to 0 09 and 0 22 for sunflower and from 0 46 to 0 50 and 0 55 for watermelon this was because sufficient irrigation could leach more salts into the deeper layers if the irrigation amount was reduced although the salt stress might reduce transpiration and further limit the upward salt flux the ultimate salt accumulation would still be larger thus the ratio of salt accumulation δs sini was the largest for the non irrigated natural land and the seldom irrigated watermelon field under the present irrigation conditions if the gwd of maize increases 90 cm in 2012 and 70 cm in 2013 or watermelon increases 80 cm in 2012 and 50 cm in 2013 the salt content in the root zone 0 90 cm would not increase the sunflower fields were already in a desalinated status in both years because of excessive irrigation and the desalting effect was enhanced with gwd increase therefore a deeper gwd and larger irrigation amount would be better for salt control also the root increase of tamarisk would not have a significant effect on soil evaporation and salt accumulation fig 4d 3 3 additional irrigation strategies for watermelon and natural land under the present gwd conditions if an additional irrigation was applied to watermelon during the third irrigation events plant transpiration increased significantly with the increased irrigation depth in the dry year 2013 fig 5 the increase rate was remarkably high with irrigation depths from 0 to 10 cm in 2012 as a large rainfall occurred in the third irrigation period and also can supplement the water deficit the additional irrigation didn t make too much difference when the additional irrigation depth exceeded 100 mm the ta was even reduced in 2012 this may be caused by waterlogging positive effects of additional irrigation were obviously greater during drier years in contrast negative effects waterlogging were more likely to happen in wet years thus an additional irrigation depth of 10 cm was recommended for watermelon if the gwd increased to gwd 40 or gwd 100 cm the crop transpiration was only slightly affected while bare soil evaporation and salt accumulation can be reduced significantly for all the irrigation strategies pre season irrigation can significantly improve tamarisk growth fig 6 under the present gwd the ta tp increased sharply from about 0 7 0 92 in 2012 and from 0 60 to 0 80 in 2013 with an irrigation depth increase from 0 to 250 mm then the increase rates gradually become smaller with ta tp increasing from 0 92 to 0 95 in 2012 and from 0 80 to 0 91 in 2013 when irrigation depth further increased to 500 mm the gwd scenarios gwd 40 and gwd 100 were similar and both obviously superior to the present conditions in promoting transpiration the ta tp of gwd 40 and gwd 100 scenarios increased by about 0 03 compared to present values in both years moreover the deeper gwd scenarios can also substantially reduce non beneficial bare soil evaporation and root zone salt buildup additional irrigation increased tamarisk transpiration more significantly in the dry year 2013 from the perspective of promoting plant growth and saving water an irrigation depth of 250 mm for pre season irrigation and a deeper gwd was recommended for the tamarisk 3 4 optimum groundwater depth and irrigation strategies in order to maintain agricultural production and the sustainability of natural patches as well as to save water the gwd in the natural land should be kept at a reasonable level for improving vegetation growth and reducing bare soil evaporation and root zone salt accumulation in a canal system with heterogeneous land cover and almost the same groundwater conditions efforts should be made to coordinate the growth of all main crops and the natural vegetation under present irrigation schedules an optimum gwd shouldn t have adverse effects on vegetation growth so plant transpiration of each crop shouldn t be worse than present based on this a suitable gwd range for each crop can be defined as shown in fig 4 the gwd for which ta tp reached the peak value for each plant was also identified at the same time to reduce bare soil evaporation and root zone salt accumulation it is obvious that the gwd should be kept as deep as possible thus the gwd from the peak value point to the end of the suitable gwd is defined as the optimum interval in this way it not only can reduce non beneficial bare soil evaporation and salt accumulation but it can also improve vegetation growth to some extent as a result the optimum gwd ranges in 2012 were respectively from r 60 to r 150 cm for maize from r 40 to r 100 cm for sunflower from r 40 to r 100 cm for watermelon and from r 40 to r 100 cm for tamarisk during 2013 those were respectively from r 40 to r 100 cm for maize from r 20 to r 40 cm for sunflower from r 40 to r 80 cm for watermelon and from r 40 to r 100 cm for tamarisk based on above comprehensive analysis and result comparison the gwd between r 40 cm and r 100 cm could be regarded as the optimum gwd range for the studied irrigation system due to its general applicability for all three crop types and the natural vegetation the final optimum gwd interval is also very good to tamarisk if its root length increased with the gwd fig 4d eventually the seasonal mean values for optimum gwds were about 170 230 cm in the croplands and about 140 200 cm in the natural land according to previous literature pereira et al 2007 xu et al 2013 hao et al 2014 a targeted gwd of 100 150 cm was proposed for wheat and maize in the nearby qingtongxia irrigation district qid the optimum gwd obtained in this paper is a little deeper than that from the qid which may be because the gwd scenarios in this study were fluctuating while in the qid studies they were constant ren et al 2017 ruan et al 2008 concluded that excessive lowering of the groundwater table mainly when that depth exceeds 3 m would bring negative impacts on crop productivity and the environment due to reduced capillary rise in hetao referring to the previous studies it seems the optimum gwd for the complex agro ecosystem in this study is reasonable and appropriate with optimum gwd vegetation growth would not be negatively affected and it can even be improved to some extent further the bare soil evaporation and salt accumulation can be reduced by 26 48 and 45 100 this indicated that 50 100 mm depth of water consumption could be saved accounting for 15 30 of water diversion from the yellow river during the growing season each year irrigation scenarios showed that reduction of irrigation for maize and watermelon would obviously reduce their transpiration while for sunflower the reduced strategy 0 8ir would not affect its growth therefore except for 20 of the irrigation water for sunflower that can be saved there was almost no water saving potential during the growing season thus under the present irrigation frequency the wsps should pay more attention to the water delivery processes and the optimization of irrigation during the non growing season i e pre season irrigation and autumn irrigation these two irrigations accounted for more than 50 of total water diversion from the yellow river per year and were the controlling factors to the gwd if the irrigation water is sufficient during the third irrigation event a 100 mm additional irrigation for watermelon can significantly improve its growth conditions a pre season irrigation of 250 mm to the natural land is also helpful to sustain ecosystem health note that this is suggested to be adopted every few years on the natural lands only if it is necessary under optimum gwd ranges scenarios r 40 cm and r 100 cm the positive effects of additional irrigation are obviously enhanced as shown in fig 6 4 conclusions the well calibrated hydrus dualkc model was applied to assess the effects of future groundwater depth gwd scenarios and irrigation strategies on the main crops maize sunflower watermelon and natural vegetation tamarisk in a canal system of hetao china the consequences of water table decline and irrigation reduction were predicted and analyzed an optimal gwd range and appropriate irrigation suggestions were provided for the irrigation system with various land covers results showed that under present irrigation scheduling transpiration ta of maize watermelon tamarisk and sunflower had a slight increase at first then reached peak values at about r 40 cm and finally decreased over the two years with gwd increase soil evaporation and salt accumulation both declined continuously the reduced irrigation strategies 0 8ir and 0 6ir for maize and watermelon showed an obvious decrease in ta especially in the dry year 2013 while for sunflower the 0 8ir strategy was almost the same as for 1 0ir yet the 0 6ir scenario began to reduce transpiration salt accumulation increased with the irrigation reduction yet soil evaporation was marginally affected the integrated results from scenario simulations showed that the current gwd should be further increased 40 100 cm i e from r 40 to r 100 cm to obtain the optimum target improving vegetation growth and reducing bare soil evaporation and salt accumulation as a result an optimum gwd of between 1 7 2 3 m for the crops and 1 4 2 0 m for the natural land was recommended with optimum gwds there is the potential that 15 30 of water diversions from the yellow river can be reduced during the growing season each year irrigation reduction scenarios also showed that only sunflower had the potential to save about 20 of the water applied irrigation water to other vegetation was just enough or even inadequate in the dry year an additional irrigation to watermelon during its development stage the third irrigation period and a pre season irrigation to tamarisk the first irrigation period can greatly improve their growth and the recommended irrigation depths were 100 mm and 250 mm

11566,in this study a fuzzy linear fractional programming flfp approach with double sided fuzziness is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty the flfp model can be derived from incorporating double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp into linear fractional programming lfp optimization framework the developed model can deal with uncertainty presented as fuzziness in both right hand and left hand sides of constraints moreover it has advantages in 1 addressing two objectives directly without considering subjective factors 2 effectively reflecting

the model is applied to a case study of irrigation water allocation in the middle reaches of heihe river basin northwest china the optimal irrigation water allocation solutions from the flfp model can be obtained these results can provide decision support when deciding on selecting reasonable irrigation water resources management and agricultural production keywords irrigation water allocation double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming linear fractional programming uncertainty decision making 1 introduction nowadays it is commonly believed that growing population and diminishing water availability in china are jointly affect the contradiction between water supply and water demand especially in arid or semiarid regions dominated by agriculture moreover irrigated agriculture is the biggest consumer attributing to water use consuming 70 of total water use in the world kang et al 2017 irrigation water management naturally becomes worldwide concerns for agricultural production and livelihood security with limited water resources storm et al 2011 parsinejad et al 2013 therefore how to improve agricultural water use efficiency or agricultural water productivity and further effectively allocate irrigation water resources is expected to ensure food security and promote sustainable development of agriculture to address the above concerns many optimization methods or models have been developed for optimal irrigation water allocation dudley et al 1971 rao et al 1990 mainuddin et al 1997 shangguan et al 2002 noory et al 2012 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a however among these studies the objectives of model almost focus on the system benefits and few studies optimize the agricultural water use efficiency agricultural water use efficiency is defined as the production per unit of irrigation application playán and mateos 2006 which is also known as agricultural water productivity reflecting the system efficiency more importantly in many developing countries irrigation water management suffers from lower water use efficiency and the irrigation water resources are not utilized efficiently li et al 2016a in water limited areas where water is the most limiting factor to obtain higher water productivity may be economically more profitable for the farmer and it is more likely to be considered rather than higher crop yield or economic benefits this problem can be quantitatively described by an optimization model using linear fractional programming lfp the lfp model is capable of facilitating the analysis of system efficiency through transforming a bi objective e g cost and volume output and input problem into a ratio one especially for addressing the issue with better achievements per unit of inputs lara and stancu minasian 1999 gomez et al 2006 guo et al 2014 zhang and guo 2017a however the lfp model has difficulty in tackling uncertainties in irrigation water allocation problems uncertainties existing in irrigation water management systems should be considered strategically generally the irrigation water management basically consists of various parameters such as hydrological elements economic parameters and other related parameters which are not easily quantified and defined in the model regulwar and gurav 2011 elliott et al 2014 zhang et al 2017b there are many inexact optimization methods mainly including stochastic mathematical programming smp fuzzy mathematical programming fmp and interval linear programming ilp were developed to tackle uncertainties huang 1996 shastri and diwekar 2006 kerachian and karamouz 2007 guo et al 2010 li et al 2013 liu et al 2014 li et al 2015 nematian 2016 wang et al 2016 in detail smp is generally used to deal with random uncertainties i e hydrological parameters in the irrigation water allocation problems however the data requirement to specify parameter with probability distribution functions pdfs and intensive computational burden may result in difficulties in its practical applications li et al 2016a ilp can deal with all uncertain parameters expressed as interval values without considering distribution information however it is incapable of tackling problems with violation of system constraints huang 1996 in practical some parameters exhibit features of vagueness and imprecision they are estimated empirically and subject to human judgments and can better be expressed by fuzzy membership functions xu and qin 2010 moreover fmp has a lower data requirements but reflects more flexible information in practical application because the related membership functions are more easily defined than pdfs xu et al 2010 wan and li 2015 besides when the violation of system constraints exists in the optimization model the chance constrained programming with fuzzy parameters needs to be introduced into the general optimization framework therefore chance constrained programming ccp was extended from stochastic pdfs to fuzzy possibility distribution environments liu and iwamura 1998 similar to chance constrained programming with random uncertainties models fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp also requires that the fuzzy constraints be transformed into deterministic ones at predetermined confidence levels which has a lower computational burden and generates more flexible solutions therefore fccp is an improved fmp method and it s effective for tackling fuzzy uncertainties and violation of system constraints xu and qin 2010 however in many practical applications fuzzy uncertainties may exist in both sides of constraints within the model thus double sided fccp dfccp method is a better choice for addressing these complexities nevertheless dfccp method cannot deal with ratio optimization problems in addition there are few studies on dfccp method for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty therefore this study aims to develop a fuzzy linear fractional programming flfp approach with double sided fuzziness for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty technique of dfccp will be incorporated into lfp optimization framework therefore the developed model can deal with uncertainty presented as fuzziness in both left hand side and right hand side components of constraints moreover it has advantages in 1 addressing two objectives simultaneously without considering subjective factors 2 effectively reflecting economic water productivity 3 introducing the concept of confidence levels of fuzzy constraints satisfaction under both the minimum and maximum reliabilities to generate more flexible solutions and 4 facilitating in depth analysis of interrelationships among economic water productivity system benefits and varying confidence levels the model is applied to a case study to demonstrate its applicability the study area is a major agricultural production base in china while it currently faces increasingly severe water shortages problems the objective is to maximize the economic water productivity i e to obtain maximum system benefits with minimum irrigation water allocation to allocate the limited irrigation water to different crops and different subareas the optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation can be generated under each confidence level which can be used to facilitate the analysis for the various irrigation water management schemes under complex uncertainties the framework of this study is illustrated in fig 1 2 formulation of the flfp approach consider an agricultural irrigation system in a region where multiple crops need to be irrigated in different irrigation districts the managers are responsible for making irrigation plans for these competing water users generally a higher agricultural water productivity is a greater concern under limited water conditions for creating a sustainable agriculture system such a problem can be effectively addressed by linear fractional programming lfp model charnes and cooper 1963 zhu and huang 2011 moreover when both left hand and right hand side parameters in the constraints are of fuzzy features and can be presents as possibility distributions and the violation of system constraints exists in the optimization model thus the double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp method can be adopted fiedler et al 2006 xu et al 2012 for example in this study parameters associated with the water availability and the rate of water loss during water conveyance are expressed as fuzzy sets therefore in response to above concerns a fuzzy linear fractional programming flfp approach with double sided fuzziness is developed by integrating the dfccp method into lfp framework consequently based on flfp approach the study problem for irrigation water allocation to different crops in different subarea can be formulated as follows system objective 1a max f i 1 12 j 1 3 n b i j c p i j a i j a j s w i j g w i j p e i b j i 1 12 j 1 3 a i j c s i s w

type of crop j 1 2 3 nb ij is the price of crop j in irrigation district i yuan kg cp ij is the cost of crop production of crop j in irrigation district i which includes all other costs such as seed fertilizer pesticides machinery harvesting marketing drying and unexpected costs this cost is independent of the amount of applied irrigation water yuan kg a ij is the irrigated area of crop j in irrigation district i ha a j and b j are the coefficients of linear crop water production function of crop j sw ij and gw ij are the decision variables which means that the allocated surface water and groundwater m3 ha p e i is the effective precipitation of irrigation district i m3 ha cs i cg i are the cost of surface water and groundwater use in irrigation district i yuan m3 η s and η g are the irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and ground water respectively constraints the objective is subjected to a series of constraints in water availability irrigation water demand fairness and other related concerns these constraints can determine the reasonable decision space of decision variables 1 surface water availability constraint 1b p o s λ s q s i 1 12 j 1 3 1 λ s a i

they can be expressed by fuzzy membership functions η s and η g are the irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater β s and β g are the proportion of surface water and groundwater used for agricultural irrigation in this study let β s 0 9 and β g 0 9 in above constrains α cut confidence level is used to describe the fuzzy degree of membership level and quantify the fuzzy parameter fig 2 presents the triangular membership function and α cut interval with lower and upper bounds for each α cut level 3 fairness constraint 1d i 1 i i 2 i s w i 1 j g w i 1 j p e i 1 s

this constraint means that the ratio between the sum of water shortages of each two subareas and total water demands is less than or equal to an acceptable gap zhang and xu 2011 for some districts with higher water use efficiency and net benefit will be allocated with more water this may not fair to farmers with lower water use efficiency therefore the gini coefficient is introduced when considering the fairness constraint yang et al 2015 let g 0 0 4 in fairness constraint because the international warning level is 0 4 4 irrigation water demand constraint 1e e t min i j s w i j g w i

and gw ij are the decision variables which should be positive according to fiedler et al 2006 the violation of constraints in the dfccp method at each predefined confidence level consists of two reliability scenarios namely the minimum reliability and the maximum reliability therefore they can be presented as follows 2a p o s r i j v min i j sup min μ r i j x i j μ v i j y i j x i j y i j ℜ x i j y i j α r i j l α v i j r α 2b p o s r i j v max i j inf max 1 μ r i j x i j 1 μ v i j y i j x i j y i j ℜ x i j y i j α r i j r 1 α v i j l 1 α where r i j v min i j means that the equations r i j v i j should be satisfied at the minimum reliability while r i j v max i j means that the equations r i j v i j should be satisfied at the maximum reliability μ r i j x i j μ v i j y i j are the fuzzy membership functions of the variables x ij and y ij the term r i j l α is defined as the minimum values of all possible values at α cut level namely r i j l α inf r r μ 1 α similarly v i j r α is defined as maximum values of all possible values at α cut level namely v i j r α sup v v μ 1 α μ 1 is the inverse function of μ based on eqs 2a and 2b the flfp approach can be transformed into two crisp equivalents accordingly therefore these two deterministic submodels can be presented as follows a confidence levels at the minimum reliability 3a max f minr i 1 12 j 1 3 n b i j c p i j a i j a

right hand side parameters become their minimum ones in this case the constraints become more restricted which will lead to an increased strictness for the constraints and thus a narrow decision space

into upper middle and lower reaches by the controlled hydrological stations of yingluoxia and zhengyixia the upstream area is the mountainous area where is the runoff production area and midstream area is a main water consumer due to its considerably large area of irrigated oasis as for the downstream area it s mainly desert facing serious ecological problems e g degradation of the environment desertification of land the elevations of the hrb range from 1300 to 2500 m its climate is characterized by arid because this area is situated in the inner of asia europe continent zhao et al 2005 the mean annual temperature is 7 57 c and mean annual precipitation is 195 mm as well as mean annual potential evapotranspiration is 1710 mm the shallow porous and highly permeable soil in the midstream area are characterized as greyish brown desert soil sandy loam and sandy soil zhao et al 2010 the midstream area produces the main crops of wheat maize and economic crops such as cotton fruits and vegetables the economic crop is also called as cash crop compared with grain crops like maize and wheat the economic crops can bring high economic benefits to increase farmer s income because no multiple cropping exists and thus the value of the multiple cropping index is nearly 100 the growing period of these crops ranges from march to october there are in total 12 irrigation districts ids belonging to three administrative regions in midstream area that are irrigated directly by the main stream which is selected as the study area 97 37 102 06 e 37 44 42 40 n namely daman shangsan xijun and yingke ids of ganzhou district pingchuan banqiao yanuan liaoquan and shahe ids of linze county youlian luocheng and liuba ids of gaotai county the study area see fig 3 is a major irrigation area and grain production base in china that currently faces severe water shortages with little precipitation and high evapotranspiration irrigation thereby becomes an important measure for promoting grain production moreover in midstream area water consumption accounts for over 80 of the total available water resources from the heihe river and nearly 90 of the water consumption is used for irrigation li et al 2016a crops are mainly irrigated with canal water and traditional irrigation patterns such as flood and furrow methods are commonly used pumping groundwater is mainly for supplementing agricultural irrigation when the supply of canal water is inadequate or seasonal variations jiang et al 2015 the increasing water demands and shrinking water supplies have exacerbated the competition among water users therefore how to optimize the limited irrigation water allocation and thus to improve agricultural water productivity have become a growing urgent issue for the development of agriculture this agricultural water productivity nowadays called economic water productivity is defined as the production or and system benefits per unit of irrigation water which plays an increasingly important role in irrigation water management problem the problem can be more compounded by many uncertainties existing in the agricultural systems such as socio economic parameters i e market conditions water use costs and hydrological elements thus managers attempt to obtain optimal irrigation water allocation solutions to three different crops in these ids in the study system the problems under consideration include 1 how to maximize economic water productivity under fuzzy uncertainty 2 how to reflect the variations of results with double sided violation of system constraints and 3 how to identify the optimal irrigation water allocation solutions for crops to different ids under different water levels therefore to address above concerns a fuzzy linear fractional programming flfp approach with double sided fuzziness is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation 3 2 data collection and processing to deal with such a problem a series of input parameters need to be acquired not only about crops data among different ids but also the information about the precipitation irrigation water demand and available water resources a detailed description of the different input parameters can be presented as follows 3 2 1 crop water production function the crop water production function cwpf is used to express the relation between obtained crop yield and the total amount of actual evapotranspiration brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 which will directly influence irrigation planning and irrigation water allocation solutions two types of cwpf including the relation between crop yields and actual evapotranspiration in the whole growth period and in each growth stage are commonly used in this study cwpfs for the whole growth stage will be adopted which basically includes linear and nonlinear functions generally the linear and nonlinear empirical models of cwpfs can be established by the experimental data for the whole growth stage chen and kang 1995 a linear form is more suitable to the low yield area where it is lack of irrigation water and has a lower management level kang and cai 1996 li et al 2016a b because the study area is located in an arid region thus a linear cwpf model is a better choice namely y a bet where y is crop yield kg ha et is actual evapotranspiration m3 ha a b are empirical coefficients fitted by least square method different crop water production functions are fitted based on evapotranspiration data and associated yield data obtained from field experiments the field experiments were conducted in yingke irrigation district during april to september in 2012 2013 jiang et al 2015 field experiments are a laborious and time consuming task that did not conducted within each irrigation district resulting in a lack of data for all irrigation districts we believe that soil types and other characteristics have an impact on the water production function which we did not consider in the study because water is the most dominant limiting factor moreover yingke irrigation district located in the ganzhou district is a typical irrigation district in the middle reaches of heihe river basin therefore the data is representative it is thus assumed that crop water production function of all these 12 ids is the same due to their similar hydrological and meteorological conditions the expression of linear crop water production functions for the three crops in this study is shown in table 1 3 2 2 water availability crops in these ids are irrigated by surface water and groundwater in order to reflect the uncertain characteristics of parameters both surface water and groundwater availability are considered as a fuzzy number on the right hand side constraints table 2 the triangular fuzzy number is used to describe the fuzzy characteristics which requires to obtain the middle and the lower values of water availability in terms of surface water availability water supply for the midstream area is delivered by the main stream of heihe river thus water supply for all the 12 ids equals the difference that the runoff from the upstream subtracts the water release to the downstream area the category of three inflow levels is based on the frequency analysis method li et al 2016a namely low level p 75 medium level 25 p 75 and high level p 25 because the standard deviation of the each inflow level is unknown then t distribution is used to estimate the range of parameters this study adopts the 95 confidence level lower bounds to express the lower values of fuzzy numbers and the mean of inflow are to express the middle values therefore for each inflow level a triangular fuzzy value with lower and middle values denotes the surface water availability for irrigation the available groundwater is obtained from historical statistical data it is also divided into three water levels in the form of triangular fuzzy number the middle and the lower values of available groundwater are calculated based on the mean and the minimum values of the statistical data once the surface water is insufficient for irrigation due to seasonal variations then pumping groundwater is to make up for this deficiency therefore when the surface water is at low level more groundwater will be extracted the effective precipitation among different water levels are obtained from the typical hydrological years table 3 because of the low precipitation in arid area the precipitation can be fully utilized so effective precipitation can be obtained directly from the measured data of meteorological stations 3 2 3 irrigation water demand in this study irrigation water demand for these 12 ids is calculated according to et c k c et 0 allen et al 1998 where et c is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day daily reference evapotranspiration is obtained by the fao 56 penman monteith method based on the meteorological data from zhangye no 52562 linze no 52557 and gaotai no 52546 meteorological stations located in midstream area during 1967 2009 yin et al 2012 the total crop evapotranspiration of the whole growth stage can be calculated by the sum of daily value of each growth stage under typical hydrological year the k c values vary during different growth stages which can determine the upper and lower bounds of irrigation water demand li et al 2016b therefore irrigation water demand and k c values of the crops at different growth stages can be seen in tables 3 and 4 3 2 4 other related parameters table 5 presents some basic data of different crops in these ids including crop planting area market price and water use cost per unit irrigation water because the rate of canal lining is low thus nearly 30 of the water is lost during water conveyance zhang and guo 2017b therefore the irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater are 0 52 0 60 respectively the rate of water loss during water conveyance is considered as triangular fuzzy sets in the left hand side constraints in this problem the rates of water loss during surface water and groundwater conveyance are 0 20 0 25 0 30 and 0 10 0 15 0 20 respectively 4 result analysis because the developed model incorporates the dfccp method into lfp optimization framework thus this model reflects the characteristics and advantages of the two methods simultaneously firstly the objective function of model is defined as the maximum economic benefits per unit of irrigation water which also represents the agricultural water use efficiency or economic water productivity moreover the fundamental concept of the dfccp method is to generate optimal results that double sided fuzzy constraints can be satisfied at a certain confidence level in optimization model therefore how to choose the confidence level is particularly important to investigate the results of violating the constraints and generate a range of decision solutions the results at four α cut confidence levels e g α 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are analyzed and compared different α cut levels reflect the subjective attitudes or preferences of decision makers and thus affect the corresponding changing trend of the results under different satisfaction degrees of fuzzy uncertainty table 6 presents the obtained results of irrigation water allocation from flfp model under medium water level at α cut levels from 0 2 to 0 8 for the same α cut confidence level under the minimum and maximum reliabilities the overall results for different crops in ganzhou district and gaotai county almost are the same for example at α 0 2 under the minimum and maximum reliabilities see second column of table 6 the obtained results for three crops among the majority of ids show that crops are irrigated by groundwater completely and no surface water is used for irrigation under such circumstance the allowable groundwater is firstly utilized for irrigation due to its higher irrigation water use coefficient and lower rate of water loss during water conveyance i e η g η s and λ g λ s luocheng is an exception for the optimal irrigation water allocation of three crops that is under the minimum reliability the result is 0 1993 2 m3 ha surface water groundwater for wheat 1145 1 874 2 m3 ha for maize and 0 1884 9 m3 ha for economic crops while under the maximum reliability the result is 1993 2 0 m3 ha for wheat 2019 3 0 m3 ha for maize and 1884 9 0 m3 ha for economic crops respectively similarly the results can be examined at α 0 4 0 6 0 8 under both the minimum and maximum reliabilities however ids in linze county have different results under the minimum reliability scenario all the crops are irrigated by groundwater totally but the varying results can be obtained under the maximum reliability scenario furthermore the sum of irrigated surface water and groundwater is also equal to their minimum crop water requirements this is because if the linear cwpf projects a positive vertical axis intercept the empirical value of crop water productivity will decline as et increases wichelns 2014 the intercept will thereby help determine whether water productivity will increase or decrease at higher levels of et for a linear cwpf thus it is evident that those crops suffer from water deficiency in order to achieve the maximum economic benefits with the minimum irrigation amount additionally the results also indicate that surface water resources are not fully utilized more importantly this also shows that it is urgent need to take water saving measures such as canal lining to reduce the water loss and thus improve the irrigation efficiency of surface water on the other hand such a great quantity of surface water is not fully utilized indicating that there is still not achieve its full potential for the development of water saving agriculture in the region furthermore at α 0 2 under the minimum reliability the allocated surface water is less than or equals to that under the maximum reliability in contrast the allocated groundwater presents the opposite result taking wheat as an example the allocated surface water in ids of linze county is zero under the minimum reliability while the results under the maximum reliability are 383 3 m3 ha pingchuan 754 2 m3 ha banqiao 789 7 m3 ha yanuan 636 4 m3 ha liaoquan and 711 0 m3 ha shahe the reason is that according to the dfccp algorithm the surface water and groundwater availabilities under the minimum reliability conditions are significantly higher than the maximum reliability more groundwater availabilities are used for irrigation due to the structure of the developed optimization model therefore the overall optimal solution is to give priority to the use of groundwater to meet the actual crop water requirements the results in table 6 also shows that a higher confidence level corresponds to a higher total irrigation water allocation i e the equation i 1 i j 1 j a i j s w i j η s g w i j η g for example when α cut confidence level is raised from o 2 to 0 8 the total of allocated irrigation water is increased from 237 09 106 m3 to 239 19 106 m3 under the minimum reliability the total of allocated irrigation water is increased from 240 52 106 m3 to 242 44 106 m3 under the maximum reliability based on fuzzy arithmetic that can be used to generalize crisp mathematical operators to fuzzy sets zadeh 1978 an increased α cut confidence level leads to an increased possibility and decreased admissible risk of violation of constraints which means an increased strictness for the double sided fuzzy constraints thus less water availabilities right hand side fuzzy parameters of constraints and larger rate of water loss during water conveyance left hand side fuzzy parameters of constraints will be generated therefore in this case the allocated groundwater availabilities are limited and more surface water availabilities should be used for irrigation leading to an increased total irrigation water use fig 4 a c present the variations of the maximum economic water productivity between total economic benefits and total irrigation water use at different confidence levels under the minimum and maximum reliabilities scenarios taking the medium water level as example shown in fig 4b the results of economic water productivity from the developed model are decreased with an increased confidence level for example when the confidence level is raised the economic water productivity is decreased from 5 520 yuan m3 to 5 494 yuan m3 under the minimum reliability certainly similar changing trends of the results can be obtained under high and low water levels this is mainly because with the confidence level increasing the double sided constraints become more strictly established and thus lead to a narrower decision space this will conversely result in increased total irrigation water use and water use costs and thus reduce system economic benefits and economic water productivity moreover the economic water productivity is 5 474 yuan m3 to 5 444 yuan m3 under the maximum reliability scenario obviously the maximum reliability is slightly lower than that under the minimum reliability scenario compared with the minimum reliability scenario this confidence level of constraints satisfaction is more reliable because the risk level is lower therefore in this case the decision maker will be more conservative in the irrigation water allocation management 5 discussion to better summarize the characteristics and advantages of the flfp model a linear dfccp model is introduced into the study for comparison this linear model is an economy oriented optimization model its objective function is to maximize the system economic benefits with the same parameter settings of fuzzy uncertainty and a set of constraints therefore optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation can be obtained by solving linear dfccp model table 7 figs 5 7 show the comparison of the economic water productivity and total irrigation water use of two models under high medium and low water levels in fact under different water levels the flfp model leads to lower system economic benefits than the linear dfccp model at different confidence levels however in terms of economic water productivity the flfp model is much greater than the linear model taking medium water level as an example fig 6a when the confidence level raised from 0 2 to 0 8 the economic water productivity resulting from flfp model is decreased from 5 520 yuan m3 to 5 494 yuan m3 while that from linear model is increased from 2 046 yuan m3 to 2 141 yuan m3 such a notable difference between the two models can be explained by further comparisons of the total irrigation water use amount in other words the linear model leads to more system economic benefits but it also consumes a large amount of irrigation water resources resulting in less economic water productivity as shown in figs 5 7 total irrigation water use of flfp model is greatly lower than that of linear dfccp model in detail see fig 6a as the confidence level raised total irrigation water use resulting from flfp model will fluctuate within a range of 237 09 106 m3 and 239 19 106 m3 while that from linear model is decreased from 807 60 106 m3 to 765 85 106 m3 this is because the flfp model focuses on the maximum economic water productivity that is maximum net system benefits with minimum irrigation water allocation from the irrigated area but the linear dfccp model puts more emphasis on the total system benefits from the overall irrigation districts fig 8 illustrates the system benefits of the flfp and linear dfccp models under the minimum and maximum reliabilities and high water level apparently the system benefits of the linear dfccp model are roughly greater than flfp model thus the total system benefits and farmer s economic income of flfp model are much less due to yield reduction but these saved water can be used for other purpose to compensate for this for instance water saved by flfp model can be used to discharge to the downstream area for ecological restoration cheng et al 2014 or transfer agricultural water to the second industry and tertiary industry to bring an incremental benefit of water resources through agricultural water savings reallocation zhang and guo 2016 therefore the results of the flfp model show that the potential in the study area is significant in terms of economic water productivity and water savings on the other hand in practical problems the objective of the maximum economic water productivity may lead to allocate less irrigation water to achieve a relative higher agricultural water productivity which will lead to water deficit irrigation conditions of crops and thus reduce the expected agricultural crop yields however this situation can be resolved through market trade and national grain subsidy policy to guarantee food security and give economic compensation for farmers respectively furthermore when the confidence level increases the economic water productivity of flfp model decreases while the economic water productivity of linear model increases fig 5a b present the variation trends between the minimum and maximum reliabilities scenarios the economic water productivity under the minimum reliability is slightly higher than that under the maximum reliability of the flfp model however the linear model shows an opposite result therefore compared with linear model the flfp model is an efficiency oriented optimization model that can effectively deal with ratio problem and reflect economic water productivity more practically it can reflect the tradeoffs and interrelationships through a ratio of economic water productivity by taking into account multiple input factors which is helpful in the sustainable development of agriculture in order to highlight the characteristics of flfp model a linear fractional programming lfp model is introduced for comparison purpose without consideration of double sided fuzzy chance constrained constraints its deterministic parameters can be derived from setting the confidence level α 1 0 therefore the solutions of lfp model are special cases in the solutions generated from flfp method accordingly the solution of the lfp model can be obtained table 8 in this case the decision alternative will be restricted to a single solution meanwhile the flexibility and effectiveness of decision making will be undermined without considering the fuzzy uncertainty of parameters therefore the flfp model can support the in depth analysis of the relationship between economic water productivity and different confidence levels and can provide more effective decision alternatives to sum up the above analysis shows that the flfp model is derived from combining with lfp and dfccp model which can be used to deal with the problem of irrigation water allocation under uncertainty the flfp model has the following advantages 1 it can deal with two objectives directly rather than subjective determination of weight coefficients 2 it effectively reflects economic water productivity and fuzzy parameters on double sided constraints 3 it introduces the concept of confidence levels of fuzzy constraints satisfaction under both minimum and maximum reliabilities to generate more flexible solutions and 4 it facilitates in depth analysis of interrelationships among economic water productivity system benefits and varying confidence levels therefore the results of the flfp model can provide decision support when applied in the irrigation water allocation under complex uncertainty it is an attempt to demonstrate that these solutions are feasible and flexible when considering economic water productivity so as to support the irrigation water management in the study area the results can also help managers to identify desired irrigation water allocations for supporting agricultural sustainability 6 conclusions a fuzzy linear fractional programing flfp approach with double sided fuzziness is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty in the developed model the double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp is incorporated into a linear fractional programming lfp optimization framework therefore the flfp model can deal with ratio optimization problems with double sided fuzzy chance constraints the concept of confidence level of fuzzy constraints satisfaction under both minimum and maximum reliabilities is introduced to generate more flexible solutions thus the final solutions can be generated by giving different confidence levels for constraint the developed flfp model is then applied to a case study for irrigation water allocation to demonstrate its applicability the obtained results are useful for supporting irrigation water management the results of flfp model show that 1 the sum of irrigated surface water and groundwater is equal to the minimum crop water requirements in flfp model due to its objective function 2 the allocated irrigation water in ids of linze county is sensitive to the variations of confidence levels 3 a higher confidence level corresponds to a higher total irrigation water allocation and a lower economic water productivity and 4 the economic water productivity under maximum reliability is slightly lower than that under the minimum reliability scenario 5 the results of economic water productivity under three water level are high level medium level lower level while the total system benefits show an opposite result this study attempts to develop a modelling framework for ratio problems involving fuzzy uncertainties to deal with irrigation water allocation problem the results suggest that it is also applicable to other resources and environmental management problems however the flfp model still needs to be improved confidence level is critical in the decision making process of fuzzy constraints satisfaction but there are no effective tools to choose a proper one this difficulty should deserve further investigations besides this approach can be further enhanced through incorporating the highly complex information within the optimization framework to reflect the spatial variations of crop soil and water such as process based simulation model and more filed experiments as a potentially crucial problem water quality and saline problems will be paid attention to in our future scientific research acknowledgements this

be obtained these results can provide decision support when deciding on selecting reasonable irrigation water resources management and agricultural production keywords irrigation water allocation double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming linear fractional programming uncertainty decision making 1 introduction nowadays it is commonly believed that growing population and diminishing water availability in china are jointly affect the contradiction between water supply and water demand especially in arid or semiarid regions dominated by agriculture moreover irrigated agriculture is the biggest consumer attributing to water use consuming 70 of total water use in the world kang et al 2017 irrigation water management naturally becomes worldwide concerns for agricultural production and livelihood security with limited water resources storm et al 2011 parsinejad et al 2013 therefore how to improve agricultural water use efficiency or agricultural water productivity and further effectively allocate irrigation water resources is expected to ensure food security and promote sustainable development of agriculture to address the above concerns many optimization methods or models have been developed for optimal irrigation water allocation dudley et al 1971 rao et al 1990 mainuddin et al 1997 shangguan et al 2002 noory et al 2012 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a however among these studies the objectives of model almost focus on the system benefits and few studies optimize the agricultural water use efficiency agricultural water use efficiency is defined as the production per unit of irrigation application playán and mateos 2006 which is also known as agricultural water productivity reflecting the system efficiency more importantly in many developing countries irrigation water management suffers from lower water use efficiency and the irrigation water resources are not utilized efficiently li et al 2016a in water limited areas where water is the most limiting factor to obtain higher water productivity may be economically more profitable for the farmer and it is more likely to be considered rather than higher crop yield or economic benefits this problem can be quantitatively described by an optimization model using linear fractional programming lfp the lfp model is capable of facilitating the analysis of system efficiency through transforming a bi objective e g cost and volume output and input problem into a ratio one especially for addressing the issue with better achievements per unit of inputs lara and stancu minasian 1999 gomez et al 2006 guo et al 2014 zhang and guo 2017a however the lfp model has difficulty in tackling uncertainties in irrigation water allocation problems uncertainties existing in irrigation water management systems should be considered strategically generally the irrigation water management basically consists of various parameters such as hydrological elements economic parameters and other related parameters which are not easily quantified and defined in the model regulwar and gurav 2011 elliott et al 2014 zhang et al 2017b there are many inexact optimization methods mainly including stochastic mathematical programming smp fuzzy mathematical programming fmp and interval linear programming ilp were developed to tackle uncertainties huang 1996 shastri and diwekar 2006 kerachian and karamouz 2007 guo et al 2010 li et al 2013 liu et al 2014 li et al 2015 nematian 2016 wang et al 2016 in detail smp is generally used to deal with random uncertainties i e hydrological parameters in the irrigation water allocation problems however the data requirement to specify parameter with probability distribution functions pdfs and intensive computational burden may result in difficulties in its practical applications li et al 2016a ilp can deal with all uncertain parameters expressed as interval values without considering distribution information however it is incapable of tackling problems with violation of system constraints huang 1996 in practical some parameters exhibit features of vagueness and imprecision they are estimated empirically and subject to human judgments and can better be expressed by fuzzy membership functions xu and qin 2010 moreover fmp has a lower data requirements but reflects more flexible information in practical application because the related membership functions are more easily defined than pdfs xu et al 2010 wan and li 2015 besides when the violation of system constraints exists in the optimization model the chance constrained programming with fuzzy parameters needs to be introduced into the general optimization framework therefore chance constrained programming ccp was extended from stochastic pdfs to fuzzy possibility distribution environments liu and iwamura 1998 similar to chance constrained programming with random uncertainties models fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp also requires that the fuzzy constraints be transformed into deterministic ones at predetermined confidence levels which has a lower computational burden and generates more flexible solutions therefore fccp is an improved fmp method and it s effective for tackling fuzzy uncertainties and violation of system constraints xu and qin 2010 however in many practical applications fuzzy uncertainties may exist in both sides of constraints within the model thus double sided fccp dfccp method is a better choice for addressing these complexities nevertheless dfccp method cannot deal with ratio optimization problems in addition there are few studies on dfccp method for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty therefore this study aims to develop a fuzzy linear fractional programming flfp approach with double sided fuzziness for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty technique of dfccp will be incorporated into lfp optimization framework therefore the developed model can deal with uncertainty presented as fuzziness in both left hand side and right hand side components of constraints moreover it has advantages in 1 addressing two objectives simultaneously without considering subjective factors 2 effectively reflecting economic water productivity 3 introducing the concept of confidence levels of fuzzy constraints satisfaction under both the minimum and maximum reliabilities to generate more flexible solutions and 4 facilitating in depth analysis of interrelationships among economic water productivity system benefits and varying confidence levels the model is applied to a case study to demonstrate its applicability the study area is a major agricultural production base in china while it currently faces increasingly severe water shortages problems the objective is to maximize the economic water productivity i e to obtain maximum system benefits with minimum irrigation water allocation to allocate the limited irrigation water to different crops and different subareas the optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation can be generated under each confidence level which can be used to facilitate the analysis for the various irrigation water management schemes under complex uncertainties the framework of this study is illustrated in fig 1 2 formulation of the flfp approach consider an agricultural irrigation system in a region where multiple crops need to be irrigated in different irrigation districts the managers are responsible for making irrigation plans for these competing water users generally a higher agricultural water productivity is a greater concern under limited water conditions for creating a sustainable agriculture system such a problem can be effectively addressed by linear fractional programming lfp model charnes and cooper 1963 zhu and huang 2011 moreover when both left hand and right hand side parameters in the constraints are of fuzzy features and can be presents as possibility distributions and the violation of system constraints exists in the optimization model thus the double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp method can be adopted fiedler et al 2006 xu et al 2012 for example in this study parameters associated with the water availability and the rate of water loss during water conveyance are expressed as fuzzy sets therefore in response to above concerns a fuzzy linear fractional programming flfp approach with double sided fuzziness is developed by integrating the dfccp method into lfp framework consequently based on flfp approach the study problem for irrigation water allocation to different crops in different subarea can be formulated as follows system objective 1a max f i 1 12 j 1 3 n b i j c p i j a i j a j s w i j g w i j p e i b j i 1 12 j 1 3 a i j c s i s w

type of crop j 1 2 3 nb ij is the price of crop j in irrigation district i yuan kg cp ij is the cost of crop production of crop j in irrigation district i which includes all other costs such as seed fertilizer pesticides machinery harvesting marketing drying and unexpected costs this cost is independent of the amount of applied irrigation water yuan kg a ij is the irrigated area of crop j in irrigation district i ha a j and b j are the coefficients of linear crop water production function of crop j sw ij and gw ij are the decision variables which means that the allocated surface water and groundwater m3 ha p e i is the effective precipitation of irrigation district i m3 ha cs i cg i are the cost of surface water and groundwater use in irrigation district i yuan m3 η s and η g are the irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and ground water respectively constraints the objective is subjected to a series of constraints in water availability irrigation water demand fairness and other related concerns these constraints can determine the reasonable decision space of decision variables 1 surface water availability constraint 1b p o s λ s q s i 1 12 j 1 3 1 λ s a i

λ g are the rate of surface water and groundwater loss during water conveyance exhibiting features of vagueness and imprecision q s and q g are the surface water and groundwater availability 106 m3 they can be expressed by fuzzy membership functions η s and η g are the irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater β s and β g are the proportion of surface water and groundwater used for agricultural irrigation in this study let β s 0 9 and β g 0 9 in above constrains α cut confidence level is used to describe the fuzzy degree of membership level and quantify the fuzzy parameter fig 2 presents the triangular membership function and α cut interval with lower and upper bounds for each α cut level 3 fairness constraint 1d i 1 i i 2 i s w i 1 j g w i 1 j p e i 1 s

this constraint means that the ratio between the sum of water shortages of each two subareas and total water demands is less than or equal to an acceptable gap zhang and xu 2011 for some districts with higher water use efficiency and net benefit will be allocated with more water this may not fair to farmers with lower water use efficiency therefore the gini coefficient is introduced when considering the fairness constraint yang et al 2015 let g 0 0 4 in fairness constraint because the international warning level is 0 4 4 irrigation water demand constraint 1e e t min i j s w i j g w i

and gw ij are the decision variables which should be positive according to fiedler et al 2006 the violation of constraints in the dfccp method at each predefined confidence level consists of two reliability scenarios namely the minimum reliability and the maximum reliability therefore they can be presented as follows 2a p o s r i j v min i j sup min μ r i j x i j μ v i j y i j x i j y i j ℜ x i j y i j α r i j l α v i j r α 2b p o s r i j v max i j inf max 1 μ r i j x i j 1 μ v i j y i j x i j y i j ℜ x i j y i j α r i j r 1 α v i j l 1 α where r i j v min i j means that the equations r i j v i j should be satisfied at the minimum reliability while r i j v max i j means that the equations r i j v i j should be satisfied at the maximum reliability μ r i j x i j μ v i j y i j are the fuzzy membership functions of the variables x ij and y ij the term r i j l α is defined as the minimum values of all possible values at α cut level namely r i j l α inf r r μ 1 α similarly v i j r α is defined as maximum values of all possible values at α cut level namely v i j r α sup v v μ 1 α μ 1 is the inverse function of μ based on eqs 2a and 2b the flfp approach can be transformed into two crisp equivalents accordingly therefore these two deterministic submodels can be presented as follows a confidence levels at the minimum reliability 3a max f minr i 1 12 j 1 3 n b i j c p i j a i j a

l 1 α η g β g where the submodel means that constraints are satisfied at the maximum reliability therefore left hand side parameters of constraints 4b and 4c should become their maximum values and the right hand side parameters become their minimum ones in this case the constraints become more restricted which will lead to an increased strictness for the constraints and thus a narrow decision space

into upper middle and lower reaches by the controlled hydrological stations of yingluoxia and zhengyixia the upstream area is the mountainous area where is the runoff production area and midstream area is a main water consumer due to its considerably large area of irrigated oasis as for the downstream area it s mainly desert facing serious ecological problems e g degradation of the environment desertification of land the elevations of the hrb range from 1300 to 2500 m its climate is characterized by arid because this area is situated in the inner of asia europe continent zhao et al 2005 the mean annual temperature is 7 57 c and mean annual precipitation is 195 mm as well as mean annual potential evapotranspiration is 1710 mm the shallow porous and highly permeable soil in the midstream area are characterized as greyish brown desert soil sandy loam and sandy soil zhao et al 2010 the midstream area produces the main crops of wheat maize and economic crops such as cotton fruits and vegetables the economic crop is also called as cash crop compared with grain crops like maize and wheat the economic crops can bring high economic benefits to increase farmer s income because no multiple cropping exists and thus the value of the multiple cropping index is nearly 100 the growing period of these crops ranges from march to october there are in total 12 irrigation districts ids belonging to three administrative regions in midstream area that are irrigated directly by the main stream which is selected as the study area 97 37 102 06 e 37 44 42 40 n namely daman shangsan xijun and yingke ids of ganzhou district pingchuan banqiao yanuan liaoquan and shahe ids of linze county youlian luocheng and liuba ids of gaotai county the study area see fig 3 is a major irrigation area and grain production base in china that currently faces severe water shortages with little precipitation and high evapotranspiration irrigation thereby becomes an important measure for promoting grain production moreover in midstream area water consumption accounts for over 80 of the total available water resources from the heihe river and nearly 90 of the water consumption is used for irrigation li et al 2016a crops are mainly irrigated with canal water and traditional irrigation patterns such as flood and furrow methods are commonly used pumping groundwater is mainly for supplementing agricultural irrigation when the supply of canal water is inadequate or seasonal variations jiang et al 2015 the increasing water demands and shrinking water supplies have exacerbated the competition among water users therefore how to optimize the limited irrigation water allocation and thus to improve agricultural water productivity have become a growing urgent issue for the development of agriculture this agricultural water productivity nowadays called economic water productivity is defined as the production or and system benefits per unit of irrigation water which plays an increasingly important role in irrigation water management problem the problem can be more compounded by many uncertainties existing in the agricultural systems such as socio economic parameters i e market conditions water use costs and hydrological elements thus managers attempt to obtain optimal irrigation water allocation solutions to three different crops in these ids in the study system the problems under consideration include 1 how to maximize economic water productivity under fuzzy uncertainty 2 how to reflect the variations of results with double sided violation of system constraints and 3 how to identify the optimal irrigation water allocation solutions for crops to different ids under different water levels therefore to address above concerns a fuzzy linear fractional programming flfp approach with double sided fuzziness is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation 3 2 data collection and processing to deal with such a problem a series of input parameters need to be acquired not only about crops data among different ids but also the information about the precipitation irrigation water demand and available water resources a detailed description of the different input parameters can be presented as follows 3 2 1 crop water production function the crop water production function cwpf is used to express the relation between obtained crop yield and the total amount of actual evapotranspiration brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 which will directly influence irrigation planning and irrigation water allocation solutions two types of cwpf including the relation between crop yields and actual evapotranspiration in the whole growth period and in each growth stage are commonly used in this study cwpfs for the whole growth stage will be adopted which basically includes linear and nonlinear functions generally the linear and nonlinear empirical models of cwpfs can be established by the experimental data for the whole growth stage chen and kang 1995 a linear form is more suitable to the low yield area where it is lack of irrigation water and has a lower management level kang and cai 1996 li et al 2016a b because the study area is located in an arid region thus a linear cwpf model is a better choice namely y a bet where y is crop yield kg ha et is actual evapotranspiration m3 ha a b are empirical coefficients fitted by least square method different crop water production functions are fitted based on evapotranspiration data and associated yield data obtained from field experiments the field experiments were conducted in yingke irrigation district during april to september in 2012 2013 jiang et al 2015 field experiments are a laborious and time consuming task that did not conducted within each irrigation district resulting in a lack of data for all irrigation districts we believe that soil types and other characteristics have an impact on the water production function which we did not consider in the study because water is the most dominant limiting factor moreover yingke irrigation district located in the ganzhou district is a typical irrigation district in the middle reaches of heihe river basin therefore the data is representative it is thus assumed that crop water production function of all these 12 ids is the same due to their similar hydrological and meteorological conditions the expression of linear crop water production functions for the three crops in this study is shown in table 1 3 2 2 water availability crops in these ids are irrigated by surface water and groundwater in order to reflect the uncertain characteristics of parameters both surface water and groundwater availability are considered as a fuzzy number on the right hand side constraints table 2 the triangular fuzzy number is used to describe the fuzzy characteristics which requires to obtain the middle and the lower values of water availability in terms of surface water availability water supply for the midstream area is delivered by the main stream of heihe river thus water supply for all the 12 ids equals the difference that the runoff from the upstream subtracts the water release to the downstream area the category of three inflow levels is based on the frequency analysis method li et al 2016a namely low level p 75 medium level 25 p 75 and high level p 25 because the standard deviation of the each inflow level is unknown then t distribution is used to estimate the range of parameters this study adopts the 95 confidence level lower bounds to express the lower values of fuzzy numbers and the mean of inflow are to express the middle values therefore for each inflow level a triangular fuzzy value with lower and middle values denotes the surface water availability for irrigation the available groundwater is obtained from historical statistical data it is also divided into three water levels in the form of triangular fuzzy number the middle and the lower values of available groundwater are calculated based on the mean and the minimum values of the statistical data once the surface water is insufficient for irrigation due to seasonal variations then pumping groundwater is to make up for this deficiency therefore when the surface water is at low level more groundwater will be extracted the effective precipitation among different water levels are obtained from the typical hydrological years table 3 because of the low precipitation in arid area the precipitation can be fully utilized so effective precipitation can be obtained directly from the measured data of meteorological stations 3 2 3 irrigation water demand in this study irrigation water demand for these 12 ids is calculated according to et c k c et 0 allen et al 1998 where et c is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day daily reference evapotranspiration is obtained by the fao 56 penman monteith method based on the meteorological data from zhangye no 52562 linze no 52557 and gaotai no 52546 meteorological stations located in midstream area during 1967 2009 yin et al 2012 the total crop evapotranspiration of the whole growth stage can be calculated by the sum of daily value of each growth stage under typical hydrological year the k c values vary during different growth stages which can determine the upper and lower bounds of irrigation water demand li et al 2016b therefore irrigation water demand and k c values of the crops at different growth stages can be seen in tables 3 and 4 3 2 4 other related parameters table 5 presents some basic data of different crops in these ids including crop planting area market price and water use cost per unit irrigation water because the rate of canal lining is low thus nearly 30 of the water is lost during water conveyance zhang and guo 2017b therefore the irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater are 0 52 0 60 respectively the rate of water loss during water conveyance is considered as triangular fuzzy sets in the left hand side constraints in this problem the rates of water loss during surface water and groundwater conveyance are 0 20 0 25 0 30 and 0 10 0 15 0 20 respectively 4 result analysis because the developed model incorporates the dfccp method into lfp optimization framework thus this model reflects the characteristics and advantages of the two methods simultaneously firstly the objective function of model is defined as the maximum economic benefits per unit of irrigation water which also represents the agricultural water use efficiency or economic water productivity moreover the fundamental concept of the dfccp method is to generate optimal results that double sided fuzzy constraints can be satisfied at a certain confidence level in optimization model therefore how to choose the confidence level is particularly important to investigate the results of violating the constraints and generate a range of decision solutions the results at four α cut confidence levels e g α 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are analyzed and compared different α cut levels reflect the subjective attitudes or preferences of decision makers and thus affect the corresponding changing trend of the results under different satisfaction degrees of fuzzy uncertainty table 6 presents the obtained results of irrigation water allocation from flfp model under medium water level at α cut levels from 0 2 to 0 8 for the same α cut confidence level under the minimum and maximum reliabilities the overall results for different crops in ganzhou district and gaotai county almost are the same for example at α 0 2 under the minimum and maximum reliabilities see second column of table 6 the obtained results for three crops among the majority of ids show that crops are irrigated by groundwater completely and no surface water is used for irrigation under such circumstance the allowable groundwater is firstly utilized for irrigation due to its higher irrigation water use coefficient and lower rate of water loss during water conveyance i e η g η s and λ g λ s luocheng is an exception for the optimal irrigation water allocation of three crops that is under the minimum reliability the result is 0 1993 2 m3 ha surface water groundwater for wheat 1145 1 874 2 m3 ha for maize and 0 1884 9 m3 ha for economic crops while under the maximum reliability the result is 1993 2 0 m3 ha for wheat 2019 3 0 m3 ha for maize and 1884 9 0 m3 ha for economic crops respectively similarly the results can be examined at α 0 4 0 6 0 8 under both the minimum and maximum reliabilities however ids in linze county have different results under the minimum reliability scenario all the crops are irrigated by groundwater totally but the varying results can be obtained under the maximum reliability scenario furthermore the sum of irrigated surface water and groundwater is also equal to their minimum crop water requirements this is because if the linear cwpf projects a positive vertical axis intercept the empirical value of crop water productivity will decline as et increases wichelns 2014 the intercept will thereby help determine whether water productivity will increase or decrease at higher levels of et for a linear cwpf thus it is evident that those crops suffer from water deficiency in order to achieve the maximum economic benefits with the minimum irrigation amount additionally the results also indicate that surface water resources are not fully utilized more importantly this also shows that it is urgent need to take water saving measures such as canal lining to reduce the water loss and thus improve the irrigation efficiency of surface water on the other hand such a great quantity of surface water is not fully utilized indicating that there is still not achieve its full potential for the development of water saving agriculture in the region furthermore at α 0 2 under the minimum reliability the allocated surface water is less than or equals to that under the maximum reliability in contrast the allocated groundwater presents the opposite result taking wheat as an example the allocated surface water in ids of linze county is zero under the minimum reliability while the results under the maximum reliability are 383 3 m3 ha pingchuan 754 2 m3 ha banqiao 789 7 m3 ha yanuan 636 4 m3 ha liaoquan and 711 0 m3 ha shahe the reason is that according to the dfccp algorithm the surface water and groundwater availabilities under the minimum reliability conditions are significantly higher than the maximum reliability more groundwater availabilities are used for irrigation due to the structure of the developed optimization model therefore the overall optimal solution is to give priority to the use of groundwater to meet the actual crop water requirements the results in table 6 also shows that a higher confidence level corresponds to a higher total irrigation water allocation i e the equation i 1 i j 1 j a i j s w i j η s g w i j η g for example when α cut confidence level is raised from o 2 to 0 8 the total of allocated irrigation water is increased from 237 09 106 m3 to 239 19 106 m3 under the minimum reliability the total of allocated irrigation water is increased from 240 52 106 m3 to 242 44 106 m3 under the maximum reliability based on fuzzy arithmetic that can be used to generalize crisp mathematical operators to fuzzy sets zadeh 1978 an increased α cut confidence level leads to an increased possibility and decreased admissible risk of violation of constraints which means an increased strictness for the double sided fuzzy constraints thus less water availabilities right hand side fuzzy parameters of constraints and larger rate of water loss during water conveyance left hand side fuzzy parameters of constraints will be generated therefore in this case the allocated groundwater availabilities are limited and more surface water availabilities should be used for irrigation leading to an increased total irrigation water use fig 4 a c present the variations of the maximum economic water productivity between total economic benefits and total irrigation water use at different confidence levels under the minimum and maximum reliabilities scenarios taking the medium water level as example shown in fig 4b the results of economic water productivity from the developed model are decreased with an increased confidence level for example when the confidence level is raised the economic water productivity is decreased from 5 520 yuan m3 to 5 494 yuan m3 under the minimum reliability certainly similar changing trends of the results can be obtained under high and low water levels this is mainly because with the confidence level increasing the double sided constraints become more strictly established and thus lead to a narrower decision space this will conversely result in increased total irrigation water use and water use costs and thus reduce system economic benefits and economic water productivity moreover the economic water productivity is 5 474 yuan m3 to 5 444 yuan m3 under the maximum reliability scenario obviously the maximum reliability is slightly lower than that under the minimum reliability scenario compared with the minimum reliability scenario this confidence level of constraints satisfaction is more reliable because the risk level is lower therefore in this case the decision maker will be more conservative in the irrigation water allocation management 5 discussion to better summarize the characteristics and advantages of the flfp model a linear dfccp model is introduced into the study for comparison this linear model is an economy oriented optimization model its objective function is to maximize the system economic benefits with the same parameter settings of fuzzy uncertainty and a set of constraints therefore optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation can be obtained by solving linear dfccp model table 7 figs 5 7 show the comparison of the economic water productivity and total irrigation water use of two models under high medium and low water levels in fact under different water levels the flfp model leads to lower system economic benefits than the linear dfccp model at different confidence levels however in terms of economic water productivity the flfp model is much greater than the linear model taking medium water level as an example fig 6a when the confidence level raised from 0 2 to 0 8 the economic water productivity resulting from flfp model is decreased from 5 520 yuan m3 to 5 494 yuan m3 while that from linear model is increased from 2 046 yuan m3 to 2 141 yuan m3 such a notable difference between the two models can be explained by further comparisons of the total irrigation water use amount in other words the linear model leads to more system economic benefits but it also consumes a large amount of irrigation water resources resulting in less economic water productivity as shown in figs 5 7 total irrigation water use of flfp model is greatly lower than that of linear dfccp model in detail see fig 6a as the confidence level raised total irrigation water use resulting from flfp model will fluctuate within a range of 237 09 106 m3 and 239 19 106 m3 while that from linear model is decreased from 807 60 106 m3 to 765 85 106 m3 this is because the flfp model focuses on the maximum economic water productivity that is maximum net system benefits with minimum irrigation water allocation from the irrigated area but the linear dfccp model puts more emphasis on the total system benefits from the overall irrigation districts fig 8 illustrates the system benefits of the flfp and linear dfccp models under the minimum and maximum reliabilities and high water level apparently the system benefits of the linear dfccp model are roughly greater than flfp model thus the total system benefits and farmer s economic income of flfp model are much less due to yield reduction but these saved water can be used for other purpose to compensate for this for instance water saved by flfp model can be used to discharge to the downstream area for ecological restoration cheng et al 2014 or transfer agricultural water to the second industry and tertiary industry to bring an incremental benefit of water resources through agricultural water savings reallocation zhang and guo 2016 therefore the results of the flfp model show that the potential in the study area is significant in terms of economic water productivity and water savings on the other hand in practical problems the objective of the maximum economic water productivity may lead to allocate less irrigation water to achieve a relative higher agricultural water productivity which will lead to water deficit irrigation conditions of crops and thus reduce the expected agricultural crop yields however this situation can be resolved through market trade and national grain subsidy policy to guarantee food security and give economic compensation for farmers respectively furthermore when the confidence level increases the economic water productivity of flfp model decreases while the economic water productivity of linear model increases fig 5a b present the variation trends between the minimum and maximum reliabilities scenarios the economic water productivity under the minimum reliability is slightly higher than that under the maximum reliability of the flfp model however the linear model shows an opposite result therefore compared with linear model the flfp model is an efficiency oriented optimization model that can effectively deal with ratio problem and reflect economic water productivity more practically it can reflect the tradeoffs and interrelationships through a ratio of economic water productivity by taking into account multiple input factors which is helpful in the sustainable development of agriculture in order to highlight the characteristics of flfp model a linear fractional programming lfp model is introduced for comparison purpose without consideration of double sided fuzzy chance constrained constraints its deterministic parameters can be derived from setting the confidence level α 1 0 therefore the solutions of lfp model are special cases in the solutions generated from flfp method accordingly the solution of the lfp model can be obtained table 8 in this case the decision alternative will be restricted to a single solution meanwhile the flexibility and effectiveness of decision making will be undermined without considering the fuzzy uncertainty of parameters therefore the flfp model can support the in depth analysis of the relationship between economic water productivity and different confidence levels and can provide more effective decision alternatives to sum up the above analysis shows that the flfp model is derived from combining with lfp and dfccp model which can be used to deal with the problem of irrigation water allocation under uncertainty the flfp model has the following advantages 1 it can deal with two objectives directly rather than subjective determination of weight coefficients 2 it effectively reflects economic water productivity and fuzzy parameters on double sided constraints 3 it introduces the concept of confidence levels of fuzzy constraints satisfaction under both minimum and maximum reliabilities to generate more flexible solutions and 4 it facilitates in depth analysis of interrelationships among economic water productivity system benefits and varying confidence levels therefore the results of the flfp model can provide decision support when applied in the irrigation water allocation under complex uncertainty it is an attempt to demonstrate that these solutions are feasible and flexible when considering economic water productivity so as to support the irrigation water management in the study area the results can also help managers to identify desired irrigation water allocations for supporting agricultural sustainability 6 conclusions a fuzzy linear fractional programing flfp approach with double sided fuzziness is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty in the developed model the double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp is incorporated into a linear fractional programming lfp optimization framework therefore the flfp model can deal with ratio optimization problems with double sided fuzzy chance constraints the concept of confidence level of fuzzy constraints satisfaction under both minimum and maximum reliabilities is introduced to generate more flexible solutions thus the final solutions can be generated by giving different confidence levels for constraint the developed flfp model is then applied to a case study for irrigation water allocation to demonstrate its applicability the obtained results are useful for supporting irrigation water management the results of flfp model show that 1 the sum of irrigated surface water and groundwater is equal to the minimum crop water requirements in flfp model due to its objective function 2 the allocated irrigation water in ids of linze county is sensitive to the variations of confidence levels 3 a higher confidence level corresponds to a higher total irrigation water allocation and a lower economic water productivity and 4 the economic water productivity under maximum reliability is slightly lower than that under the minimum reliability scenario 5 the results of economic water productivity under three water level are high level medium level lower level while the total system benefits show an opposite result this study attempts to develop a modelling framework for ratio problems involving fuzzy uncertainties to deal with irrigation water allocation problem the results suggest that it is also applicable to other resources and environmental management problems however the flfp model still needs to be improved confidence level is critical in the decision making process of fuzzy constraints satisfaction but there are no effective tools to choose a proper one this difficulty should deserve further investigations besides this approach can be further enhanced through incorporating the highly complex information within the optimization framework to reflect the spatial variations of crop soil and water such as process based simulation model and more filed experiments as a potentially crucial problem water quality and saline problems will be paid attention to in our future scientific research acknowledgements this

11567,increased use of irrigation on semi arid sandy soils requires optimisation of irrigation and fertilisation practices to reduce water and nitrogen n losses field experiments were conducted on a semi arid loamy sandy soil in two consecutive cropping periods one in a cold dry season cp cd and one in a hot wet season cp hw the effects of individual treatment factors and their interactions including two different irrigation methods furrow f or drip d two irrigation levels full if or reduced ir and two top dressing n fertiliser types quick nq or slow ns release on water and n distribution in the soil profile potential water fluxes to the zone below the roots and n losses from the 0 90 cm soil profile were studied the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in soil water from suction cups and soil from bulk soil samples tended to be higher at greater depth in the treatments with lower soil water tension resulting from the interactions between the factors f or d with if and nq most probably resulting from net downward redistribution of n the irns treatments resulted in longer soil water no3 n and nh4 n residence time at 30 and 60 cm depth and throughout the two cropping periods no3 n was higher in ns than in nq treatments potential faster downward water flux and thus water losses and the n leaching risk was concentrated to the first 50 75 days after sowing in fir and dir treatments while it was spread throughout the cropping periods in fif and dif hence treatments fifnq and difnq in both cp cd and cp hw resulted in the highest estimated n losses from the 0 90 cm soil profile based on these results a combination of d irrigation ir irrigation level and ns fertiliser type should preferably be applied to avoid the risk of excessive water losses downward n redistribution and subsequent leaching keywords ammonium leaching maize crop nitrate temporal variation water flux 1 introduction accurate knowledge of water and nitrogen n redistribution in soil is essential for proper design and management of irrigation and n fertiliser application options to safeguard sustainable farm practices wang and xing 2016a worldwide irrigated agriculture contributes 40 of the food produced wwap 2012 and it represents the major force controlling n dynamics in soil due to its impacts on the moisture content valé et al 2007 in the soil system n fertilisers are subjected to losses by a number of pathways of which leaching mainly in the form of nitrate no3 n hereafter no3 n is the most important therefore proper management of irrigation and n fertiliser applications is essential particularly in regions dominated by semi arid soils such as southern mozambique sandy soils generally have higher internal drainage with lower water holding capacity than finer textured soils mcneal et al 1995 when combined with excessive irrigation e g under traditional furrow irrigation this is likely to result in n losses with associated potential yield decreases and reduced water and nitrogen use efficiency rivera and boochs 2009 in general previous studies have indicated that n redistribution in the soil profile is intimately associated with the soil no3 n concentration and the amount of water lost through deep percolation tamini and mermoud 2002 gheysari et al 2009 jia et al 2014 ammonium n nh4 n hereafter nh4 n is another form of n potentially lost in coarse textured soils vitosh et al 1995 yet to a lower degree than no3 n according to deare et al 1995 nh4 n redistribution in the soil profile can be expected to be fast following urea fertilisation nevertheless a limited number of studies have assessed the downward movement of nh4 n in loamy sandy soils while most research focuses on no3 n thus water and n management practices require improvements to increase both no3 n and nh4 n residence time in the root zone and thereby increase their availability for crops various water and n fertiliser management practices have been suggested for sandy soils including surface drip irrigation darusman et al 1997 arbat et al 2013 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 application of slow or controlled release fertilisers noellsch et al 2009 guan et al 2014 multiple or split application of n fertiliser nakamura et al 2004 reduced irrigation and reduced n fertiliser level jia et al 2014 sui et al 2015 and a combination of organic and chemical fertilisers arbat et al 2013 omar et al 2015 irrigation management is of greater importance than fertilisers in reducing n losses and the use of drip irrigation has been shown to improve water and n use efficiency in maize production in the case of excessive water application however such as high rainfall events in combination with high n application has been associated with high no3 n losses due to maintenance of high soil moisture content arbat et al 2013 furthermore high frequency low volume irrigation e g drip irrigation has been shown in some studies to result in greater deep percolation losses than low frequency high volume irrigation e g furrow irrigation e g behera and panda 2009 in other studies drip irrigation has been found to be the best water application method for reducing water and n losses e g souza et al 2009 liu et al 2015 recognising the strong positive relationship between n leaching on one side and irrigation levels and n application rates on the other sui et al 2015 it has been suggested that for maize production it may be possible to reduce no3 n leaching from the root zone by split application of irrigation and n according to crop growth stage requirements jia et al 2014 the application of slow release n fertiliser e g poilyolefin resin coated urea and isobutylidene diurea to sandy soils potentially reduces n losses through leaching compared with quick release n fertiliser i e nh4no3 wang and alva 1996 furthermore improvements in n use efficiency of up to 27 compared with conventional n fertilisers have been reported when slow release n fertilisers are used in maize production in semi arid areas guan et al 2014 despite these advances there are persistent risks of increased downward redistribution of water and n resulting in deep percolation and leaching of nutrients beyond the root zone ajdary et al 2007 sui et al 2015 these risks require more research especially in cases where applied and percolating water exceeds the water holding capacity of the soil omar et al 2015 there is still limited information on the effects of different irrigation and n fertiliser strategies on the magnitude of water and n redistribution and accumulation in the soil profile barakat et al 2016 wang and xing 2016 especially for coarse textured soils sexton et al 1996 such information is essential to improve n budgets in different agro climate conditions the objective of the present study was to assess in a field experimental set up water and n redistribution including potential fluxes to the zone below the roots during two contrasting cropping periods cold dry and hot wet as affected by irrigation method irrigation level and n fertiliser type 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area the field experiments used in the present study were the latter two of four consecutive trials conducted from 2012 to 2015 on the same field plots located at the faculty of agronomy and forestry engineering experimental station in sábie village southern mozambique 25 19 13 s 32 15 53 e 58 m above sea level results from two previous studies have been published in chilundo et al 2016 and chilundo et al 2017 the site is characterised by a tropical steppe climate corresponding to bsh in the köppen classification peel et al 2007 with two contrasting seasons a cold dry season from may to september and a hot wet season from october to april reddy

exceeds 1500 mm with june and july having the lowest values approximately 100 mm reddy 1986 the soil in the area consists of deep stratified alluvial deposits with slope of 1 2 classified as eutric fluvisols fao soil classification inia 1990 before the establishment of trials plots soil samples collected throughout the experimental site 0 80 cm depth in four depth layers i e 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm indicated that soil texture ranged around the border between loamy sand and sandy loam furthermore the organic matter content ranged between 0 1 and 2 1 and cation exchange capacity between 4 9 and 10 9 meq per 100 g dry bulk density ranged between 1 2 and 1 4 g cm 3 in soil cores sampled in a pit 2 replicates per soil profile horizon i e 20 cm layers at the experimental site field capacity estimated from soil moisture observations in the experimental plots ranged between 17 and 23 v v and permanent wilting point between 4 and 6 v v before establishment of the cold dry period crop total soil no3 n ranged from 2 0 to 22 5 mg kg 1 and soil nh4 n ranged from 2 5 to 23 2 mg kg 1 in the central block used here for detailed studies of soil water flux direction the field capacity ranged between 17 and 24 v v and the permanent wilting point between 4 and 6 v v 2 2 experimental design and cultivation practices the field experiments included eight treatments resulting from combination of two irrigation methods two irrigation levels and two topdressing n fertiliser types arranged in a 2 2 2 factorial system in a randomised complete block design with three replicates blocks the three blocks were laid side by side and separated by a 2 m wide strip while a 1 m strip separated the individual plots within each block the size of each plot was 8 m 8 m the experiments in the present study were established and monitored during two cropping periods cp to match the two annual growing seasons one in the cold dry season may to september 2014 cp cd and one in the hot wet season november 2014 to february 2015 cp hw irrigation methods were furrow f and drip d irrigation levels were set to meet at least the crop water requirements if and reduced irrigation equalling 75 of if ir and the n fertiliser types were quick release nq and slow release ns the combined factors resulted in eight treatments assigned to each plot as follows fifnq fifns firnq firns difnq difns dirnq and dirns medium maturation maize hybrid pan67 which has a cycle of approximately 140 days to maturation in the cold dry season and 110 days in the hot wet season was planted manually in all plots on 10 may in cp cd and on 10 november in cp hw the spacing between plants was 30 cm with a final density of 41 600 plants ha 1 in all plots all plots were treated equally except for the management of irrigation and n fertiliser type conventional tillage using a disc plough to a working depth of 20 25 cm followed by disc harrowing was used for soil preparation before crop establishment in cp cd while before establishment in cp hw no soil preparation was done other than manual weeding pests were controlled by spraying chemicals according to recommendations by uda 1982 and weeds were controlled manually by hoeing 2 3 meteorological data and irrigation management meteorological data used for irrigation scheduling were collected from a station located 40 m from the experimental site rainfall was measured using an automated tipping bucket rain gauge model te525ws texas electronics inc usa potential evaporation used to estimate reference evapotranspiration was monitored manually using an andersson evaporimeter installed at 1 5 m height andersson 1969 volumetric flow meters were used to control the irrigation supply these were attached to flexible hoses for f treatments and installed on the irrigation manifold pipes for d treatments the d irrigation system consisted of low volume pressure compensating emitters spaced 30 cm apart along the line delivering a maximum discharge of 1 0 l h 1 at 1 bar operating pressure in order to start each of the cropping periods with similar soil moisture conditions 40 mm of water were applied as irrigation before sowing thoroughly wetting the soil to values close to or above field capacity in the upper 60 cm during the first 33 days after sowing in cp cd in order to stimulate uniform establishment of plants all plots were pre irrigated equally while in cp hw the pre irrigation was restricted to the first 15 days after sowing due to fast establishment of the plants thereafter the specific water level treatments if and ir were applied irrigation scheduling was established through a simplified water balance equation of allen et al 1998 by calculating the daily soil moisture depletion 1 swd i swd i 1 et c i i i p i where swdi is soil moisture depletion at the end of day i mm swdi 1 is soil moisture depletion at the end of the day before day i mm etc i is the crop evapotranspiration on day i mm calculated as the product of crop growth coefficient adapted from allen et al 1998 to local climate conditions and reference evapotranspiration ii is the applied irrigation level on day i mm and pi is the rainfall on day i mm the minimum value for swdi was zero i e when the root zone was at field capacity which was also the expected initial boundary condition following the irrigation events prior to sowing surface runoff and capillary rise were neglected due to the level to nearly level slope gradient in the area and the deep groundwater level 6 m within the f irrigated plots 30 mm of water were applied in the if treatments i e fifnq and fifns when swdi approached 30 mm while 22 5 mm were applied in ir i e firnq and firns the d irrigated plots under if i e difnq and difns received 15 mm water when swdi approached 15 mm while those under ir i e dirnq and dirns received 11 25 mm the irrigation frequency was thus higher in d treatments than in f treatments but in total treatments under a similar irrigation level if and ir respectively received equal amounts of water 2 4 fertiliser management two n fertiliser types were tested i quick release urea with 46 n nq a water soluble and readily available n source and ii organic complex coated slow release black urea with 46 n ns a low water soluble n source from which n release into the environment occurs at a slower rate than from common fertilisers shaviv and mikkelsen 1993 in total 100 kg n ha 1 were applied targeting a maize yield of 5 5 mg ha 1 bondesio et al 2006 the n was applied on three occasions per cropping period as an adaptation of the mozambican fertilisation regime for irrigated maize uda 1982 25 of total n as npk 12 24 12 uniformly spread along the rows and hoed into the soil shortly before sowing 37 5 as nq or ns manually embedded into the soil beside the growing plant at 5 cm depth between the sixth and seventh leaf vegetative growth stages v6 and v7 and 37 5 applied similarly at the tasselling growth stage vt 2 5 sampling measurements and calculations 2 5 1 soil moisture content soil water n and soil n concentration soil moisture content within the plots was monitored from sowing to harvest at depths of 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm using a pr2 profile probe delta t devices ltd cambridge uk in the centre of each plot pr2 readings were calibrated gravimetrically daily readings at each depth were taken in one access tube in the centre of each plot the soil water n distribution in the profile was monitored using ceramic suction cups samplers irrometer company inc usa installed at 30 60 and 90 cm depth in the centre of each plot soil water samples in suction cups were extracted after irrigation or rainfall events using a 4 mm syringe connected to the suction cups via flexible polyethylene tubing in cp cd prior to each first extraction of soil water i e 24 h after irrigation or rain a suction of 10 kpa i e a pressure of 10 kpa was initially applied to each suction cup just before the start of irrigation or during a rain event aiming to capture the fastest flowing water in the macropores and largest mesopores i e 0 03 mm equivalent pore diameter luxmoore 1981 after this first sample extraction at 10 kpa suction the suction was increased to 30 kpa for the next 36 h for a second soil water extraction aiming to capture the water mostly in mesopores 0 01 mm in cp hw sample collection was limited to application of 30 kpa suction before start of irrigation or during a rain event followed by sample extraction 36 h after suction application aiming to capture the water in macro and mesopores soil water samples were not obtained on all sampling occasions whenever found sample volume at each extraction occasion varied depending on soil moisture content but typically ranged between 5 and 50 ml soil water samples per depth extraction suction and treatment from two consecutive sampling occasions were mixed and frozen at 18 c in 50 ml polyethylene bottle flasks until analyses could be performed soil water samples were colorimetrically analysed for no3 n and nh4 n using a rqflex reflectometer merk millipore group germany the n content in the bulk soil i e in the particles and pores with their actual soil moisture content was determined in soil samples taken in the 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm layers using a hand driven auger in both cp cd and cp hw each composite sample per layer resulted from mixing eight sub samples spread in each plot taken prior to sowing at seven leaf growth stage v7 10 leaf stage v10 silking stage r1 and after physiological maturity r6 the mineral no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were determined by titration with 0 01 m hcl after one hour extraction from frozen 15 c samples with 2 m kcl and steam distillation as described by keeney and nelson 1982 this procedure was used in cp cd on the soil samples taken prior to sowing and after maturity and in cp hw on samples from all crop stages when freezing and thawing soil samples potential concentration changes might occur during thawing due to mineralisation however in the present study the period of extraction was kept less than two hours as recommended by esala 1996 in the following the bulk soil mineral n is referred to as soil no3 n and soil nh4 n to evaluate the seasonal cumulative n losses leaching volatilisation denitrification n immobilised in organic matter and nh4 n strongly fixed in clay from the soil profile 0 90 cm nloss the n balance was calculated from sowing to harvest in cp cd and cp hw the depth of 90 cm was set for calculation of nloss since earlier studies at the same site reported concentration of maize root density within the first 80 cm with roots rarely growing below this depth chilundo et al 2017 to calculate nloss kg ha 1 the mass balance approach adapted from sexton et al 1996 was used as follows 2 n l o s s n f e r t n m i n n i n i t i a l n i r r i n d e p n p l a n t n f i n a l where nfert is the n input from fertiliser

from atmospheric deposition nplant is the n uptake by the aboveground biomass including grain and nfinal is the mineral n present in the soil after harvesting 0 90 cm nmin was estimated according to dalgliesh and foale 2009 but given the differences in climate conditions soil organic matter content and the effect of temperature and soil moisture on organic matter mineralisation guntiñas et al 2012 different values were used for cp cd 22 5 kg n ha 1 and cp hw 40 kg n ha 1 nirri was obtained by multiplying the total amount of irrigation water applied by the mean n concentration in the irrigation water no3 n nh4 n in cp cd estimated as 3 5 if and 2 8 ir kg n ha 1 and in cp hw as 2 0 if and 1 6 ir kg n ha 1 ndep was estimated from nyaga et al 2013 as 4 8 kg n ha 1 year 1 for both cp cd and cp hw due to its low seasonal variation in the region and was adapted to match the length of the cropping period nplant was obtained from the n content in the dried aboveground biomass including grain at r6 stage based on kjeldahl n determination as described by westerhout and bovee 1985 the same procedure was used to determine grain kjeldahl n at harvest 2 5 2 soil water tension in the central block in order to complement the general water and n dynamics observations in the soil profile in the plots in all three replicate blocks water tension in the soil profile was monitored in the central replicate block during both cropping periods by means of tensiometers irrometer company inc usa three tensiometers at 30 60 and 90 cm depths were installed in the centre of each plot in the central block and readings of soil water tension were taken daily the data were used to determine the flow directions between 30 and 60 cm and between 60 and 90 cm depth on each measurement occasion with the latter used to assess the potential water and n flux directions to the zone below the roots i e below 80 cm depth the flow direction was estimated by calculating the hydraulic gradient δh δz m m 1 from the darcy equation as 3 δ h δ z h 1 h 2 z 1 z 2 g 1 g 2 z 1 z 2 where δh is the total head difference h1 h2 is the water pressure head tension difference and g1 g2 is gravitational head difference all three expressed over a specific flow path length δz z1 z2 a distinction was made between faster flux and slower or zero flux faster flux was considered to occur when soil water tension was below 20 kpa i e above 50 of the plant available water in the soil at the flux destination depth combined with a difference in total head between two consecutive depths slower or zero flux was considered to occur when soil water tension was equal to or above 20 kpa i e below 50 of the plant available water at the flux destination depth combined with a difference in total head between these two depths slower flux or when there was no difference in total head between these two depths regardless of soil water tension zero flux 2 6 statistical analyses the individual and

in bulk soil as well as between nloss on one side and days with faster downflow flux between 60 and 90 cm depth or plant n uptake on the other 3 results 3 1 general findings and experimental observations 3 1 1 water inputs and climate conditions the cold dry cp cd and hot wet cp hw cropping periods were characterised by contrasting rainfall regimes cp cd was drier overall with a total cumulative rainfall of 13 2 mm mainly observed in august 42 of total and september 54 while cp hw received 265 9 mm mainly in december 52 january 21 and february 24 as a result the total cumulative water inputs rainfall and irrigation were also different for cp cd and cp hw fig 1 as an example treatments dif and fif in cp cd received a total of 540 7 mm of which 97 from irrigation and only 3 from rainfall while the same treatments in cp hw received in total 505 6 mm of which 47 from irrigation and 53 from rainfall in cp hw rainfall events of 15 mm day 1 or higher were frequent and spread throughout the growing period overall lower mean air temperature was recorded in cp cd ranging from 14 to 29 c with a minimum of 1 8 c august and a maximum of 38 7 c september mean air temperature was slightly higher in cp hw ranging from 19 to 32 c with a minimum of 16 1 c february and a maximum of 40 8 c december even though the mean temperature was higher in cp hw than in cp cd the potential evapotranspiration was found to be comparable in both cropping periods ranging between 97 and 150 mm month 1 in cp cd and between 117 and 140 mm month 1 in cp hw 3 1 2 soil water no3 n at 10 and 30 kpa extraction in cp cd the soil water no3 n concentration extracted at 10 kpa suction at the three depths was found to be influenced by the interaction irrigation method irrigation level depth and irrigation level n fertiliser type depth table 1 accordingly dif treatments compared with other factor combinations resulted in lower mean no3 n concentration at the upper depth 30 cm while it was higher at lower depths 60 and 90 cm at 30 cm depth dif treatments resulted in 89 lower mean no3 n concentration than the highest in fir while at 90 cm depth dif had about 46 higher mean no3 n than the lowest in fir furthermore and regardless of irrigation method treatments with irnq or irns compared with ifnq or ifns generally resulted in higher mean no3 n concentrations at 30 and 60 cm depth however at 90 cm depth higher mean concentrations were found in ifnq and ifns treatments table 1 this distinct distribution of no3 n concentrations in dif treatments between upper and lower depths tended to be pronounced from 80 days after sowing das toward maturation since at early growth stages higher concentrations were found both at 30 and 60 cm depth in a majority of these treatments data not shown the soil water no3 n extracted at 30 kpa in cp cd showed to some extent similar variation in time fig 2 as that found for extraction at 10 kpa as supported by a strong positive linear correlation p 0 001 r 0 88 with close to unit slope 0 95 this was particularly evident regarding the influence of full irrigation level on no3 n depth distribution yet relatively small concentration differences were observed between consecutive observations treatments irns were overall found to be more favourable for the maintenance of high mean no3 n at the upper depths as a result the mean soil water no3 n concentration at 30 cm was 81 lower in ifns than in irns and at 60 cm it was 59 lower in ifnq than in irns treatments table 1 furthermore treatments firns and dirns had respectively 16 fold and three fold higher mean soil water no3 n at 30 cm than at 90 cm depth however treatments difns and difnq resulted respectively in two and four fold higher mean no3 n at 90 cm depth than at 30 cm in cp hw there was greater variation with time in soil water no3 n extracted at 30 kpa at almost all depths compared with that observed in cp cd extracted at 10 or 30 kpa figs 2 and 3 partly responding to the topdressing n applications as an example between 28 and 37 das at 30 cm depth fig 3 the no3 n increase ranged between two and 12 fold occurring mainly in f treatments responding to nq or ns treatments at 33 das in the same period at 90 cm depth a comparable no3 n increase ranging between 13 and 125 was observed in almost all treatments with the exception of treatment dirns these results indicate relatively fast downward movement of no3 n especially in f treatments however the effect of the second topdressing application at 53 das i e sampled at the assessment at 56 das did not yield comparable results as the first one at 33 das sampled at 37 das yet there were indications of no3 n increases at 60 and 90 cm in both f and d irrigated treatments as an example treatments firns and dirns resulted in higher mean no3 n at 30 cm than at 90 cm depth deriving from a significant effect of the interaction irrigation method irrigation level n fertiliser type depth table 1 in contrast at 90 cm depth the highest mean no3 n concentrations were found in treatments fifnq difnq difns and dirnq these values were two to seven fold higher at 90 cm depth than at 30 cm depth furthermore at 30 cm depth ifns treatments resulted in 85 lower mean no3 n than the highest at irns as supported by the interaction irrigation level x n fertiliser type x depth 3 1 3 soil water nh4 n at 30 kpa extraction the soil water nh4 n concentration in both cp cd and cp hw was distinctly lower than the soil water no3 n figs 4 and 5 although not pronounced nh4 n showed a trend for responding to topdressing n fertiliser applied at 48 and 75 das in cp cd and at 33 and 53 das in cp hw similarly to no3 n there was an overall tendency for depletion of soil water nh4 n at 30 cm depth with a subsequent increase at lower depths in both cps particularly at 90 cm depth as an example in cp cd between 57 and 68 das nh4 n increased at 90 cm depth in seven out of the eight treatments increase range between about two and five fold with larger increases in f treatments in cp hw the largest increases at 90 cm depth were observed between 37 and 46 das ranging between two and three fold in seven treatments here with the largest increases in d treatments furthermore in cp hw an additional increase in nh4 n at 90 cm depth was observed between 56 and 61 das also ranging between two and three fold once more being larger in d treatments altogether these pronounced increases in nh4 n concentration at 90 cm depth represent potential fast nh4 n downward movement in the soil profile overall the soil water nh4 n content in all treatments ranged from 0 1 to 2 5 mg l 1 in cp cd and from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l 1 in cp hw table 1 thus the mean profile nh4 n concentration in cp cd was 44 higher than in cp hw p 0 001 the interaction irrigation level n fertiliser and irrigation method irrigation level was found to influence the nh4 n distribution in cp cd while in cp hw the nh4 n distribution was determined by the interaction irrigation method irrigation level n fertiliser type depth table 1 3 1 4 soil no3 n and nh4 n soil no3 n and nh4 n in cp hw were characterised by large variations with time i e increases and decreases in the soil profile especially up to 81 das when the highest concentrations were observed however from 81 to 114 the period preceding physiological maturation to the period post harvest there was a fast variation in no3 n in almost all treatments resulting in a decrease in concentrations at all sampled depths while for nh4 n a similar decrease was mainly found in the 0 30 cm layer overall higher soil no3 n in the soil profile was found to be associated with fns treatments except toward maturation when higher no3 n was instead associated with dns regardless of irrigation level the significant interaction irrigation method fertiliser type at 31 and 81 das supported this table 2 as an example at 31 das fns treatments resulted in a two fold higher mean soil no3 n concentration in the entire profile than the lowest mean in fnq and dns treatments furthermore at 81 das fns treatments resulted in about two folds higher mean no3 n concentration than the mean lowest in dns and fnq treatments as observed for soil water nh4 n soil nh4 n also varied in the soil profile over time with large fluctuations to 81 das as an example from 1 to 52 das the mean soil nh4 n increase per layer was between one and five fold in the 0 30 cm layer between one and two fold in the 30 60 cm layer and between two and four fold in the 60 90 layer table 2 although no clear effect of the factors tested could be established there were indications of an influence of fif treatments on depth variation in nh4 n in the soil profile over time with a decrease in mean soil nh4 n in upper layers 0 30 and 30 60 cm and an increase in the lower layer 60 90 cm this was the case for the significant interaction irrigation method x irrigation level n fertiliser type depth at 81 das although not supported on other sampling occasions this indicated that in the top 0 30 cm layer potential losses of soil nh4 n to lower layers occurred mainly in treatments fifns fifnq and dirnq which resulted in 42 57 and 46 lower mean nh4 n respectively than the highest in treatment firnq for the bottom layer 60 90 cm the opposite was observed with higher mean nh4 n in treatment fifnq two and three fold higher than in treatments dirns and firnq respectively which had the lowest concentrations comparable observations were made for the interaction irrigation method irrigation level depth at 52 das which had a significant effect on nh4 n distribution thus in the 0 30 cm layer the fif treatments resulted in 35 lower nh4 n than the fir treatments which had the lowest concentration however in the 60 90 cm layer the fif treatments resulted in 105 higher nh4 n than in fir treatments thus indicating potential soil nh4 n redistribution to lower depths in the soil profile when f was combined with if the comparison between the soil no3 n before crop establishment 1 das and after harvesting 174 das in cp cd and 114 in cp hw revealed that in both cps there was a reduction in the concentration in the upper layer 0 30 cm for the majority of treatments 5 8 treatments in cp cd and 7 8 in cp hw and an increase in the lowest layer 60 90 cm 5 8 treatments in both cp cd and cp hw table 2 for cp hw in cp hw this process was associated with if application regardless of irrigation method and n fertiliser type however in cp cd data not shown a similar association could not be established for the soil nh4 n the results were different for cp cd and cp hw in cp cd there was an overall increase in soil nh4 n at all depths for 6 8 treatments in the 0 30 cm layer and 8 8 treatments in the 60 90 cm layer in cp hw a reduction in concentrations dominated in 8 8 treatments in the 0 30 cm layer and 5 8 in both the 30 60 and 60 90 cm layers the ir treatments in cp hw were associated with greater reductions in soil nh4 n in the upper layer while if resulted in the largest increases in lower layers similarly to soil no3 n in cp cd no pattern of individual or interaction effect of tested factors could be established between nh4 n before crop establishment and after harvesting 3 1 5 estimated n losses and residual soil no3 n the amount of n lost from the profile 0 90 cm nloss for all blocks in table 3 was estimated to be high when compared with the n supplied through fertilisation and it was negatively related to the n uptake by the aboveground biomass p 0 002 r 0 43 in the two cropping periods if treatments resulted in higher nloss than ir treatments particularly treatment difnq which resulted in mean nloss of 27 and 31 kg n ha 1 during cp cd and cp hw respectively these values were five fold and three fold higher than the lowest estimated in treatments dirns cp cd and firnq cp hw respectively in cp cd as expected the higher estimated nloss in difnq resulted in lower n uptake by aboveground biomass 102 kg n ha 1 the n content in the grain which is primarily a consequence of aboveground biomass n uptake ranged between 52 and 79 kg n ha 1 in cp cd and between 54 and 78 kg n ha 1 in cp hw thus in relation to aboveground biomass n uptake the redistribution of n to the grain ranged between 40 and 61 in cp cd and between 43 and 66 in cp hw the residual soil no3 n concentration after crop harvest rn which is potentially leachable n in the soil profile was found to be higher in cp cd than in cp hw in cp cd the highest rn was found in the 60 90 cm layer in treatment dirnq six fold higher than the lowest in the 30 60 cm layer also in treatment dirnq fig 6 furthermore in cp cd the application of ns was found to be associated with high rn concentrations in the 30 60 cm layer regardless of irrigation method and irrigation level with the exception of treatment fifnq which also had high rn in the 30 60 cm layer in cp hw no clear distinction was found between the effects of tested factors and rn in any layer however in the 0 30 cm layer the highest rn was found in two treatments receiving ns while in the 60 90 cm layer the highest concentrations were found in if irrigation level in three out of the four treatments showing the highest rn specifically treatment difns 10 5 mg kg 1 had the highest rn which was three fold higher than the lowest in treatment dirnq 3 5 mg kg 1 3 2 soil water dynamics in the central block 3 2 1 soil water tension variation in both cp cd and cp hw as expected soil water tension variations with time in the soil profile were inversely related to soil moisture contents in f treatments in cp cd the tension variation was slightly different from that in d figs 7 and 8 generally fif treatments resulted in tensions lower than 20 kpa up to 100 das followed by a gradual or fast increase towards crop maturation stage reaching values higher than 40 kpa on some occasions mainly after 125 das fig 7 fir treatments on the other hand were drier than fif with an early increase in tension at around 50 das at 30 cm depth and around 75 das at 60 and 90 cm depth in d treatments for example tension under dif treatments in cp cd was lower than 20 kpa throughout maize growth and thus near the soil field capacity whereas in dir treatments tension was on average lower than 20 kpa only for the first 50 75 das fig 8 as expected the fluctuations in tension were highest at 30 cm depth since it is the layer directly receiving the irrigation and rain water in f treatments in cp hw tension was generally found to be lower than 20 kpa at 90 cm depth during the entire cropping period fig 9 with the exception of treatment fifns which resulted in a gradual increase to 40 kpa between 50 and 100 das however at the upper two depths 30 and 60 cm low tension was only limited to the first 50 das with the exception of treatment firnq and fifnq at 60 cm depth where the moister conditions extended to 125 das in dif treatments however as in cp cd the tension was low 20 kpa throughout the maize growth period fig 10 yet with an increasing trend after 100 das especially at 30 cm depth dir treatments showed frequent tension fluctuations with an increasing trend during the cropping period mainly from 50 das overall the periods with lower soil water tension and consequently with higher soil moisture content matched the initial maize growth stages when crop water requirements were relatively small this represents potential periods for water and n flux to the zone below the roots 3 2 2 water flux direction and potential n flux the slower or zero flux i e the condition with minor or no water movement between two consecutive depths was predominant in ir treatments with the exception of treatment firnq in cp hw figs 11 and 12 upflow faster flux indicating upward water movement between 60 and 30 cm depth or 90 and 60 cm depth was mainly observed in dir and fir treatments in both cps especially from 90 to 60 cm depth downflow faster flux indicating downward water movement mainly occurred in treatments with relatively low soil water tension or higher soil moisture throughout the growth period in both cps hence treatments with full irrigation level i e fifnq fifns difnq and difns had more downflow than those with reduced irrigation i e firnq firns dirnq and dirns dif treatments in comparison with fif generally resulted in a larger number of days with downflow in both cps either from 30 to 60 cm 33 91 increase or from 60 to 90 cm 8 108 increase this represented treatments with higher risks of potential losses of water and n to the zone below the roots the latter being especially important between 60 and 90 cm in cp hw between 30 and 70 das the firnq treatment resulted in a larger number of days with downflow from 30 to 60 cm 56 91 and from 60 to 90 cm 116 131 as compared with dirnq no clear trends were visually found in the two cps regarding soil water nh4 n variation in the soil profile as affected by soil water tension variation figs 7 10 concerning soil water no3 n concentration in cp cd the values in the soil profile were found to be related to the flux pattern as an example in dif treatments no3 n above 20 mg l 1 was found at 90 cm depth between 60 and 100 das fig 8 similar patterns in increasing no3 n build up at 90 cm depth were observed in f treatments but without much distinction between if or ir irrigated treatments fig 7 in cp hw treatments firnq firns difns and dirnq had no3 n higher than 20 mg l 1 at 90 cm on some occasions with the exception of treatment dirnq these periods of high no3 n at 90 cm depth coincided with the occurrence of downflow faster flux from 60 to 90 cm depth thus representing a period of potential no3 n leaching i e potential loss of n to the zone below the roots estimates of n losses from the soil profile 0 90 cm depth nloss in the central block table 3 showed that in cp cd treatment firns resulted in relatively low nloss about 1 9 kg ha 1 followed by firnq and dirns with 2 5 and 4 3 kg ha 1 respectively in cp hw relatively higher nloss values were estimated even though low nloss values were still associated with ir treatments i e dirns 8 7 kg ha 1 and firns 8 2 kg ha 1 furthermore in cp hw the results suggested that the highest nloss was associated with ifnq treatments regardless of irrigation method while irns treatments resulted in the lowest nloss estimates in cp cd treatment fifnq in the central block showed the highest nloss value 31 8 kg ha 1 which was coupled with the third lowest aboveground biomass n uptake 109 2 kg n ha 1 and fourth lowest grain n uptake 75 2 kg n ha 1 in cp hw the highest nloss in the central block was in treatment difnq 34 2 kg n ha 1 with the second highest in treatment fifnq 31 3 kg n ha 1 the latter also showing the lowest aboveground biomass n uptake 67 4 kg n ha 1 and the lowest grain n uptake 50 8 kg n ha 1 furthermore a strong positive relationship was found between the estimated nloss in the central block and that obtained by averaging all three blocks p 0 003 r 0 88 thus allowing the generalisation of results obtained in the central block 4 discussion 4 1 nitrate distribution in the soil profile as the analyses of soil water no3 n extracted at 30 kpa in the suction cups table 1 and soil no3 n distribution showed table 2 no3 n was significantly influenced by the individual or interaction effect of irrigation method irrigation level and n fertiliser type a significant positive yet weak correlation between soil water no3 n and soil no3 n p 0 001 r 0 40 was obtained for soil water no3 n there was no seasonal difference i e between cp hw and cp cd p 0 775 altogether higher soil water and soil no3 n concentration with depth in the soil profile was to a large extent influenced by drip or furrow irrigation under full irrigation conditions with application of quick release n fertiliser while drip or furrow irrigation with reduced irrigation level and slow release n fertiliser created favourable conditions for maintenance of soil water or soil no3 n in top layers figs 2 and 3 in cp cd for example when only a total of 13 2 mm of rain was recorded and thus water inputs were mainly by irrigation mean soil water no3 n at 30 and 60 cm depth irrespective of irrigation method was higher in irns treatments than in ifnq or ifns whereas at 90 cm depth the opposite was observed table 1 when ifnq or ifns was combined with drip irrigation the higher irrigation frequency combined with the full irrigation level causing relatively low soil water tensions compared with furrow irrigation and reduced irrigation level fig 8 might have offered conditions for relatively fast transport of no3 n with the soil water flow to deeper soil layers deeper wetted zones under drip irrigation and thereby larger water and no3 n flow volumes to at least 60 cm depth have also been reported by sui et al 2015 for a silt loam soil increased losses of water and nutrients below the root zone under drip irrigation in comparison with furrow irrigation in loamy sandy soils are sparsely addressed in the literature thorburn et al 2000 generally the opposite is reported with drip irrigation largely reducing water and no3 n to the zone below the roots hassanli et al 2009 tagar et al 2012 however the wetting under drip irrigation may be greater than the active root zone when irrigation is applied more frequently and at higher volumes at each irrigation event thorburn et al 2000 this might have been the case for dif treatments in the present study i e 15 mm application when ifnq or ifns was combined with furrow irrigation the use of large irrigation volumes i e 22 5 or 30 mm may occasionally have increased the hydraulic gradient possibly resulting in relatively fast transport of water and n this might explain the higher no3 n concentrations observed at greater depths in furrow irrigated treatments fig 2 and 3 the fast water and solute flow under saturated and near saturated conditions in macro and mesopores with high pore continuity and low tortuosity like in many loamy sandy soils has been frequently addressed e g beven and germann 1982 shinomiya et al 2001 this may thus act as an important flow path for no3 n transport in the soil profile martin and nicholas 1999 in our study in cp cd soil water extracted at 10 kpa suction and in cp hw soil water extracted at 30 kpa suction the water and no3 n downward redistributions related to macro and mesopore flow were higher in the treatment combinations fif or dif table 1 furthermore soil macroporosity has been reported to be reduced under shallower and less dense maize root networks while increased in deeper and denser root networks helliwell 2011 as the roots at the experimental site of the present study were shallower in furrow than in drip treatments chilundo et al 2017 slower water and no3 n downward redistribution was thus expected to occur in fif treatments than in dif these findings were supported by the detailed water flux study in the central block where the lower soil water tension at full irrigation level figs 7 10 resulted in increased number of days with downflow i e days with faster downward water flux from 30 to 60 cm and from 60 to 90 cm depth in both cropping periods this was particularly the case in fif and dif treatments in cp cd and dif treatments in cp hw which had the largest number of days with downflow faster fluxes figs 11 and 12 the furrow or drip treatments with reduced irrigation level had a greater tendency to show slower or zero flux or even upward faster flux than furrow or drip treatments with full irrigation level from these observations in figs 2 3 11 and 12 it is apparent that in fir and dir treatments potential n redistribution to the zone below the roots would only be concentrated to the first 50 75 das in both cps mainly during the crop establishment period as also found by vázquez et al 2006 in dif and some fif treatments potential n leaching was spread throughout the cropping period in both cps figs 11 and 12 it may thus be appropriate to reduce the irrigation level as in the reduced irrigation level in the present study as a strategy to decrease the risk of n losses these results are similar to findings in drip irrigated maize on a silt loam where a reduction in irrigation level to at least 75 of full irrigation was reported to be a good strategy to reduce water fluxes to the zone below the roots darusman et al 1997 as shown in the results for both cps slow release n at shallower depths i e 30 and 60 cm resulted in higher soil water no3 n concentration extracted at 30 kpa suction than the same combination with quick release n table 1 however at 90 cm depth quick release n resulted in higher soil water no3 n than slow release n this was particularly evident in cp cd and suggests that slow release n reduced the no3 n downward movement in soil compared with quick release n thus lowering the risk of n leaching ning et al 2012 reported higher n concentrations in the 0 40 cm layer compared with deeper layers with application of coated urea and similar results have also been reported by rose et al 2016 therefore application of slow release n to reduce no3 n movement represents a potential fertilisation strategy in loamy sandy soils even though the total n leaching will continue to be governed by factors such as the solubility of the slow release n fertiliser the specific soil texture and the magnitude of water flux wang and alva 1996 as well as the microbial activity in the soil liu et al 2014 4 2 ammonium distribution in the soil profile as found for soil water no3 n and soil no3 n soil water nh4 n and soil nh4 n had a significant positive yet weak correlation p 0 001 r 0 41 higher soil water nh4 n concentration extracted at 30 kpa was found in cp cd than in cp hw figs 4 and 5 and table 1 this could be attributed to the relatively lower temperatures in cp cd absolute values ranging from 2 to 39 c cooler mean temperatures ranging from 14 to 29 c indicate that the nitrification process was possibly reduced especially in top layers thus favouring higher nh4 n values lees and quastel 1946 for example reported concentration of the nitrification process to near the soil surface with an accepted optimum at 35 c while its rate is reduced at around 20 c myers 1975 moreover the more variable soil moisture content found during the drying wetting cycles in the topsoil of furrow irrigation treatments compared with drip irrigation in the present study has been indicated to affect nitrifying bacteria activity aulakh et al 1996 and thus reduce nitrification thorburn et al 2003a thorburn et al 2003b this is another important influence possibly causing higher nh4 n in cp cd than in cp hw there was also general evidence in both cropping periods of some downward movement of nh4 n as observed from soil water and soil nh4 n values given the relatively large variation in nh4 n concentration in uppermost and lowermost layers with time figs 4 and 5 tables 1 and 2 part of this variation was possibly due to n uptake by the crop table 3 the generally accepted low nh4 n mobility in mineral soils omar et al 2015 was not verified in the loamy sandy soil at the present study site possibly due to its low organic matter content i e 0 1 2 1 and low cation exchange capacity i e 4 9 10 9 meq per 100 g which potentially brings about reduced nh4 n adsorption leaching losses of nh4 n have been reported under similar soil conditions as the present study especially when low adsorption capacity of the soil was combined with addition of nh4 n through fertilisers zarabi and jalali 2012 in addition the relatively fast increase in mean soil nh4 n concentration in the 60 90 cm layer observed in cp hw between 0 and 52 das and at 81 das in a majority of fif treatments table 2 supports the view of relatively fast movement of nh4 n in large pores mainly in furrow irrigation treatments a natural tendency for higher nh4 n in bottom layers than in upper layers due to increased nitrification rates in upper layers has also been reported ipni 2013 on a few occasions higher mean soil water nh4 n concentrations were observed at upper than lower soil depths table 1 this was the case in cp cd with higher soil water nh4 n concentrations at 30 cm than at 60 and 90 cm depths associated with full irrigation level and quick release n possibly due to considerably lower temperatures in cp cd the reduction in soil water nh4 n concentrations at the upper depth towards the end of cp cd when the mean temperatures increased together with the lack of similar behaviour in cp hw where temperature was overall high supported this view 4 3 nitrogen uptake potential nitrogen losses and residual nitrogen irrigation is known to increase maize n uptake including increased accumulation in grain and straw ning et al 2012 at the physiological maturity stage in cp hw the n accumulated in aboveground biomass was 26 higher in treatments with reduced irrigation level than in those with full irrigation level table 3 in cp cd a similar response was only found in quick release n treatments resulting in 7 17 higher aboveground biomass n uptake than in slow release treatments however the translocation of n from vegetative organs to grain was low overall and in cp hw drip irrigation resulted in 22 higher grain n uptake than in furrow irrigation the retention of n in vegetative organs as a result of low translocation from straw to the grain has been reported to be associated with excessive irrigation which increases plant n losses due to leaching or disruption of n translocation between anthesis and maturity growth stages xu et al 2005 this might have been the reason for the higher n uptake in reduced irrigation treatments than in full irrigation in the present study an effect that was more pronounced in cp hw due to frequent rainfall events fig 1 the potential nloss in the 0 90 cm soil profile was estimated to be high in all blocks generally with higher values in ifnq treatments than irns table 3 it is expected that n leaching to the zone below the roots will contribute with a large proportion to nloss as supported by earlier studies in a temperate semi arid silty loam wang and xing 2016b and in an alluvial loam cartagena et al 1995 furthermore the potential n leaching is likely to increase when n uptake by maize plants is relatively low given the negative yet weak correlation between n uptake and nloss p 0 002 r 0 44 close to significant or significant correlations were found between the number of days with potential faster downflow from 30 to 60 cm or 60 90 cm depth and nloss i e p 0 076 r 0 46 and p 0 072 r 0 46 respectively based on the above it was therefore shown that n leaching losses may occur at any growth stage during the cropping period although a larger proportion of n leaching losses can be expected to occur during the crop establishment stage singh and sekhon 1976 the residual soil mineral no3 n concentration rn represents an additional risk of n leaching losses from the system fig 6 especially during post harvest rainfall events arbat et al 2013 in the present study this may thus occur during the transition period between cp cd and cp hw or the period after cp hw when there is no rooting system established and the nitrification rate is high mean no3 n rn in cp cd ranged from 3 3 mg kg 1 dirnq 30 60 cm depth to 19 3 mg kg 1 dirnq 60 90 cm whereas it was lower in cp hw ranging from 2 2 mg kg 1 firns 0 30 cm to 10 6 mg kg 1 difns 60 90 cm thus in addition to the potential n leaching losses during the cropping periods the risk of n losses to the zone below the roots was also found to be high after cp cd due to relatively higher soil no3 n and nh4 n than in cp hw this is particularly important since the end of the cold dry season goes over into the rainy season which in turn keeps on until the start of the following cp hw however some of the rn might be available to crops in the following cropping period in the case of a transition period with few rainfall events with small amounts 5 conclusions it was generally found that the use of furrow irrigation f or drip irrigation d combined with full irrigation if resulted in maintenance of low soil water tensions 20 kpa and consequently higher soil moisture content in the soil profile than furrow or drip and reduced irrigation ir in both cold dry and hot wet cropping periods regardless of n fertiliser type potential faster downflow water flux to the zone below the roots occurred either at early crop development stages in furrow irrigation or throughout the cropping period in drip irrigation treatments especially when combined with full irrigation level in both cold dry and hot wet cropping periods the treatments fifnq and difnq resulted in the highest estimated nloss values from the 0 90 cm soil profile indicating the potential contribution of full irrigation treatments to the risk of higher nitrogen leaching to the zone below the roots to summarise the optimal management approach for the system studied would be to combine drip irrigation and reduced irrigation level to maintain good but not excessive soil moisture conditions in a larger portion of the root zone this would also reduce potential leaching losses of no3 n and nh4 n furthermore slow release n could be preferable to quick release n as it showed a longer residence time of no3 n in upper layers thus allowing better opportunities for no3 n to be taken up by the growing crop especially during the cold dry cropping period acknowledgements this work was

11567,increased use of irrigation on semi arid sandy soils requires optimisation of irrigation and fertilisation practices to reduce water and nitrogen n losses field experiments were conducted on a semi arid loamy sandy soil in two consecutive cropping periods one in a cold dry season cp cd and one in a hot wet season cp hw the effects of individual treatment factors and their interactions including two different irrigation methods furrow f or drip d two irrigation levels full if or reduced ir and two top dressing n fertiliser types quick nq or slow ns release on water and n distribution in the soil profile potential water fluxes to the zone below the roots and n losses from the 0 90 cm soil profile were studied the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in soil water from suction cups and soil from bulk soil samples tended to be higher at greater depth in the treatments with lower soil water tension resulting from the interactions between the factors f or d with if and nq most probably resulting from net downward redistribution of n the irns treatments resulted in longer soil water no3 n and nh4 n residence time at 30 and 60 cm depth and throughout the two cropping periods no3 n was higher in ns than in nq treatments potential faster downward water flux and thus water losses and the n leaching risk was concentrated to the first 50 75 days after sowing in fir and dir treatments while it was spread throughout the cropping periods in fif and dif hence treatments fifnq and difnq in both cp cd and cp hw resulted in the highest estimated n losses from the 0 90 cm soil profile based on these results a combination of d irrigation ir irrigation level and ns fertiliser type should preferably be applied to avoid the risk of excessive water losses downward n redistribution and subsequent leaching keywords ammonium leaching maize crop nitrate temporal variation water flux 1 introduction accurate knowledge of water and nitrogen n redistribution in soil is essential for proper design and management of irrigation and n fertiliser application options to safeguard sustainable farm practices wang and xing 2016a worldwide irrigated agriculture contributes 40 of the food produced wwap 2012 and it represents the major force controlling n dynamics in soil due to its impacts on the moisture content valé et al 2007 in the soil system n fertilisers are subjected to losses by a number of pathways of which leaching mainly in the form of nitrate no3 n hereafter no3 n is the most important therefore proper management of irrigation and n fertiliser applications is essential particularly in regions dominated by semi arid soils such as southern mozambique sandy soils generally have higher internal drainage with lower water holding capacity than finer textured soils mcneal et al 1995 when combined with excessive irrigation e g under traditional furrow irrigation this is likely to result in n losses with associated potential yield decreases and reduced water and nitrogen use efficiency rivera and boochs 2009 in general previous studies have indicated that n redistribution in the soil profile is intimately associated with the soil no3 n concentration and the amount of water lost through deep percolation tamini and mermoud 2002 gheysari et al 2009 jia et al 2014 ammonium n nh4 n hereafter nh4 n is another form of n potentially lost in coarse textured soils vitosh et al 1995 yet to a lower degree than no3 n according to deare et al 1995 nh4 n redistribution in the soil profile can be expected to be fast following urea fertilisation nevertheless a limited number of studies have assessed the downward movement of nh4 n in loamy sandy soils while most research focuses on no3 n thus water and n management practices require improvements to increase both no3 n and nh4 n residence time in the root zone and thereby increase their availability for crops various water and n fertiliser management practices have been suggested for sandy soils including surface drip irrigation darusman et al 1997 arbat et al 2013 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 application of slow or controlled release fertilisers noellsch et al 2009 guan et al 2014 multiple or split application of n fertiliser nakamura et al 2004 reduced irrigation and reduced n fertiliser level jia et al 2014 sui et al 2015 and a combination of organic and chemical fertilisers arbat et al 2013 omar et al 2015 irrigation management is of greater importance than fertilisers in reducing n losses and the use of drip irrigation has been shown to improve water and n use efficiency in maize production in the case of excessive water application however such as high rainfall events in combination with high n application has been associated with high no3 n losses due to maintenance of high soil moisture content arbat et al 2013 furthermore high frequency low volume irrigation e g drip irrigation has been shown in some studies to result in greater deep percolation losses than low frequency high volume irrigation e g furrow irrigation e g behera and panda 2009 in other studies drip irrigation has been found to be the best water application method for reducing water and n losses e g souza et al 2009 liu et al 2015 recognising the strong positive relationship between n leaching on one side and irrigation levels and n application rates on the other sui et al 2015 it has been suggested that for maize production it may be possible to reduce no3 n leaching from the root zone by split application of irrigation and n according to crop growth stage requirements jia et al 2014 the application of slow release n fertiliser e g poilyolefin resin coated urea and isobutylidene diurea to sandy soils potentially reduces n losses through leaching compared with quick release n fertiliser i e nh4no3 wang and alva 1996 furthermore improvements in n use efficiency of up to 27 compared with conventional n fertilisers have been reported when slow release n fertilisers are used in maize production in semi arid areas guan et al 2014 despite these advances there are persistent risks of increased downward redistribution of water and n resulting in deep percolation and leaching of nutrients beyond the root zone ajdary et al 2007 sui et al 2015 these risks require more research especially in cases where applied and percolating water exceeds the water holding capacity of the soil omar et al 2015 there is still limited information on the effects of different irrigation and n fertiliser strategies on the magnitude of water and n redistribution and accumulation in the soil profile barakat et al 2016 wang and xing 2016 especially for coarse textured soils sexton et al 1996 such information is essential to improve n budgets in different agro climate conditions the objective of the present study was to assess in a field experimental set up water and n redistribution including potential fluxes to the zone below the roots during two contrasting cropping periods cold dry and hot wet as affected by irrigation method irrigation level and n fertiliser type 2 material and methods 2 1 description of study area the field experiments used in the present study were the latter two of four consecutive trials conducted from 2012 to 2015 on the same field plots located at the faculty of agronomy and forestry engineering experimental station in sábie village southern mozambique 25 19 13 s 32 15 53 e 58 m above sea level results from two previous studies have been published in chilundo et al 2016 and chilundo et al 2017 the site is characterised by a tropical steppe climate corresponding to bsh in the köppen classification peel et al 2007 with two contrasting seasons a cold dry season from may to september and a hot wet season from october to april reddy 1984 mean annual temperature is 23 c with a mean minimum of 11 c in june and july and a mean maximum of 34 c in december and january with a range of 2 39 c cold dry season and of 9 44 c hot wet season mean annual rainfall is 580 mm and shows strong seasonal variation with about 12 in the cold dry season and 88 in the hot wet season reddy 1984 total annual potential evapotranspiration frequently exceeds 1500 mm with june and july having the lowest values approximately 100 mm reddy 1986 the soil in the area consists of deep stratified alluvial deposits with slope of 1 2 classified as eutric fluvisols fao soil classification inia 1990 before the establishment of trials plots soil samples collected throughout the experimental site 0 80 cm depth in four depth layers i e 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm indicated that soil texture ranged around the border between loamy sand and sandy loam furthermore the organic matter content ranged between 0 1 and 2 1 and cation exchange capacity between 4 9 and 10 9 meq per 100 g dry bulk density ranged between 1 2 and 1 4 g cm 3 in soil cores sampled in a pit 2 replicates per soil profile horizon i e 20 cm layers at the experimental site field capacity estimated from soil moisture observations in the experimental plots ranged between 17 and 23 v v and permanent wilting point between 4 and 6 v v before establishment of the cold dry period crop total soil no3 n ranged from 2 0 to 22 5 mg kg 1 and soil nh4 n ranged from 2 5 to 23 2 mg kg 1 in the central block used here for detailed studies of soil water flux direction the field capacity ranged between 17 and 24 v v and the permanent wilting point between 4 and 6 v v 2 2 experimental design and cultivation practices the field experiments included eight treatments resulting from combination of two irrigation methods two irrigation levels and two topdressing n fertiliser types arranged in a 2 2 2 factorial system in a randomised complete block design with three replicates blocks the three blocks were laid side by side and separated by a 2 m wide strip while a 1 m strip separated the individual plots within each block the size of each plot was 8 m 8 m the experiments in the present study were established and monitored during two cropping periods cp to match the two annual growing seasons one in the cold dry season may to september 2014 cp cd and one in the hot wet season november 2014 to february 2015 cp hw irrigation methods were furrow f and drip d irrigation levels were set to meet at least the crop water requirements if and reduced irrigation equalling 75 of if ir and the n fertiliser types were quick release nq and slow release ns the combined factors resulted in eight treatments assigned to each plot as follows fifnq fifns firnq firns difnq difns dirnq and dirns medium maturation maize hybrid pan67 which has a cycle of approximately 140 days to maturation in the cold dry season and 110 days in the hot wet season was planted manually in all plots on 10 may in cp cd and on 10 november in cp hw the spacing between plants was 30 cm with a final density of 41 600 plants ha 1 in all plots all plots were treated equally except for the management of irrigation and n fertiliser type conventional tillage using a disc plough to a working depth of 20 25 cm followed by disc harrowing was used for soil preparation before crop establishment in cp cd while before establishment in cp hw no soil preparation was done other than manual weeding pests were controlled by spraying chemicals according to recommendations by uda 1982 and weeds were controlled manually by hoeing 2 3 meteorological data and irrigation management meteorological data used for irrigation scheduling were collected from a station located 40 m from the experimental site rainfall was measured using an automated tipping bucket rain gauge model te525ws texas electronics inc usa potential evaporation used to estimate reference evapotranspiration was monitored manually using an andersson evaporimeter installed at 1 5 m height andersson 1969 volumetric flow meters were used to control the irrigation supply these were attached to flexible hoses for f treatments and installed on the irrigation manifold pipes for d treatments the d irrigation system consisted of low volume pressure compensating emitters spaced 30 cm apart along the line delivering a maximum discharge of 1 0 l h 1 at 1 bar operating pressure in order to start each of the cropping periods with similar soil moisture conditions 40 mm of water were applied as irrigation before sowing thoroughly wetting the soil to values close to or above field capacity in the upper 60 cm during the first 33 days after sowing in cp cd in order to stimulate uniform establishment of plants all plots were pre irrigated equally while in cp hw the pre irrigation was restricted to the first 15 days after sowing due to fast establishment of the plants thereafter the specific water level treatments if and ir were applied irrigation scheduling was established through a simplified water balance equation of allen et al 1998 by calculating the daily soil moisture depletion 1 swd i swd i 1 et c i i i p i where swdi is soil moisture depletion at the end of day i mm swdi 1 is soil moisture depletion at the end of the day before day i mm etc i is the crop evapotranspiration on day i mm calculated as the product of crop growth coefficient adapted from allen et al 1998 to local climate conditions and reference evapotranspiration ii is the applied irrigation level on day i mm and pi is the rainfall on day i mm the minimum value for swdi was zero i e when the root zone was at field capacity which was also the expected initial boundary condition following the irrigation events prior to sowing surface runoff and capillary rise were neglected due to the level to nearly level slope gradient in the area and the deep groundwater level 6 m within the f irrigated plots 30 mm of water were applied in the if treatments i e fifnq and fifns when swdi approached 30 mm while 22 5 mm were applied in ir i e firnq and firns the d irrigated plots under if i e difnq and difns received 15 mm water when swdi approached 15 mm while those under ir i e dirnq and dirns received 11 25 mm the irrigation frequency was thus higher in d treatments than in f treatments but in total treatments under a similar irrigation level if and ir respectively received equal amounts of water 2 4 fertiliser management two n fertiliser types were tested i quick release urea with 46 n nq a water soluble and readily available n source and ii organic complex coated slow release black urea with 46 n ns a low water soluble n source from which n release into the environment occurs at a slower rate than from common fertilisers shaviv and mikkelsen 1993 in total 100 kg n ha 1 were applied targeting a maize yield of 5 5 mg ha 1 bondesio et al 2006 the n was applied on three occasions per cropping period as an adaptation of the mozambican fertilisation regime for irrigated maize uda 1982 25 of total n as npk 12 24 12 uniformly spread along the rows and hoed into the soil shortly before sowing 37 5 as nq or ns manually embedded into the soil beside the growing plant at 5 cm depth between the sixth and seventh leaf vegetative growth stages v6 and v7 and 37 5 applied similarly at the tasselling growth stage vt 2 5 sampling measurements and calculations 2 5 1 soil moisture content soil water n and soil n concentration soil moisture content within the plots was monitored from sowing to harvest at depths of 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm using a pr2 profile probe delta t devices ltd cambridge uk in the centre of each plot pr2 readings were calibrated gravimetrically daily readings at each depth were taken in one access tube in the centre of each plot the soil water n distribution in the profile was monitored using ceramic suction cups samplers irrometer company inc usa installed at 30 60 and 90 cm depth in the centre of each plot soil water samples in suction cups were extracted after irrigation or rainfall events using a 4 mm syringe connected to the suction cups via flexible polyethylene tubing in cp cd prior to each first extraction of soil water i e 24 h after irrigation or rain a suction of 10 kpa i e a pressure of 10 kpa was initially applied to each suction cup just before the start of irrigation or during a rain event aiming to capture the fastest flowing water in the macropores and largest mesopores i e 0 03 mm equivalent pore diameter luxmoore 1981 after this first sample extraction at 10 kpa suction the suction was increased to 30 kpa for the next 36 h for a second soil water extraction aiming to capture the water mostly in mesopores 0 01 mm in cp hw sample collection was limited to application of 30 kpa suction before start of irrigation or during a rain event followed by sample extraction 36 h after suction application aiming to capture the water in macro and mesopores soil water samples were not obtained on all sampling occasions whenever found sample volume at each extraction occasion varied depending on soil moisture content but typically ranged between 5 and 50 ml soil water samples per depth extraction suction and treatment from two consecutive sampling occasions were mixed and frozen at 18 c in 50 ml polyethylene bottle flasks until analyses could be performed soil water samples were colorimetrically analysed for no3 n and nh4 n using a rqflex reflectometer merk millipore group germany the n content in the bulk soil i e in the particles and pores with their actual soil moisture content was determined in soil samples taken in the 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm layers using a hand driven auger in both cp cd and cp hw each composite sample per layer resulted from mixing eight sub samples spread in each plot taken prior to sowing at seven leaf growth stage v7 10 leaf stage v10 silking stage r1 and after physiological maturity r6 the mineral no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were determined by titration with 0 01 m hcl after one hour extraction from frozen 15 c samples with 2 m kcl and steam distillation as described by keeney and nelson 1982 this procedure was used in cp cd on the soil samples taken prior to sowing and after maturity and in cp hw on samples from all crop stages when freezing and thawing soil samples potential concentration changes might occur during thawing due to mineralisation however in the present study the period of extraction was kept less than two hours as recommended by esala 1996 in the following the bulk soil mineral n is referred to as soil no3 n and soil nh4 n to evaluate the seasonal cumulative n losses leaching volatilisation denitrification n immobilised in organic matter and nh4 n strongly fixed in clay from the soil profile 0 90 cm nloss the n balance was calculated from sowing to harvest in cp cd and cp hw the depth of 90 cm was set for calculation of nloss since earlier studies at the same site reported concentration of maize root density within the first 80 cm with roots rarely growing below this depth chilundo et al 2017 to calculate nloss kg ha 1 the mass balance approach adapted from sexton et al 1996 was used as follows 2 n l o s s n f e r t n m i n n i n i t i a l n i r r i n d e p n p l a n t n f i n a l where nfert is the n input from fertiliser nmin is the n input from mineralisation of organic matter ninitial is the mineral n no3 n nh4 n initially present in the soil 0 90 cm nirri is the n input from irrigation water ndep is the n input from atmospheric deposition nplant is the n uptake by the aboveground biomass including grain and nfinal is the mineral n present in the soil after harvesting 0 90 cm nmin was estimated according to dalgliesh and foale 2009 but given the differences in climate conditions soil organic matter content and the effect of temperature and soil moisture on organic matter mineralisation guntiñas et al 2012 different values were used for cp cd 22 5 kg n ha 1 and cp hw 40 kg n ha 1 nirri was obtained by multiplying the total amount of irrigation water applied by the mean n concentration in the irrigation water no3 n nh4 n in cp cd estimated as 3 5 if and 2 8 ir kg n ha 1 and in cp hw as 2 0 if and 1 6 ir kg n ha 1 ndep was estimated from nyaga et al 2013 as 4 8 kg n ha 1 year 1 for both cp cd and cp hw due to its low seasonal variation in the region and was adapted to match the length of the cropping period nplant was obtained from the n content in the dried aboveground biomass including grain at r6 stage based on kjeldahl n determination as described by westerhout and bovee 1985 the same procedure was used to determine grain kjeldahl n at harvest 2 5 2 soil water tension in the central block in order to complement the general water and n dynamics observations in the soil profile in the plots in all three replicate blocks water tension in the soil profile was monitored in the central replicate block during both cropping periods by means of tensiometers irrometer company inc usa three tensiometers at 30 60 and 90 cm depths were installed in the centre of each plot in the central block and readings of soil water tension were taken daily the data were used to determine the flow directions between 30 and 60 cm and between 60 and 90 cm depth on each measurement occasion with the latter used to assess the potential water and n flux directions to the zone below the roots i e below 80 cm depth the flow direction was estimated by calculating the hydraulic gradient δh δz m m 1 from the darcy equation as 3 δ h δ z h 1 h 2 z 1 z 2 g 1 g 2 z 1 z 2 where δh is the total head difference h1 h2 is the water pressure head tension difference and g1 g2 is gravitational head difference all three expressed over a specific flow path length δz z1 z2 a distinction was made between faster flux and slower or zero flux faster flux was considered to occur when soil water tension was below 20 kpa i e above 50 of the plant available water in the soil at the flux destination depth combined with a difference in total head between two consecutive depths slower or zero flux was considered to occur when soil water tension was equal to or above 20 kpa i e below 50 of the plant available water at the flux destination depth combined with a difference in total head between these two depths slower flux or when there was no difference in total head between these two depths regardless of soil water tension zero flux 2 6 statistical analyses the individual and interaction effects of factors on n distribution were compared by analysis of variance anova performed using minitab 17 2 1 statistical software minitab inc state college pa usa the general linear mixed model glmm procedure applied to a factorial design was used to assess the effects of the fixed factors irrigation method irrigation level n fertiliser type and depth their respective

test for pairwise mean comparisons differences were considered significant at probability p 0 05 pearson correlation analysis was applied to the relationship between no3 n or nh4 n in soil water and in bulk soil as well as between nloss on one side and days with faster downflow flux between 60 and 90 cm depth or plant n uptake on the other 3 results 3 1 general findings and experimental observations 3 1 1 water inputs and climate conditions the cold dry cp cd and hot wet cp hw cropping periods were characterised by contrasting rainfall regimes cp cd was drier overall with a total cumulative rainfall of 13 2 mm mainly observed in august 42 of total and september 54 while cp hw received 265 9 mm mainly in december 52 january 21 and february 24 as a result the total cumulative water inputs rainfall and irrigation were also different for cp cd and cp hw fig 1 as an example treatments dif and fif in cp cd received a total of 540 7 mm of which 97 from irrigation and only 3 from rainfall while the same treatments in cp hw received in total 505 6 mm of which 47 from irrigation and 53 from rainfall in cp hw rainfall events of 15 mm day 1 or higher were frequent and spread throughout the growing period overall lower mean air temperature was recorded in cp cd ranging from 14 to 29 c with a minimum of 1 8 c august and a maximum of 38 7 c september mean air temperature was slightly higher in cp hw ranging from 19 to 32 c with a minimum of 16 1 c february and a maximum of 40 8 c december even though the mean temperature was higher in cp hw than in cp cd the potential evapotranspiration was found to be comparable in both cropping periods ranging between 97 and 150 mm month 1 in cp cd and between 117 and 140 mm month 1 in cp hw 3 1 2 soil water no3 n at 10 and 30 kpa extraction in cp cd the soil water no3 n concentration extracted at 10 kpa suction at the three depths was found to be influenced by the interaction irrigation method irrigation level depth and irrigation level n fertiliser type depth table 1 accordingly dif treatments compared with other factor combinations resulted in lower mean no3 n concentration at the upper depth 30 cm while it was higher at lower depths 60 and 90 cm at 30 cm depth dif treatments resulted in 89 lower mean no3 n concentration than the highest in fir while at 90 cm depth dif had about 46 higher mean no3 n than the lowest in fir furthermore and regardless of irrigation method treatments with irnq or irns compared with ifnq or ifns generally resulted in higher mean no3 n concentrations at 30 and 60 cm depth however at 90 cm depth higher mean concentrations were found in ifnq and ifns treatments table 1 this distinct distribution of no3 n concentrations in dif treatments between upper and lower depths tended to be pronounced from 80 days after sowing das toward maturation since at early growth stages higher concentrations were found both at 30 and 60 cm depth in a majority of these treatments data not shown the soil water no3 n extracted at 30 kpa in cp cd showed to some extent similar variation in time fig 2 as that found for extraction at 10 kpa as supported by a strong positive linear correlation p 0 001 r 0 88 with close to unit slope 0 95 this was particularly evident regarding the influence of full irrigation level on no3 n depth distribution yet relatively small concentration differences were observed between consecutive observations treatments irns were overall found to be more favourable for the maintenance of high mean no3 n at the upper depths as a result the mean soil water no3 n concentration at 30 cm was 81 lower in ifns than in irns and at 60 cm it was 59 lower in ifnq than in irns treatments table 1 furthermore treatments firns and dirns had respectively 16 fold and three fold higher mean soil water no3 n at 30 cm than at 90 cm depth however treatments difns and difnq resulted respectively in two and four fold higher mean no3 n at 90 cm depth than at 30 cm in cp hw there was greater variation with time in soil water no3 n extracted at 30 kpa at almost all depths compared with that observed in cp cd extracted at 10 or 30 kpa figs 2 and 3 partly responding to the topdressing n applications as an example between 28 and 37 das at 30 cm depth fig 3 the no3 n increase ranged between two and 12 fold occurring mainly in f treatments responding to nq or ns treatments at 33 das in the same period at 90 cm depth a comparable no3 n increase ranging between 13 and 125 was observed in almost all treatments with the exception of treatment dirns these results indicate relatively fast downward movement of no3 n especially in f treatments however the effect of the second topdressing application at 53 das i e sampled at the assessment at 56 das did not yield comparable results as the first one at 33 das sampled at 37 das yet there were indications of no3 n increases at 60 and 90 cm in both f and d irrigated treatments as an example treatments firns and dirns resulted in higher mean no3 n at 30 cm than at 90 cm depth deriving from a significant effect of the interaction irrigation method irrigation level n fertiliser type depth table 1 in contrast at 90 cm depth the highest mean no3 n concentrations were found in treatments fifnq difnq difns and dirnq these values were two to seven fold higher at 90 cm depth than at 30 cm depth furthermore at 30 cm depth ifns treatments resulted in 85 lower mean no3 n than the highest at irns as supported by the interaction irrigation level x n fertiliser type x depth 3 1 3 soil water nh4 n at 30 kpa extraction the soil water nh4 n concentration in both cp cd and cp hw was distinctly lower than the soil water no3 n figs 4 and 5 although not pronounced nh4 n showed a trend for responding to topdressing n fertiliser applied at 48 and 75 das in cp cd and at 33 and 53 das in cp hw similarly to no3 n there was an overall tendency for depletion of soil water nh4 n at 30 cm depth with a subsequent increase at lower depths in both cps particularly at 90 cm depth as an example in cp cd between 57 and 68 das nh4 n increased at 90 cm depth in seven out of the eight treatments increase range between about two and five fold with larger increases in f treatments in cp hw the largest increases at 90 cm depth were observed between 37 and 46 das ranging between two and three fold in seven treatments here with the largest increases in d treatments furthermore in cp hw an additional increase in nh4 n at 90 cm depth was observed between 56 and 61 das also ranging between two and three fold once more being larger in d treatments altogether these pronounced increases in nh4 n concentration at 90 cm depth represent potential fast nh4 n downward movement in the soil profile overall the soil water nh4 n content in all treatments ranged from 0 1 to 2 5 mg l 1 in cp cd and from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l 1 in cp hw table 1 thus the mean profile nh4 n concentration in cp cd was 44 higher than in cp hw p 0 001 the interaction irrigation level n fertiliser and irrigation method irrigation level was found to influence the nh4 n distribution in cp cd while in cp hw the nh4 n distribution was determined by the interaction irrigation method irrigation level n fertiliser type depth table 1 3 1 4 soil no3 n and nh4 n soil no3 n and nh4 n in cp hw were characterised by large variations with time i e increases and decreases in the soil profile especially up to 81 das when the highest concentrations were observed however from 81 to 114 the period preceding physiological maturation to the period post harvest there was a fast variation in no3 n in almost all treatments resulting in a decrease in concentrations at all sampled depths while for nh4 n a similar decrease was mainly found in the 0 30 cm layer overall higher soil no3 n in the soil profile was found to be associated with fns treatments except toward maturation when higher no3 n was instead associated with dns regardless of irrigation level the significant interaction irrigation method fertiliser type at 31 and 81 das supported this table 2 as an example at 31 das fns treatments resulted in a two fold higher mean soil no3 n concentration in the entire profile than the lowest mean in fnq and dns treatments furthermore at 81 das fns treatments resulted in about two folds higher mean no3 n concentration than the mean lowest in dns and fnq treatments as observed for soil water nh4 n soil nh4 n also varied in the soil profile over time with large fluctuations to 81 das as an example from 1 to 52 das the mean soil nh4 n increase per layer was between one and five fold in the 0 30 cm layer between one and two fold in the 30 60 cm layer and between two and four fold in the 60 90 layer table 2 although no clear effect of the factors tested could be established there were indications of an influence of fif treatments on depth variation in nh4 n in the soil profile over time with a decrease in mean soil nh4 n in upper layers 0 30 and 30 60 cm and an increase in the lower layer 60 90 cm this was the case for the significant interaction irrigation method x irrigation level n fertiliser type depth at 81 das although not supported on other sampling occasions this indicated that in the top 0 30 cm layer potential losses of soil nh4 n to lower layers occurred mainly in treatments fifns fifnq and dirnq which resulted in 42 57 and 46 lower mean nh4 n respectively than the highest in treatment firnq for the bottom layer 60 90 cm the opposite was observed with higher mean nh4 n in treatment fifnq two and three fold higher than in treatments dirns and firnq respectively which had the lowest concentrations comparable observations were made for the interaction irrigation method irrigation level depth at 52 das which had a significant effect on nh4 n distribution thus in the 0 30 cm layer the fif treatments resulted in 35 lower nh4 n than the fir treatments which had the lowest concentration however in the 60 90 cm layer the fif treatments resulted in 105 higher nh4 n than in fir treatments thus indicating potential soil nh4 n redistribution to lower depths in the soil profile when f was combined with if the comparison between the soil no3 n before crop establishment 1 das and after harvesting 174 das in cp cd and 114 in cp hw revealed that in both cps there was a reduction in the concentration in the upper layer 0 30 cm for the majority of treatments 5 8 treatments in cp cd and 7 8 in cp hw and an increase in the lowest layer 60 90 cm 5 8 treatments in both cp cd and cp hw table 2 for cp hw in cp hw this process was associated with if application regardless of irrigation method and n fertiliser type however in cp cd data not shown a similar association could not be established for the soil nh4 n the results were different for cp cd and cp hw in cp cd there was an overall increase in soil nh4 n at all depths for 6 8 treatments in the 0 30 cm layer and 8 8 treatments in the 60 90 cm layer in cp hw a reduction in concentrations dominated in 8 8 treatments in the 0 30 cm layer and 5 8 in both the 30 60 and 60 90 cm layers the ir treatments in cp hw were associated with greater reductions in soil nh4 n in the upper layer while if resulted in the largest increases in lower layers similarly to soil no3 n in cp cd no pattern of individual or interaction effect of tested factors could be established between nh4 n before crop establishment and after harvesting 3 1 5 estimated n losses and residual soil no3 n the amount of n lost from the profile 0 90 cm nloss for all blocks in table 3 was estimated to be high when compared with the n supplied through fertilisation and it was negatively related to the n uptake by the aboveground biomass p 0 002 r 0 43 in the two cropping periods if treatments resulted in higher nloss than ir treatments particularly treatment difnq which resulted in mean nloss of 27 and 31 kg n ha 1 during cp cd and cp hw respectively these values were five fold and three fold higher than the lowest estimated in treatments dirns cp cd and firnq cp hw respectively in cp cd as expected the higher estimated nloss in difnq resulted in lower n uptake by aboveground biomass 102 kg n ha 1 the n content in the grain which is primarily a consequence of aboveground biomass n uptake ranged between 52 and 79 kg n ha 1 in cp cd and between 54 and 78 kg n ha 1 in cp hw thus in relation to aboveground biomass n uptake the redistribution of n to the grain ranged between 40 and 61 in cp cd and between 43 and 66 in cp hw the residual soil no3 n concentration after crop harvest rn which is potentially leachable n in the soil profile was found to be higher in cp cd than in cp hw in cp cd the highest rn was found in the 60 90 cm layer in treatment dirnq six fold higher than the lowest in the 30 60 cm layer also in treatment dirnq fig 6 furthermore in cp cd the application of ns was found to be associated with high rn concentrations in the 30 60 cm layer regardless of irrigation method and irrigation level with the exception of treatment fifnq which also had high rn in the 30 60 cm layer in cp hw no clear distinction was found between the effects of tested factors and rn in any layer however in the 0 30 cm layer the highest rn was found in two treatments receiving ns while in the 60 90 cm layer the highest concentrations were found in if irrigation level in three out of the four treatments showing the highest rn specifically treatment difns 10 5 mg kg 1 had the highest rn which was three fold higher than the lowest in treatment dirnq 3 5 mg kg 1 3 2 soil water dynamics in the central block 3 2 1 soil water tension variation in both cp cd and cp hw as expected soil water tension variations with time in the soil profile were inversely related to soil moisture contents in f treatments in cp cd the tension variation was slightly different from that in d figs 7 and 8 generally fif treatments resulted in tensions lower than 20 kpa up to 100 das followed by a gradual or fast increase towards crop maturation stage reaching values higher than 40 kpa on some occasions mainly after 125 das fig 7 fir treatments on the other hand were drier than fif with an early increase in tension at around 50 das at 30 cm depth and around 75 das at 60 and 90 cm depth in d treatments for example tension under dif treatments in cp cd was lower than 20 kpa throughout maize growth and thus near the soil field capacity whereas in dir treatments tension was on average lower than 20 kpa only for the first 50 75 das fig 8 as expected the fluctuations in tension were highest at 30 cm depth since it is the layer directly receiving the irrigation and rain water in f treatments in cp hw tension was generally found to be lower than 20 kpa at 90 cm depth during the entire cropping period fig 9 with the exception of treatment fifns which resulted in a gradual increase to 40 kpa between 50 and 100 das however at the upper two depths 30 and 60 cm low tension was only limited to the first 50 das with the exception of treatment firnq and fifnq at 60 cm depth where the moister conditions extended to 125 das in dif treatments however as in cp cd the tension was low 20 kpa throughout the maize growth period fig 10 yet with an increasing trend after 100 das especially at 30 cm depth dir treatments showed frequent tension fluctuations with an increasing trend during the cropping period mainly from 50 das overall the periods with lower soil water tension and consequently with higher soil moisture content matched the initial maize growth stages when crop water requirements were relatively small this represents potential periods for water and n flux to the zone below the roots 3 2 2 water flux direction and potential n flux the slower or zero flux i e the condition with minor or no water movement between two consecutive depths was predominant in ir treatments with the exception of treatment firnq in cp hw figs 11 and 12 upflow faster flux indicating upward water movement between 60 and 30 cm depth or 90 and 60 cm depth was mainly observed in dir and fir treatments in both cps especially from 90 to 60 cm depth downflow faster flux indicating downward water movement mainly occurred in treatments with relatively low soil water tension or higher soil moisture throughout the growth period in both cps hence treatments with full irrigation level i e fifnq fifns difnq and difns had more downflow than those with reduced irrigation i e firnq firns dirnq and dirns dif treatments in comparison with fif generally resulted in a larger number of days with downflow in both cps either from 30 to 60 cm 33 91 increase or from 60 to 90 cm 8 108 increase this represented treatments with higher risks of potential losses of water and n to the zone below the roots the latter being especially important between 60 and 90 cm in cp hw between 30 and 70 das the firnq treatment resulted in a larger number of days with downflow from 30 to 60 cm 56 91 and from 60 to 90 cm 116 131 as compared with dirnq no clear trends were visually found in the two cps regarding soil water nh4 n variation in the soil profile as affected by soil water tension variation figs 7 10 concerning soil water no3 n concentration in cp cd the values in the soil profile were found to be related to the flux pattern as an example in dif treatments no3 n above 20 mg l 1 was found at 90 cm depth between 60 and 100 das fig 8 similar patterns in increasing no3 n build up at 90 cm depth were observed in f treatments but without much distinction between if or ir irrigated treatments fig 7 in cp hw treatments firnq firns difns and dirnq had no3 n higher than 20 mg l 1 at 90 cm on some occasions with the exception of treatment dirnq these periods of high no3 n at 90 cm depth coincided with the occurrence of downflow faster flux from 60 to 90 cm depth thus representing a period of potential no3 n leaching i e potential loss of n to the zone below the roots estimates of n losses from the soil profile 0 90 cm depth nloss in the central block table 3 showed that in cp cd treatment firns resulted in relatively low nloss about 1 9 kg ha 1 followed by firnq and dirns with 2 5 and 4 3 kg ha 1 respectively in cp hw relatively higher nloss values were estimated even though low nloss values were still associated with ir treatments i e dirns 8 7 kg ha 1 and firns 8 2 kg ha 1 furthermore in cp hw the results suggested that the highest nloss was associated with ifnq treatments regardless of irrigation method while irns treatments resulted in the lowest nloss estimates in cp cd treatment fifnq in the central block showed the highest nloss value 31 8 kg ha 1 which was coupled with the third lowest aboveground biomass n uptake 109 2 kg n ha 1 and fourth lowest grain n uptake 75 2 kg n ha 1 in cp hw the highest nloss in the central block was in treatment difnq 34 2 kg n ha 1 with the second highest in treatment fifnq 31 3 kg n ha 1 the latter also showing the lowest aboveground biomass n uptake 67 4 kg n ha 1 and the lowest grain n uptake 50 8 kg n ha 1 furthermore a strong positive relationship was found between the estimated nloss in the central block and that obtained by averaging all three blocks p 0 003 r 0 88 thus allowing the generalisation of results obtained in the central block 4 discussion 4 1 nitrate distribution in the soil profile as the analyses of soil water no3 n extracted at 30 kpa in the suction cups table 1 and soil no3 n distribution showed table 2 no3 n was significantly influenced by the individual or interaction effect of irrigation method irrigation level and n fertiliser type a significant positive yet weak correlation between soil water no3 n and soil no3 n p 0 001 r 0 40 was obtained for soil water no3 n there was no seasonal difference i e between cp hw and cp cd p 0 775 altogether higher soil water and soil no3 n concentration with depth in the soil profile was to a large extent influenced by drip or furrow irrigation under full irrigation conditions with application of quick release n fertiliser while drip or furrow irrigation with reduced irrigation level and slow release n fertiliser created favourable conditions for maintenance of soil water or soil no3 n in top layers figs 2 and 3 in cp cd for example when only a total of 13 2 mm of rain was recorded and thus water inputs were mainly by irrigation mean soil water no3 n at 30 and 60 cm depth irrespective of irrigation method was higher in irns treatments than in ifnq or ifns whereas at 90 cm depth the opposite was observed table 1 when ifnq or ifns was combined with drip irrigation the higher irrigation frequency combined with the full irrigation level causing relatively low soil water tensions compared with furrow irrigation and reduced irrigation level fig 8 might have offered conditions for relatively fast transport of no3 n with the soil water flow to deeper soil layers deeper wetted zones under drip irrigation and thereby larger water and no3 n flow volumes to at least 60 cm depth have also been reported by sui et al 2015 for a silt loam soil increased losses of water and nutrients below the root zone under drip irrigation in comparison with furrow irrigation in loamy sandy soils are sparsely addressed in the literature thorburn et al 2000 generally the opposite is reported with drip irrigation largely reducing water and no3 n to the zone below the roots hassanli et al 2009 tagar et al 2012 however the wetting under drip irrigation may be greater than the active root zone when irrigation is applied more frequently and at higher volumes at each irrigation event thorburn et al 2000 this might have been the case for dif treatments in the present study i e 15 mm application when ifnq or ifns was combined with furrow irrigation the use of large irrigation volumes i e 22 5 or 30 mm may occasionally have increased the hydraulic gradient possibly resulting in relatively fast transport of water and n this might explain the higher no3 n concentrations observed at greater depths in furrow irrigated treatments fig 2 and 3 the fast water and solute flow under saturated and near saturated conditions in macro and mesopores with high pore continuity and low tortuosity like in many loamy sandy soils has been frequently addressed e g beven and germann 1982 shinomiya et al 2001 this may thus act as an important flow path for no3 n transport in the soil profile martin and nicholas 1999 in our study in cp cd soil water extracted at 10 kpa suction and in cp hw soil water extracted at 30 kpa suction the water and no3 n downward redistributions related to macro and mesopore flow were higher in the treatment combinations fif or dif table 1 furthermore soil macroporosity has been reported to be reduced under shallower and less dense maize root networks while increased in deeper and denser root networks helliwell 2011 as the roots at the experimental site of the present study were shallower in furrow than in drip treatments chilundo et al 2017 slower water and no3 n downward redistribution was thus expected to occur in fif treatments than in dif these findings were supported by the detailed water flux study in the central block where the lower soil water tension at full irrigation level figs 7 10 resulted in increased number of days with downflow i e days with faster downward water flux from 30 to 60 cm and from 60 to 90 cm depth in both cropping periods this was particularly the case in fif and dif treatments in cp cd and dif treatments in cp hw which had the largest number of days with downflow faster fluxes figs 11 and 12 the furrow or drip treatments with reduced irrigation level had a greater tendency to show slower or zero flux or even upward faster flux than furrow or drip treatments with full irrigation level from these observations in figs 2 3 11 and 12 it is apparent that in fir and dir treatments potential n redistribution to the zone below the roots would only be concentrated to the first 50 75 das in both cps mainly during the crop establishment period as also found by vázquez et al 2006 in dif and some fif treatments potential n leaching was spread throughout the cropping period in both cps figs 11 and 12 it may thus be appropriate to reduce the irrigation level as in the reduced irrigation level in the present study as a strategy to decrease the risk of n losses these results are similar to findings in drip irrigated maize on a silt loam where a reduction in irrigation level to at least 75 of full irrigation was reported to be a good strategy to reduce water fluxes to the zone below the roots darusman et al 1997 as shown in the results for both cps slow release n at shallower depths i e 30 and 60 cm resulted in higher soil water no3 n concentration extracted at 30 kpa suction than the same combination with quick release n table 1 however at 90 cm depth quick release n resulted in higher soil water no3 n than slow release n this was particularly evident in cp cd and suggests that slow release n reduced the no3 n downward movement in soil compared with quick release n thus lowering the risk of n leaching ning et al 2012 reported higher n concentrations in the 0 40 cm layer compared with deeper layers with application of coated urea and similar results have also been reported by rose et al 2016 therefore application of slow release n to reduce no3 n movement represents a potential fertilisation strategy in loamy sandy soils even though the total n leaching will continue to be governed by factors such as the solubility of the slow release n fertiliser the specific soil texture and the magnitude of water flux wang and alva 1996 as well as the microbial activity in the soil liu et al 2014 4 2 ammonium distribution in the soil profile as found for soil water no3 n and soil no3 n soil water nh4 n and soil nh4 n had a significant positive yet weak correlation p 0 001 r 0 41 higher soil water nh4 n concentration extracted at 30 kpa was found in cp cd than in cp hw figs 4 and 5 and table 1 this could be attributed to the relatively lower temperatures in cp cd absolute values ranging from 2 to 39 c cooler mean temperatures ranging from 14 to 29 c indicate that the nitrification process was possibly reduced especially in top layers thus favouring higher nh4 n values lees and quastel 1946 for example reported concentration of the nitrification process to near the soil surface with an accepted optimum at 35 c while its rate is reduced at around 20 c myers 1975 moreover the more variable soil moisture content found during the drying wetting cycles in the topsoil of furrow irrigation treatments compared with drip irrigation in the present study has been indicated to affect nitrifying bacteria activity aulakh et al 1996 and thus reduce nitrification thorburn et al 2003a thorburn et al 2003b this is another important influence possibly causing higher nh4 n in cp cd than in cp hw there was also general evidence in both cropping periods of some downward movement of nh4 n as observed from soil water and soil nh4 n values given the relatively large variation in nh4 n concentration in uppermost and lowermost layers with time figs 4 and 5 tables 1 and 2 part of this variation was possibly due to n uptake by the crop table 3 the generally accepted low nh4 n mobility in mineral soils omar et al 2015 was not verified in the loamy sandy soil at the present study site possibly due to its low organic matter content i e 0 1 2 1 and low cation exchange capacity i e 4 9 10 9 meq per 100 g which potentially brings about reduced nh4 n adsorption leaching losses of nh4 n have been reported under similar soil conditions as the present study especially when low adsorption capacity of the soil was combined with addition of nh4 n through fertilisers zarabi and jalali 2012 in addition the relatively fast increase in mean soil nh4 n concentration in the 60 90 cm layer observed in cp hw between 0 and 52 das and at 81 das in a majority of fif treatments table 2 supports the view of relatively fast movement of nh4 n in large pores mainly in furrow irrigation treatments a natural tendency for higher nh4 n in bottom layers than in upper layers due to increased nitrification rates in upper layers has also been reported ipni 2013 on a few occasions higher mean soil water nh4 n concentrations were observed at upper than lower soil depths table 1 this was the case in cp cd with higher soil water nh4 n concentrations at 30 cm than at 60 and 90 cm depths associated with full irrigation level and quick release n possibly due to considerably lower temperatures in cp cd the reduction in soil water nh4 n concentrations at the upper depth towards the end of cp cd when the mean temperatures increased together with the lack of similar behaviour in cp hw where temperature was overall high supported this view 4 3 nitrogen uptake potential nitrogen losses and residual nitrogen irrigation is known to increase maize n uptake including increased accumulation in grain and straw ning et al 2012 at the physiological maturity stage in cp hw the n accumulated in aboveground biomass was 26 higher in treatments with reduced irrigation level than in those with full irrigation level table 3 in cp cd a similar response was only found in quick release n treatments resulting in 7 17 higher aboveground biomass n uptake than in slow release treatments however the translocation of n from vegetative organs to grain was low overall and in cp hw drip irrigation resulted in 22 higher grain n uptake than in furrow irrigation the retention of n in vegetative organs as a result of low translocation from straw to the grain has been reported to be associated with excessive irrigation which increases plant n losses due to leaching or disruption of n translocation between anthesis and maturity growth stages xu et al 2005 this might have been the reason for the higher n uptake in reduced irrigation treatments than in full irrigation in the present study an effect that was more pronounced in cp hw due to frequent rainfall events fig 1 the potential nloss in the 0 90 cm soil profile was estimated to be high in all blocks generally with higher values in ifnq treatments than irns table 3 it is expected that n leaching to the zone below the roots will contribute with a large proportion to nloss as supported by earlier studies in a temperate semi arid silty loam wang and xing 2016b and in an alluvial loam cartagena et al 1995 furthermore the potential n leaching is likely to increase when n uptake by maize plants is relatively low given the negative yet weak correlation between n uptake and nloss p 0 002 r 0 44 close to significant or significant correlations were found between the number of days with potential faster downflow from 30 to 60 cm or 60 90 cm depth and nloss i e p 0 076 r 0 46 and p 0 072 r 0 46 respectively based on the above it was therefore shown that n leaching losses may occur at any growth stage during the cropping period although a larger proportion of n leaching losses can be expected to occur during the crop establishment stage singh and sekhon 1976 the residual soil mineral no3 n concentration rn represents an additional risk of n leaching losses from the system fig 6 especially during post harvest rainfall events arbat et al 2013 in the present study this may thus occur during the transition period between cp cd and cp hw or the period after cp hw when there is no rooting system established and the nitrification rate is high mean no3 n rn in cp cd ranged from 3 3 mg kg 1 dirnq 30 60 cm depth to 19 3 mg kg 1 dirnq 60 90 cm whereas it was lower in cp hw ranging from 2 2 mg kg 1 firns 0 30 cm to 10 6 mg kg 1 difns 60 90 cm thus in addition to the potential n leaching losses during the cropping periods the risk of n losses to the zone below the roots was also found to be high after cp cd due to relatively higher soil no3 n and nh4 n than in cp hw this is particularly important since the end of the cold dry season goes over into the rainy season which in turn keeps on until the start of the following cp hw however some of the rn might be available to crops in the following cropping period in the case of a transition period with few rainfall events with small amounts 5 conclusions it was generally found that the use of furrow irrigation f or drip irrigation d combined with full irrigation if resulted in maintenance of low soil water tensions 20 kpa and consequently higher soil moisture content in the soil profile than furrow or drip and reduced irrigation ir in both cold dry and hot wet cropping periods regardless of n fertiliser type potential faster downflow water flux to the zone below the roots occurred either at early crop development stages in furrow irrigation or throughout the cropping period in drip irrigation treatments especially when combined with full irrigation level in both cold dry and hot wet cropping periods the treatments fifnq and difnq resulted in the highest estimated nloss values from the 0 90 cm soil profile indicating the potential contribution of full irrigation treatments to the risk of higher nitrogen leaching to the zone below the roots to summarise the optimal management approach for the system studied would be to combine drip irrigation and reduced irrigation level to maintain good but not excessive soil moisture conditions in a larger portion of the root zone this would also reduce potential leaching losses of no3 n and nh4 n furthermore slow release n could be preferable to quick release n as it showed a longer residence time of no3 n in upper layers thus allowing better opportunities for no3 n to be taken up by the growing crop especially during the cold dry cropping period acknowledgements this work was

11568,considering ground water pumping restrictions and unpredictable amount of water available for irrigation from year to year nebraska panhandle producers are facing a challenge to reduce their irrigation water usage and practice deficit irrigation among irrigated crops in the region dry bean a major cash crop and critical to crop rotation systems has relatively low water use and is capable to withstand periods of stress consequently two experiments within six consecutive growing seasons 2010 2015 were conducted to determine the impacts of multiple irrigation scenarios full irrigation deficit irrigation and rainfed and two soil surface conditions bare soil versus crop residue on dry bean production irrigation water use efficiency and temporal soil water dynamic within the crop root zone dry bean yield ranged from 0 41 to 4 07 mg ha 1 during the six years of the study 2010 2015 the results 2012 2015 indicated that reducing irrigation water by 25 on average increased irrigation water use efficiency iwue by 26 and only caused 6 yield reduction in relative to the full irrigation treatment scenario however applying only 50 crop evapotranspiration requirement etc resulted in significant yield reduction 30 reduction on average in 5 out of 6 years compared to the full irrigation treatment p 0 05 our results indicate that temporal in season rainfall and etc demand variabilities along with the per season soil water content status should be carefully analyzed in order to target the appropriate growth stage s for more severe deficit irrigation scenarios when pre and early season rainfall was abundant deficit irrigation treatments imposed before flowering outperformed treatments targeting after flowering however under normal and dry conditions yield decline was more pronounced due to severe early season before flowering water stress compared to late season after flowering water stress in two of three years plots with bare soil significantly p 0 05 outyielded plots covered with residue average yield across irrigation treatments was 14 lower for plots with residue cover average yield 2 15 mg ha 1 compared to bare soil plots average yield 2 51 mg

seasons keywords groundwater decline nebraska panhandle sprinkler irrigation water production function 1 introduction water resources used for agriculture are becoming more restricted throughout the world and as a result the use of water for irrigated crop production must become more efficient across the us nebraska has the highest amount of irrigated land over 3 5 million ha wherein irrigated agriculture accounts for more than 90 of all groundwater consumption irmak et al 2010 usgs 2000 since available fresh water resources are limited irrigation water management has evolved into a top priority issue which is a critical element of the state s agricultural production and economy the panhandle district is the most diverse region in terms of nebraska s agriculture production areas consisting of almost 62 000 km2 of land area representing nearly 31 percent of nebraska there are more than 5900 farms in the district generating in excess of 2 35 billion of revenue the region is unlike any other in the state due to its high elevation low precipitation limited water resources and crops grown in the panhandle of nebraska irrigation plays an essential role in crop production since evapotranspiration et almost always exceeds precipitation the result being that both surface and groundwater are used to fulfill crop water requirements the surface irrigation network is supplied by snowpack that originates in the rocky mountains of colorado and wyoming groundwater management for irrigation and human use is controlled by the state s natural resource districts nrds many nrds have prescribed pumping limits for water applications and these limits are set in terms of an annual average pumping with no exceedance of a set value over three or five years the recent drought cycle from 2002 to 2009 triggered more water allocation restrictions thus pressuring farmers to enhance their irrigation water use efficiency iwue recent deficit irrigation studies conducted

magnitude of stress dry bean is capable to withstand without significant yield reduction and how deficit irrigation strategies impact iwue bourgault et al 2013 reported insignificant and significant yield reductions for moderate depletion fraction of 0 6 and severe depletion fraction of 0 7 stress levels respectively compared to recommended irrigation application depletion fraction of 0 45 allen

regulated deficit irrigation and alternate furrow irrigation on dry bean in uzbekistan and found reduction in crop consumptive water use for both strategies but observed no change in the wue of bean over several irrigation treatments because any water use reduction resulted in a corresponding yield reduction efetha et al 2011 noticed significant increase in average dry bean seed yield and in wue for higher frequently irrigated treatments compared to less frequently irrigated treatments therefore recommended keeping the majority of roots moist to optimize yield and wue efficient practicing of deficit irrigation depends on farmers knowledge about how much of a reduction in applied water can be tolerated and when that reduction can occur throughout the growing season simsek et al 2011 observed sensitivity of bean yield to the water stress was more pronounced in the vegetation stage from seed germination to beginning of flowering than reproductive stage from the first flowering to the end of harvesting over the course of a three year experiment conducted in southern turkey findings of efetha et al 2011 also showed dry bean to be more sensitive to drought during vegetative growth stages in addition it is critical to find the best agronomic practices to reduce evaporation from soil surface runoff and deep percolation hence maximizing readily available water for crop per unit of applied irrigation water the general belief is that planting directly into crop residue allows moisture retention at the soil surface for seedling development while preventing stand reduction due to wind and heavy rain damage a covered soil surface with residue is expected to have lower evaporation rate mainly because it gets protected from solar radiation and air movement above the soil surface is diminished this may have a positive impact on yield when deficit irrigation is practiced on the other hand crop residue may cause wet soil surface and lower temperature delaying planting date van donk et al 2010 baumhardt et al 2013a 2013b studied residue management effects on water use and yield of corn and cotton under deficit irrigation at bushland texas they reported higher corn and cotton yield with conservation tillage and attributed that to likely higher transpiration caused by lower early season evaporation van donk et al 2010 2012 reported higher corn and soybean yield

and the other half were left with a bare surface the plots were uniformly irrigated for germination and establishment of the wheat early in march of 2013 field moisture conditions were below standards so irrigation water was applied to sustain the wheat and support growth the bare plots were also irrigated at the same time and received same amount of water in the spring all of the plots were sprayed with glyphosate in order to kill any weeds in the bare plots and to kill the wheat in the residue plots after about 10 days the bean crop was planted in the entire study plots were harvested

irrigation treatments as well as seasonal irrigation and iwue data for both varieties during the three years of the first study 2010 2012 irrigation and variety had always significant impact on dry bean yield production p 0 05 while the interaction between irrigation and variety was only significant in 2010 dry bean yield ranged from 0 47 to 4 07 mg ha 1 the highest yield in 2010 and 2012 4 07 mg ha 1 and 2 95 mg ha 1 respectively belonged to the full irrigation treatment but in 2011 treatment 8 50 100 50 showed the highest amount of yield of 3 87 mg ha 1 applying 75 of the etc always produced lower yield compared to irrigation based on full etc yet the yield differences were never statistically significant p 0 05 imposing more stress on crop by further reducing the applied water to 50 and 25 of the etc resulted in significant yield reduction in two of three years p 0 05 among growth stage treatments i e treatments 5 8 no treatment consistently outperformed the others yet

the plant during vegetative and flowering stages treatment 6 50 50 100 in 2010 and 2011 growing seasons yet the opposite was observed in 2012 rainfed treatment always yielded significantly lower than the other treatments p 0 05 marquis variety had significantly better yield performance than mattherhorn variety in all three years p 0 05 the highest iwue was equal to 0 022 0 020 and 0 008 mg ha 1 mm 1 in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively overall the iwue increased as the amounts of irrigation water applied decreased from treatment 1 4 for the other treatments it was hard to identify a consistent trend in iwue values across the years overall iwue was lower in 2012 than in the other two years seasonal water production functions wpfs for 2010 2012 growing seasons were developed using second order polynomial regression models as shown in fig 2 the coefficient of determination r2 ranged from 0 53 to 0 91 year 2012 displayed a lower range of yield among years given the slope and curvature of wpfs there was a positive production response to irrigation across treatments in 2010 and this was also true for 2012 but less pronounced year 2011 however showed a different pattern such that wpf reached its maximum at irrigation levels of about 200 250 mm and started to decline for the higher irrigation values the highest difference between data points for the two varieties was observed in 2011 the standard deviation among replications bars in fig 2 was noticeably higher in 2011 and 2010 than in 2012 fig 3 depicts the temporal changes in the volumetric soil water content across the nine irrigation treatments table 2 throughout the deficit irrigation experiment 2010 2012 in 2010 the first and last irrigations were applied on 30 and 76 days after planting dap respectively a full soil profile was reflective of the moisture conditions at planting the first reading was done prior to the irrigation season dap 21 when there was no difference in soil water content among the treatments early in season dap 33 crop mostly used water from the top portion of the profile as season progressed crop also extracted water from deeper layers dap 44 dap 55 and dap 71 when gradually deviations in soil water contents started to appear among the irrigation treatments for instance in the fifth reading dap 71 while the pattern was very similar among all treatments there was a distinct reduction in available water content within the soil profile from full irrigation treatment to rainfed treatment in 2011 the soil water status was similar among treatments early season dap 24 and dap 39 first and last irrigation were applied on july 20 dap 30 and september 19 dap 91 respectively the soil water line in the upper portion of the root zone for the rainfed treatment started to deviate from the lines for the other treatments in mid season reading dap 51 and continued to show lower water contents and higher depletions within the root zone up to the last measurement dap 93 other deficit irrigation treatments also started to show deviations from the full irrigation treatment in different magnitudes in the late season readings a total of 22 irrigation events were applied in 2012 from dap 4 to dap 88 since it was an extremely dry and hot year the first two irrigations were uniformly applied across all treatments for good germination and stand establishment the very first reading was done before replanting when there was a uniform water distribution within the root zone yet substantially lower than the water content observed in the same time periods for 2010 and 2011 from the very first reading after replanting dap 18 rainfed treatment started to show fast water depletion at different depths within the profile these differences became more pronounced as the season progressed other treatments also showed gradual depletions of water at different depths and started to deviate from the water content line for the full irrigation treatment as early as second reading up to the last measurement 3 2 deficit irrigation crop residue experiment 2013 2015 cropping seasons table 4 summarizes the average dry bean yield response to irrigation treatments as well as seasonal irrigation and iwue data for the both varieties during the three years of the second study 2013 2015 from 2013 2015 irrigation and variety had always significant impact on dry bean yield production p 0 05 except for the variety in 2014 growing season the interaction between irrigation and variety was only significant in 2013 p 0 05 the impact of crop residue was significant in two of three years 2014 and 2015 p 0 05 the other interaction terms i e irrigation residue residue variety irrigation residue variety were not significant except for the irrigation residue in 2015 p 0 05 dry bean yield ranged from 0 41 to 3 84 mg ha 1 in 2013 3 26 mg ha 1 and 2014 3 84 mg ha 1 full irrigation treatment significantly improved yield over the other treatments but in 2015 treatment 5 50 100 showed slightly not statistically significant higher yield 3 79 mg ha 1 than the full irrigation 3 73 mg ha 1 reponses of dry bean to the other irrigation treatments were not consistent among years on average the after flowering stress treatments i e treatments 5 and 6 received higher seasonal irrigation but produced lower yield compared to the before flowering stress treatments treatments i e treatments 3 and 4 an exception occurred in 2015 when rainfall was abundant during pre and early season therefore the before flowering stress treatments not only significantly produced higher yield than the after flowering stress treatments but they also ranked high among all the irrigation treatments in terms of iwue in 2013 and 2014 treatment 4 75 25 showed highest iwue among the treatments yet produced significantly lower yield than the full irrigation treatment the rainfed treatment in all years yielded significantly lower than the other treatments p 0 05 marquis consistently produced significant higher yield p 0 05 than gn 3138 yet the mean iwue was very similar between the two varieties in years 2014 and 2015 residue caused statistically significant yield reduction however in 2013 yield was not statistically different between plots with and without residue covers the iwue was very similar between plots with and without reside covers in two of three years fig 4 illustrates seasonal wpfs for the deficit irrigation and surface residue experiment 2013 2015 the coefficient of determination r2 for seasonal wpfs ranged from 0 40 to 0 76 wpfs showed higher slope for the 2014 and 2015 data than for 2013 data the 2015 and 2013 had the highest minimum and lowest maximum yield respectively in 2013 wpfs for the plots with and without residue were almost identical however in 2014 and 2015 wpfs for the residue plots were positioned below wpfs of the bare soil indicating higher production for the bare soil plots over a wide range of the irrigation applications standard deviations among observations were higher in 2014 than for those in 2013 and 2015 fig 5 depicts the temporal changes in soil water status across irrigation and residue treatments in 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in 2013 the first and last irrigation were applied june 10 dap 6 and august 26 dap 83 respectively visual assessment of the soil moisture data indicates that among the treatments plots under the full irrigation and rainfed treatments showed the lowest and highest soil moisture depletions respectively all the other treatments treatments 2 3 4 5 and 6 showed an expected trend of profile depletion as season progressed where irrigation quantity was the major factor influencing the magnitude of soil moisture depletion it is challenging to recognize a consistent pattern of soil water dynamic due to different residue levels across the irrigation treatments in general however the first reading of bare plots and residue covered plots were similar while plots with residue showed slightly higher surface water contents mostly for early to mid season measurements in 2014 the first and last irrigation were applied 32 and 95 dap respectively treatments 4 75 25 and 7 rainfed showed higher changes in soil water status throughout the growing season fig 5 visual assessment compared to the other treatments while the full irrigation treatment showed lowest depletion in most cases plots under similar irrigation conditions but different residue levels either showed similar water content or random patterns treatment 4 75 25 resulted in higher water content for the surface layer of the residue covered plots towards end of the growing season when only 25 etc was applied the same trend but less pronounced was observed for treatment 2 50 50 and 7 rainfed while a general depletion in soil water content was noticeable at deepest measurement level 120 cm for the rainfed treatment at best it is challenging to precisely identify depth of root development across the irrigation treatments due to the limited number of measurements in each season in 2015 the first two readings were collected prior to irrigation season dap 37 and the last reading was made 3 days before the last irrigation event dap 89 the 2015 precipitation was higher than the long term average therefore soil water depletion patterns were somewhat similar across the irrigation treatments the initial soil water content was close to field capacity just one day after planting overall the residue level i e bare soil versus residue covered plots did not impact soil water status across irrigation treatments throughout the growing season 4 discussion 4 1 impact of deficit irrigation on dry bean production dry bean yield ranged from 0 41 to 4 07 mg ha 1 during the six years of our study spurgeon and yonts 2013 reported dry bean yield ranging from 1 44 to 3 63 mg ha 1 while their irrigation treatments varied from 50 to 125 of the etc requirement their study was conducted at the university of nebraska lincoln mitchell ag lab in scottsbluff which has similar climate as our study site a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system was used to irrigate plots hence their lower yield may be related to difficulties to bring water up to the surface and keep it in the top portion of the root zone with the sdi system and a very fine sandy loam soil ucar et al 2009 and ninou et al 2013 reported 2 43 mg ha 1 and 1 48 mg ha 1 of dry bean seed yield for full irrigation regimes in the semiarid mediterranean regions of turkey and greece respectively anderson et al 2003 reported 1 44 2 75 mg ha 1 yield for rainfed dry bean planted in the semiarid regions of the northern great plains the six year average yield for full irrigation treatment 3 56 mg ha 1 was higher than the reported yield by the aforementioned studies by ucar et al 2009 ninou et al 2013 and anderson et al 2003 the differences observed here can be attributed to soil type climate varietal distinctions and management practices among the studies ninou et al 2013 measured a variety of physiological characteristics of dry bean to understand crop response to water stress they observed higher yield under higher irrigation regimes compared to lower irrigation treatments due to a denser canopy with greater and more photosynthetically active foliage our results 2010 2012 indicated that reducing irrigation water by 25 etc had no significant p 0 05 impact on dry bean yield however when only 50 etc was applied in 5 out of 6 years yield reduction compared to the full irrigation treatment was statistically significant p 0 05 simsek et al 2011 recommend deficit irrigation at 25 deficit level at reproductive stage without a significant decrease in the yield while reporting excessive temperature as the dominant factor in causing flowering and fruit set reduction satriani et al 2015 observed no significant yield reduction for a 50 etc irrigation treatment using a surface drip irrigation system placed on the bean rows they attributed their result to low sensitivity of their local bean genotype to water stress we observed high variabilities in dry bean response to the deficit irrigation scenarios i e study 1 treatments 5 8 study 2 treatments 2 6 targeting different growth stages across the years our results indicate that changes in temporal in season rainfall and etc demand patterns across growing seasons fig 1 and table 1 impact how dry bean responds to levels of deficit irrigation at different growth stages which in turn affects the iwue of irrigation treatments for instance in 2011 and 2015 when pre and early season rainfall was abundant fig 1 and profile was full the before flowering deficit irrigation treatments outperformed the late season deficit irrigation treatments and yielded similar or higher iwue in addition this high pre and early season rainfall in 2011 and 2015 resulted in marketable yield and high iwue for both 50 etc and 25 etc irrigation scenarios a trend that was not observed in other growing seasons in our second study we observed more pronounced yield decline due to severe early season before flowering water stress compared to late season after flowering water stress simsek et al 2011 also suggested imposing no stress during vegetative stage because of the high sensitivity of the plant they observed at this growth stage limited plant root development early season causes rapid development of stress for plants under severe deficit irrigation treatments on the other hand plants under later season deficit irrigation treatment have likely deeper and better developed root systems allowing them to utilize water from deeper layers of soil and fulfill the crop water requirement when shallow roots might be impacted by lack of water efetha et al 2011 however expending more carbon storage to increase root biomass may have a negative impact on dry bean yield webber et al 2008 late season water cut back allows the crop to use stored water in the soil profile which will be likely refilled over the following winter another benefit of limited irrigation late in season is that it eliminates the risk of white mold growth a common pathogen of the dry bean crop efetha et al 2011 throughout our experiments there were few incidents of white mold growth however since we had selected varieties that were resistant and had a high level of tolerance to this pathaogen we attributed no yield losses to white mold we observed some differences in our seasonal wpfs across years which is mainly attributed to differences in in season weather conditions across years crop wpfs are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield reduction due to deficit irrigation wagner et al 2016 used stochastic crop wpfs to predict dry bean crop productivity on a regional scale under varying climatic conditions sayari et al 2015 investigated the impact of climate change on water production functions of multiple legumes including dry bean in northeastern iran promising results have been reported on using sophisticated data mining techniques to establish more robust wpfs e g haghverdi et al 2014 2016 we therefore recommend combining data collected from previous dry bean deficit irrigation studies in the region and developing wpfs using data mining techniques with additional input attributes e g detailed relative et or irrigation water requirement information across growth stages since growers in the region are currently allowed to maintain ownership of their water across growing seasons in a set time frame reducing the amount of water consumed by a bean crop will allow producers to use additional water for other crops within their rotation that require more water to attain optimum economical returns further studies are needed to explore utility of wpfs developed in this study in order to find optimum deficit irrigation strategies and cropping patterns in the panhandle region in terms of economic benefits a wide range of factors impacting gross margin should be considered including irrigation water price tag yield price and cultural production costs and in particular different climatic conditions because current climate change scenarios predict this region will have dryer summers warmer and wetter winters and overall greater climate variability 4 2 impact of crop residue on dry bean production planting directly in crop residue did not improve the dry bean yield in our study in fact in two of three years plots with bare soil significantly outyielded plots covered with residue p 0 05 we found no consistent trend of higher water content due to residue cover compared to bare soil plots across irrigation treatments throughout the growing seasons lascano et al 2015 reported similar results that use of terminated wheat residue did not benefit the water balance of irrigated cotton crop in texas and was associated with cotton lint yields reduction compared to conventionally tilled condition souza et al 2016 evaluated the performance of two tillage practices crop residues left on the soil versus incorporated in the soil on irrigated common bean and found no statistically significant difference in yield associated with crop residue plots with crop residue yielded 2 lower than bare soil plots a similar pattern was observed with soil moisture for both soil management practices which is in agreement with the soil moisture trend observed in our study for the bare soil versus residue covered plots reported results also show a positive impact of crop residue on yield components and wue for instance baumhardt et al 2013b observed increase in soil water storage during fallow as well as significant yield increases due to residue retaining conservation tillage van donk et al 2010 conducted a two year study to investigate the impact of residue on corn production and soil moisture conservation in central nebraska they reported significant higher yield in residue covered plots compared to bare soil plots unlike the study by van donk et al 2010 prior to each growing season we added the same amount of irrigation necessary to build residue to bare plots as well consequently the positive impact of crop residue in conserving surface soil moisture might have been cancelled out by the additional water stored in bare soil plots another possible explanation is occurrence of some unexpected pre season rainfall events which caused wet soil and a later than optimum glyphosate application resulting in taller than optimum residue we suspect this might have delayed the bean crop emergence and in some cases possibly hindered growth on plots covered with residue compared to bare soil plots which ultimately contributed to the relatively lower yield of residue covered plots we considered but decided against covering plots with dead residue mainly because we were concerned with the alternative residue being misplaced within the plots or even removed out of the experimental area due to high wind in the region especially in the spring in a sugar beet deficit irrigation study haghverdi et al 2017 we observed higher yield for residue covered plots than that for the bare soil plots the highest sugar beet yield increase due to residue cover occurred in 2012 an exceptionally dry year further investigation would be required to determine the impact of crop residue on soil water storage and dry bean yield in a year with below average in season precipitation and dry conditions 5 conclusion since most of central and western nebraska is semi arid arid and the pumping limits are less than crop water requirement without irrigation crop failure or significant yield reduction has a high probability the main challenge for growers in the nebraska panhandle region is how to maintain marketable yield quantity and quality when available water for irrigation is limited since dry bean requires less water compared to most irrigated crops grown in western nebraska it is often viewed as the ideal crop to grow when water supplies are limited the main aim of this research is to provide to the nebraska growers correct irrigation management guidelines to reduce water application without affecting yield the substantial temporal variation in growing season weather parameters over the course of the two experiments provided an excellent range of conditions from drought to above long term average rainfall for analyzing plant responses to irrigation and soil moisture depletion the results of this research indicate that applying 25 less water than full etc in normal and even dry years can still produce a marketable dry bean product with no significant yield reduction compared to full irrigation scenario while increasing iwue by 26 on average our results also showed that more intense deficit irrigation scenarios can be imposed without significant yield reduction in years with above average pre and in season precipitation however temporal variation in rainfall patterns and etc demands should be clearly monitored to avoid higher undesirable yield loss by targeting proper growth stages and identifying optimum deficit irrigation intensity planting directly in crop residue did not improve dry bean yield under deficit irrigation scenarios compared to bare soil plots under normal and wet weather patterns acknowledgment this study was partially funded by the nebraska dry bean commission authors would like to dedicate this article to the memory of dean yonts 
11568,considering ground water pumping restrictions and unpredictable amount of water available for irrigation from year to year nebraska panhandle producers are facing a challenge to reduce their irrigation water usage and practice deficit irrigation among irrigated crops in the region dry bean a major cash crop and critical to crop rotation systems has relatively low water use and is capable to withstand periods of stress consequently two experiments within six consecutive growing seasons 2010 2015 were conducted to determine the impacts of multiple irrigation scenarios full irrigation deficit irrigation and rainfed and two soil surface conditions bare soil versus crop residue on dry bean production irrigation water use efficiency and temporal soil water dynamic within the crop root zone dry bean yield ranged from 0 41 to 4 07 mg ha 1 during the six years of the study 2010 2015 the results 2012 2015 indicated that reducing irrigation water by 25 on average increased irrigation water use efficiency iwue by 26 and only caused 6 yield reduction in relative to the full irrigation treatment scenario however applying only 50 crop evapotranspiration requirement etc resulted in significant yield reduction 30 reduction on average in 5 out of 6 years compared to the full irrigation treatment p 0 05 our results indicate that temporal in season rainfall and etc demand variabilities along with the per season soil water content status should be carefully analyzed in order to target the appropriate growth stage s for more severe deficit irrigation scenarios when pre and early season rainfall was abundant deficit irrigation treatments imposed before flowering outperformed treatments targeting after flowering however under normal and dry conditions yield decline was more pronounced due to severe early season before flowering water stress compared to late season after flowering water stress in two of three years plots with bare soil significantly p 0 05 outyielded plots covered with residue average yield across irrigation treatments was 14 lower for plots with residue cover average yield 2 15 mg ha 1 compared to bare soil plots average yield 2 51 mg ha 1 overall the dynamic of soil water content within root zone and iwue in plots covered with residue was similar to that in bare soil plots across irrigation treatments throughout the growing seasons keywords groundwater decline nebraska panhandle sprinkler irrigation water production function 1 introduction water resources used for agriculture are becoming more restricted throughout the world and as a result the use of water for irrigated crop production must become more efficient across the us nebraska has the highest amount of irrigated land over 3 5 million ha wherein irrigated agriculture accounts for more than 90 of all groundwater consumption irmak et al 2010 usgs 2000 since available fresh water resources are limited irrigation water management has evolved into a top priority issue which is a critical element of the state s agricultural production and economy the panhandle district is the most diverse region in terms of nebraska s agriculture production areas consisting of almost 62 000 km2 of land area representing nearly 31 percent of nebraska there are more than 5900 farms in the district generating in excess of 2 35 billion of revenue the region is unlike any other in the state due to its high elevation low precipitation limited water resources and crops grown in the panhandle of nebraska irrigation plays an essential role in crop production since evapotranspiration et almost always exceeds precipitation the result being that both surface and groundwater are used to fulfill crop water requirements the surface irrigation network is supplied by snowpack that originates in the rocky mountains of colorado and wyoming groundwater management for irrigation and human use is controlled by the state s natural resource districts nrds many nrds have prescribed pumping limits for water applications and these limits are set in terms of an annual average pumping with no exceedance of a set value over three or five years the recent drought cycle from 2002 to 2009 triggered more water allocation restrictions thus pressuring farmers to enhance their irrigation water use efficiency iwue recent deficit irrigation studies conducted in the region on multiple crops including sugarbeet potato camelina and canola indicate promising results on conserving water yet producing marketable yield haghverdi et al 2017 pavlista 2015 pavlista et al 2016 hergert et al 2016 dry edible bean phaseolus vulgaris l is an important source of protein fiber and nutrition and has been playing a critical role in human diet for a long time currently dry bean is the largest pulse crop produced in the world approximately 25 million tons produced over 30 million hectares each year www faostat3 fao org in the united states dry beans are produced in more than 17 states which makes this country the sixth leading dry bean producer across the world with more than 5 of the total worldwide production one of the highest producing edible dry bean regions in the unites states is the central high plains i e colorado wyoming and nebraska that produces approximately 20 25 of the u s dry bean crop approximately 0 25 0 30 million tons production annually from 12 000 to 16 000 ha planted a majority of commercial land under dry beans 90 are irrigated in this region mainly by either center pivot or gravity systems the average yield produced under irrigation 2 mg ha 1 is 3 6 times higher than that of rainfed condition 0 28 0 56 mg ha 1 schwartz and brick 2015 several studies in the literature have reported yield reduction for bean due to increasing water deficits bourgault et al 2010 nielsen and nelson 1998 dapaah et al 2000 boutraa and sanders 2001 calvache and reichardt 1999 wakrim et al 2005 it is important to determine what magnitude of stress dry bean is capable to withstand without significant yield reduction and how deficit irrigation strategies impact iwue bourgault et al 2013 reported insignificant and significant yield reductions for moderate depletion fraction of 0 6 and severe depletion fraction of 0 7 stress levels respectively compared to recommended irrigation application depletion fraction of 0 45 allen et al 1998 in a long term simulation study de faria et al 1997 found out that maximum economic benefits are achieved when depletion fraction is below 0 4 webber et al 2006 2008 studied the impact of regulated deficit irrigation and alternate furrow irrigation on dry bean in uzbekistan and found reduction in crop consumptive water use for both strategies but observed no change in the wue of bean over several irrigation treatments because any water use reduction resulted in a corresponding yield reduction efetha et al 2011 noticed significant increase in average dry bean seed yield and in wue for higher frequently irrigated treatments compared to less frequently irrigated treatments therefore recommended keeping the majority of roots moist to optimize yield and wue efficient practicing of deficit irrigation depends on farmers knowledge about how much of a reduction in applied water can be tolerated and when that reduction can occur throughout the growing season simsek et al 2011 observed sensitivity of bean yield to the water stress was more pronounced in the vegetation stage from seed germination to beginning of flowering than reproductive stage from the first flowering to the end of harvesting over the course of a three year experiment conducted in southern turkey findings of efetha et al 2011 also showed dry bean to be more sensitive to drought during vegetative growth stages in addition it is critical to find the best agronomic practices to reduce evaporation from soil surface runoff and deep percolation hence maximizing readily available water for crop per unit of applied irrigation water the general belief is that planting directly into crop residue allows moisture retention at the soil surface for seedling development while preventing stand reduction due to wind and heavy rain damage a covered soil surface with residue is expected to have lower evaporation rate mainly because it gets protected from solar radiation and air movement above the soil surface is diminished this may have a positive impact on yield when deficit irrigation is practiced on the other hand crop residue may cause wet soil surface and lower temperature delaying planting date van donk et al 2010 baumhardt et al 2013a 2013b studied residue management effects on water use and yield of corn and cotton under deficit irrigation at bushland texas they reported higher corn

and the other half were left with a bare surface the plots were uniformly irrigated for germination and establishment of the wheat early in march of 2013 field moisture conditions were below standards so irrigation water was applied to sustain the wheat and support growth the bare plots were also irrigated at the same time and received same amount of water in the spring all of the plots were sprayed with glyphosate in order to kill any weeds in the bare plots and to kill the wheat in the residue plots after about 10 days the bean crop was planted in the entire study plots were harvested

irrigation treatments as well as seasonal irrigation and iwue data for both varieties during the three years of the first study 2010 2012 irrigation and variety had always significant impact on dry bean yield production p 0 05 while the interaction between irrigation and variety was only significant in 2010 dry bean yield ranged from 0 47 to 4 07 mg ha 1 the highest yield in 2010 and 2012 4 07 mg ha 1 and 2 95 mg ha 1 respectively belonged to the full irrigation treatment but in 2011 treatment 8 50 100 50 showed the highest amount of yield of 3 87 mg ha 1 applying 75 of the etc always produced lower yield compared to irrigation based on full etc yet the yield differences were never statistically significant p 0 05 imposing more stress on crop by further reducing the applied water to 50 and 25 of the etc resulted in significant yield reduction in two of three years p 0 05 among growth stage treatments i e treatments 5 8 no treatment consistently outperformed the others yet treatments which received lowest seasonal irrigation always yielded lower than the others stressing the plant after flowering and during pod filling treatment 7 100 50 50 yielded lower than stressing the plant during vegetative and flowering stages treatment 6 50 50 100 in 2010 and 2011 growing seasons yet the opposite was observed in 2012 rainfed treatment always yielded significantly lower than the other treatments p 0 05 marquis variety had significantly better yield performance than mattherhorn variety in all three years p 0 05 the highest iwue was equal to 0 022 0 020 and 0 008 mg ha 1 mm 1 in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively overall the iwue increased as the amounts of irrigation water applied decreased from treatment 1 4 for the other treatments it was hard to identify a consistent trend in iwue values across the years overall iwue was lower in 2012 than in the other two years seasonal water production functions wpfs for 2010 2012 growing seasons were developed using second order polynomial regression models as shown in fig 2 the coefficient of determination r2 ranged from 0 53 to 0 91 year 2012 displayed a lower range of yield among years given the slope and curvature of wpfs there was a positive production response to irrigation across treatments in 2010 and this was also true for 2012 but less pronounced year 2011 however showed a different pattern such that wpf reached its maximum at irrigation levels of about 200 250 mm and started to decline for the higher irrigation values the highest difference between data points for the two varieties was observed in 2011 the standard deviation among replications bars in fig 2 was noticeably higher in 2011 and 2010 than in 2012 fig 3 depicts the temporal changes in the volumetric soil water content across the nine irrigation treatments table 2 throughout the deficit irrigation experiment 2010 2012 in 2010 the first and last irrigations were applied on 30 and 76 days after planting dap respectively a full soil profile was reflective of the moisture conditions at planting the first reading was done prior to the irrigation season dap 21 when there was no difference in soil water content among the treatments early in season dap 33 crop mostly used water from the top portion of the profile as season progressed crop also extracted water from deeper layers dap 44 dap 55 and dap 71 when gradually deviations in soil water contents started to appear among the irrigation treatments for instance in the fifth reading dap 71 while the pattern was very similar among all treatments there was a distinct reduction in available water content within the soil profile from full irrigation treatment to rainfed treatment in 2011 the soil water status was similar among treatments early season dap 24 and dap 39 first and last irrigation were applied on july 20 dap 30 and september 19 dap 91 respectively the soil water line in the upper portion of the root zone for the rainfed treatment started to deviate from the lines for the other treatments in mid season reading dap 51 and continued to show lower water contents and higher depletions within the root zone up to the last measurement dap 93 other deficit irrigation treatments also started to show deviations from the full irrigation treatment in different magnitudes in the late season readings a total of 22 irrigation events were applied in 2012 from dap 4 to dap 88 since it was an extremely dry and hot year the first two irrigations were uniformly applied across all treatments for good germination and stand establishment the very first reading was done before replanting when there was a uniform water distribution within the root zone yet substantially lower than the water content observed in the same time periods for 2010 and 2011 from the very first reading after replanting dap 18 rainfed treatment started to show fast water depletion at different depths within the profile these differences became more pronounced as the season progressed other treatments also showed gradual depletions of water at different depths and started to deviate from the water content line for the full irrigation treatment as early as second reading up to the last measurement 3 2 deficit irrigation crop residue experiment 2013 2015 cropping seasons table 4 summarizes the average dry bean yield response to irrigation treatments as well as seasonal irrigation and iwue data for the both varieties during the three years of the second study 2013 2015 from 2013 2015 irrigation and variety had always significant impact on dry bean yield production p 0 05 except for the variety in 2014 growing season the interaction between irrigation and variety was only significant in 2013 p 0 05 the impact of crop residue was significant in two of three years 2014 and 2015 p 0 05 the other interaction terms i e irrigation residue residue variety irrigation residue variety were not significant except for the irrigation residue in 2015 p 0 05 dry bean yield ranged from 0 41 to 3 84 mg ha 1 in 2013 3 26 mg ha 1 and 2014 3 84 mg ha 1 full irrigation treatment significantly improved yield over the other treatments but in 2015 treatment 5 50 100 showed slightly not statistically significant higher yield 3 79 mg ha 1 than the full irrigation 3 73 mg ha 1 reponses of dry bean to the other irrigation treatments were not consistent among years on average the after flowering stress treatments i e treatments 5 and 6 received higher seasonal irrigation but produced lower yield compared to the before flowering stress treatments treatments i e treatments 3 and 4 an exception occurred in 2015 when rainfall was abundant during pre and early season therefore the before flowering stress treatments not only significantly produced higher yield than the after flowering stress treatments but they also ranked high among all the irrigation treatments in terms of iwue in 2013 and 2014 treatment 4 75 25 showed highest iwue among the treatments yet produced significantly lower yield than the full irrigation treatment the rainfed treatment in all years yielded significantly lower than the other treatments p 0 05 marquis consistently produced significant higher yield p 0 05 than gn 3138 yet the mean iwue was very similar between the two varieties in years 2014 and 2015 residue caused statistically significant yield reduction however in 2013 yield was not statistically different between plots with and without residue covers the iwue was very similar between plots with and without reside covers in two of three years fig 4 illustrates seasonal wpfs for the deficit irrigation and surface residue experiment 2013 2015 the coefficient of determination r2 for seasonal wpfs ranged from 0 40 to 0 76 wpfs showed higher slope for the 2014 and 2015 data than for 2013 data the 2015 and 2013 had the highest minimum and lowest maximum yield respectively in 2013 wpfs for the plots with and without residue were almost identical however in 2014 and 2015 wpfs for the residue plots were positioned below wpfs of the bare soil indicating higher production for the bare soil plots over a wide range of the irrigation applications standard deviations among observations were higher in 2014 than for those in 2013 and 2015 fig 5 depicts the temporal changes in soil water status across irrigation and residue treatments in 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons in 2013 the first and last irrigation were applied june 10 dap 6 and august 26 dap 83 respectively visual assessment of the soil moisture data indicates that among the treatments plots under the full irrigation and rainfed treatments showed the lowest and highest soil moisture depletions respectively all the other treatments treatments 2 3 4 5 and 6 showed an expected trend of profile depletion as season progressed where irrigation quantity was the major factor influencing the magnitude of soil moisture depletion it is challenging to recognize a consistent pattern of soil water dynamic due to different residue levels across the irrigation treatments in general however the first reading of bare plots and residue covered plots were similar while plots with residue showed slightly higher surface water contents mostly for early to mid season measurements in 2014 the first and last irrigation were applied 32 and 95 dap respectively treatments 4 75 25 and 7 rainfed showed higher changes in soil water status throughout the growing season fig 5 visual assessment compared to the other treatments while the full irrigation treatment showed lowest depletion in most cases plots under similar irrigation conditions but different residue levels either showed similar water content or random patterns treatment 4 75 25 resulted in higher water content for the surface layer of the residue covered plots towards end of the growing season when only 25 etc was applied the same trend but less pronounced was observed for treatment 2 50 50 and 7 rainfed while a general depletion in soil water content was noticeable at deepest measurement level 120 cm for the rainfed treatment at best it is challenging to precisely identify depth of root development across the irrigation treatments due to the limited number of measurements in each season in 2015 the first two readings were collected prior to irrigation season dap 37 and the last reading was made 3 days before the last irrigation event dap 89 the 2015 precipitation was higher than the long term average therefore soil water depletion patterns were somewhat similar across the irrigation treatments the initial soil water content was close to field capacity just one day after planting overall the residue level i e bare soil versus residue covered plots did not impact soil water status across irrigation treatments throughout the growing season 4 discussion 4 1 impact of deficit irrigation on dry bean production dry bean yield ranged from 0 41 to 4 07 mg ha 1 during the six years of our study spurgeon and yonts 2013 reported dry bean yield ranging from 1 44 to 3 63 mg ha 1 while their irrigation treatments varied from 50 to 125 of the etc requirement their study was conducted at the university of nebraska lincoln mitchell ag lab in scottsbluff which has similar climate as our study site a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system was used to irrigate plots hence their lower yield may be related to difficulties to bring water up to the surface and keep it in the top portion of the root zone with the sdi system and a very fine sandy loam soil ucar et al 2009 and ninou et al 2013 reported 2 43 mg ha 1 and 1 48 mg ha 1 of dry bean seed yield for full irrigation regimes in the semiarid mediterranean regions of turkey and greece respectively anderson et al 2003 reported 1 44 2 75 mg ha 1 yield for rainfed dry bean planted in the semiarid regions of the northern great plains the six year average yield for full irrigation treatment 3 56 mg ha 1 was higher than the reported yield by the aforementioned studies by ucar et al 2009 ninou et al 2013 and anderson et al 2003 the differences observed here can be attributed to soil type climate varietal distinctions and management practices among the studies ninou et al 2013 measured a variety of physiological characteristics of dry bean to understand crop response to water stress they observed higher yield under higher irrigation regimes compared to lower irrigation treatments due to a denser canopy with greater and more photosynthetically active foliage our results 2010 2012 indicated that reducing irrigation water by 25 etc had no significant p 0 05 impact on dry bean yield however when only 50 etc was applied in 5 out of 6 years yield reduction compared to the full irrigation treatment was statistically significant p 0 05 simsek et al 2011 recommend deficit irrigation at 25 deficit level at reproductive stage without a significant decrease in the yield while reporting excessive temperature as the dominant factor in causing flowering and fruit set reduction satriani et al 2015 observed no significant yield reduction for a 50 etc irrigation treatment using a surface drip irrigation system placed on the bean rows they attributed their result to low sensitivity of their local bean genotype to water stress we observed high variabilities in dry bean response to the deficit irrigation scenarios i e study 1 treatments 5 8 study 2 treatments 2 6 targeting different growth stages across the years our results indicate that changes in temporal in season rainfall and etc demand patterns across growing seasons fig 1 and table 1 impact how dry bean responds to levels of deficit irrigation at different growth stages which in turn affects the iwue of irrigation treatments for instance in 2011 and 2015 when pre and early season rainfall was abundant fig 1 and profile was full the before flowering deficit irrigation treatments outperformed the late season deficit irrigation treatments and yielded similar or higher iwue in addition this high pre and early season rainfall in 2011 and 2015 resulted in marketable yield and high iwue for both 50 etc and 25 etc irrigation scenarios a trend that was not observed in other growing seasons in our second study we observed more pronounced yield decline due to severe early season before flowering water stress compared to late season after flowering water stress simsek et al 2011 also suggested imposing no stress during vegetative stage because of the high sensitivity of the plant they observed at this growth stage limited plant root development early season causes rapid development of stress for plants under severe deficit irrigation treatments on the other hand plants under later season deficit irrigation treatment have likely deeper and better developed root systems allowing them to utilize water from deeper layers of soil and fulfill the crop water requirement when shallow roots might be impacted by lack of water efetha et al 2011 however expending more carbon storage to increase root biomass may have a negative impact on dry bean yield webber et al 2008 late season water cut back allows the crop to use stored water in the soil profile which will be likely refilled over the following winter another benefit of limited irrigation late in season is that it eliminates the risk of white mold growth a common pathogen of the dry bean crop efetha et al 2011 throughout our experiments there were few incidents of white mold growth however since we had selected varieties that were resistant and had a high level of tolerance to this pathaogen we attributed no yield losses to white mold we observed some differences in our seasonal wpfs across years which is mainly attributed to differences in in season weather conditions across years crop wpfs are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield reduction due to deficit irrigation wagner et al 2016 used stochastic crop wpfs to predict dry bean crop productivity on a regional scale under varying climatic conditions sayari et al 2015 investigated the impact of climate change on water production functions of multiple legumes including dry bean in northeastern iran promising results have been reported on using sophisticated data mining techniques to establish more robust wpfs e g haghverdi et al 2014 2016 we therefore recommend combining data collected from previous dry bean deficit irrigation studies in the region and developing wpfs using data mining techniques with additional input attributes e g detailed relative et or irrigation water requirement information across growth stages since growers in the region are currently allowed to maintain ownership of their water across growing seasons in a set time frame reducing the amount of water consumed by a bean crop will allow producers to use additional water for other crops within their rotation that require more water to attain optimum economical returns further studies are needed to explore utility of wpfs developed in this study in order to find optimum deficit irrigation strategies and cropping patterns in the panhandle region in terms of economic benefits a wide range of factors impacting gross margin should be considered including irrigation water price tag yield price and cultural production costs and in particular different climatic conditions because current climate change scenarios predict this region will have dryer summers warmer and wetter winters and overall greater climate variability 4 2 impact of crop residue on dry bean production planting directly in crop residue did not improve the dry bean yield in our study in fact in two of three years plots with bare soil significantly outyielded plots covered with residue p 0 05 we found no consistent trend of higher water content due to residue cover compared to bare soil plots across irrigation treatments throughout the growing seasons lascano et al 2015 reported similar results that use of terminated wheat residue did not benefit the water balance of irrigated cotton crop in texas and was associated with cotton lint yields reduction compared to conventionally tilled condition souza et al 2016 evaluated the performance of two tillage practices crop residues left on the soil versus incorporated in the soil on irrigated common bean and found no statistically significant difference in yield associated with crop residue plots with crop residue yielded 2 lower than bare soil plots a similar pattern was observed with soil moisture for both soil management practices which is in agreement with the soil moisture trend observed in our study for the bare soil versus residue covered plots reported results also show a positive impact of crop residue on yield components and wue for instance baumhardt et al 2013b observed increase in soil water storage during fallow as well as significant yield increases due to residue retaining conservation tillage van donk et al 2010 conducted a two year study to investigate the impact of residue on corn production and soil moisture conservation in central nebraska they reported significant higher yield in residue covered plots compared to bare soil plots unlike the study by van donk et al 2010 prior to each growing season we added the same amount of irrigation necessary to build residue to bare plots as well consequently the positive impact of crop residue in conserving surface soil moisture might have been cancelled out by the additional water stored in bare soil plots another possible explanation is occurrence of some unexpected pre season rainfall events which caused wet soil and a later than optimum glyphosate application resulting in taller than optimum residue we suspect this might have delayed the bean crop emergence and in some cases possibly hindered growth on plots covered with residue compared to bare soil plots which ultimately contributed to the relatively lower yield of residue covered plots we considered but decided against covering plots with dead residue mainly because we were concerned with the alternative residue being misplaced within the plots or even removed out of the experimental area due to high wind in the region especially in the spring in a sugar beet deficit irrigation study haghverdi et al 2017 we observed higher yield for residue covered plots than that for the bare soil plots the highest sugar beet yield increase due to residue cover occurred in 2012 an exceptionally dry year further investigation would be required to determine the impact of crop residue on soil water storage and dry bean yield in a year with below average in season precipitation and dry conditions 5 conclusion since most of central and western nebraska is semi arid arid and the pumping limits are less than crop water requirement without irrigation crop failure or significant yield reduction has a high probability the main challenge for growers in the nebraska panhandle region is how to maintain marketable yield quantity and quality when available water for irrigation is limited since dry bean requires less water compared to most irrigated crops grown in western nebraska it is often viewed as the ideal crop to grow when water supplies are limited the main aim of this research is to provide to the nebraska growers correct irrigation management guidelines to reduce water application without affecting yield the substantial temporal variation in growing season weather parameters over the course of the two experiments provided an excellent range of conditions from drought to above long term average rainfall for analyzing plant responses to irrigation and soil moisture depletion the results of this research indicate that applying 25 less water than full etc in normal and even dry years can still produce a marketable dry bean product with no significant yield reduction compared to full irrigation scenario while increasing iwue by 26 on average our results also showed that more intense deficit irrigation scenarios can be imposed without significant yield reduction in years with above average pre and in season precipitation however temporal variation in rainfall patterns and etc demands should be clearly monitored to avoid higher undesirable yield loss by targeting proper growth stages and identifying optimum deficit irrigation intensity planting directly in crop residue did not improve dry bean yield under deficit irrigation scenarios compared to bare soil plots under normal and wet weather patterns acknowledgment this study was partially funded by the nebraska dry bean commission authors would like to dedicate this article to the memory of dean yonts 
11569,a key guideline of the european water framework directive wfd asks to cover water costs in a way to encourage the efficient use of the resource therefore its protection but minimizing possible adverse environmental social and economic impacts of cost recovery we use a mathematical programming model of an italian mediterranean agricultural area where a reclamation and irrigation board rib manages collective irrigation facilities to simulate the impact of replacing the existing pricing system with several alternatives at different degrees of water cost recovery we estimate the water distribution cost wdc of the rib with a translog cost function and consider the cost incurred by the sardinian water agency enas for maintaining regional dams and primary water infrastructures we also consider that a regional subsidy pays part of the ribs and enas energy cost for water lifting and that enas rates are modulated among end users to reduce agricultural fee by increasing the charge on industrial uses we simulate the impact of alternative pricing under four scenarios of cost recovery i current partial recovery of wdc with no enas charge ii current recovery of wdc plus enas cost at modulated agricultural rates iii full coverage of wdc i e absence of the regional aid plus enas cost at modulated agricultural rates iv full coverage of wdc plus unmodulated enas rate solely changing the water pricing system at current cost recovery level generates limited total impacts but substantial income redistributive effects among farm types whose magnitude grows increasing the level of recovery the full cost recovery scenarios generate remarkable global impacts and drops of income in the single farm types particularly when applying enas undiscounted rate major consequences also emerge for the use of water and other productive factors and labour employment keywords water framework directive pricing irrigation water water distribution cost function mathematical programming 1 introduction one of the key guidelines of the water framework directive wfd is to combine economic principles and tools polluter pays and pricing to achieve environmental goals while ensuring full cost recovery fcr of water services and adequate incentives to efficiently use water european commission 2000 massarutto 2007 martin ortega et al 2015 the european guidance document on the directive précises how to plan and organise the economic analysis in implementing the water policy wateco 2003 besides article 9 of wfd recognizes that applying efficient water pricing may raise social and redistributive concerns and establishes that member states may consider social environmental impacts and economic in planning the mode and level of cost recovery this aspect is important on it reynaud 2016 shows that increasing water payments for domestic use could mainly affect the most vulnerable social groups from the agricultural perspective venot and molle 2008 stresses that raising taxes on the water taken from farms wells does not involve significant savings of that resource and can further reduce the profitability of extensive crops or low income in the case of irrigation water supplied by collective facilities dono et al 2010 stress that if the latter are underused fcr rates could be based on average costs that are much higher than the marginal costs uncontrolled extractions of groundwater may result where this resource is available or negative impacts on incomes where not definitely pursuing fcr by increasing water payments might generate a vicious circle favouring the use of sources difficult to protect appreciably affecting low income users and reducing the use of collective services azevedo and baltar 2005 reynaud 2016 according to a recent report of the european commission not all member states apply transparent water pricing and greece and italy are particularly lagging behind in adapting european commission 2015 1 1 a key factor of delay is considered the lack of adequate metering systems a precondition to present users the water costs a solicitation arises for many national and local water authorities to recover the delay our analysis takes its cue from this commitment and assesses the possible impact of various pricing methods in an irrigated mediterranean area of sardinia italy where a reclamation and irrigation board rib distributes water to farms 2 2 the ribs are non profit landowners associations with legal status our goal is twofold first assess the impact of replacing the current pricing with alternative systems including volumetric often regarded as the most effective in promoting efficient use of water second evaluate the effect of including all the costs of water in the irrigation rates and indirectly assess the choice of regional authorities to limit this transfer to farms the next section background illustrates aspects of the scientific debate that are relevant to our study section materials and methods describes the study area the approach for assessing the impacts of water pricing and cost recovery with simulated pricing systems and the estimation of water costs the results section reports the economic and some environmental and social impacts of the simulations the discussion section assesses the impacts of the pricing systems and the conclusions follow 2 background 2 1 scientific debate on water framework directive several aspects of the scientific debate on wfd are relevant to our study a first issue is identification of the costs to be recovered in agriculture garrido and calatrava 2010 classify monetary costs in three categories the irrigator pays private costs as any other farming cost such as energy maintenance and labour the pricing and water allocation policies can have major impacts on them leading to change the source of supply for example encouraging use of groundwater or the adopted irrigation technologies another category is the costs of the irrigation district or scheme for the management and maintenance of water distribution systems to individual farms ribs manage most of the italian schemes and about 63 of irrigation water bellini 2014 and charge specific tariffs to farmers inea 2011 project capital costs are publicly funded finally the water authority costs pertain to governmental agencies that manage large dams and infrastructures debiting related costs to end users and taxpayers and it is interesting to examine the distribution between the two groups garrido and calatrava 2010 complex and site specific analyses are required to estimate and include in the fcr environmental and resource costs the former consist of non use values associated with obtaining a healthy functioning of aquatic ecosystems and use values of water environment drafting group eco2 2004 resource costs arise when alternative uses of the water generate higher economic value than present use or foreseen future because of an inefficient water allocation or pollution over time and across users eea 2013 several authors agree that applying fcr would increase the water users payments mainly to agriculture that currently pays part of the financial costs berbel and gomez limon 2000 massarutto 2007 berbel et al 2011 giannakis et al 2016 according to eea 2013 volumetric water tariffs of italian agriculture are in the range of 0 04 0 25 m3 3 3 arcadis 2012 report 0 03 0 07 m3 as the prevalent range for volumetric pricing in southern italy over 0 002 0 70 m3 in a selected group of european countries flat rates are in the range of 30 150 ha over 30 210 ha for those same countries arcadis 2012 estimate that those charges generate a 50 financial cost recovery rate as average of 50 80 in the north and 20 30 in southern italy massarutto 2003 mentions analogous levels of partial recovery of the total cost he also highlights the complexity of this computation warning that in many facilities the final cost value depends on the joint use in multiple uses as the hydropower generation in northern italy and public water supply companies in south 4 4 depreciation and capital cost depend on accounting practices on allocation of assets ownership and economic risk among operators users and public authorities and among types of uses for multipurpose water systems eea 2013 the author also reports that operation and maintenance costs are recovered at 70 100 in northern italy and 20 100 in the south related to fcr another relevant issue concerns the pricing system that can encourage efficient use of water volumetric is considered as the most suitable pricing for achieving the wfd objectives gómez limón and riesgo 2004 bartolini et al 2007 gallego ayala 2012 yet many constraints are found to possibly hinder the reaching of efficiency in irrigation water johansson et al 2002 massarutto 2007 stresses that recovery should only consider costs incurred by an efficient service supplier that pays all inputs at their marginal cost mc furthermore dono et al 2013 highlight that mc pricing may not allow fcr when average costs ac are decreasing as in large canal schemes being mc lower than ac other factors such as scarcity due to climate change may reduce the use of water at levels where mc of running collective facilities is below ac in conditions of structurally decreasing irrigation ac or under utilized irrigation schemes fcr pricing would charge farmers for inefficient levels of use that do not depend on their choices finally and key for this paper wfd provides that member states may balance negative effects of fcr on social environmental and economic issues other objectives of national policies can be reconciled in wfd as adequacy of revenues from water services equity and flexibility environmental protection administrative simplicity and transparency garcia and reynaud 2004 reynaud 2016 cooper et al 2014 point out that these objectives might be in conflict with each other 5 5 achieve economic efficiency may conflict with ensure adequacy of revenues both may conflict with reaching of equity and is likely hard to reconcile all in a single policy dono et al 2010 stress that fcr of water services achieved by increasing payments could hinder water protection encouraging farmers to use alternative sources as groundwater or rivers according to reynaud 2016 the implementation of fcr would result in major changes in water use of households in italy among other countries as well as in accessibility issues since not italian families in the lowest income decile will have to devote major shares of their income to pay the new water bills and wastewater moreover inconsistent aspects are present garrido and llamas 2009 point out that specify the resource cost would require functioning water markets yet if this trade becomes a usual practice there will be no need to integrate the resource element in the water costs in any case according to howarth 2009 a critical aspect is that wfd and the documents on its application are vague in defining the criteria to assess these issues gómez limón and martin ortega 2013 stress that the vagueness of article 9 can also lead to conclude that it is not required to apply increases in water tariffs also because of this vagueness many river basin plans are mainly descriptive and devoid of prospective analysis hence it would be useful strengthening their economic section to avoid that their choices appear arbitrary in tempering the social impact of fcr and in protecting environmental quality 2 2 water framework directive and mathematical programming models we evaluate the impact of reforming water pricing with a mathematical programming model mpm of our study area bazzani et al 2005 use a multi criteria mpm to conclude that wfd would reduce only slightly agricultural water use and would mainly reduce farm income and labour employment even if differently among farm types mejias et al 2004 use a stochastic mpm to show that pricing would be even less effective in reducing farming use in the years of increased water scarcity instead integrating objectives of wdf and cap would increase the efficiency of water allocation riesgo and gómez limón 2006 and bartolini et al 2007 use a mpm respectively with linear and multi attribute utility to conclude that agricultural policies are pre eminent on the recovery partial and complete of the irrigation water costs they also conclude that it is useful to maintain low water prices to achieve the environmental objectives of wf semaan et al 2007 integrate the results of the epic crop model in a mpm to conclude that water pricing is ineffective in reducing nitrate leaching it is also socially resisted because as the taxes on nitrogen fertilizer charges farmers the cost of nitrate leaching reduction garrido and calatrava 2010 stress that mpms overvalue the economic impacts of pricing policies and undervalues water demand elasticity because of its short medium term perspective besides neglecting the uncertainties involved in farming stochastic programming models may help in representing the effect of various types of risk or uncertainty on the agricultural water demand hardaker et al 2004 garrido and calatrava 2010 quiggin et al 2010 use discrete stochastic programming dsp to evidence the long run role of water reallocation in limiting the adverse impacts of cc and claim for global adaptation policies and pledge of local governs in protecting the environmental flows dono et al 2013 use a dsp model to investigate the concurrent impacts of cc on irrigation water availability and crop water needs and stress the potential of eu rural development policy in assisting ribs to improve management and functionality of collective water infrastructure kahil et al 2015 use dsp to derive the ability of policy assisted water markets in driving farmers adaptation to cc many of these studies use the positive mathematical programming pmp to perfectly calibrate the water allocation models iglesias and blanco 2008 recommend pmp to assist in implementing the wfd pricing and cost recovery given its accuracy and replicability in diverse contexts cortignani and severini 2009 extended the of röhm and dabbert 2003 approach to calibrate the pmp in order to simulate the application of new strategies and irrigation technologies this enabled to overcome the dependence of the pmp from observed reality which in other ways prevents to obtaining adaptive responses based on new activities 6 6 fragoso and marques 2015 suggest that approaches as econometric mathematical programming can overcome some limits of pmp in reproducing farmers behaviour under sweeping policy changes dono and giraldo 2012 show the potential of pmp to assist water policy analysis highlighting that volumetric pricing of water from a dam could increase over extraction of groundwater and speed up the on going salinization of aquifers pmp allows to establish interactions amongst economic hydrological and other biophysical sub models in complex multi module models given the ease to apply in several contexts thanks to its self calibrated approach howitt et al 2012 dagnino and ward 2012 use pmp to assess the effects of an incentive assisted policy that encourages farmers of a sub basin in north america s rio grande to convert from surface to drip irrigation they show that in face of a consistent reduction of farm level water usage a relevant shortcoming is represented by the increase of water depletion at sub basin level because increased irrigation efficiency generates higher yields and higher et moreover without the possibility of restoring aquifers through percolation finally gohar and cashman 2016 stress that producing smooth changes pmp adequately assesses cc impacts on water and food security as well as many scenarios of adaptation and cost of water in dynamic optimization frameworks 3 material and methods we evaluate the impact of different water charging systems in an irrigated sardinian area partially or fully recovering water distribution costs wdc of the rib and accounting for different recovery levels of the costs incurred by the enas 7 7 enas ente acque della sardegna water authority of sardinia the agency that manages the sardinian water schemes and provides sectorial end users agriculture industry civil use we simulate these impacts with a territorial economic model divided into blocks that represent the sub areas with different technologies to distribute irrigation water and inside the sub areas main farm types furthermore the model uses the discrete stochastic programming to represent the choices prone to uncertain conditions different states of the nature of some parameters yields and irrigation requirements are considered with the possibility to correct the choices in later stages another original contribution concerns the integration of the territorial model with a translog function giraldo et al 2014 this function estimates the wdc incurred by the rib under the agricultural water use conditions generated by the pricing and cost recovery simulations concurrently the territorial mpm accounts for the effects of the latter on the on farm water usage and demand we also consider that part of wdc is subsidized by a regional aid to cover extra energy costs incurred by the rib for water lifting as a consequence of local orographic disadvantages finally we consider the cost to providing water to the rib from the reports of the enas which differentiates the tariffs among end users in order to balance the environmental economic and social impacts of cost recovery we now examine the study area the mathematical formulation of the territorial dsp model and the simulated scenarios as regards the water costs and pricing systems 3 1 study area and irrigation districts the study area has an acreage of 54 000 ha in centre west of sardinia italy dono et al 2016 describe its main features as well as the process of their identification here we recall that two sub areas compose it with different water availability conditions on 36 000 ha the oristanese rib annually provides 120 mm3 of water from the eleonora d arborea dam to 26 irrigation districts based on technological features these districts can be grouped into three clusters the first distributes water at high pressure hp with pipelines and pumping schemes a similar network provides water at low pressure lp in another group finally a network of open channels conveys water by gravity gr in a third group the unitary amount of the current acreage crop fees are specified depending on the benefit that farms gain from irrigation precisely in function of the adopted distribution technology in this regard the hp group is divided in a cluster for the districts of the arborea municipality hpar where higher fees are imposed and in another hp district clusters hpot hence four macro districts compose the rib area hpar hpot lp and gr with a decreasing level of benefit the water distribution facilities of the rib are absent in the remaining 18 000 ha of the area where rain fed farming is practiced with the exception of a limited number of hectares where private farm wells serve the irrigation thirteen main types represent the farms of the area nine of them operate in the rib zone the main crops are silage maize and rice italian ryegrass and alfalfa open field and greenhouse horticultural crops tree crops the largest part of dairy cattle breeding of sardinia operates in the arborea area with a well organized cooperative structure for producing processing and marketing cow milk dairy sheep breeding of is also practiced in the rib zone although it is mostly concentrated in the rainfed zone 3 2 mathematical formulation of the territorial dsp model we use a dsp supply model to consider various risk conditions in the decision making that are typical of mediterranean areas attention is paid to the role of climate variability in making uncertain several agricultural parameters water needs of crops among the others according to dsp modelling farmers conceive the production process as a sequence of stages whose structure depends on uncertainty on some parameters for these parameters they formulate a pdf probability distribution function that then discretize into main states of nature with related representative values and probabilities 8 8 farmers are assumed to build the pdf of many variables influenced by the normal climate variability by learning from individual experience and the local knowledge nguyen et al 2014 hence farmers plan based on the probability of these climatic therefore productive states and the possibility to correct potentially unfavourable results even if at a cost in particular the planning focuses on the state with the highest expected income the resulting management is different from that of perfect knowledge of all parameters in fact since unfavourable states may occur farmers take precautions whose cost reduces the potentially achievable income 9 9 details can be found among others in hardaker et al 2004 connor et al 2009 dono et al 2016 dono et al 2016 describe in detail the dsp model used in our simulations here we specify its structure in blocks related to the macro districts and within them to the farm types moreover respect to the formulation made in dono et al 2016 here is made explicit the component related to water pricing wp that represents the mechanism by means of which water costs are charged to end users as will be illustrated in the following paragraphs 3 3 and 3 4 this mechanism differs among the various simulations for what concerns both the entity of the costs charged to

corrective actions performed x r n s d t y 3 3 water costs and pricing systems simulated scenarios 3 3 1 irrigation water costs charged to farmers we simulated the recovery of the costs incurred by both the oristanese rib and the enas the costs of the rib include salaries and purchases of materials and energy to distribute water and maintain and administer the irrigation network from the dam to the farms 12 12 italian entitles the ribs to impose taxes on members including public institutions to contribute to maintenance of land reclamation facilities and irrigation as well as to their operating costs these fees in whatever way are calculated are not intended as the price paid for an economic good irrigation water or service water supply but as a contribution to the collective expenses or payment the rib uses a two part tariff to charge fixed costs with a fee per hectare served by the water distribution network and variable costs based on the actual irrigation activities the rib does not charge depreciation of the distribution facilities because their construction was publicly funded environmental and resource costs are computed as described in the following sub paragraph 3 3 2 accounting respectively for water volumes that is necessary to preserve from withdrawal to ensure the minimum vital outflow of the rivers and for the predominant role of industry in determining quality depletion of water resources enas 2010 however these costs are already included in enas fees and are not accounted among the rib costs our simulations change pricing system and cost recovery level therefore modify the amount of water used by farms and the variable component of the wdc of the rib 13 13 the extent of this latter modification depends on the water distribution technology we determined these costs in the various scenarios by using a transcendental logarithmic function translog that considers prices and amount of energy and labour inputs amount of distributed water and technological characteristics of the various districts of the network giraldo et al 2014 being estimated on observed data this cost function represents the actual cost operating condition of the oristanese rib it can be expressed in general terms as 6 l n c z α 0 α i ln z i 1 2 i k α i k ln z i ln z k α i k α k i this form expresses the logarithm of the wdc c in each macro district as a function of the independent variables z i and z k in our case the components in which the volume of distributed water can be divided irrigated acreage watering intensity and in the gravity macro district network losses 14 14 these components are normalized with respect to their average values in each macro district the coefficients αi and αk and the α0 constant term have distinct values in the districts at high pressure low pressure and gravity the αi represent the cost elasticity of the independent variable hence their relative importance in generating the wdc giraldo et al 2014 show that the irrigated acreage variable largely prevails over irrigation intensity and the network losses in determining the wdc our baseline provides a partial recovery of these costs this is made possible by a regional subsidy that compensates the higher hydraulic lifting energy costs of ribs due to unfavourable orography and climate of sardinia the costs of water authority charged by enas to end users relate to management maintenance and development of dams and primary water infrastructures and as mentioned include environmental and resource components the enas evaluates the resource stored in the dams assigns volumes to industry households and agriculture and defines the plan to recover the costs of supplying them water to this end enas subtracts these costs from regional subsidies received to pay a portion of the high energy costs 15 15 we have seen that regional contributions with an analogous role are provided to the ribs as well as other revenue from sources other than the sale of raw water such as the sale of hydroelectricity the residual cost has to be recovered by means of tariffs per cubic meter obtained dividing the former by the difference between the available water and the water released downstream of the dams to protect the instream flow 16 16 this subtraction increases the rate in proportion to the action to protect the environmental quality of the waterways finally enas modulates this tariff among end users to balance possible social and economic impacts of cost recovery particularly the burden is reduced on households and appreciably on farms indeed in 2009 2014 compared with an average of 0 046 mc industry paid 0 23 mc families were at 0 04 mc and farms at 0 007 mc 17 17 to encourage an efficient use of water the tariffs to agricultural end users as well as to household are divided into two volume blocks a unitary price of 0 005 mc for 80 of the volume assigned to the rib 140 mmc for the oristanese in 2010 and 0 015 mc for the higher 20 industry pays higher fees because is considered predominant in determining resource and environmental costs ras 2009 therefore unlike the subsidy to extra energy costs this measure transfers part of the agricultural water cost to other users of the resource and the public service and not to the taxpayers 3 3 2 water pricing systems we simulated four pricing systems at four different cost recovery levels the latter were 1 2 current partial coverage of rib s wdc and no coverage of enas 2010 modulated agricultural rate 3 current partial coverage of rib s wdc and fcr of enas 2010 modulated agricultural rate 4 fcr of rib s wdc and of enas 2010 modulated agricultural rate 5 fcr of rib s wdc and of enas 2010 non modulated agricultural rate 0 0461 mc here we describe the simulated water pricing systems 3 3 2 1 acreage crop this is the currently applied system whose fees are applied to each irrigated hectare based on two indicators reflecting water needs of crops and benefit generated by the distribution scheme these latter are 1 24 for hpar 1 00 in hpot 0 72 for lp 0 44 for gr 18 18 the indices are also modulated to consider the soil characteristics and climatic of the various rib areas which affect the potential for exploiting the available water they also take into account that the mode of water delivery and the oldness of the facilities determine the on field usage costs level hence the general profitability of irrigation its implementation requires the rib to verify the crops that farmers actually grow our baseline considers the current partial coverage of wdc allowed by the regional subsidy and no coverage of water authority costs fcr of both rib and enas costs is obtained by proportionally increasing the fees to the crops and macro districts 3 3 2 2 irrigated acreage watering this pricing is obtained by introducing the wdc function in the objective function of the dsp model and directly bind water payments to irrigated acreage extension irrigation needs of crops and water losses estimated to generate the wdc of the rib another tariff element per used cubic meter considers the payment to enas the basis of this pricing system irrigated acreage and irrigation needs is similar to the currently adopted system though unlike this latter it does not consider pedo climatic conditions of the rib areas also it assumes perfect information of farmers about wdc formation and consciousness on the impact of their choices giraldo et al 2014 being absent these conditions we consider its results as a hint on the best use water obtainable with this type of rates rather than the outcome of a technically applicable pricing 19 19 yet this pricing mechanism does not require high investments for the implementation and management costs in fact satellite imagery allows the detection of irrigated surfaces and intensity of water use and to build a coherent pricing 3 3 2 3 volumetric this method ignores the importance of the irrigated acreage in generating the wdc and debits to farmers only according to the used volume of water its implementation requires an accurate metering that can generate significant costs of investment and measurement to the rib yet this system is considered the most consistent with the guidelines of the wfd about using the pricing to direct towards the efficient use of water we implemented the water price at macro districts level by dividing the estimated wdc plus enas cost by the respective volume of distributed water including network losses to allow the cost recovery at the various levels 3 3 2 4 irrigable acreage farms pay based on the acreage served by the rib facilities independently from the actual water use we divide the total cost among farms based on the parameters that in the current pricing reflect the benefit generated by the water distribution technology this system is totally opposite to the principles of wfd but represents for the rib the less expensive and easiest way to implement and manage because it does not even require verifying whether or not farmers irrigate conversely it does not generate any economic incentive to evaluate even the opportunity to use or not the water resource in our simulations the farms pay a fixed value per each hectare to partially or fully cover water cost 4 results 4 1 impact on the entire rib area table 1 reports the impacts of modifying the pricing system and or the level of cost recovery on the agricultural income of rib area water payments of the farms to rib wdc paid by taxpayers average wdc of the rib water use nitrogen and labour the section 1 reports the results of the current pricing system expressed in absolute value baseline 2010 the results reported in the following sections are expressed as percentage changes over the baseline section 2 reports the results of the other tariff systems at the current level of water cost recovery sections 3 4 and 5 report the results of the current tariff system and of the alternative ones at progressively increasing levels of recovery of water costs the data of the current situation in section 1 remain as shown in dono et al 2016 compared to what is shown in that publication the table also shows the 1 983 million m of water costs that are charged to taxpayers due to the regional energy subsidies to the rib and to non payment of the enas rates based on these values we can say that the current acreage crop pricing recovers 61 of the 3527 m of the estimated rib s wdc cost recovery reduces to 52 if we add 0 6 m of not payed enas costs at the modulated rate instead if we consider non modulated enas rate 0 0461 mc acreage crop only covers 24 3 of the 8813 m of the total water cost 60 of which represented by enas costs this situation is expressed in detail by table 1a this shows in detail the various components of the wdc at the baseline total value unit value of 114 7 mm3 of water from the rib percentage weight over the total and the subjects who are paying section 2 of table 1 shows that changing the pricing and maintaining the baseline level of cost recovery causes very limited impacts on the area s income and water payments to rib instead differences emerge on the cost to the taxpayers and resources use the irrigated acreage watering influences the allocation of resources based on surface area to be irrigated and use of water this leads to make more extensive farming reducing the use of nitrogen water from aquifers and the rib and labour also decrease the financial burden on the taxpayers and the average wdc of rib suggestsing an increase in efficiency in providing that water volumetric pricing charges the entire payment on the use of rib water and ignores the surface component of wdc this decreases more the use of rib water has almost no impact on the groundwater use and increases the use of nitrogen despite the decline in water use rib the cost to the taxpayers does not decrease while the average wdc is even increasing finally irrigable acreage decouples the payments from water use and intensifies cropping patterns towards more water nitrogen and labour demanding crops increasing the use of rib water also visibly increases the burden on the taxpayers as well as the average wdc the simulations of section 3 maintain unchanged the regional energy subsidies to the rib but require the full recovery of the enas costs even if at modulated farm tariffs the increase of water payments charges to agriculture a notable part of the burden to manage the dam despite the appreciable increase the limited importance of water payments on total farm income generates a very limited impact on the latter and the impact is similar across the different pricing systems the effects on resource use and efficiency of the rib water distribution accentuate the trends observed in previous simulations crop acreage and watering irrigated acreage have analogous impacts though the latter increases more the burden on farmers and conversely reduces more the use of resources and the average wdc of the rib the volumetric has the least impact on irrigation payments though notable and yet reduces more the use of rib water irrigable acreage acting as a fixed income levy maintains the same impact of the previous simulation which remains unchanged in the following section 4 reports the results at fcr by irrigation payments with elimination of energy subsidies to the rib and entire payment of the enas modulated rate the various pricing increase their impacts on net incomes and resources use but remain in the same mutual relationship of the previous cost recovery scenarios the only exception is that crop acreage is more incisive than watering irrigated acreage in increasing the irrigation payments and reducing the use of water from the rib conversely the latter pricing reduces more the average wdc increasing at a lesser extent the irrigation payments section 5 shows the results at fcr with enas non modulated agricultural rate farmers pay all the energy costs of rib as well as the costs of the sardinian water scheme currently charged to industrial users all pricing systems greatly reduce the agricultural income of the area because of the increase up to fourfold of the irrigation payments a heavy de intensification of cropping patterns is generated in all cases except irrigable acreage as already noted a drastic drop of the rib water use reaches up to 14 also appreciably decline groundwater extraction use of nitrogen and of labour irrigated acreage watering maintains a lead in the reduction of average wdc and as in previous case combines it with the smaller increase of the irrigation payments 4 2 impact on the farm typologies table 2 is similar to the previous ones the absolute values of the baseline refer to the average farm income of the types in decreasing order while the results of all the other pricing and cost recovery levels are percentage changes over the baseline section 2 shows that substituting the pricing at the current level of recovery may generate a certain for some pricing wide heterogeneity of income impacts on the single types yet in all the simulations the types with higher net income ni cattle breeding cata and catb and rice growing risp 20 20 these types represent 18 1 of farms and 54 9 of the rib area net income not reported in the table improve their condition while the other types always lose ni even notably 5 0 mixed crops type mix 3 2 3 sheep type sha hence the current crop acreage pricing supports the lower income farms the parameter on crop irrigation needs generates this support indeed irrigable acreage that applies the current parameter on the water distribution technology does not support the lower income farms this is due to the elimination of any link between water use and cost under this pricing that prevents farmers from making any adjustment in order to limit income impacts increasing the cost recovery level generally reduces farm incomes and gains of the higher ni types gradually narrow and finally become negative yet the considerations made in advance remain the crop acreage allows the types with lower ni to face milder impacts while the opposite happens with the other pricing again the greater redistributive effect is generated by applying the fixed fee of the irrigable acreage finally fcr generates appreciable income impacts in many cases even at modulated enas rates 13 1 sha 6 0 mix2 4 9 mix3 and grh implementing the non modulated farm rates generates significant impacts 15 5 catb 14 4 citr 14 0 grh and mix3 which in some cases become dramatic 31 9 sha we conclude with the impacts on the irrigation payments of the farm types that are immediately visible and comparable among farms and thus even more of income changes may alter the consent of farmers on the choices of the rib and of region about water resources management table 2a reports these impacts we note that changing the pricing section 2 would have very large negative effects always on farms with lower incomes these would increase greatly with irrigable acreage pursuing the fcr of enas cost would act in a more balanced way with the current pricing though in a wide range of 20 27 impacts disparities would become consistent with the other pricing systems and of course would grow by charging to farmers first also the entire wdc then also the enas cost at the non modulated rates in this latest simulation the current pricing would reach up to quadruple payment of the type with the lowest ni other pricing might result in increases of up to eight times the current level 5 discussion we used the translog function of giraldo et al 2014 to identify the wdc in the macro districts of the rib under the water demand conditions arising in the various simulations of pricing and cost recovery we interviewed local farmers and agricultural technicians to derive the crops water needs that integrated as coefficients of the dsp model generated the use conditions of water and the other resources based on these elements our results indicated that the coverage level of the oristanese rib s wdc is about 61 which is in the upper range of cost recovery cited by massarutto 2003 for southern italy irrigated ribs and very close to the range of the northern consortia in this context the current pricing system generates an indirect support to the lower ni farms by embodying social assessments that would not be met by the other pricing systems of this study adopt the latter would have a relatively limited impact on incomes instead the impact on irrigation payments would be considerable and above all would be very different between types primarily damaging the low income farms such payments are visible and comparable by farmers associated with the rib which may increase the disputes on redistributive effects of these other tariff systems maintaining the current pricing would cost since adopting irrigated acreage watering would reduce by 3 4 the average wdc as measured by our function this savings would reduce the inefficiencies that fcr charges to farmers approaching the condition of water tariffs that only include costs of efficient management massarutto 2007 this could at least partly balance the social impact of a different distribution of water cost among farmers other results address the various cost recovery levels the first concerns full debiting to farmers enas costs at modulated rates this option is causing right now appreciable tensions between farmers the rib enas and sardinia region la nova 2016 this allocation would have limited income impacts although significant on some farm types instead the impacts on irrigation payments would be high and even with the current pricing would affect many farms with low incomes the social visibility of this cost component is contributing to determine the mentioned disputes adopting our alternative pricing would further increase payments and much on low income farms continuing with cost recovery and transferring to farmers all the electricity costs for water pumping obviously would increase the impacts on farm incomes and irrigation payments along with the distribution divergences in this case changing also the pricing would lead to cases of extreme income impacts finally also abolishing the modulation of enas tariffs would reduce more than 10 income in many types to reach 30 in extreme cases even in this case coupling fcr to a pricing more directly linked to wdc might generate social tensions because neutralizes the current support to low ni farms other authors find that an exhaustive wfd policy might jeopardize sustainability of irrigated agriculture gómez limón and riesgo 2004 berbel et al 2011 tariff modulation appears essential for its impact it reflects the regional evaluation that the user cost in sardinia is mainly generated by the water pollution impact of industrial use while farming has a negative user cost because of its relatively lower impact hence the current crop acreage system supported by the regional contribution to electricity costs and the modulation of the rates to end users minimizes the economic and social impacts of water pricing and addresses the resource and environmental costs generated by the industrial sector the problem is to reconcile these aspects with the environmental issues precisely water protection and conservation that may be directly related to the farming activity in this regard the irrigated acreage watering and volumetric result to better fulfil the concerns of wfd indeed even at the current level of cost recovery the first one saves the rib water and causes a lower environmental pressure reducing the groundwater use and nitrogen the second one by relating payments to the use of the rib water reduces it even more but on the other hand increases the use of the other two resources these impacts on the resources use are emphasized at fcr where the extensification effect of the irrigated acreage watering is greatly reinforced while a notable capability of saving the sole rib water emerges for the volumetric 6 conclusions our assessment of various water pricing in an farming area of south italy confirms that a multi purpose policy as wfd requires the use of articulated tools we found that volumetric pricing generates savings of rib water but increases the use of chemicals and fails to reduce even increases groundwater use the large availability of rib water makes these relatively limited externalities yet the impact could be larger in a condition of scarcity irrigated acreage watering more properly considers the structure of water supply costs namely their relationship to the extension of the irrigated area this induces a more equilibrate de intensification of cropping activities which better controls groundwater and nitrogen use and reduces the aid requested to the taxpayers under partial cost recovery under fcr this has more limited impacts on farms even if causes the strongest negative impacts on labour employment the current crop acreage has an intermediate performance yet more than the other two minimizes social and economic impacts of water pricing as a general result a dichotomy emerges between fulfilling the environmental objectives of wfd and preventing intense social and economic negative impacts this type of analysis can help to specify the pricing policies of local water authorities making their watershed plans less descriptive this way their choices and actions will appear less arbitrary in mitigating social and economic impacts of water fcr acknowledgements the paper was carried out under macsur 1 and 2 d m 2660 7303 2012 and 24064 7303 2015 www macsur eu

11569,a key guideline of the european water framework directive wfd asks to cover water costs in a way to encourage the efficient use of the resource therefore its protection but minimizing possible adverse environmental social and economic impacts of cost recovery we use a mathematical programming model of an italian mediterranean agricultural area where a reclamation and irrigation board rib manages collective irrigation facilities to simulate the impact of replacing the existing pricing system with several alternatives at different degrees of water cost recovery we estimate the water distribution cost wdc of the rib with a translog cost function and consider the cost incurred by the sardinian water agency enas for maintaining regional dams and primary water infrastructures we also consider that a regional subsidy pays part of the ribs and enas energy cost for water lifting and that enas rates are modulated among end users to reduce agricultural fee by increasing the charge on industrial uses we simulate the impact of alternative pricing under four scenarios of cost recovery i current partial recovery of wdc with no enas charge ii current recovery of wdc plus enas cost at modulated agricultural rates iii full coverage of wdc i e absence of the regional aid plus enas cost at modulated agricultural rates iv full coverage of wdc plus unmodulated enas rate solely changing the water pricing system at current cost recovery level generates limited total impacts but substantial income redistributive effects among farm types whose magnitude grows increasing the level of recovery the full cost recovery scenarios generate remarkable global impacts and drops of income in the single farm types particularly when applying enas undiscounted rate major consequences also emerge for the use of water and other productive factors and labour employment keywords water framework directive pricing irrigation water water distribution cost function mathematical programming 1 introduction one of the key guidelines of the water framework directive wfd is to combine economic principles and tools polluter pays and pricing to achieve environmental goals while ensuring full cost recovery fcr of water services and adequate incentives to efficiently use water european commission 2000 massarutto 2007 martin ortega et al 2015 the european guidance document on the directive précises how to plan and organise the economic analysis in implementing the water policy wateco 2003 besides article 9 of wfd recognizes that applying efficient water pricing may raise social and redistributive concerns and establishes that member states may consider social environmental impacts and economic in planning the mode and level of cost recovery this aspect is important on it reynaud 2016 shows that increasing water payments for domestic use could mainly affect the most vulnerable social groups from the agricultural perspective venot and molle 2008 stresses that raising taxes on the water taken from farms wells does not involve significant savings of that resource and can further reduce the profitability of extensive crops or low income in the case of irrigation water supplied by collective facilities dono et al 2010 stress that if the latter are underused fcr rates could be based on average costs that are much higher than the marginal costs uncontrolled extractions of groundwater may result where this resource is available or negative impacts on incomes where not definitely pursuing fcr by increasing water payments might generate a vicious circle favouring the use of sources difficult to protect appreciably affecting low income users and reducing the use of collective services azevedo and baltar 2005 reynaud 2016 according to a recent report of the european commission not all member states apply transparent water pricing and greece and italy are particularly lagging behind in adapting european commission 2015 1 1 a key factor of delay is considered the lack of adequate metering systems a precondition to present users the water costs a solicitation arises for many national and local water authorities to recover the delay our analysis takes its cue from this commitment and assesses the possible impact of various pricing methods in an irrigated mediterranean area of sardinia italy where a reclamation and irrigation board rib distributes water to farms 2 2 the ribs are non profit landowners associations with legal status our goal is twofold first assess the impact of replacing the current pricing with alternative systems including volumetric often regarded as the most effective in promoting efficient use of water second evaluate the effect of including all the costs of water in the irrigation rates and indirectly assess the choice of regional authorities to limit this transfer to farms the next section background illustrates aspects of the scientific debate that are relevant to our study section materials and methods describes the study area the approach for assessing the impacts of water pricing and cost recovery with simulated pricing systems and the estimation of water costs the results section reports the economic and some environmental and social impacts of the simulations the discussion section assesses the impacts of the pricing systems and the conclusions follow 2 background 2 1 scientific debate on water framework directive several aspects of the scientific debate on wfd are relevant to our study a first issue is identification of the costs to be recovered in agriculture garrido and calatrava 2010 classify monetary costs in three categories the irrigator pays private costs as any other farming cost such as energy maintenance and labour the pricing and water allocation policies can have major impacts on them leading to change the source of supply for example encouraging use of groundwater or the adopted irrigation technologies another category is the costs of the irrigation district or scheme for the management and maintenance of water distribution systems to individual farms ribs manage most of the italian schemes and about 63 of irrigation water bellini 2014 and charge specific tariffs to farmers inea 2011 project capital costs are publicly funded finally the water authority costs pertain to governmental agencies that manage large dams and infrastructures debiting related costs to end users and taxpayers and it is interesting to examine the distribution between the two groups garrido and calatrava 2010 complex and site specific analyses are required to estimate and include in the fcr environmental and resource costs the former consist of non use values associated with obtaining a healthy functioning of aquatic ecosystems and use values of water environment drafting group eco2 2004 resource costs arise when alternative uses of the water generate higher economic value than present use or foreseen future because of an inefficient water allocation or pollution over time and across users eea 2013 several authors agree that applying fcr would increase the water users payments mainly to agriculture that currently pays part of the financial costs berbel and gomez limon 2000 massarutto 2007 berbel et al 2011 giannakis et al 2016 according to eea 2013 volumetric water tariffs of italian agriculture are in the range of 0 04 0 25 m3 3 3 arcadis 2012 report 0 03 0 07 m3 as the prevalent range for volumetric pricing in southern italy over 0 002 0 70 m3 in a selected group of european countries flat rates are in the range of 30 150 ha over 30 210 ha for those same countries arcadis 2012 estimate that those charges generate a 50 financial cost recovery rate as average of 50 80 in the north and 20 30 in southern italy massarutto 2003 mentions analogous levels of partial recovery of the total cost he also highlights the complexity of this computation warning that in many facilities the final cost value depends on the joint use in multiple uses as the hydropower generation in northern italy and public water supply companies in south 4 4 depreciation and capital cost depend on accounting practices on allocation of assets ownership and economic risk among operators users and public authorities and among types of uses for multipurpose water systems eea 2013 the author also reports that operation and maintenance costs are recovered at 70 100 in northern italy and 20 100 in the south related to fcr another relevant issue concerns the pricing system that can encourage efficient use of water volumetric is considered as the most suitable pricing for achieving the wfd objectives gómez limón and riesgo 2004 bartolini et al 2007 gallego ayala 2012 yet many constraints are found to possibly hinder the reaching of efficiency in irrigation water johansson et al 2002 massarutto 2007 stresses that recovery should only consider costs incurred by an efficient service supplier that pays all inputs at their marginal cost mc furthermore dono et al 2013 highlight that mc pricing may not allow fcr when average costs ac are decreasing as in large canal schemes being mc lower than ac other factors such as scarcity due to climate change may reduce the use of water at levels where mc of running collective facilities is below ac in conditions of structurally decreasing irrigation ac or under utilized irrigation schemes fcr pricing would charge farmers for inefficient levels of use that do not depend on their choices finally and key for this paper wfd provides that member states may balance negative effects of fcr on social environmental and economic issues other objectives of national policies can be reconciled in wfd as adequacy of revenues from water services equity and flexibility environmental protection administrative simplicity and transparency garcia and reynaud 2004 reynaud 2016 cooper et al 2014 point out that these objectives might be in conflict with each other 5 5 achieve economic efficiency may conflict with ensure adequacy of revenues both may conflict with reaching of equity and is likely hard to reconcile all in a single policy dono et al 2010 stress that fcr of water services achieved by increasing payments could hinder water protection encouraging farmers to use alternative sources as groundwater or rivers according to reynaud 2016 the implementation of fcr would result in major changes in water use of households in italy among other countries as well as in accessibility issues since not italian families in the lowest income decile will have to devote major shares of their income to pay the new water bills and wastewater moreover inconsistent aspects are present garrido and llamas 2009 point out that specify the resource cost would require functioning water markets yet if this trade becomes a usual practice there will be no need to integrate the resource element in the water costs in any case according to howarth 2009 a critical aspect is that wfd and the documents on its application are vague in defining the criteria to assess these issues gómez limón and martin ortega 2013 stress that the vagueness of article 9 can also lead to conclude that it is not required to apply increases in water tariffs also because of this vagueness many river basin plans are mainly descriptive and devoid of prospective analysis hence it would be useful strengthening their economic section to avoid that their choices appear arbitrary in tempering the social impact of fcr and in protecting environmental quality 2 2 water framework directive and mathematical programming models we evaluate the impact of reforming water pricing with a mathematical programming model mpm of our study area bazzani et al 2005 use a multi criteria mpm to conclude that wfd would reduce only slightly agricultural water use and would mainly reduce farm income and labour employment even if differently among farm types mejias et al 2004 use a stochastic mpm to show that pricing would be even less effective in reducing farming use in the years of increased water scarcity instead integrating objectives of wdf and cap would increase the efficiency of water allocation riesgo and gómez limón 2006 and bartolini et al 2007 use a mpm respectively with linear and multi attribute utility to conclude that agricultural policies are pre eminent on the recovery partial and complete of the irrigation water costs they also conclude that it is useful to maintain low water prices to achieve the environmental objectives of wf semaan et al 2007 integrate the results of the epic crop model in a mpm to conclude that water pricing is ineffective in reducing nitrate leaching it is also socially resisted because as the taxes on nitrogen fertilizer charges farmers the cost of nitrate leaching reduction garrido and calatrava 2010 stress that mpms overvalue the economic impacts of pricing policies and undervalues water demand elasticity because of its short medium term perspective besides neglecting the uncertainties involved in farming stochastic programming models may help in representing the effect of various types of risk or uncertainty on the agricultural water demand hardaker et al 2004 garrido and calatrava 2010 quiggin et al 2010 use discrete stochastic programming dsp to evidence the long run role of water reallocation in limiting the adverse impacts of cc and claim for global adaptation policies and pledge of local governs in protecting the environmental flows dono et al 2013 use a dsp model to investigate the concurrent impacts of cc on irrigation water availability and crop water needs and stress the potential of eu rural development policy in assisting ribs to improve management and functionality of collective water infrastructure kahil et al 2015 use dsp to derive the ability of policy assisted water markets in driving farmers adaptation to cc many of these studies use the positive mathematical programming pmp to perfectly calibrate the water allocation models iglesias and blanco 2008 recommend pmp to assist in implementing the wfd pricing and cost recovery given its accuracy and replicability in diverse contexts cortignani and severini 2009 extended the of röhm and dabbert 2003 approach to calibrate the pmp in order to simulate the application of new strategies and irrigation technologies this enabled to overcome the dependence of the pmp from observed reality which in other ways prevents to obtaining adaptive responses based on new activities 6 6 fragoso and marques 2015 suggest that approaches as econometric mathematical programming can overcome some limits of pmp in reproducing farmers behaviour under sweeping policy changes dono and giraldo 2012 show the potential of pmp to assist water policy analysis highlighting that volumetric pricing of water from a dam could increase over extraction of groundwater and speed up the on going salinization of aquifers pmp allows to establish interactions amongst economic hydrological and other biophysical sub models in complex multi module models given the ease to apply in several contexts thanks to its self calibrated approach howitt et al 2012 dagnino and ward 2012 use pmp to assess the effects of an incentive assisted policy that encourages farmers of a sub basin in north america s rio grande to convert from surface to drip irrigation they show that in face of a consistent reduction of farm level water usage a relevant shortcoming is represented by the increase of water depletion at sub basin level because increased irrigation efficiency generates higher yields and higher et moreover without the possibility of restoring aquifers through percolation finally gohar and cashman 2016 stress that producing smooth changes pmp adequately assesses cc impacts on water and food security as well as many scenarios of adaptation and cost of water in dynamic optimization frameworks 3 material and methods we evaluate the impact of different water charging systems in an irrigated sardinian area partially or fully recovering water distribution costs wdc of the rib and accounting for different recovery levels of the costs incurred by the enas 7 7 enas ente acque della sardegna water authority of sardinia the agency that manages the sardinian water schemes and provides sectorial end users agriculture industry civil use we simulate these impacts with a territorial economic model divided into blocks that represent the sub areas with different technologies to distribute irrigation water and inside the sub areas main farm types furthermore the model uses the discrete stochastic programming to represent the choices prone to uncertain conditions different states of the nature of some parameters yields and irrigation requirements are considered with the possibility to correct the choices in later stages another original contribution concerns the integration of the territorial model with a translog function giraldo et al 2014 this function estimates the wdc incurred by the rib under the agricultural water use conditions generated by the pricing and cost recovery simulations concurrently the territorial mpm accounts for the effects of the latter on the on farm water usage and demand we also consider that part of wdc is subsidized by a regional aid to cover extra energy costs incurred by the rib for water lifting as a consequence of local orographic disadvantages finally we consider the cost to providing water to the rib from the reports of the enas which differentiates the tariffs among end users in order to balance the environmental economic and social impacts of cost recovery we now examine the study area the mathematical formulation of the territorial dsp model and the simulated scenarios as regards the water costs and pricing systems 3 1 study area and irrigation districts the study area has an acreage of 54 000 ha in centre west of sardinia italy dono et al 2016 describe its main features as well as the process of their identification here we recall that two sub areas compose it with different water availability conditions on 36 000 ha the oristanese rib annually provides 120 mm3 of water from the eleonora d arborea dam to 26 irrigation districts based on technological features these districts can be grouped into three clusters the first distributes water at high pressure hp with pipelines and pumping schemes a similar network provides water at low pressure lp in another group finally a network of open channels conveys water by gravity gr in a third group the unitary amount of the current acreage crop fees are specified depending on the benefit that farms gain from irrigation precisely in function of the adopted distribution technology in this regard the hp group is divided in a cluster for the districts of the arborea municipality hpar where higher fees are imposed and in another hp district clusters hpot hence four macro districts compose the rib area hpar hpot lp and gr with a decreasing level of benefit the water distribution facilities of the rib are absent in the remaining 18 000 ha of the area where rain fed farming is practiced with the exception of a limited number of hectares where private farm wells serve the irrigation thirteen main types represent the farms of the area nine of them operate in the rib zone the main crops are silage maize and rice italian ryegrass and alfalfa open field and greenhouse horticultural crops tree crops the largest part of dairy cattle breeding of sardinia operates in the arborea area with a well organized cooperative structure for producing processing and marketing cow milk dairy sheep breeding of is also practiced in the rib zone although it is mostly concentrated in the rainfed zone 3 2 mathematical formulation of the territorial dsp model we use a dsp supply model to consider various risk conditions in the decision making that are typical of mediterranean areas attention is paid to the role of climate variability in making uncertain several agricultural parameters water needs of crops among the others according to dsp modelling farmers conceive the production process as a sequence of stages whose structure depends on uncertainty on some parameters for these parameters they formulate a pdf probability distribution function that then discretize into main states of nature with related representative values and probabilities 8 8 farmers are assumed to build the pdf of many variables influenced by the normal climate variability by learning from individual experience and the local knowledge nguyen et al 2014 hence farmers plan based on the probability of these climatic therefore productive states and the possibility to correct potentially unfavourable results even if at a cost in particular the planning focuses on the state with the highest expected income the resulting management is different from that of perfect knowledge of all parameters in fact since unfavourable states may occur farmers take precautions whose cost reduces the potentially achievable income 9 9 details can be found among others in hardaker et al 2004 connor et al 2009 dono et al 2016 dono et al 2016 describe in detail the dsp model used in our simulations here we specify its structure in blocks related to the macro districts and within them to the farm types moreover respect to the formulation made in dono et al 2016 here is made explicit the component related to water pricing wp that represents the mechanism by means of which water costs are charged to end users as will be illustrated in the following paragraphs 3 3 and 3 4 this mechanism differs among the various simulations for what concerns both the entity of the costs charged to farmers and the pricing system used eq 1 is the objective function zgm of as sum of gross margins related to each crop j and livestock activity in the 13 farm types ty operating in the five macro

is the unitary land and labour needs for each activity bd ty is the respective availability 11 11 for reasons of compactness in the formal specification of constraint equations we jointly consider

corrective actions performed x r n s d t y 3 3 water costs and pricing systems simulated scenarios 3 3 1 irrigation water costs charged to farmers we simulated the recovery of the costs incurred by both the oristanese rib and the enas the costs of the rib include salaries and purchases of materials and energy to distribute water and maintain and administer the irrigation network from the dam to the farms 12 12 italian entitles the ribs to impose taxes on members including public institutions to contribute to maintenance of land reclamation facilities and irrigation as well as to their operating costs these fees in whatever way are calculated are not intended as the price paid for an economic good irrigation water or service water supply but as a contribution to the collective expenses or payment the rib uses a two part tariff to charge fixed costs with a fee per hectare served by the water distribution network and variable costs based on the actual irrigation activities the rib does not charge depreciation of the distribution facilities because their construction was publicly funded environmental and resource costs are computed as described in the following sub paragraph 3 3 2 accounting respectively for water volumes that is necessary to preserve from withdrawal to ensure the minimum vital outflow of the rivers and for the predominant role of industry in determining quality depletion of water resources enas 2010 however these costs are already included in enas fees and are not accounted among the rib costs our simulations change pricing system and cost recovery level therefore modify the amount of water used by farms and the variable component of the wdc of the rib 13 13 the extent of this latter modification depends on the water distribution technology we determined these costs in the various scenarios by using a transcendental logarithmic function translog that considers prices and amount of energy and labour inputs amount of distributed water and technological characteristics of the various districts of the network giraldo et al 2014 being estimated on observed data this cost function represents the actual cost operating condition of the oristanese rib it can be expressed in general terms as 6 l n c z α 0 α i ln z i 1 2 i k α i k ln z i ln z k α i k α k i this form expresses the logarithm of the wdc c in each macro district as a function of the independent variables z i and z k in our case the components in which the volume of distributed water can be divided irrigated acreage watering intensity and in the gravity macro district network losses 14 14 these components are normalized with respect to their average values in each macro district the coefficients αi and αk and the α0 constant term have distinct values in the districts at high pressure low pressure and gravity the αi represent the cost elasticity of the independent variable hence their relative importance in generating the wdc giraldo et al 2014 show that the irrigated acreage variable largely prevails over irrigation intensity and the network losses in determining the wdc our baseline provides a partial recovery of these costs this is made possible by a regional subsidy that compensates the higher hydraulic lifting energy costs of ribs due to unfavourable orography and climate of sardinia the costs of water authority charged by enas to end users relate to management maintenance and development of dams and primary water infrastructures and as mentioned include environmental and resource components the enas evaluates the resource stored in the dams assigns volumes to industry households and agriculture and defines the plan to recover the costs of supplying them water to this end enas subtracts these costs from regional subsidies received to pay a portion of the high energy costs 15 15 we have seen that regional contributions with an analogous role are provided to the ribs as well as other revenue from sources other than the sale of raw water such as the sale of hydroelectricity the residual cost has to be recovered by means of tariffs per cubic meter obtained dividing the former by the difference between the available water and the water released downstream of the dams to protect the instream flow 16 16 this subtraction increases the rate in proportion to the action to protect the environmental quality of the waterways finally enas modulates this tariff among end users to balance possible social and economic impacts of cost recovery particularly the burden is reduced on households and appreciably on farms indeed in 2009 2014 compared with an average of 0 046 mc industry paid 0 23 mc families were at 0 04 mc and farms at 0 007 mc 17 17 to encourage an efficient use of water the tariffs to agricultural end users as well as to household are divided into two volume blocks a unitary price of 0 005 mc for 80 of the volume assigned to the rib 140 mmc for the oristanese in 2010 and 0 015 mc for the higher 20 industry pays higher fees because is considered predominant in determining resource and environmental costs ras 2009 therefore unlike the subsidy to extra energy costs this measure transfers part of the agricultural water cost to other users of the resource and the public service and not to the taxpayers 3 3 2 water pricing systems we simulated four pricing systems at four different cost recovery levels the latter were 1 2 current partial coverage of rib s wdc and no coverage of enas 2010 modulated agricultural rate 3 current partial coverage of rib s wdc and fcr of enas 2010 modulated agricultural rate 4 fcr of rib s wdc and of enas 2010 modulated agricultural rate 5 fcr of rib s wdc and of enas 2010 non modulated agricultural rate 0 0461 mc here we describe the simulated water pricing systems 3 3 2 1 acreage crop this is the currently applied system whose fees are applied to each irrigated hectare based on two indicators reflecting water needs of crops and benefit generated by the distribution scheme these latter are 1 24 for hpar 1 00 in hpot 0 72 for lp 0 44 for gr 18 18 the indices are also modulated to consider the soil characteristics and climatic of the various rib areas which affect the potential for exploiting the available water they also take into account that the mode of water delivery and the oldness of the facilities determine the on field usage costs level hence the general profitability of irrigation its implementation requires the rib to verify the crops that farmers actually grow our baseline considers the current partial coverage of wdc allowed by the regional subsidy and no coverage of water authority costs fcr of both rib and enas costs is obtained by proportionally increasing the fees to the crops and macro districts 3 3 2 2 irrigated acreage watering this pricing is obtained by introducing the wdc function in the objective function of the dsp model and directly bind water payments to irrigated acreage extension irrigation needs of crops and water losses estimated to generate the wdc of the rib another tariff element per used cubic meter considers the payment to enas the basis of this pricing system irrigated acreage and irrigation needs is similar to the currently adopted system though unlike this latter it does not consider pedo climatic conditions of the rib areas also it assumes perfect information of farmers about wdc formation and consciousness on the impact of their choices giraldo et al 2014 being absent these conditions we consider its results as a hint on the best use water obtainable with this type of rates rather than the outcome of a technically applicable pricing 19 19 yet this pricing mechanism does not require high investments for the implementation and management costs in fact satellite imagery allows the detection of irrigated surfaces and intensity of water use and to build a coherent pricing 3 3 2 3 volumetric this method ignores the importance of the irrigated acreage in generating the wdc and debits to farmers only according to the used volume of water its implementation requires an accurate metering that can generate significant costs of investment and measurement to the rib yet this system is considered the most consistent with the guidelines of the wfd about using the pricing to direct towards the efficient use of water we implemented the water price at macro districts level by dividing the estimated wdc plus enas cost by the respective volume of distributed water including network losses to allow the cost recovery at the various levels 3 3 2 4 irrigable acreage farms pay based on the acreage served by the rib facilities independently from the actual water use we divide the total cost among farms based on the parameters that in the current pricing reflect the benefit generated by the water distribution technology this system is totally opposite to the principles of wfd but represents for the rib the less expensive and easiest way to implement and manage because it does not even require verifying whether or not farmers irrigate conversely it does not generate any economic incentive to evaluate even the opportunity to use or not the water resource in our simulations the farms pay a fixed value per each hectare to partially or fully cover water cost 4 results 4 1 impact on the entire rib area table 1 reports the impacts of modifying the pricing system and or the level of cost recovery on the agricultural income of rib area water payments of the farms to rib wdc paid by taxpayers average wdc of the rib water use nitrogen and labour the section 1 reports the results of the current pricing system expressed in absolute value baseline 2010 the results reported in the following sections are expressed as percentage changes over the baseline section 2 reports the results of the other tariff systems at the current level of water cost recovery sections 3 4 and 5 report the results of the current tariff system and of the alternative ones at progressively increasing levels of recovery of water costs the data of the current situation in section 1 remain as shown in dono et al 2016 compared to what is shown in that publication the table also shows the 1 983 million m of water costs that are charged to taxpayers due to the regional energy subsidies to the rib and to non payment of the enas rates based on these values we can say that the current acreage crop pricing recovers 61 of the 3527 m of the estimated rib s wdc cost recovery reduces to 52 if we add 0 6 m of not payed enas costs at the modulated rate instead if we consider non modulated enas rate 0 0461 mc acreage crop only covers 24 3 of the 8813 m of the total water cost 60 of which represented by enas costs this situation is expressed in detail by table 1a this shows in detail the various components of the wdc at the baseline total value unit value of 114 7 mm3 of water from the rib percentage weight over the total and the subjects who are paying section 2 of table 1 shows that changing the pricing and maintaining the baseline level of cost recovery causes very limited impacts on the area s income and water payments to rib instead differences emerge on the cost to the taxpayers and resources use the irrigated acreage watering influences the allocation of resources based on surface area to be irrigated and use of water this leads to make more extensive farming reducing the use of nitrogen water from aquifers and the rib and labour also decrease the financial burden on the taxpayers and the average wdc of rib suggestsing an increase in efficiency in providing that water volumetric pricing charges the entire payment on the use of rib water and ignores the surface component of wdc this decreases more the use of rib water has almost no impact on the groundwater use and increases the use of nitrogen despite the decline in water use rib the cost to the taxpayers does not decrease while the average wdc is even increasing finally irrigable acreage decouples the payments from water use and intensifies cropping patterns towards more water nitrogen and labour demanding crops increasing the use of rib water also visibly increases the burden on the taxpayers as well as the average wdc the simulations of section 3 maintain unchanged the regional energy subsidies to the rib but require the full recovery of the enas costs even if at modulated farm tariffs the increase of water payments charges to agriculture a notable part of the burden to manage the dam despite the appreciable increase the limited importance of water payments on total farm income generates a very limited impact on the latter and the impact is similar across the different pricing systems the effects on resource use and efficiency of the rib water distribution accentuate the trends observed in previous simulations crop acreage and watering irrigated acreage have analogous impacts though the latter increases more the burden on farmers and conversely reduces more the use of resources and the average wdc of the rib the volumetric has the least impact on irrigation payments though notable and yet reduces more the use of rib water irrigable acreage acting as a fixed income levy maintains the same impact of the previous simulation which remains unchanged in the following section 4 reports the results at fcr by irrigation payments with elimination of energy subsidies to the rib and entire payment of the enas modulated rate the various pricing increase their impacts on net incomes and resources use but remain in the same mutual relationship of the previous cost recovery scenarios the only exception is that crop acreage is more incisive than watering irrigated acreage in increasing the irrigation payments and reducing the use of water from the rib conversely the latter pricing reduces more the average wdc increasing at a lesser extent the irrigation payments section 5 shows the results at fcr with enas non modulated agricultural rate farmers pay all the energy costs of rib as well as the costs of the sardinian water scheme currently charged to industrial users all pricing systems greatly reduce the agricultural income of the area because of the increase up to fourfold of the irrigation payments a heavy de intensification of cropping patterns is generated in all cases except irrigable acreage as already noted a drastic drop of the rib water use reaches up to 14 also appreciably decline groundwater extraction use of nitrogen and of labour irrigated acreage watering maintains a lead in the reduction of average wdc and as in previous case combines it with the smaller increase of the irrigation payments 4 2 impact on the farm typologies table 2 is similar to the previous ones the absolute values of the baseline refer to the average farm income of the types in decreasing order while the results of all the other pricing and cost recovery levels are percentage changes over the baseline section 2 shows that substituting the pricing at the current level of recovery may generate a certain for some pricing wide heterogeneity of income impacts on the single types yet in all the simulations the types with higher net income ni cattle breeding cata and catb and rice growing risp 20 20 these types represent 18 1 of farms and 54 9 of the rib area net income not reported in the table improve their condition while the other types always lose ni even notably 5 0 mixed crops type mix 3 2 3 sheep type sha hence the current crop acreage pricing supports the lower income farms the parameter on crop irrigation needs generates this support indeed irrigable acreage that applies the current parameter on the water distribution technology does not support the lower income farms this is due to the elimination of any link between water use and cost under this pricing that prevents farmers from making any adjustment in order to limit income impacts increasing the cost recovery level generally reduces farm incomes and gains of the higher ni types gradually narrow and finally become negative yet the considerations made in advance remain the crop acreage allows the types with lower ni to face milder impacts while the opposite happens with the other pricing again the greater redistributive effect is generated by applying the fixed fee of the irrigable acreage finally fcr generates appreciable income impacts in many cases even at modulated enas rates 13 1 sha 6 0 mix2 4 9 mix3 and grh implementing the non modulated farm rates generates significant impacts 15 5 catb 14 4 citr 14 0 grh and mix3 which in some cases become dramatic 31 9 sha we conclude with the impacts on the irrigation payments of the farm types that are immediately visible and comparable among farms and thus even more of income changes may alter the consent of farmers on the choices of the rib and of region about water resources management table 2a reports these impacts we note that changing the pricing section 2 would have very large negative effects always on farms with lower incomes these would increase greatly with irrigable acreage pursuing the fcr of enas cost would act in a more balanced way with the current pricing though in a wide range of 20 27 impacts disparities would become consistent with the other pricing systems and of course would grow by charging to farmers first also the entire wdc then also the enas cost at the non modulated rates in this latest simulation the current pricing would reach up to quadruple payment of the type with the lowest ni other pricing might result in increases of up to eight times the current level 5 discussion we used the translog function of giraldo et al 2014 to identify the wdc in the macro districts of the rib under the water demand conditions arising in the various simulations of pricing and cost recovery we interviewed local farmers and agricultural technicians to derive the crops water needs that integrated as coefficients of the dsp model generated the use conditions of water and the other resources based on these elements our results indicated that the coverage level of the oristanese rib s wdc is about 61 which is in the upper range of cost recovery cited by massarutto 2003 for southern italy irrigated ribs and very close to the range of the northern consortia in this context the current pricing system generates an indirect support to the lower ni farms by embodying social assessments that would not be met by the other pricing systems of this study adopt the latter would have a relatively limited impact on incomes instead the impact on irrigation payments would be considerable and above all would be very different between types primarily damaging the low income farms such payments are visible and comparable by farmers associated with the rib which may increase the disputes on redistributive effects of these other tariff systems maintaining the current pricing would cost since adopting irrigated acreage watering would reduce by 3 4 the average wdc as measured by our function this savings would reduce the inefficiencies that fcr charges to farmers approaching the condition of water tariffs that only include costs of efficient management massarutto 2007 this could at least partly balance the social impact of a different distribution of water cost among farmers other results address the various cost recovery levels the first concerns full debiting to farmers enas costs at modulated rates this option is causing right now appreciable tensions between farmers the rib enas and sardinia region la nova 2016 this allocation would have limited income impacts although significant on some farm types instead the impacts on irrigation payments would be high and even with the current pricing would affect many farms with low incomes the social visibility of this cost component is contributing to determine the mentioned disputes adopting our alternative pricing would further increase payments and much on low income farms continuing with cost recovery and transferring to farmers all the electricity costs for water pumping obviously would increase the impacts on farm incomes and irrigation payments along with the distribution divergences in this case changing also the pricing would lead to cases of extreme income impacts finally also abolishing the modulation of enas tariffs would reduce more than 10 income in many types to reach 30 in extreme cases even in this case coupling fcr to a pricing more directly linked to wdc might generate social tensions because neutralizes the current support to low ni farms other authors find that an exhaustive wfd policy might jeopardize sustainability of irrigated agriculture gómez limón and riesgo 2004 berbel et al 2011 tariff modulation appears essential for its impact it reflects the regional evaluation that the user cost in sardinia is mainly generated by the water pollution impact of industrial use while farming has a negative user cost because of its relatively lower impact hence the current crop acreage system supported by the regional contribution to electricity costs and the modulation of the rates to end users minimizes the economic and social impacts of water pricing and addresses the resource and environmental costs generated by the industrial sector the problem is to reconcile these aspects with the environmental issues precisely water protection and conservation that may be directly related to the farming activity in this regard the irrigated acreage watering and volumetric result to better fulfil the concerns of wfd indeed even at the current level of cost recovery the first one saves the rib water and causes a lower environmental pressure reducing the groundwater use and nitrogen the second one by relating payments to the use of the rib water reduces it even more but on the other hand increases the use of the other two resources these impacts on the resources use are emphasized at fcr where the extensification effect of the irrigated acreage watering is greatly reinforced while a notable capability of saving the sole rib water emerges for the volumetric 6 conclusions our assessment of various water pricing in an farming area of south italy confirms that a multi purpose policy as wfd requires the use of articulated tools we found that volumetric pricing generates savings of rib water but increases the use of chemicals and fails to reduce even increases groundwater use the large availability of rib water makes these relatively limited externalities yet the impact could be larger in a condition of scarcity irrigated acreage watering more properly considers the structure of water supply costs namely their relationship to the extension of the irrigated area this induces a more equilibrate de intensification of cropping activities which better controls groundwater and nitrogen use and reduces the aid requested to the taxpayers under partial cost recovery under fcr this has more limited impacts on farms even if causes the strongest negative impacts on labour employment the current crop acreage has an intermediate performance yet more than the other two minimizes social and economic impacts of water pricing as a general result a dichotomy emerges between fulfilling the environmental objectives of wfd and preventing intense social and economic negative impacts this type of analysis can help to specify the pricing policies of local water authorities making their watershed plans less descriptive this way their choices and actions will appear less arbitrary in mitigating social and economic impacts of water fcr acknowledgements the paper was carried out under macsur 1 and 2 d m 2660 7303 2012 and 24064 7303 2015 www macsur eu
