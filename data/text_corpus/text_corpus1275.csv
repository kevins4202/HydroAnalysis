6375,weather generators wgs are tools that create synthetic weather data which are statistically similar to the observed data considering the limitations of most rainfall generators to preserve satisfactorily the fundamental statistical properties e g spatial and temporal coherence simultaneously we propose a new framework for multisite rainfall generation the framework consists of three main components 1 a spatiotemporal rainfall field described as spatial modes and their corresponding temporal evolution based on empirical orthogonal function analysis eofa 2 the time series of these spatial modes decomposed into intrinsic mode functions imfs with characteristic frequencies periods using hilbert huang transform hht 3 stochastic simulation ss achieved by assigning random phases for the specific imfs the current model ehs eofa hht ss is compared with two other typical multi site rainfall generators mulgets parametric model and knn non parametric model for a network of 12 stations in xiang river basin china these three models are assessed based on their ability to simulate sequences with statistical attributes that are similar to those observed we compare the basic statistics mean standard deviation skewness extreme value characteristics 95th percentile and maximum spatial dependence spatial correlation and spatial continuity ratio and temporal dependence statistic autocorrelation wet dry spells and low frequency variability the results show that ehs rainfall generator has a similar capacity as knn model in reproducing the spatial structure of the original rainfall field and has a greater ability than mulgets and knn model to preserve the historical temporal statistics especially the autocorrelation at various time scales and low frequency variability overall ehs is a useful model for generating realistic multi site rainfall field and can be expected to generate plausible scenarios for impact studies keywords principal component analysis empirical

series of meteorological variables that have statistical properties similar to those of observed data and wgs can provide long synthetic time series of meteorological variables of interest representing a broad range of feasible meteorological scenarios this makes wg a useful tool for risk assessment in hydrological environmental ecological and agricultural applications among the meteorological variables precipitation is the most influential meteorological input to the impact models and is also the most challenging variable to model the focus of this paper is on the stochastic simulation of multi site daily precipitation there are currently two main classes of weather generators parametric and non parametric most parametric weather generators follow the richardson type wg richardson 1981 where precipitation occurrence is modeled with a markov chain and precipitation amount obeys a given distribution function the non parametric type of wgs is essentially a resampling model where the assumption of a specific probability distribution is avoided such as k nearest neighbor knn resampling method rajagopalan et al 1997 over the last several decades most weather generators are based on these two prototypes they are modified chen et al 2010 racsko et al 1991 or hybridized apipattanavis et al 2007 steinschneider and brown 2013 to solve one or several problems encountered in the previous wgs specifically a weakness of the richardson type wg is its failure to adequately depict the dry and wet spells so methods based on higher order markov chains e g chin 1977 or directly depending on spell lengths e g racsko et al 1991 were recommended to improve dry and wet spell performance another problem is the underestimation of extreme values because the commonly used exponential or gamma distribution does not yield heavy tailed extreme distribution observed in daily precipitation data an intuitive solution is to use heavy tailed extreme distributions to correct extremal behavior e g lennartsson et al 2008 or to introduce the non parametric modeling method e g knn resampling method to avoid specific distributional assumptions underestimation of the low frequency variability of monthly seasonal means katz and parlange 1998 is another common problem some post processing technologies were developed to preserve low frequency of climate variability chen et al 2010 fatichi et al 2011 khazaei et al 2013 wang and nathan 2007 most of the early stage weather generators are used at a single site independently of the others thus ignoring the spatial dependence exhibited by the observed data racsko et al 1991 richardson 1981 a big step forward in wg modeling and application was the extension of single site to multi site simulation buishand and brandsma 2001 wilks 1998 recently another big step was the extension from multi site daily simulation to gridded and or sub daily simulation paschalis et al 2013 peleg et al 2017 westra et al 2012 as far as the meteorological time series in the time domain is concerned characterizing the relationships between successive data values with the autocorrelation function is a common practice e g bardossy and plate 1992 due to the well known intrinsic connection between the autocorrelation and frequency spectrum of a time series data the time domain parameterization can be equivalently replaced with its conjugate in the frequency domain for instance the wiener khinchin theorem states that the autocorrelation and the spectral density function of a stationary time series form a fourier transformation pair actually fourier analysis has been used in dealing with weather data series for example the fourier spectra of observed monthly and annual time series were used to modulate the generated daily precipitation for preserving low frequency variability chen et al 2010 schoof et al 2005 developed a spectral weather generator to simulate the temperature based on its fourier spectral properties paschalis et al 2013 and peleg et al 2017 used fast fourier transform fft to model the areal precipitation in the frequency domain however the validity of using fourier analysis is restricted to presumably linear and stationary time series considering the non linearity and non stationarity of the natural weather climate system here we use a recently developed hilbert huang transform hht which can precisely capture the amplitude and frequency change with time thus preserving the temporal information to make a new framework for weather scenarios generation this hht based framework is expected to provide a new approach to cope with the heavy tail extremes and low frequency variability phenomena by the virtue of the inherent capability of hht to express non linearity and non stationarity in sequences in addition to the temporal coherence spatial coherence is also an essential feature of rainfall and of high hydrologically significance for example distributed hydrological modeling has been shown to depend on the spatial structure of precipitation field khalili et al 2011 li et al 2017 in order to consider the spatial coherence in our framework empirical orthogonal function analysis eofa is implemented before hht to transform the multi site rainfall field into spatial patterns defined by the empirical orthogonal functions eofs and the corresponding principal component time series pcs show the dynamics of such patterns for a natural weather climate process the observed time series can be regarded as a specific realization of the underlying random process due to the uniqueness and non repeatability of the natural process the task of stochastic weather generations is to build a stochastic process model to infer other potential realizations so after eofa and hht we adopt the stochastic simulation ss method to represent the underlying random process by introducing a random phase in this paper we first present this three stage framework eofa hht ss to generate multi site rainfall scenarios introduce and discuss the methodology and evaluate its performance in terms of reproducing the spatial and temporal attributes in south central china xiang river watershed the generated rainfall scenarios are also compared with a typical parametric mulgets model and a typical non parametric knn model the main objectives of this study are 1 to introduce a new framework ehs eofa hht ss for multi site stochastic rainfall generator 2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed ehs model in reproducing the statistical properties of the observed data by comparing to mugets and knn 2 study area and data this study was conducted over the xiang river basin fig 1 located in the eastern part of the hunan province south central china the drainage area of the xiang river basin is approximately 85 383 km2 spanning between 109 5 e 111 1 e longitude and 38 2 n 39 8 n latitude with a mainstream length of 842 km the study area is located in the humid subtropical climate zone from 1961 to 2010 the annual precipitation ranges from 1094 to 2065 mm most of the precipitation 69 occurs between march and august with the highest amount occurring in may 215 mm and the lowest occurring in december 53 mm for this study a 25 year record from 1961 to 1985 of daily precipitation at 12 stations was obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn the inter station distances between station pairs vary approximately from 20 to 270 km fig 1 table s1 in supplementary information gives the details of the rainfall stations and some summary statistics missing values at some stations totally 0 02 were filled in by average precipitation values of neighboring stations in this study the observed rainfall field matrix 9125 12 with the observation timeline in rows and the stations in columns hereafter denoted as r becomes the starting line of our proposed model for multi site stochastic rainfall generation 3 methodology 3 1 ehs eofa hht ss model the rainfall matrix r contains features of the spatiotemporal rainfall field for the study area strategically the ehs model starts with observation r and ends with a simulated counterpart denoted as r the proposed model couples empirical orthogonal function analysis eofa for preserving the spatial structure of the rainfall field with hilbert huang transform hht that effectively captures the temporal characteristics at various time scales stochastic simulation ss of the rainfall field is achieved by altering the original field by assigning random phases a flow diagram of the ehs modeling framework is illustrated in fig 2 and the sub models and algorithms are described in detail below 3 1 1 pre processing due to some special characteristics of the precipitation data some practical problems skewness and zero effect should be handled before implementing ehs method as shown in fig 3 a precipitation has many zero values and shows obvious skewness so here we use the censored latent gaussian transform method allard and bourotte 2015 baxevani and lennartsson 2015 to map between the original rainfall variable r and the latent gaussian variable z fig 3b eq 1 defines a latent gaussian variable z for which dry conditions r 0 correspond to censored values below a given threshold z0 positive rainfall amounts r1 are generated by a transformation of the gaussian value z1 above the threshold z0 a day is considered as a dry day or a wet day depending on whether the rainfall amount on that day is less than 0 1 mm or not respectively φ z0 is the proportion of dry days and φ denotes the cumulative distribution function cdf rm is the resolution of the rain gauge typically rm 0 1 mm habib et al 2001 the remaining a b c are the parameters of the transformation function an advantage of the present pre processing is that it does not require separate treatments for the rainfall occurrence and the corresponding rainfall amount as an example in station s4 fig 3c and d the transformed rainfall approximately obeys normal distribution all 12 stations pass the jarque bera test for normality at the significance level of 0 05 1 r r m b e a z z o c 1 z z 0 0 z z 0 3 1 2 empirical orthogonal function analysis eofa eofa also known as principal component analysis pca is widely used in the meteorological community it converts observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of mutually orthogonal variables eofs this transformation is defined so that the first eof accounts for the most variability in the dataset and each succeeding eof accounts for less hence eof analysis provides a way to reduce the field dimension by retaining only a small number of eofs as a major component of the ehs method the eofa method is briefly discussed as follows the original rainfall field matrix r is first standardized into a normalized matrix z by the censored latent gaussian transform method mentioned in subsection 3 1 1 then z is subjected to an eofa to produce mutually orthogonal modes eofs and their time series pcs for any zij of z it relates to the eof and pc by eq 2 2 z ij k 1 m p c ik e o f jk where the subscript i refers to the time index e g i th day j indexes the stations and k indexes the eofs with the total number of m the variable eof jk and its correponding pc ik denote the loadings and the score respectively with the former reflecting the coefficient of linear correlation between the j th station value and k th pc and the latter representing the scores of the k th eof on the i th day e g the pcs and eofs for current study please refer to fig 4 due to the nonlinear and nonstationary behaviors of these pc time series the traditional time series processors such as fourier analysis or wavelet analysis are of limited use as discussed by huang et al 1996 1998 so here we adopt the hht to analyze the pc time series 3 1 3 hilbert huang transform hht hht consists of empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1996 1998 and hilbert spectral analysis hsa it is an emerging empirical and adaptive method suitable for analyzing data from nonstationary and nonlinear processes huang et al 2009 kuai and tsai 2012 wu et al 2007 as a critical tool for hht the emd decomposes a time series into a finite and often small number of component sequences called intrinsic mode functions imfs the imf by virtue of its definition can be processed with the hht to yield a changing amplitude time series and simultaneously an instantaneous frequency time series both being nonstationary per se the final outcome of hht is a time frequency energy distribution designated as the hilbert spectrum examination of the hilbert spectrum allows sharp identifications of locally embedded structures and abrupt changes in the frequency and or amplitude domains huang et al 1998 3 1 3 1 empirical mode decomposition emd emd is technically a sifting process by which a data series is decomposed into a set of imfs an imf is defined as a function that satisfies the following two requirements 1 in the entire dataset the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must either equal or differ at most by one and 2 at any point the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined by the local minima is zero the sifting starts with identifying all the local extrema both the peak and the trough with which the upper and lower envelopes are formed the mean of the upper and lower envelopes is then used to subtract the pc time series and obtain a proto imf by iterating the sifting process several times the resultant series becomes good enough to meet the requirement of the imf and this imf becomes the first imf component denoted as imf1 overall the imf1 contains the finest scale highest frequency component of the pc time series subtracting imf1 from the original data pc t eq 3 leaves a remainder denoted as r 1 containing the lower frequency components 3 pc t i m f 1 r 1 the data series of r 1 can be again sifted to produce the second imf imf2 and its subtraction leads to a new residual series r 2 which contains still lower frequency components if we repeat the sifting subtracting processes until the residue r n becomes a constant or a monotonic function or a function with only one maximum and one minimum from which no more imf can be extracted thus the original data series pc is sequentially decomposed into n imfs cl l 1 n and a final residue r n eq 4 4 p c t l 1 n im f l r n by generalizing all the m pcs the emd process can be written as eq 5 5 p c k t l 1 n im f k l r k n k 1 m to examine whether an imf obtained from emd contains a true signal or just a white noise component wu and huang 2004 developed a statistical significance test for imfs this test compares the spectral energy dependence on the mean period of the imfs to that of the white noise as fig 5 shows if the imf energy of the observed data with a certain mean period is located above the confidence level the corresponding imf is considered statistically significant at the given level p 0 05 in this study we use the variant version of emd namely the ensemble emd eemd eemd is a noise assisted emd method wu and huang 2008 which defines the true imfs as the mean of an ensemble of emd trials each consisting of the signal plus a white noise of finite amplitude and therefore is deemed to be more robust to imf mode mixing the general term emd implies eemd unless otherwise specified 3 1 3 2 hilbert spectral analysis hsa after emd each of the resultant imfs time series imf t is used to calculate its hilbert transform h imf t with eq 6 6 h i m f t 1 π i m f τ t τ d τ with this definition imf t and h imf t form a complex conjugate pair by introducing s t as defined in eq 7 7 s t i m f t i h i m f t a t e i θ t in which 8 a t im f 2 t h 2 i m f t 1 2 θ t arctan h i m f t i m f t and i 1 the instantaneous frequency can be defined as eq 9 9 f t 1 2 π d θ t dt where a t is the instantaneous amplitude θ t is the instantaneous phase function and f t is the instantaneous frequency after applying the hilbert transform to all of the imfs pertaining to one pc time series the original pcs as the sum of imfs and residues can be re expressed as eq 10 10 p c k t re l 1 n a k l t e i 2 π f k l t d t r k n t k 1 m where re denotes the real part of the complex eq 10 presents the final form of hht highlighting the amplitude and frequency of the emd derived empirical modes as functions of time the amplitude series a t and frequency series f t pertaining to certain imfs which still pertain to certain pcs are deemed to be sufficiently simple to allow analysis and modeling therefore eq 10 finalizes the dissolution stage eofa hht of the ehs method 3 1 4 stochastic simulation ss the observed meteorological data can be regarded as one and the only realization of the underlying random process of the natural weather system the task of weather generator is to elicit other realizations based on this sample by conserving the intrinsic law while simultaneously allowing the intrinsic randomness with this perception we introduce a random element φ to represent the underlying random process as wen and gu 2004 2009 11 p c k t re l 1 n a k l t e i 2 π f k l t d t φ k l r k n t k 1 m where φ is an independent random phase angle uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π with eq 11 a simulated pc can be generated by assigning random phases φs for the specific imfs all imfs tested as noises statistically significant see fig 5 are altered by assigning a random phase nonetheless the first imf resulted from hht i e imf1 which embodies the highest frequency component is always subjected to phase randomization regardless of the significance test table 2 the simulated pc time series is obtained as the sum of the simulated imf s and the original residue series putting the simulated pc s time series and the non simulated ones deemed less significant in the eofa together creates the simulated pcs matrix by multiplying the pcs matrix with the original eofs matrix which are obtained in the eofa stage the simulated normalized matrix z is obtained 3 1 5 post processing finally the inverse transform of eq 1 is implemented to transform the simulated normalized matrix z into the final simulated rainfall field r by randomly generating phases in the model many rainfall scenarios can be simulated that exhaustively explore potential futures that exhibit slight differences in nuanced climate characteristics please refer to fig 2 for an explanation of the post processing of ehs method 3 2 mulgets model as an extension of the single site richardson type weather generator mulgets is a multi site parametric wg for generating precipitation and temperature mulgets drives individual single site models with temporally independent but spatially correlated random numbers wilks 1998 similar to the conventional richardson type wg richardson 1981 precipitation occurrence whether a day is wet or dry and precipitation intensity amounts on wet days are modeled separately with the spatially corrected random field precipitation occurrence is first generated using a first order two state markov chain instead of generating daily precipitation intensity based on a single distribution mulgets uses a multi gamma distribution to address the spatial correlation of precipitation intensity for constructing the multi gamma distribution an occurrence index describing the spatial distribution of precipitation occurrence at a watershed is introduced the occurrence index which varies between zero precipitation occurs at only one station and one precipitation occurs at all stations is linked with the distribution parameters this means that larger precipitation amounts will be generated when many stations are wet large value of occurrence index full details of mulgets can be found in brissette et al 2007 chen et al 2014 and the main steps of the precipitation generation in mulgets are presented in the supplementary information section 2 3 3 knn model k nearest neighbor knn model is a non parametric wg that considers sampling with replacement of the daily rainfall from the historical records the spatial structure of the rainfall field is maintained by resampling simultaneously at all the stations to preserve the temporal correlations the resampling is conditioned on the days in the historical record that has similar characteristics as those of the previously simulated days the conditional probability f r t 1 r t is estimated based on the k nearest neighbors of the conditioning rainfall vector r t the k nearest neighbors of r t are selected in terms of the distance measures such as euclidean distance weighted by standard deviation buishand and brandsma 2001 rajagopalan and lall 1999 euclidean distance weighted by partial weights sharma and mehrotra 2014 sharma et al 2016 and mahalanobis distance yates et al 2003 in this study we use mahalanobis distance because it does not need standardizing or assigning weights beforehand main steps of the precipitation generation with the knn model can be found in supplementary information section 3 3 4 evaluation of models performance the aim in designing weather generators is to produce synthetic weather sequences that inherently resemble the historical records so that they can be used as meteorological inputs in various impact models the performances of ehs mulgets and knn model were compared using 25 year observed data from a network of 12 stations in the xiang river basin in china the following statistics summarized in table 1 were used to evaluate the generated rainfall sequences mean standard deviation and skewness of daily precipitation on a month by month basis 95th percentile 95p and maximum of 25 year daily precipitation series spatial coherence spatial correlation and spatial intermittence temporal coherence autocorrelation wet and dry spells and low frequency variability the indicators for spatial coherence and temporal coherence are specifically described below the spatial correlation sc is defined as the linear correlation coefficient of rainfall series between stations 12 sc c o r r r i r j where r denotes rainfall series and i and j index station number the spatial intermittence of the rainfall field is indicated by the spatial continuity ratio cr defined by wilks 1998 13 cr e r i r i 0 r j 0 e r i r i 0 r j 0 for each station pair cr defines the ratio of the precipitation mean at station i depending on whether station j is wet or dry the ratio will be small for highly correlated stations and large for stations that are weakly correlated it is used to evaluate the ability of models to reproduce the link between precipitation amounts and occurrences the sample autocorrelation ac l is used to evaluate the ability of rainfall generator to reproduce the temporal structure 14 a c l c o r r r t r t l where l denotes the time lag l of rainfall series various wet and dry spell lengths are compared between observation and simulation in this study 0 1 mm is used as a precipitation threshold for a wet and dry day low frequency variability is examined among the models defined as the inter annual variances of the monthly and seasonal precipitation total for a fair comparison of different models 100 simulations with 25 year long the length of the historical record generated by each model were conducted the above mentioned statistics based on these simulations were calculated and compared to those based on historical record observation in terms of a correlation coefficient cor and a mean absolute relative error mare as eq 15 15 mare 1 c i 1 c s i o i o i where o is the observed statistic s is the model simulated statistic c is the total number of combinations including different simulations stations and or months note that unless otherwise stated obs ehs mulgets and knn in the remainder of the paper refer to the observation ehs model simulation mulgets model simulation and knn model simulation respectively computer codes in matlab language of all the models used in the study are available with the authors and can be provided on request 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of the rainfall field the spatial correlation matrices of the original and transformed standardized rainfall field were first examined figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary information overall the pairwise correlations between closer stations were higher than those of the farther stations all correlation coefficients are significant p 0 05 ranging from 0 21 0 32 to 0 72 0 63 for the original transformed rainfall field the strong correlations across rainfall stations confirm the necessity of applying eofa as mentioned in subsection 3 1 2 to capture the spatial pattern of the rainfall field 4 1 1 characterization of three leading eofs implementing eofa on the observed rainfall field matrix gave rise to twelve eofs and corresponding pc series the first three eofs cumulatively accounted for 70 of the total variance fig 4 and we subjected the corresponding three pcs to further hilbert huang transform while left the remaining nine pcs intact by analyzing the coefficients of the leading eofs fig 4c e g the main spatial patterns of the rainfall field were identified the first eof fig 4c eof1 explained 55 0 of the total variance and represented a spatially consistent precipitation pattern mainly affected by the large scale weather system the second eof fig 4e eof2 explained 10 1 of the total variance and depicted a strong north south gradient of the rainfall field with opposite sign to the north and south refer to fig 1 for station locations the third eof fig 4g eof3 explained 4 7 of the total variance and displayed two obvious transitions in the watershed with positive coefficients in the northern and southern part and negative coefficients in the middle region 4 1 2 imfs of the three leading pc time series after implementing eemd on pc1 3 each pc time series is decomposed into twelve imfs and one residue and the representative imfs of pc1 are displayed in fig 5 a an inherent advantage of the eemd method is that each imf retains both the frequency and amplitude modulations according to the hht theory huang et al 1998 both the amplitude or energy the square of the amplitude and the frequency are functions of time indicating the local instantaneous characteristics of the pc time series nonetheless the mean amplitude and the mean frequency of imfs of pc1 3 table 2 present a quantitative comparison among the imfs in general the mean frequency of imf gradually decreases with emd progress imf number indicates emd progress see subsection 3 1 3 as expected although none of the imf series is stationary the amplitudes of imfs represent the strength of fluctuation and can provide insight into the underlying signals in combination with the imf frequencies for instance the imf10 of pc3 is the relatively energetic components pertaining to pc3 suggesting that pc3 experienced a periodic oscillation of approximately 5 88 years a statistical significance test was applied to determine whether the imf components contain physically meaningful information see table 2 as fig 5b shows imf10 12 of pc1 are detected as pure noise because they are below the 95 significance line it should be noted that the first imf i e imf1 of pc1 3 are all significantly different from noise which indicates that these highest frequency components are indeed reflecting the nature of the rainfall field notwithstanding the added white noise in eemd subsection 3 1 3 which are easily sifted into imf1 wu and huang 2008 as described in subsection 3 1 4 the three imf1s are all assigned random phases in the stochastic simulation 4 2 mean standard deviation and skewness of daily precipitation for each month the daily precipitation statistics namely the mean standard deviation and skewness of the model simulations are displayed in fig 6 as a comparison to those of the observation calculated for each month the mean standard deviation and skewness of daily precipitation in each month are quite well reproduced by ehs and knn model the mulgets model reproduces the mean and standard deviation well but tend to slightly underestimate the skewness which may become exaggerated for highly skewed precipitations the possible explanation is that the skewness of precipitation data cannot be well captured by the gamma distribution used by mulgets overall the average mare across the three statistics mean standard deviation and skewness has the lowest value for the ehs model 8 6 followed by knn 10 6 and mulgets 13 2 4 3 extreme value the ability of rainfall generator to reproduce extremes is important for risk assessment in the impact study we compare the performances of the rainfall generators in simulating the 95th percentile 95p and maximum as shown in fig 7 the asterisks denote the observation and the box plots represent the ranges of the 100 simulations and the 1 5 times interquartile 25th 75th percentile range is used to find the outliers plus signs it is apparent that the knn model underestimates the extreme value and this is attributed to the underlying nature of the knn resampling algorithm which chooses only from existing historical data when simulating rainfall both ehs and mulgets models are able to generate extreme values exceeding the historical records maximum the mare of 95p for ehs and mulgets are comparably small 3 14 and 3 12 in contrast to that for the knn 9 72 although obviously biased the mare of maximum for knn 10 13 seems smaller than those for ehs 20 56 and mulgets 21 51 overall ehs and mulgets are judged as better models than knn in simulating extreme value because more historical values fall within the interquartile range of the box plots 4 4 spatial coherence 4 4 1 spatial correlation accurate representation of the spatial correlation of rainfall field is vital in hydrological and agricultural applications fig 8 presents the scatter plots of between station precipitation correlation coefficients as modeled in comparison to those observed all the three models reasonably preserve the spatial correlations of precipitation across all the stations as indicated by the correlation coefficients being close to the 1 1 line 4 4 2 spatial intermittence precipitation is much more difficult to model than other meteorological variables like temperature because precipitation can rapidly vary in space and in time this problem was referred to as spatial intermittence by bardossy and plate 1992 who pointed out that failure to address it may lead to unrealistically sharp transitions between wet and dry portions in the spatial domain so the continuity ratio eq 13 is used to verify the performance of rainfall generators in dealing with the spatial intermittence problem the mare of the continuity ratio for ehs mulgets and knn is 14 9 25 2 and 6 7 respectively fig 9 despite the excellent reproduction of the spatial correlation by mulgets using a spatially correlated random number fig 8 the spatial intermittence feature of precipitation field is not properly preserved actually mulgets has tried to deal with the complex spatial intermittence problem by linking average and standard deviation of precipitation to an occurrence index eq 13 that describes the distribution of precipitation occurrence but there are many significant scatters in the mulgets result as discussed by brissette et al 2007 and chen et al 2014 some errors may be introduced when fitting the best lines between the means or standard deviations with the occurrence indexes especially when the fitting data points are scarce in contrast the knn performs best and shows little bias as the knn model considers precipitation occurrences and amounts concurrently at all the stations it naturally preserves the dependence between the stations for ehs spatial dependence is preserved by keeping the eofs unchanged specifically the linear eof coefficients of the original rainfall series to create new rainfall fields remain intact the result fig 9a shows ehs model does a reasonably good job at reproducing the continuity ratio of precipitation especially in the case of moderate continuity ratio in general ehs and knn provide a better framework for the spatial coherent generation of multi site rainfall field by providing synthetic data that adequately reproduce the spatial correlation and well address the spatial intermittence problem 4 5 temporal coherence 4 5 1 autocorrelation autocorrelation commonly exists in the meteorological time series so the synthetic and observed weather data are required to be consistent with respect to autocorrelation at different time scales however the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficients of simulations of mulgets and knn are obviously biased as they are always smaller than those of the observation fig 10 in contrast ehs performed best because every station has the ehs simulated lag 1 autocorrelation value in terms of the interquartile range catching up closely its historical lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient the better performance of ehs is not surprising because ehs model decomposes the repeated patterns autocorrelations of time series into multiple but finite components imfs each of which associates with certain characteristic frequencies to demonstrate the inherent advantage of ehs in simulating the temporal structure a comparison is made between the observed and modeled sample autocorrelation function of daily monthly and seasonal precipitation the lag 1 autocorrelation for station s4 0 19 is the strongest autocorrelation of daily precipitation fig 11 a for monthly precipitation the strongest autocorrelation 0 32 appears in 36 month 3 years lag fig 11e similarly seasonal precipitation has the strongest autocorrelation 0 51 with 12 season 3 years lag fig 11i it indicates that a strong 3 year cycle exists in the original precipitation time series and such temporal features should be reproduced in the rainfall generator as shown in fig 11 ehs performs much better than mulgets and knn to adequately reproduce the autocorrelation of daily monthly and seasonal precipitation in the framework of ehs autocorrelations at various lags represented as the imfs of different frequencies are indeed reserved by assigning random phases for imf components 4 5 2 wet and dry spells sequences of wet and dry days are critical for plant growth and algae reproduction and underestimation of wet and dry spells can have a significant impact on crop and aquatic ecosystem modeling for wet spells mulgets has the smallest mare 28 5 followed by ehs 47 4 and knn 76 0 fig 12 a the wet spells of both short and long durations are best modeled by mulgets in contrast ehs and knn tend to overestimate the frequency of isolated wet spell run 1 d and to underestimate the long length e g run 14 d wet periods for dry spells the best mare goes to ehs 28 2 followed by mulgets 30 4 and knn 46 8 fig 12b again mulgets performs better than ehs and knn in reproducing the isolated wet spell run 1 d however there is a tendency across the three models to underestimate the dry spells especially the longest dry spell run 28 d 4 5 3 low frequency variability overdispersion phenomenon it is important that models are able to simulate the natural low frequency variability e g inter annual variance especially in the impact study of climate change however underestimation of the low frequency variability also known as overdispersion phenomenon is one of the well known problems of the conventional weather generators gregory et al 1993 katz and parlange 1998 katz and zheng 1999 wilks 1999 in light of the knowledge that an observed inter annual variance consists of contributions from both high frequency day to day variations and from lower frequency variations one explanation of the low frequency variability underestimation will be the inadequate capability of certain wgs in modeling moderate or high frequency components which is ostensibly emerging as the overdispersion phenomenon katz and parlange 1998 wilks 1999 nonetheless a more fundamental reason for the missing low frequency variability is known to be the assumption adopted in the conventional wgs methodology that the climate and more specifically the daily precipitation process is stationary or approximately stationary though it is authentically not most wg models such as mulgets do not explicitly take into account the aspects of low frequency variability such as decadal oscillations and thus underestimate the year to year or longer variances for example the typical markov chain model uses multi year average parameters e g transition probability distribution parameters which hastily disregards the year to year variations thus it is not surprising that mulgets underestimates the inter annual variability of both monthly and seasonal precipitation total fig 13 similarly the knn resampling procedure indiscriminately chooses the potential nearest neighbors from the multi year windows without taking note of the between year differences inter annual correlation and such a permutation of inter annual data weakens if not diminishes the low frequency variability fig 13 compared with these time domain approaches ehs performs much better to adequately reproduce the year to year variations of monthly and seasonal precipitation total because the so called inter annual or longer variabilities are essentially the same as the imfs with low frequencies see table 2 actually as a frequency domain approach ehs exhibits an intrinsic capability to consider the oscillations of all frequencies in the original data although results are not presented it should be noted that the variance of biennially or even multiannual precipitation total is also significantly preserved 5 conclusions in this paper a new framework ehs for multi site stochastic rainfall generation is presented this ehs rainfall generator applies eofa and hht in sequence to parse the spatiotemporal rainfall field into spatial patterns and multiple time scale components series plausible rainfall scenarios are stochastically simulated by assigning random phases to the selected imfs which can mostly retain statistical characteristics of the original rainfall field this model was compared with mulgets and knn on the basis of how well the statistical properties are preserved the comparison results show that the ehs rainfall generator has greater ability to reproduce the various statistics of interest as previously proved as a frequency domain approach the big advantage of ehs model stems from its capability to preserve satisfactorily key statistical properties of the temporal structure simultaneously at various daily monthly and annual time scales the experiments of model comparison also demonstrate that ehs model has a comparable capacity as knn model in reproducing the spatial structure of the original rainfall field through this preliminary demonstration the method has exhibited promise for its use in generating plausible rainfall scenarios for the impact studies moreover the scale free nature of hht method may allow the models under ehs framework to become high resolution wgs e g gridded and sub daily which are of increasing interests and growing needs in many applications although not shown explicitly here the ehs framework may accomplish such tasks by for example adaptively decomposing the sub daily series into imfs with finer frequencies and interpolating the eofs spatial pattern on gauge scale into spatial grids which are subsequently used to generate rainfall sequences for each grid in addition as an adaptive data driven method the ehs framework is quite flexible and easy to introduce new weather variables this adaptive feature makes the ehs model an attractive procedure to generate weather series based on modeling purposes and data availability so the extension of the model to include other weather variables e g temperature solar radiation and wind etc will also be the subject of our future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this research was jointly supported

6375,weather generators wgs are tools that create synthetic weather data which are statistically similar to the observed data considering the limitations of most rainfall generators to preserve satisfactorily the fundamental statistical properties e g spatial and temporal coherence simultaneously we propose a new framework for multisite rainfall generation the framework consists of three main components 1 a spatiotemporal rainfall field described as spatial modes and their corresponding temporal evolution based on empirical orthogonal function analysis eofa 2 the time series of these spatial modes decomposed into intrinsic mode functions imfs with characteristic frequencies periods using hilbert huang transform hht 3 stochastic simulation ss achieved by assigning random phases for the specific imfs the current model ehs eofa hht ss is compared with two other typical multi site rainfall generators mulgets parametric model and knn non parametric model for a network of 12 stations in xiang river basin china these three models are assessed based on their ability to simulate sequences with statistical attributes that are similar to those observed we compare the basic statistics mean standard deviation skewness extreme value characteristics 95th percentile and maximum spatial dependence spatial correlation and spatial continuity ratio and temporal dependence statistic autocorrelation wet dry spells and low frequency variability the results show that ehs rainfall generator has a similar capacity as knn model in reproducing the spatial structure of the original rainfall field and has a greater ability than mulgets and knn model to preserve the historical temporal statistics especially the autocorrelation at various time scales and low frequency variability overall ehs is a useful model for generating realistic multi site rainfall field and can be expected to generate plausible scenarios for impact studies keywords principal component analysis empirical

series of meteorological variables that have statistical properties similar to those of observed data and wgs can provide long synthetic time series of meteorological variables of interest representing a broad range of feasible meteorological scenarios this makes wg a useful tool for risk assessment in hydrological environmental ecological and agricultural applications among the meteorological variables precipitation is the most influential meteorological input to the impact models and is also the most challenging variable to model the focus of this paper is on the stochastic simulation of multi site daily precipitation there are currently two main classes of weather generators parametric and non parametric most parametric weather generators follow the richardson type wg richardson 1981 where precipitation occurrence is modeled with a markov chain and precipitation amount obeys a given distribution function the non parametric type of wgs is essentially a resampling model where the assumption of a specific probability distribution is avoided such as k nearest neighbor knn resampling method rajagopalan et al 1997 over the last several decades most weather generators are based on these two prototypes they are modified chen et al 2010 racsko et al 1991 or hybridized apipattanavis et al 2007 steinschneider and brown 2013 to solve one or several problems encountered in the previous wgs specifically a weakness of the richardson type wg is its failure to adequately depict the dry and wet spells so methods based on higher order markov chains e g chin 1977 or directly depending on spell lengths e g racsko et al 1991 were recommended to improve dry and wet spell performance another problem is the underestimation of extreme values because the commonly used exponential or gamma distribution does not yield heavy tailed extreme distribution observed in daily precipitation data an intuitive solution is to use heavy tailed extreme distributions to correct extremal behavior e g lennartsson et al 2008 or to introduce the non parametric modeling method e g knn resampling method to avoid specific distributional assumptions underestimation of the low frequency variability of monthly seasonal means katz and parlange 1998 is another common problem some post processing technologies were developed to preserve low frequency of climate variability chen et al 2010 fatichi et al 2011 khazaei et al 2013 wang and nathan 2007 most of the early stage weather generators are used at a single site independently of the others thus ignoring the spatial dependence exhibited by the observed data racsko et al 1991 richardson 1981 a big step forward in wg modeling and application was the extension of single site to multi site simulation buishand and brandsma 2001 wilks 1998 recently another big step was the extension from multi site daily simulation to gridded and or sub daily simulation paschalis et al 2013 peleg et al 2017 westra et al 2012 as far as the meteorological time series in the time domain is concerned characterizing the relationships between successive data values with the autocorrelation function is a common practice e g bardossy and plate 1992 due to the well known intrinsic connection between the autocorrelation and frequency spectrum of a time series data the time domain parameterization can be equivalently replaced with its conjugate in the frequency domain for instance the wiener khinchin theorem states that the autocorrelation and the spectral density function of a stationary time series form a fourier transformation pair actually fourier analysis has been used in dealing with weather data series for example the fourier spectra of observed monthly and annual time series were used to modulate the generated daily precipitation for preserving low frequency variability chen et al 2010 schoof et al 2005 developed a spectral weather generator to simulate the temperature based on its fourier spectral properties paschalis et al 2013 and peleg et al 2017 used fast fourier transform fft to model the areal precipitation in the frequency domain however the validity of using fourier analysis is restricted to presumably linear and stationary time series considering the non linearity and non stationarity of the natural weather climate system here we use a recently developed hilbert huang transform hht which can precisely capture the amplitude and frequency change with time thus preserving the temporal information to make a new framework for weather scenarios generation this hht based framework is expected to provide a new approach to cope with the heavy tail extremes and low frequency variability phenomena by the virtue of the inherent capability of hht to express non linearity and non stationarity in sequences in addition to the temporal coherence spatial coherence is also an essential feature of rainfall and of high hydrologically significance for example distributed hydrological modeling has been shown to depend on the spatial structure of precipitation field khalili et al 2011 li et al 2017 in order to consider the spatial coherence in our framework empirical orthogonal function analysis eofa is implemented before hht to transform the multi site rainfall field into spatial patterns defined by the empirical orthogonal functions eofs and the corresponding principal component time series pcs show the dynamics of such patterns for a natural weather climate process the observed time series can be regarded as a specific realization of the underlying random process due to the uniqueness and non repeatability of the natural process the task of stochastic weather generations is to build a stochastic process model to infer other potential realizations so after eofa and hht we adopt the stochastic simulation ss method to represent the underlying random process by introducing a random phase in this paper we first present this three stage framework eofa hht ss to generate multi site rainfall scenarios introduce and discuss the methodology and evaluate its performance in terms of reproducing the spatial and temporal attributes in south central china xiang river watershed the generated rainfall scenarios are also compared with a typical parametric mulgets model and a typical non parametric knn model the main objectives of this study are 1 to introduce a new framework ehs eofa hht ss for multi site stochastic rainfall generator 2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed ehs model in reproducing the statistical properties of the observed data by comparing to mugets and knn 2 study area and data this study was conducted over the xiang river basin fig 1 located in the eastern part of the hunan province south central china the drainage area of the xiang river basin is approximately 85 383 km2 spanning between 109 5 e 111 1 e longitude and 38 2 n 39 8 n latitude with a mainstream length of 842 km the study area is located in the humid subtropical climate zone from 1961 to 2010 the annual precipitation ranges from 1094 to 2065 mm most of the precipitation 69 occurs between march and august with the highest amount occurring in may 215 mm and the lowest occurring in december 53 mm for this study a 25 year record from 1961 to 1985 of daily precipitation at 12 stations was obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn the inter station distances between station pairs vary approximately from 20 to 270 km fig 1 table s1 in supplementary information gives the details of the rainfall stations and some summary statistics missing values at some stations totally 0 02 were filled in by average precipitation values of neighboring stations in this study the observed rainfall field matrix 9125 12 with the observation timeline in rows and the stations in columns hereafter denoted as r becomes the starting line of our proposed model for multi site stochastic rainfall generation 3 methodology 3 1 ehs eofa hht ss model the rainfall matrix r contains features of the spatiotemporal rainfall field for the study area strategically the ehs model starts with observation r and ends with a simulated counterpart denoted as r the proposed model couples empirical orthogonal function analysis eofa for preserving the spatial structure of the rainfall field with hilbert huang transform hht that effectively captures the temporal characteristics at various time scales stochastic simulation ss of the rainfall field is achieved by altering the original field by assigning random phases a flow diagram of the ehs modeling framework is illustrated in fig 2 and the sub models and algorithms are described in detail below 3 1 1 pre processing due to some special characteristics of the precipitation data some practical problems skewness and zero effect should be handled before implementing ehs method as shown in fig 3 a precipitation has many zero values and shows obvious skewness so here we use the censored latent gaussian transform method allard and bourotte 2015 baxevani and lennartsson 2015 to map between the original rainfall variable r and the latent gaussian variable z fig 3b eq 1 defines a latent gaussian variable z for which dry conditions r 0 correspond to censored values below a given threshold z0 positive rainfall amounts r1 are generated by a transformation of the gaussian value z1 above the threshold z0 a day is considered as a dry day or a wet day depending on whether the rainfall amount on that day is less than 0 1 mm or not respectively φ z0 is the proportion of dry days and φ denotes the cumulative distribution function cdf rm is the resolution of the rain gauge typically rm 0 1 mm habib et al 2001 the remaining a b c are the parameters of the transformation function an advantage of the present pre processing is that it does not require separate treatments for the rainfall occurrence and the corresponding rainfall amount as an example in station s4 fig 3c and d the transformed rainfall approximately obeys normal distribution all 12 stations pass the jarque bera test for normality at the significance level of 0 05 1 r r m b e a z z o c 1 z z 0 0 z z 0 3 1 2 empirical orthogonal function analysis eofa eofa also known as principal component analysis pca is widely used in the meteorological community it converts observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of mutually orthogonal variables eofs this transformation is defined so that the first eof accounts for the most variability in the dataset and each succeeding eof accounts for less hence eof analysis provides a way to reduce the field dimension by retaining only a small number of eofs as a major component of the ehs method the eofa method is briefly discussed as follows the original rainfall field matrix r is first standardized into a normalized matrix z by the censored latent gaussian transform method mentioned in subsection 3 1 1 then z is subjected to an eofa to produce mutually orthogonal modes eofs and their time series pcs for any zij of z it relates to the eof and pc by eq 2 2 z ij k 1 m p c ik e o f jk where the subscript i refers to the time index e g i th day j indexes the stations and k indexes the eofs with the total number of m the variable eof jk and its correponding pc ik denote the loadings and the score respectively with the former reflecting the coefficient of linear correlation between the j th station value and k th pc and the latter representing the scores of the k th eof on the i th day e g the pcs and eofs for current study please refer to fig 4 due to the nonlinear and nonstationary behaviors of these pc time series the traditional time series processors such as fourier analysis or wavelet analysis are of limited use as discussed by huang et al 1996 1998 so here we adopt the hht to analyze the pc time series 3 1 3 hilbert huang transform hht hht consists of empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1996 1998 and hilbert spectral analysis hsa it is an emerging empirical and adaptive method suitable for analyzing data from nonstationary and nonlinear processes huang et al 2009 kuai and tsai 2012 wu et al 2007 as a critical tool for hht the emd decomposes a time series into a finite and often small number of component sequences called intrinsic mode functions imfs the imf by virtue of its definition can be processed with the hht to yield a changing amplitude time series and simultaneously an instantaneous frequency time series both being nonstationary per se the final outcome of hht is a time frequency energy distribution designated as the hilbert spectrum examination of the hilbert spectrum allows sharp identifications of locally embedded structures and abrupt changes in the frequency and or amplitude domains huang et al 1998 3 1 3 1 empirical mode decomposition emd emd is technically a sifting process by which a data series is decomposed into a set of imfs an imf is defined as a function that satisfies the following two requirements 1 in the entire dataset the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must either equal or differ at most by one and 2 at any point the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined by the local minima is zero the sifting starts with identifying all the local extrema both the peak and the trough with which the upper and lower envelopes are formed the mean of the upper and lower envelopes is then used to subtract the pc time series and obtain a proto imf by iterating the sifting process several times the resultant series becomes good enough to meet the requirement of the imf and this imf becomes the first imf component denoted as imf1 overall the imf1 contains the finest scale highest frequency component of the pc time series subtracting imf1 from the original data pc t eq 3 leaves a remainder denoted as r 1 containing the lower frequency components 3 pc t i m f 1 r 1 the data series of r 1 can be again sifted to produce the second imf imf2 and its subtraction leads to a new residual series r 2 which contains still lower frequency components if we repeat the sifting subtracting processes until the residue r n becomes a constant or a monotonic function or a function with only one maximum and one minimum from which no more imf can be extracted thus the original data series pc is sequentially decomposed into n imfs cl l 1 n and a final residue r n eq 4 4 p c t l 1 n im f l r n by generalizing all the m pcs the emd process can be written as eq 5 5 p c k t l 1 n im f k l r k n k 1 m to examine whether an imf obtained from emd contains a true signal or just a white noise component wu and huang 2004 developed a statistical significance test for imfs this test compares the spectral energy dependence on the mean period of the imfs to that of the white noise as fig 5 shows if the imf energy of the observed data with a certain mean period is located above the confidence level the corresponding imf is considered statistically significant at the given level p 0 05 in this study we use the variant version of emd namely the ensemble emd eemd eemd is a noise assisted emd method wu and huang 2008 which defines the true imfs as the mean of an ensemble of emd trials each consisting of the signal plus a white noise of finite amplitude and therefore is deemed to be more robust to imf mode mixing the general term emd implies eemd unless otherwise specified 3 1 3 2 hilbert spectral analysis hsa after emd each of the resultant imfs time series imf t is used to calculate its hilbert transform h imf t with eq 6 6 h i m f t 1 π i m f τ t τ d τ with this definition imf t and h imf t form a complex conjugate pair by introducing s t as defined in eq 7 7 s t i m f t i h i m f t a t e i θ t in which 8 a t im f 2 t h 2 i m f t 1 2 θ t arctan h i m f t i m f t and i 1 the instantaneous frequency can be defined as eq 9 9 f t 1 2 π d θ t dt where a t is the instantaneous amplitude θ t is the instantaneous phase function and f t is the instantaneous frequency after applying the hilbert transform to all of the imfs pertaining to one pc time series the original pcs as the sum of imfs and residues can be re expressed as eq 10 10 p c k t re l 1 n a k l t e i 2 π f k l t d t r k n t k 1 m where re denotes the real part of the complex eq 10 presents the final form of hht highlighting the amplitude and frequency of the emd derived empirical modes as functions of time the amplitude series a t and frequency series f t pertaining to certain imfs which still pertain to certain pcs are deemed to be sufficiently simple to allow analysis and modeling therefore eq 10 finalizes the dissolution stage eofa hht of the ehs method 3 1 4 stochastic simulation ss the observed meteorological data can be regarded as one and the only realization of the underlying random process of the natural weather system the task of weather generator is to elicit other realizations based on this sample by conserving the intrinsic law while simultaneously allowing the intrinsic randomness with this perception we introduce a random element φ to represent the underlying random process as wen and gu 2004 2009 11 p c k t re l 1 n a k l t e i 2 π f k l t d t φ k l r k n t k 1 m where φ is an independent random phase angle uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π with eq 11 a simulated pc can be generated by assigning random phases φs for the specific imfs all imfs tested as noises statistically significant see fig 5 are altered by assigning a random phase nonetheless the first imf resulted from hht i e imf1 which embodies the highest frequency component is always subjected to phase randomization regardless of the significance test table 2 the simulated pc time series is obtained as the sum of the simulated imf s and the original residue series putting the simulated pc s time series and the non simulated ones deemed less significant in the eofa together creates the simulated pcs matrix by multiplying the pcs matrix with the original eofs matrix which are obtained in the eofa stage the simulated normalized matrix z is obtained 3 1 5 post processing finally the inverse transform of eq 1 is implemented to transform the simulated normalized matrix z into the final simulated rainfall field r by randomly generating phases in the model many rainfall scenarios can be simulated that exhaustively explore potential futures that exhibit slight differences in nuanced climate characteristics please refer to fig 2 for an explanation of the post processing of ehs method 3 2 mulgets model as an extension of the single site richardson type weather generator mulgets is a multi site parametric wg for generating precipitation and temperature mulgets drives individual single site models with temporally independent but spatially correlated random numbers wilks 1998 similar to the conventional richardson type wg richardson 1981 precipitation occurrence whether a day is wet or dry and precipitation intensity amounts on wet days are modeled separately with the spatially corrected random field precipitation occurrence is first generated using a first order two state markov chain instead of generating daily precipitation intensity based on a single distribution mulgets uses a multi gamma distribution to address the spatial correlation of precipitation intensity for constructing the multi gamma distribution an occurrence index describing the spatial distribution of precipitation occurrence at a watershed is introduced the occurrence index which varies between zero precipitation occurs at only one station and one precipitation occurs at all stations is linked with the distribution parameters this means that larger precipitation amounts will be generated when many stations are wet large value of occurrence index full details of mulgets can be found in brissette et al 2007 chen et al 2014 and the main steps of the precipitation generation in mulgets are presented in the supplementary information section 2 3 3 knn model k nearest neighbor knn model is a non parametric wg that considers sampling with replacement of the daily rainfall from the historical records the spatial structure of the rainfall field is maintained by resampling simultaneously at all the stations to preserve the temporal correlations the resampling is conditioned on the days in the historical record that has similar characteristics as those of the previously simulated days the conditional probability f r t 1 r t is estimated based on the k nearest neighbors of the conditioning rainfall vector r t the k nearest neighbors of r t are selected in terms of the distance measures such as euclidean distance weighted by standard deviation buishand and brandsma 2001 rajagopalan and lall 1999 euclidean distance weighted by partial weights sharma and mehrotra 2014 sharma et al 2016 and mahalanobis distance yates et al 2003 in this study we use mahalanobis distance because it does not need standardizing or assigning weights beforehand main steps of the precipitation generation with the knn model can be found in supplementary information section 3 3 4 evaluation of models performance the aim in designing weather generators is to produce synthetic weather sequences that inherently resemble the historical records so that they can be used as meteorological inputs in various impact models the performances of ehs mulgets and knn model were compared using 25 year observed data from a network of 12 stations in the xiang river basin in china the following statistics summarized in table 1 were used to evaluate the generated rainfall sequences mean standard deviation and skewness of daily precipitation on a month by month basis 95th percentile 95p and maximum of 25 year daily precipitation series spatial coherence spatial correlation and spatial intermittence temporal coherence autocorrelation wet and dry spells and low frequency variability the indicators for spatial coherence and temporal coherence are specifically described below the spatial correlation sc is defined as the linear correlation coefficient of rainfall series between stations 12 sc c o r r r i r j where r denotes rainfall series and i and j index station number the spatial intermittence of the rainfall field is indicated by the spatial continuity ratio cr defined by wilks 1998 13 cr e r i r i 0 r j 0 e r i r i 0 r j 0 for each station pair cr defines the ratio of the precipitation mean at station i depending on whether station j is wet or dry the ratio will be small for highly correlated stations and large for stations that are weakly correlated it is used to evaluate the ability of models to reproduce the link between precipitation amounts and occurrences the sample autocorrelation ac l is used to evaluate the ability of rainfall generator to reproduce the temporal structure 14 a c l c o r r r t r t l where l denotes the time lag l of rainfall series various wet and dry spell lengths are compared between observation and simulation in this study 0 1 mm is used as a precipitation threshold for a wet and dry day low frequency variability is examined among the models defined as the inter annual variances of the monthly and seasonal precipitation total for a fair comparison of different models 100 simulations with 25 year long the length of the historical record generated by each model were conducted the above mentioned statistics based on these simulations were calculated and compared to those based on historical record observation in terms of a correlation coefficient cor and a mean absolute relative error mare as eq 15 15 mare 1 c i 1 c s i o i o i where o is the observed statistic s is the model simulated statistic c is the total number of combinations including different simulations stations and or months note that unless otherwise stated obs ehs mulgets and knn in the remainder of the paper refer to the observation ehs model simulation mulgets model simulation and knn model simulation respectively computer codes in matlab language of all the models used in the study are available with the authors and can be provided on request 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of the rainfall field the spatial correlation matrices of the original and transformed standardized rainfall field were first examined figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary information overall the pairwise correlations between closer stations were higher than those of the farther stations all correlation coefficients are significant p 0 05 ranging from 0 21 0 32 to 0 72 0 63 for the original transformed rainfall field the strong correlations across rainfall stations confirm the necessity of applying eofa as mentioned in subsection 3 1 2 to capture the spatial pattern of the rainfall field 4 1 1 characterization of three leading eofs implementing eofa on the observed rainfall field matrix gave rise to twelve eofs and corresponding pc series the first three eofs cumulatively accounted for 70 of the total variance fig 4 and we subjected the corresponding three pcs to further hilbert huang transform while left the remaining nine pcs intact by analyzing the coefficients of the leading eofs fig 4c e g the main spatial patterns of the rainfall field were identified the first eof fig 4c eof1 explained 55 0 of the total variance and represented a spatially consistent precipitation pattern mainly affected by the large scale weather system the second eof fig 4e eof2 explained 10 1 of the total variance and depicted a strong north south gradient of the rainfall field with opposite sign to the north and south refer to fig 1 for station locations the third eof fig 4g eof3 explained 4 7 of the total variance and displayed two obvious transitions in the watershed with positive coefficients in the northern and southern part and negative coefficients in the middle region 4 1 2 imfs of the three leading pc time series after implementing eemd on pc1 3 each pc time series is decomposed into twelve imfs and one residue and the representative imfs of pc1 are displayed in fig 5 a an inherent advantage of the eemd method is that each imf retains both the frequency and amplitude modulations according to the hht theory huang et al 1998 both the amplitude or energy the square of the amplitude and the frequency are functions of time indicating the local instantaneous characteristics of the pc time series nonetheless the mean amplitude and the mean frequency of imfs of pc1 3 table 2 present a quantitative comparison among the imfs in general the mean frequency of imf gradually decreases with emd progress imf number indicates emd progress see subsection 3 1 3 as expected although none of the imf series is stationary the amplitudes of imfs represent the strength of fluctuation and can provide insight into the underlying signals in combination with the imf frequencies for instance the imf10 of pc3 is the relatively energetic components pertaining to pc3 suggesting that pc3 experienced a periodic oscillation of approximately 5 88 years a statistical significance test was applied to determine whether the imf components contain physically meaningful information see table 2 as fig 5b shows imf10 12 of pc1 are detected as pure noise because they are below the 95 significance line it should be noted that the first imf i e imf1 of pc1 3 are all significantly different from noise which indicates that these highest frequency components are indeed reflecting the nature of the rainfall field notwithstanding the added white noise in eemd subsection 3 1 3 which are easily sifted into imf1 wu and huang 2008 as described in subsection 3 1 4 the three imf1s are all assigned random phases in the stochastic simulation 4 2 mean standard deviation and skewness of daily precipitation for each month the daily precipitation statistics namely the mean standard deviation and skewness of the model simulations are displayed in fig 6 as a comparison to those of the observation calculated for each month the mean standard deviation and skewness of daily precipitation in each month are quite well reproduced by ehs and knn model the mulgets model reproduces the mean and standard deviation well but tend to slightly underestimate the skewness which may become exaggerated for highly skewed precipitations the possible explanation is that the skewness of precipitation data cannot be well captured by the gamma distribution used by mulgets overall the average mare across the three statistics mean standard deviation and skewness has the lowest value for the ehs model 8 6 followed by knn 10 6 and mulgets 13 2 4 3 extreme value the ability of rainfall generator to reproduce extremes is important for risk assessment in the impact study we compare the performances of the rainfall generators in simulating the 95th percentile 95p and maximum as shown in fig 7 the asterisks denote the observation and the box plots represent the ranges of the 100 simulations and the 1 5 times interquartile 25th 75th percentile range is used to find the outliers plus signs it is apparent that the knn model underestimates the extreme value and this is attributed to the underlying nature of the knn resampling algorithm which chooses only from existing historical data when simulating rainfall both ehs and mulgets models are able to generate extreme values exceeding the historical records maximum the mare of 95p for ehs and mulgets are comparably small 3 14 and 3 12 in contrast to that for the knn 9 72 although obviously biased the mare of maximum for knn 10 13 seems smaller than those for ehs 20 56 and mulgets 21 51 overall ehs and mulgets are judged as better models than knn in simulating extreme value because more historical values fall within the interquartile range of the box plots 4 4 spatial coherence 4 4 1 spatial correlation accurate representation of the spatial correlation of rainfall field is vital in hydrological and agricultural applications fig 8 presents the scatter plots of between station precipitation correlation coefficients as modeled in comparison to those observed all the three models reasonably preserve the spatial correlations of precipitation across all the stations as indicated by the correlation coefficients being close to the 1 1 line 4 4 2 spatial intermittence precipitation is much more difficult to model than other meteorological variables like temperature because precipitation can rapidly vary in space and in time this problem was referred to as spatial intermittence by bardossy and plate 1992 who pointed out that failure to address it may lead to unrealistically sharp transitions between wet and dry portions in the spatial domain so the continuity ratio eq 13 is used to verify the performance of rainfall generators in dealing with the spatial intermittence problem the mare of the continuity ratio for ehs mulgets and knn is 14 9 25 2 and 6 7 respectively fig 9 despite the excellent reproduction of the spatial correlation by mulgets using a spatially correlated random number fig 8 the spatial intermittence feature of precipitation field is not properly preserved actually mulgets has tried to deal with the complex spatial intermittence problem by linking average and standard deviation of precipitation to an occurrence index eq 13 that describes the distribution of precipitation occurrence but there are many significant scatters in the mulgets result as discussed by brissette et al 2007 and chen et al 2014 some errors may be introduced when fitting the best lines between the means or standard deviations with the occurrence indexes especially when the fitting data points are scarce in contrast the knn performs best and shows little bias as the knn model considers precipitation occurrences and amounts concurrently at all the stations it naturally preserves the dependence between the stations for ehs spatial dependence is preserved by keeping the eofs unchanged specifically the linear eof coefficients of the original rainfall series to create new rainfall fields remain intact the result fig 9a shows ehs model does a reasonably good job at reproducing the continuity ratio of precipitation especially in the case of moderate continuity ratio in general ehs and knn provide a better framework for the spatial coherent generation of multi site rainfall field by providing synthetic data that adequately reproduce the spatial correlation and well address the spatial intermittence problem 4 5 temporal coherence 4 5 1 autocorrelation autocorrelation commonly exists in the meteorological time series so the synthetic and observed weather data are required to be consistent with respect to autocorrelation at different time scales however the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficients of simulations of mulgets and knn are obviously biased as they are always smaller than those of the observation fig 10 in contrast ehs performed best because every station has the ehs simulated lag 1 autocorrelation value in terms of the interquartile range catching up closely its historical lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient the better performance of ehs is not surprising because ehs model decomposes the repeated patterns autocorrelations of time series into multiple but finite components imfs each of which associates with certain characteristic frequencies to demonstrate the inherent advantage of ehs in simulating the temporal structure a comparison is made between the observed and modeled sample autocorrelation function of daily monthly and seasonal precipitation the lag 1 autocorrelation for station s4 0 19 is the strongest autocorrelation of daily precipitation fig 11 a for monthly precipitation the strongest autocorrelation 0 32 appears in 36 month 3 years lag fig 11e similarly seasonal precipitation has the strongest autocorrelation 0 51 with 12 season 3 years lag fig 11i it indicates that a strong 3 year cycle exists in the original precipitation time series and such temporal features should be reproduced in the rainfall generator as shown in fig 11 ehs performs much better than mulgets and knn to adequately reproduce the autocorrelation of daily monthly and seasonal precipitation in the framework of ehs autocorrelations at various lags represented as the imfs of different frequencies are indeed reserved by assigning random phases for imf components 4 5 2 wet and dry spells sequences of wet and dry days are critical for plant growth and algae reproduction and underestimation of wet and dry spells can have a significant impact on crop and aquatic ecosystem modeling for wet spells mulgets has the smallest mare 28 5 followed by ehs 47 4 and knn 76 0 fig 12 a the wet spells of both short and long durations are best modeled by mulgets in contrast ehs and knn tend to overestimate the frequency of isolated wet spell run 1 d and to underestimate the long length e g run 14 d wet periods for dry spells the best mare goes to ehs 28 2 followed by mulgets 30 4 and knn 46 8 fig 12b again mulgets performs better than ehs and knn in reproducing the isolated wet spell run 1 d however there is a tendency across the three models to underestimate the dry spells especially the longest dry spell run 28 d 4 5 3 low frequency variability overdispersion phenomenon it is important that models are able to simulate the natural low frequency variability e g inter annual variance especially in the impact study of climate change however underestimation of the low frequency variability also known as overdispersion phenomenon is one of the well known problems of the conventional weather generators gregory et al 1993 katz and parlange 1998 katz and zheng 1999 wilks 1999 in light of the knowledge that an observed inter annual variance consists of contributions from both high frequency day to day variations and from lower frequency variations one explanation of the low frequency variability underestimation will be the inadequate capability of certain wgs in modeling moderate or high frequency components which is ostensibly emerging as the overdispersion phenomenon katz and parlange 1998 wilks 1999 nonetheless a more fundamental reason for the missing low frequency variability is known to be the assumption adopted in the conventional wgs methodology that the climate and more specifically the daily precipitation process is stationary or approximately stationary though it is authentically not most wg models such as mulgets do not explicitly take into account the aspects of low frequency variability such as decadal oscillations and thus underestimate the year to year or longer variances for example the typical markov chain model uses multi year average parameters e g transition probability distribution parameters which hastily disregards the year to year variations thus it is not surprising that mulgets underestimates the inter annual variability of both monthly and seasonal precipitation total fig 13 similarly the knn resampling procedure indiscriminately chooses the potential nearest neighbors from the multi year windows without taking note of the between year differences inter annual correlation and such a permutation of inter annual data weakens if not diminishes the low frequency variability fig 13 compared with these time domain approaches ehs performs much better to adequately reproduce the year to year variations of monthly and seasonal precipitation total because the so called inter annual or longer variabilities are essentially the same as the imfs with low frequencies see table 2 actually as a frequency domain approach ehs exhibits an intrinsic capability to consider the oscillations of all frequencies in the original data although results are not presented it should be noted that the variance of biennially or even multiannual precipitation total is also significantly preserved 5 conclusions in this paper a new framework ehs for multi site stochastic rainfall generation is presented this ehs rainfall generator applies eofa and hht in sequence to parse the spatiotemporal rainfall field into spatial patterns and multiple time scale components series plausible rainfall scenarios are stochastically simulated by assigning random phases to the selected imfs which can mostly retain statistical characteristics of the original rainfall field this model was compared with mulgets and knn on the basis of how well the statistical properties are preserved the comparison results show that the ehs rainfall generator has greater ability to reproduce the various statistics of interest as previously proved as a frequency domain approach the big advantage of ehs model stems from its capability to preserve satisfactorily key statistical properties of the temporal structure simultaneously at various daily monthly and annual time scales the experiments of model comparison also demonstrate that ehs model has a comparable capacity as knn model in reproducing the spatial structure of the original rainfall field through this preliminary demonstration the method has exhibited promise for its use in generating plausible rainfall scenarios for the impact studies moreover the scale free nature of hht method may allow the models under ehs framework to become high resolution wgs e g gridded and sub daily which are of increasing interests and growing needs in many applications although not shown explicitly here the ehs framework may accomplish such tasks by for example adaptively decomposing the sub daily series into imfs with finer frequencies and interpolating the eofs spatial pattern on gauge scale into spatial grids which are subsequently used to generate rainfall sequences for each grid in addition as an adaptive data driven method the ehs framework is quite flexible and easy to introduce new weather variables this adaptive feature makes the ehs model an attractive procedure to generate weather series based on modeling purposes and data availability so the extension of the model to include other weather variables e g temperature solar radiation and wind etc will also be the subject of our future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this research was jointly supported

6376,intertidal wetlands are widely considered to be vulnerable to storm impacts while much attention has been given to the effect of hurricane typhoon landfall on local erosion deposition in intertidal wetlands less is known about how distant hurricanes typhoons can affect an intertidal wetland or about the comprehensive effects of hurricanes typhoons on hydrodynamics sediment transport and seabed stability here we investigate the possible impacts of thirteen typhoons that occurred in the western pacific during summer autumn 2016 on an intertidal wetland in the yangtze delta we detected the impacts from eight of the typhoons during half of their duration when these typhoons were 450 2000 km away nearest distance ever for each typhoon from the delta these remote typhoons caused 2 5 times maximum increases in hydrodynamics and suspended sediment concentration correspondingly considerable net mudflat erosion and marsh deposition were observed we therefore conclude that intertidal wetlands can be strongly affected by typhoons even those passing by hundreds of kilometres away these findings contribute to understand how far and in what extent hurricanes typhoons can affect intertidal wetlands and to increase knowledge needed for coastal management keywords typhoon mudflat saltmarsh intertidal wetland storm impact yangtze delta 1 introduction intertidal wetlands are among the world s most valuable ecosystems costanza et al 1997 because they provide important ecosystem functions and services barbier et al 2011 kirwan and megonigal 2013 temmerman et al 2013 the environmental stability of intertidal wetlands is presumably a key factor for the health of this ecosystem the long term stability of intertidal wetlands is influenced by sediment supply and relative sea level changes blankespoor et al 2014 yang et al 2018 its responses to fluvial sediment decline land subsidence and global sea level rise has been widely addressed yang et al 2005 blum and roberts 2009 kirwan and megonigal schuerch et al 2018 the short term stability of intertidal wetlands is strongly disturbed by storms tropical cyclones hurricanes typhoons are extreme storms that frequently impact the coasts of the pacific atlantic and india oceans emanuel 2005 knutson et al 2010 although there is great uncertainty about whether or not the frequency of tropical cyclones will increase most studies show that the tropical cyclone intensity should increase as the climate warms webster et al 2005 sobel et al 2016 intertidal wetlands are widely considered to be vulnerable to storm attack leonardi et al 2016 however most previous studies have focused on the strong erosion accretion caused by hurricanes typhoons when they landed at the intertidal wetlands yang et al 2003 turner et al 2006 williams and flanagan 2009 van ormondt et al 2015 liu et al 2017 in contrast less is known about the remote effect of hurricanes typhoons or about their comprehensive effects on hydrodynamics sediment transport and erosion accretion there is a great need to strengthen research in these fields because the sphere of influence of hurricanes typhoons may be much greater than their landing area and because the aspects of storm impact may be much more than the bed level change here we bridge the above knowledge gap by studying the yangtze delta as a model system because it is one of the world s largest deltas in terms of size and its intertidal wetland areas are known to be typically affected each summer by typhoons wang et al 2016 2018 zhu et al 2017 through combination of qualitative description and quantitative analysis we attempt to 1 divide the remote typhoons or typhoon durations into two parts i e the impacting and non impacting ones 2 address the quantitative characteristics of the impacting typhoons 3 quantify the magnitudes of the average and maximum typhoon impacts and 4 develop an impact factor for quantitative relationship between a remote typhoon and its impact this study is unique in that it focuses on how many typhoons that form in the pacific ocean and during how long duration they affect the wetlands in this delta the quantitative characteristics of the impacting typhoons i e their strength and distance from the delta and the comprehensive effects of typhoons including the hydrodynamic mechanism sediment transport and bed level and marsh changes based on high temporal resolution field measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 data mining data of typhoon tracks and maximum wind speeds near the typhoon centers during the typhoon season july through september in 2016 were obtained from the national meteorological of china http www nmc cn the 3 hourly wind speed and 6 hourly wave height data at the nearshore station in the yangtze delta during the same period were obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts https www ecmwf int the astronomical tide data were provided by the east china sea branch of state oceanic administration 2 2 field observations field observations were carried out using a tripod system from august 29 to september 28 2016 on a tidal wetland in the yangtze delta front fig 1 the winds in the yangtze delta are influenced by monsoons and typhoons and the multi year average of wind speed is ca 4 m s yang et al 2008 the tides in this area are mixed semidiurnal with a mean tidal range of 3 2 m in our study site gao et al 2008 the intertidal area is approximately 900 m in width which consists of a salt marsh upper 150 m and a mudflat lower 750 m fig 1c the observation site is below the mean sea level msl and 650 m seaward from the seawall an sbe 26plus seagauge wave and tide recorder 4 hz sea bird electronics inc usa was mounted horizontally on the bed surface to measure the wave parameters and water depth at an interval of 10 min the burst lasted for 256 s and conducted 1024 measurements an aquadopp hr profiler 1 hz nortek norway was deployed on a tripod and its downward facing probe was at a height of 0 7 m above the seabed to measure the current profile an alec current meter 1 hz alec electronics japan was attached to the tripod to measure the point currents at a height of 0 5 m the currents were measured at an interval of 5 min an argus surface meter iv asm 5 hz argus germany which has an array of sensors with a measuring profile of approximately 1 m was mounted to obtain the turbidity profile at an interval of 2 5 min fig 2 the elevations along the cross shore intertidal wetland profile were surveyed before and after typhoons using a high resolution high accuracy real time kinematic global positioning system unit trimble company usa with horizontal and vertical errors of 2 mm all surveys were based on the same reference benchmark that was built into a concrete seawall at the starting point of the central cross shore profile and all repeated surveys of elevation were conducted at fixed sites on the wetlands to avoid the influence of the footprints on the results of surveys we were careful not to trample on the soft soils at the survey points while reading the elevation we held the rtk gps and placed it just onto the sediment surface preventing it from sinking into the soils water samples were acquired at the observation site for suspended sediment concentration ssc calibration surficial bed sediments were collected each day during the ebb period to measure the water content and the grain size we used a buried plate method to measure relative bed level changes between tidal cycles zhu et al 2017 to avoid the disturbance of the tripod the buried plate site was 5 m away from the tripod in the longshore direction specifically we buried a square ceramic tile 0 3 m beneath the sediment surface then we smoothed the sediment surface to be consistent with the surrounding areas the first measurement was performed two tidal cycles after burial of the tile by which time the mudflat had been restored to its undisturbed state we measured the distance between the sediment surface and the plate using 16 thin sticks inserted vertically into the sediment to minimize the impact from the ripples we positioned eight sticks on ripple crests and a further eight within ripple troughs relative bed level changes were calculated from the difference between the two measurements 2 3 data processing in situ turbidity data obtained from the asm were converted to suspended sediment concentration data via a calibration equation in the laboratory using water samples collected in situ fig 3 grain size analyses were measured in laboratory for the surficial sediment samples using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer coulter ls100q coulter inc usa after removal of organic matter to obtain the grain size distribution curves of the sediment mean bed shear stress caused by combined wave current action τcw during 10 min periods and critical shear stress for the erosion of bottom sediment τe were computed see details in appendix a to study sediment transport and bed level changes to quantifiably describe the potential impacts of a remote typhoon on coastal meteorological hydrodynamics we developed a dimensionless impact factor of a typhoon ift which was defined as 1 if t 100 s t d t â c where st is the maximum wind speed near the typhoon center m s dt c is the distance between the typhoon center and the coast km the number 100 is used to ensure that the ift values range from 1 to 10 this factor is based on the assumption that a typhoon impact is mainly determined by the wind speed of the typhoon center and the distance between the typhoon and the coast and that ift is proportional to st but inversely proportional to dt c correlations between ift and wind speed wsy and wave height hn in the yangtze delta were established and the significance levels of the correlations were tested using regression approaches to investigate the time lag in wsy and hn after ift we established correlations with time lags of 1 5 tides and compared their correlation coefficients with the correlation coefficient of the in phase correlation we selected the correlation with the highest correlation coefficient we defined the time lag as that has the highest correlation coefficient the rate at which the wave group as a whole travels across the open ocean between the typhoon and the coast was calculated using the following equation 2 c g g t 4 π where g is the acceleration of gravity t is the wave period and π is the circumference ratio komar 1976 3 results and discussion during july through september 2016 thirteen typhoons were formed and moved northwestward through the western pacific fig 1 the maximum sustained wind speed near the typhoon center ranged from 17 to 70 m s the typhoon circle radius of 17 m s wind speed was between 100 and 600 km and the distance between the typhoon center and the yangtze delta varied from 200 to 4000 km fig 4 a the duration of these typhoons together amounted to 65 of time of the three months 3 1 remote impacts of typhoons on coastal winds at the yangtze delta the tide averaged wind speed ranged from 1 5 to 8 4 m s 4 8 m s on average during the non typhoon periods among the 115 tides when one or two typhoons were moving across the pacific ocean 10 tides were accompanied by wind speeds higher than the maximum wind speed during non typhoon periods the wind speeds during these 10 tides were 10 m s on average fig 4b table s1 during these 10 tides the wind speed at the yangtze delta were most likely influenced by typhoons on average the 6 5 m s wind speeds at the yangtze delta in the typhoon periods were equal to the wind speeds in the non typhoon periods thus the 6 5 8 4 m s wind speeds at the yangtze delta in the typhoon periods may also have been influenced by typhoons these wind speeds were observed during 22 tides table s1 therefore we conclude that the wind speeds at the yangtze delta were more or less influenced by typhoons during 32 tides or 28 of the duration of the typhoon periods during the impacting typhoons defined as the periods when a typhoon impact on wind speed in the yangtze delta was detected the distance between the typhoon center and the yangtze delta dt y the maximum wind speed near typhoon center wst the impact factor of typhoon ift and the wind speed in the yangtze delta wsy were on average 1650 km 38 m s 4 4 and 8 4 m s respectively during the non impacting typhoons defined as the periods when a typhoon impact on the yangtze delta was undetected the values of dt y wst ift and wsy were on average 1800 km 29 m s 2 2 and 4 8 m s equal to the mean wind speed under no typhoon conditions respectively during the impacting typhoons the correlation between wsy and ift was statistically significant r2 0 35 and p 0 001 for all the impacting periods and r2 ranging from 0 70 to 0 99 and p 0 001 for the three individual typhoon events fig s1 however there was no significant correlation between wsy and ift r2 0 009 p 0 4 during the non impacting typhoons data shown in table s1 in addition to increasing wind speed typhoons often changed wind direction and sometimes reduced wind speed at the yangtze delta this is because in summer the monsoon induced winds in the east china sea are typically northward or northwestward fig 4b sun et al 2016 on the other hand the typhoon generated winds at the yangtze delta tended to be southwestward or southward fig 4b because the typhoons were often to the southeast or east of the yangtze delta fig 1 and because typhoon systems rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere bridges 1987 thus at the beginning and end of the typhoon impact the winds at the yangtze delta tended to be weaker and change directions fig 4b 3 2 remote impacts of typhoons on coastal hydrodynamics 3 2 1 impact on waves during our observations of the mudflat in the yangtze delta the tide averaged significant wave height at the mudflat station was closely correlated with the tide averaged significant wave height at the nearshore station r2 0 56 data shown in table s1 thus the wave heights at the nearshore station prior to our mudflat observation can be used to understand the wave conditions on the mudflat for a longer time period at the nearshore station in the yangtze delta front the lowest wave heights were all found during calm weather wind speed 2 3 m s for example at the nearshore station where the water depth is 5 m on average the significant wave height 6 hour average was lowest ca 0 2 m on 15 july 4 august and 9 september fig 4c these minimal wave heights likely had little relation to tidal conditions because they were recorded under different tidal conditions ranging from neap 15 july to spring tides 5 august fig 4 on the other hand the highest wave heights were recorded during remote typhoons that increased the wind speed in the yangtze delta specifically the significant wave height at the nearshore station reached 1 5 m on 28 august t113 when typhoon lionrock was passing more than 1500 km away with a maximum wind speed 51 m s near the typhoon eye fig 4 this wave height was 7 5 times higher than the wave height under calm weather fig 4 the second largest wave height 1 4 m was recorded during t155 september 18 19 when typhoon malakas was passing 450 km away with a maximum wind speed 46 m s near the typhoon center the third largest wave height 1 35 m was observed during t173 september 28 when typhoon megi was passing 770 km away with a maximum wind speed of 29 m s near the typhoon center fig 4 similar to the wind speed in the yangtze delta the wave height at this delta was affected by only some remote typhoons and only during part of their duration the maximum tide averaged significant wave height during the non typhoon periods was 0 65 m among the 115 tides when one or two typhoons were moving across the pacific ocean 37 tides were accompanied by tide averaged significant wave heights higher than the maximum wave height during the non typhoon periods the significant wave heights during these 37 tides were on average 0 9 m the waves in the yangtze delta were most likely affected by remote typhoons during these 37 tides on average the 0 59 m significant wave heights in the typhoon periods were equal to the significant wave heights in the no typhoon periods thus the 0 59 65 m significant wave heights in the typhoon periods may also have been influenced by typhoons these significant wave heights were observed during 12 tides table s1 therefore we concluded that the significant wave heights were influenced to different extents by typhoons during 49 tides or 43 of the duration of the typhoon periods thus the number of tides associated with a detectable typhoon impact on waves in the yangtze delta was much greater than the number of tides associated with a detectable typhoon impact on wind speed this result suggests that the impacts of remote typhoons on waves in the yangtze delta included not only an increase in wind driven waves in the delta itself but also swells that propagated into the yangtze delta area from the remote pacific ocean where one or more typhoons generated tall waves thus even if the winds in the yangtze delta are not affected by a remote typhoon the waves generated by this typhoon in the far ocean may partly propagate into waters near the yangtze delta for typical typhoon events that significantly influenced the waves in the yangtze delta the wave height in the yangtze delta nearshore station hn was closely correlated with the impact factor of the typhoon for example the correlation coefficient r2 between hn and ift reached 0 94 significance level p 0 05 during typhoon malakas fig s2a for typhoon meranti when a 0 5 day 1 tide lag in wave height was considered the correlation coefficient between hn and ift reached its peak r2 0 58 p 0 05 fig s2b a similar time lag in wave height in the yangtze delta after the impact factor of typhoon was also observed during typhoon lionrock for this typhoon when a 2 day 4 tide lag in wave height was considered the correlation coefficient between hn and ift was at its highest r2 0 82 p 0 01 fig s2 c for all the impacting typhoons defined as the periods when a typhoon impact on wave height in the yangtze delta was detected the correlation coefficient between hn and ift reached its maximum at r2 0 43 p 0 001 when a 0 5 day lag in wave height was considered fig s2 d in contrast for the non impacting typhoons that did not affect the yangtze delta the correlation coefficient between hn and ift decreased to only r2 0 07 data shown in table s1 the time lag of hn after ift was presumably relevant to the progradation of the swells across the open pacific for example the distance between the yangtze delta and the storm center was on average 1600 km during typhoon lionrock based on equation 2 the period of waves travelling across the 1600 km distance over 2 days would be ca 12 s which is supported by the wave periods in the western pacific during the typhoon lionrock predicted by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ranging from 11 to 15 s and being 12 1 s on average although the origin and progradation of waves on the open ocean could be more complex than addressed above our coarse estimation likely explains the main mechanism of the time lag among the waves in the yangtze delta after a remote typhoon occurrence during the impacting typhoons the distance between the typhoon center and the yangtze delta the maximum wind speed near the typhoon center the impact factor of typhoon and the significant wave height at the nearshore station in the yangtze delta were on average 1600 km 38 m s 4 3 and 0 85 m respectively during the non impacting typhoons they were on average 2100 km 27 m s 1 9 and 0 42 m equal to the mean significant wave height under no typhoon weathers respectively at the mudflat station the tide averaged significant wave height was positively correlated with the tide averaged water depth during the periods of no typhoon non impacting typhoon and impacting typhoon the correlation between wave height and water depth under no typhoon was similar to that under non impacting typhoon however the correlation trendline of the impacting typhoon was far above the correlation trendlines of the no typhoon and non impacting typhoon fig 6a suggesting that the wave height during impacting typhoons were substantially higher than the wave heights during no typhoon and non impacting typhoon periods at equal water depths based on the correlation equations the wave heights under the impacting typhoons 0 55 m were on average 2 2 times higher than the wave heights under no typhoon and non impacting typhoon conditions 0 25 m the maximum typhoon impact on wave height occurred during the twin meranti and malakas typhoons when the tide averaged significant wave height measured at the mudflat station reached 1 16 m during tidal cycle t150 fig 5 and table s1 which was 4 2 times higher than that 0 28 m predicted by the correlations for non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations in fig 6 a for 2 06 m of water depth in tidal cycle t150 considering that the tide averaged water depth over the mudflat is mainly determined by tidal range the correlation between tide averaged wave height and water depth basically reflects the tide control the wave height measured at the mudflat station tended to show peak values in the flood phase of each tidal cycle fig 5c the asymmetry in the intra tidal wave height curve likely reflects the difference in influencing factors between the flood and ebb phases during the flood phase the wave propagation direction was the same as the onshore tidal current direction on the other hand during the ebb phase the wave propagation direction was opposite the offshore tidal current direction the intra tidal pattern of wave height i e increasing in the flood phase and decreasing in the ebb phase also reflects the strong influence of water depth on waves in tidal wetlands yang et al 2012 this intra tidal pattern was present because of the high resolution of the wave measurements i e 10 min average if the resolution of wave height was 6 h as at the nearshore station then the above intra tidal pattern could not be observed despite the intra tidal pattern of wave height the impact of typhoons on wave height in the yangtze delta was clearly detectable in addition to the statistical result for the impacting typhoons as a whole fig 6a typhoon impacts were also reflected in individual typhoon events specifically the wave heights during the twin typhoons meranti and malakas and typhoon megi were significantly higher than in other impacting typhoon periods the comparison of the intra tidal wave height curve between two typical tidal cycles t120 and t149 which were equal in tidal range 4 44 vs 4 43 m and high tide height 5 20 vs 5 17 m but were different in weather condition no typhoon vs twin typhoons meranti and malakas fig 5 table s1 strikingly shows the storm impact on waves at the yangtze delta fig 7 c during the non typhoon tidal cycle t120 the mean wind speed at the yangtze delta was 5 31 m s and the mean significant wave heights at the nearshore and mudflat stations were 0 46 and 0 34 m respectively in contrast during the typhoon affected tidal cycle t149 the mean wind speed was 8 44 m s and the mean significant wave heights at the nearshore and mudflat stations were 0 87 and 1 07 m respectively fig 5 and table s1 the intra tidal maximum wave height at the mudflat station was 0 72 m in t120 and 2 50 m in t149 fig 5c 3 2 2 impact on currents tidal current velocity increases with tidal range alvarez 2010 call et al 2015 this scenario is supported by our finding that the tide averaged near bed current velocity at the mudflat station was closely correlated with the astronomical tide range fig 6b however the correlation trendline of the impacting typhoon situation was significantly above the correlation trendlines of the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations whereas the correlation trendlines of the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations were similar this result suggests that given the same tidal range the current velocity during impacting typhoons was significantly higher than the current velocity during non impacting typhoons and no typhoon periods based on the correlation equations the current velocities during the impacting typhoons 0 41 m s were on average 24 higher than the current velocities during the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon periods 0 33 m s the maximum typhoon impact on current velocity occurred during the twin typhoons meranti and malakas when the tide averaged current velocity measured at the mudflat station reached 0 6 m s tidal cycle t150 fig 5 and table s1 which was 67 greater than that 0 36 m s predicted by the correlations for the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations in fig 6b for 4 25 m of tidal range during tidal cycle t150 strikingly the maximum typhoon impact on current velocity occurred at the same time as the maximum typhoon impact on wave height i e on september 16 t150 fig 5 and table s1 the typhoon impact on current velocity in the intertidal wetland was also reflected in the comparison of intra tidal velocity curves between two tides that were equal in astronomical tidal ranges but were different in wind speeds and wave heights for example during the two tidal cycles of t120 and t149 the astronomical tidal ranges were 4 44 and 4 43 m and the wind speeds were 5 31 and 8 44 m s respectively table s1 during these two tides the overall v shaped intra tidal pattern of the velocity curves hardly changed that is the velocity decreased during the flood phase reached a minimum approximately at the high tide and then increased during the ebb phase however the current velocity of t149 was generally higher than the velocity of t120 the increased velocity occurred mainly in the earlier or shallower flood stage fig 7d on average the current velocity was 0 37 m s during tide t120 and 0 55 m s during tide t149 corresponding to a significant wave height of 0 34 m in t120 and 1 07 m in t149 table s1 the overall increase in current velocity due to a typhoon impact was attributable to wind induced currents wu 1975 weber 1983 chang et al 2012 and wave induced flow shaikh and siddiqui 2011 the wind and wave induced near bed currents are assumed to be inversely proportional to water depth and to be significant in shallow waters such as that over the intertidal wetland the correlation coefficient between current velocity and tidal range was relatively lower under a typhoon impact r2 0 56 than under conditions of a non impacting typhoon and no typhoon r2 0 75 0 79 fig 6b this result likely reflects that the superposition of typhoon induced currents which are independent of tidal range somewhat disturbs the relationship between current velocity and tidal range furthermore the storm induced currents observed during this study likely varied among the typhoon events 3 2 3 impact on bed shear stress as an indicator of combined current wave action for estimating sediment pick up rate τcw measured on the mudflat showed spring neap and storm no storm patterns similar to current velocity and wave height fig 5 the change in τcw was the comprehensive impact of tidal variation local winds and typhoons like the tide averaged wave height and current velocity the tide averaged τcw was closely correlated with the tidal range however the correlation trendline of the impacting typhoon category was far above the correlation trendlines of the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon categories based on the equations of these correlations the τcw values under the impacting typhoons were on average 0 40 n m2 or 60 higher than the mean τcw value 0 25 n m2 predicted for the no typhoon and non impacting typhoon conditions the maximum typhoon impact on tide averaged τcw was also occurred during the twin typhoons meranti and malakas the measured τcw in the tidal cycle t147 was 0 61 n m2 which was 2 3 times higher than the 0 26 n m2 predicted for the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations using the correlations in fig 6c given the 3 86 m in tidal range that the time of the maximum typhoon impact on τcw slightly deviated from the time of the maximum typhoon impacts on wave height and current velocity is probably because the τcw is determined by not only wave height and current velocity but also water depth and velocity profile whitehouse et al 2000 the comparison of τcw between t120 and t149 that are equal in tidal condition was most convincing for the typhoon impact during an individual tidal cycle the average τcw was 0 29 n m2 during the no typhoon tide t120 and 0 53 n m2 during the stormy tide t149 the intra tidal patterns of τcw in the two tides were similar but τcw during t149 was significantly greater than during t120 for most of the tidal cycle fig 7e under no typhoon and neap tidal conditions τcw was close to the critical shear stress for erosion τe for example during the no typhoon neap tide t136 the τcw ranged from 0 01 to 0 45 and 0 12 n m2 on average in comparison with τe 0 09 n m2 this suggests that bottom sediment can be resuspended only in part of the tide duration in the period of calm weather and neap tides however during typhoon affected tidal cycles e g t147 t151 t153 t156 all τcw values could be greater than τ e and the averaged τ cw could be 5 times higher than τe in addition the water height and submergence duration on the intertidal wetland increased during 80 of the storm affected tidal cycles for example the water height at the high tide of t149 increased by 0 15 m and the submergence duration on the intertidal wetland lengthened by 0 25 h fig 6b the maximum increases in water height and submergence were 0 43 m and 0 7 h respectively 3 3 remote impact of typhoons on coastal suspended sediment concentration the ssc measured in the 1 m water column above the mudflat in the yangtze delta showed a similar temporal pattern to that of τ cw fig 5 there was a significant positive correlation between the tide averaged ssc and tide averaged τ cw fig 6d however the highest τ cw ssc data couples were measured during the impacting typhoons whereas no significant difference between non impacting typhoons and no typhoons was found fig 6d based on the correlation shown in fig 6d the ssc would be 7 9 kg m3 for the mean τ cw of impacting typhoon 0 40 n m2 and would be 5 5 kg m3 for the mean τ cw of non impacting typhoon and no typhoon 0 25 n m2 suggesting that the ssc was increased by 44 on average by the typhoon impacts similarly the ssc would be 11 3 kg m3 during the tidal cycle t147 when the typhoon impact on τ cw reached its maximum 0 61 n m2 and would be 5 7 kg m3 for the corresponding τ cw under presumed non impacting typhoon and no typhoon conditions 0 26 n m2 suggesting that the tide averaged ssc during the maximum impacting typhoon was 2 0 times greater than the ssc under non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations that is some of the remote typhoons significantly increased the ssc in the intertidal wetland of the yangtze delta by affecting the delta hydrodynamics in the classic comparison between two tides that are equal in tidal range and high tidal level the ssc in the typhoon influenced tide t149 6 81 kg m3 was 1 7 times higher on average than the ssc in the no typhoon tide t120 3 94 kg m3 although the intra tidal and vertical patterns of ssc in the two tidal cycles were similar fig 7f fig 8 during the typhoon affected tides t153 t158 when the difference between τcw and τe becomes greater than during tide t149 fig 5f table s1 the tide averaged sscs reached 11 6 15 3 kg m3 table s1 suggesting that the amount of resuspended sediment is proportional to the difference between τcw and τe during these tides the ssc in several decimeters closest to the bottom even exceeded the upper detection limit of asm 17 3 kg m3 fig 8 it is necessary to indicate that the tidal cycles of t153 t158 were spring tides fig 5 the extremely high sscs during this period reflect the combined impact of typhoon and spring tides the tidal ranges of the tidal cycles t153 t158 were 4 75 m on average according to the correlations between tidal range and τcw under the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon conditions fig 6c the τcw would be 0 32 n m2 given the tidal range 4 75 this τcw value would result in an ssc of 6 6 kg m3 based on the correlation between ssc and τcw fig 6d the long term average tidal range in the study area is 3 2 m zhu et al 2014 which would result in a τcw of 0 21 n m2 and an ssc of 4 9 kg m3 under non impacting typhoon and no typhoon conditions based on the correlations in fig 6c and d the sscs observed during t153 t158 were on average 12 9 kg m3 table s1 thus compared with the ssc under normal weather and tidal conditions the ssc increased by 8 0 kg m3 during the stormy and spring tidal period of t153 t158 21 of this rise in ssc was attributed to increased tidal range whereas 79 of the rise in ssc was due to the impact of the remote typhoon malakas the ssc in the yangtze delta was closely correlated with the impact factor of the typhoon with a 2 tide lag in ssc after ift was considered the correlation coefficient reached the maximum r2 0 74 p 0 001 fig 6e that was significantly greater than the in phase correlation coefficient between the ssc and ift r2 0 36 p 0 001 for the non impacting typhoon category alone the in phase correlation between the ssc and ift was not statistically significant r2 0 01 p 0 92 correlation diagrams omitted even though the 2 tide lag correlation became closer fig 6e this suggests that the above significant correlation between the ssc and ift was contributed mainly by the data of impacting typhoon based on fig 6e we conclude 1 when ift 5 2 the remote typhoon was certainly an impacting typhoon that would cause sediment resuspension and increase ssc in the yangtze delta 2 when ift 5 2 the remote typhoon could be either an impacting typhoon or a non impacting typhoon considering that the ssc was also influenced by tidal range we established a binary regression relationship to reflect the combined influences of typhoon and tidal range 3 in phase correlation c 1 629 t r 0 428 if t 1 045 r 2 0 57 p 0 001 4 2 tide c lag behind if t c 0 654 t r 0 929 if t 0 262 r 2 0 79 p 0 001 where c represents the ssc kg m3 tr represents the tidal range these binary regressions suggest that as an ssc lag was considered 1 the correlation coefficient significantly increased 2 the module reflecting the weight of ift increased from 0 428 to 0 929 whereas the module reflecting the weight of tr decreased from 1 629 to 0 654 the ssc lag presumedly resulted from the hydrodynamics lag after the remote impacting typhoon as shown above thus it is necessary to consider a time lag in studying the impact of remote typhoon on sediment resuspension and bed stability the time duration of storm impact on ssc is likely longer than the impact on hydrodynamics because the deposition of suspended fine grained sediments after the decline of hydrodynamics in the post storm period requires some time this time lag of ssc decline was well shown in the post malakas period for example during tides t159 t162 after typhoon malakas the ssc was 8 6 10 3 kg m3 much higher than usual although the hydrodynamics had decreased to a very low level fig 5 table s1 it is also due to this time lag that the ssc during mean tides after spring tides tends to be higher than the ssc during mean tides prior to spring tides given similar weather conditions osborne and greenwood 2010 3 4 remote impact of typhoons on seabed stability in previous studies it was found that typhoon or hurricane landfall tends to cause severe erosion in the subtidal seabed mudflat and low marsh edges whereas it causes rapid accretion in the inner marsh area yang et al 2003 turner et al 2006 in the present study after the passing of a series of remote typhoons net erosion was found on the mudflat even though deposition was observed somewhere the comparison between the cross shore intertidal wetland profiles surveyed before and after the typhoons suggests that most of the mudflat experienced erosion during the typhoon season the net erosion in the mudflat profile was 3 cm and the maximum erosion reached 22 cm in the transitional zone between the mudflat and the marsh deposition was found only in the middle flat where the sediment surface was originally low lying fig 9 at the tripod system observation site the erosion during the twin meranti and malakas typhoons reached a maximum of ca 8 cm fig 5e after the twin meranti and malakas typhoons the mudflat experienced a week of deposition and bed level recovery fig 5e in a previous study of typhoon impact on intertidal wetland stability in the yangtze delta the bed level recovery period was also found to be approximately a week yang et al 2003 nevertheless the one week of bed level recovery coincided with a transition period from spring to neap tides both in the present and the previous study presumedly the ssc tends to decrease from spring to neap tides and the mudflat tends to experience deposition and bed level recovery unless this process is interrupted by storm events thus the bed level recovery period would be longer than a week under other conditions e g transition from neap to spring tides given the same storm generated erosion as found in this study the temporal trend of the relative bed level is overall opposite to that of the τcw on the mudflat fig 5e and the correlation coefficient r between these variables is 0 6 this suggests that the mudflat tends to erode as the τcw increases and vice versa as shown above although the increase in τcw during the twin typhoons was partly owing to the spring tides the impact from the typhoons was obvious therefore the erosion on the mudflat should be partly attributed to typhoons considering that the changes in ssc in the mudflat are the results of sediment deposition pick up and that sediment deposition pick up are directly link with bed level changes the significant increase in ssc during typhoon events also suggests strong seabed erosion during the same period we also found an erosion of 12 cm at the low marsh edge however most of the marshes experienced deposition the mean marsh deposition in the cross shore profile was 13 cm fig 9 noticeably we found the formation of a washover sand body in the low marsh which buried the existing plant scirpus mariqueter and silted up a tidal creek fig 10 the comparison between the pre and post typhoons profiles suggests that the formation of this washover sand likely linked with the landward movement of an earlier washover sand body and the maximum deposition in the center of the present washover sand body reached 31 cm fig 9 the washover sand body was composed of fine sands median size d50 0 13 0 16 mm which are much coarser than the mud found both on the mudflat d50 0 04 0 06 mm and on the inner marsh d50 0 007 0 024 mm the elevation of the washover sand body was 10 30 cm higher than the marshland on the landward side excavating the sand cover residual stems of the marsh plant were exposed suggesting that the washover sand body was rapid deposition on the marsh we infer that the washover sand body was formed during typhoon storm surges we found that under non typhoon conditions waves were low and currents were weak near the high tide which were unfavourable conditions for the movement of sands as bed load leading to only mud deposition in this area in contrast during typhoon storm surges extremely large and high waves hit the low marsh edge leading to strong wash flows which eroded the mud and left sands as a result a washover sand body was formed on the landward side of the low marsh edge storm generated washover sand bodies were often found in backbarrier marshes donnelly et al 2004 on other coasts of the yangtze delta washover sand deposits were also formed in low salt marshes during the landfalls of strong typhoons yang et al 2000 2003 in the present study we found that large washover sand bodies also developed in low salt marshes during storm surges even if the typhoons were passing hundreds of kilometers away the different morphological responses to typhoons between the marsh and the mudflat also increased the elevation gradient in the mudflat marsh transitional zone leonardi et al 2018 3 5 determinants of remote typhoon impacts our results suggest that the yangtze delta was affected by only some of the remote typhoons and during only part of the impacting typhoons the impact of a typhoon on an intertidal wetland is presumedly determined by the integration of multiple factors such as typhoon strength distance between a typhoon and the coast typhoon duration marine bathymetry coastal configuration sediment composition of the intertidal wetland marsh swamp vegetation tidal conditions e g microtidal mesotidal or macrotidal spring or neap tides and previous state of erosion accretion the typhoons that did not affect the yangtze delta were too far away or and relatively weak specifically typhoon lupit had maximum wind speeds of only 18 m s near the storm center and was more than 3400 km away from the yangtze delta typhoon nida had maximum wind speeds of 18 38 m s and was 1200 1600 km away typhoon conson had maximum wind speeds of 20 27 m s and was 3200 3700 km away and typhoon chanthu had maximum wind speeds of 18 23 m s and was 1900 3200 km away our attempt to use the ift factor to quantify the remote impact of typhoons was not perfect because it only reflects the impact of typhoon strength and the distance between the typhoon center and the studied coast eq 1 this approach fails to incorporate the impacts of other influencing factors as a result the correlations between ift and coastal wind speed wave height were not close when all typhoon events were considered r2 0 45 although the r2 could exceed 0 95 for individual typhoons fig s1 fig s2 when the ift was higher than 5 2 the intertidal wetlands in the yangtze delta was clearly affected by the remote typhoon however when the ift ws lower than 5 2 the intertidal wetlands in the yangtze delta could be impacted or could not be impacted by the remote typhoon depending on the influenced of other factors considering the shortcomings of the ift shown above more influencing factors need to be incorporated into this impact factor in future studies to improve its accuracy and applicability 4 conclusions the intertidal wetland in the yangtze delta was influenced to different extents by 8 of the 13 typhoons that occurred in the west pacific ocean during july through september 2016 the delta was affected during half of the duration of these 8 typhoons during the influenced periods the distance between the delta and the typhoon center was 450 2000 km and the maximum wind speed near the typhoon center was 20 62 m s the typhoons that did not affect the yangtze delta were too far 2000 km from the delta or and relatively weak 20 m s in maximum wind speed near the storm center the typhoons impacting the delta increased wind speed 11 5 m s with maximum impact vs 4 8 m s on average with no storm impact water height 3 73 m vs 3 30 m duration of tidal inundation 8 8 h vs 8 1 h wave height 1 2 m vs 0 26 m and current velocity 0 60 m s vs 0 31 m s thereby enhancing the bed shear stress due to combined current wave action 0 65 n m2 vs 0 27 n m2 and resulting in sediment suspension 15 3 kg m3 vs 4 5 kg m3 in near bed ssc during the periods of impacting typhoons the mudflat experienced considerable net erosion whereas the main marsh experience rapid deposition and the low marsh was buried by a washover fine sand body and a creek there was silted up we conclude that the hydrodynamic sedimentary and erosion accretion processes in intertidal wetlands can be significantly influenced by typhoons even if they pass hundreds of kilometers or more than a thousand kilometers away these findings contribute to increase knowledge of how far and in what extent hurricanes typhoons can affect intertidal wetlands that is needed for coastal

6376,intertidal wetlands are widely considered to be vulnerable to storm impacts while much attention has been given to the effect of hurricane typhoon landfall on local erosion deposition in intertidal wetlands less is known about how distant hurricanes typhoons can affect an intertidal wetland or about the comprehensive effects of hurricanes typhoons on hydrodynamics sediment transport and seabed stability here we investigate the possible impacts of thirteen typhoons that occurred in the western pacific during summer autumn 2016 on an intertidal wetland in the yangtze delta we detected the impacts from eight of the typhoons during half of their duration when these typhoons were 450 2000 km away nearest distance ever for each typhoon from the delta these remote typhoons caused 2 5 times maximum increases in hydrodynamics and suspended sediment concentration correspondingly considerable net mudflat erosion and marsh deposition were observed we therefore conclude that intertidal wetlands can be strongly affected by typhoons even those passing by hundreds of kilometres away these findings contribute to understand how far and in what extent hurricanes typhoons can affect intertidal wetlands and to increase knowledge needed for coastal management keywords typhoon mudflat saltmarsh intertidal wetland storm impact yangtze delta 1 introduction intertidal wetlands are among the world s most valuable ecosystems costanza et al 1997 because they provide important ecosystem functions and services barbier et al 2011 kirwan and megonigal 2013 temmerman et al 2013 the environmental stability of intertidal wetlands is presumably a key factor for the health of this ecosystem the long term stability of intertidal wetlands is influenced by sediment supply and relative sea level changes blankespoor et al 2014 yang et al 2018 its responses to fluvial sediment decline land subsidence and global sea level rise has been widely addressed yang et al 2005 blum and roberts 2009 kirwan and megonigal schuerch et al 2018 the short term stability of intertidal wetlands is strongly disturbed by storms tropical cyclones hurricanes typhoons are extreme storms that frequently impact the coasts of the pacific atlantic and india oceans emanuel 2005 knutson et al 2010 although there is great uncertainty about whether or not the frequency of tropical cyclones will increase most studies show that the tropical cyclone intensity should increase as the climate warms webster et al 2005 sobel et al 2016 intertidal wetlands are widely considered to be vulnerable to storm attack leonardi et al 2016 however most previous studies have focused on the strong erosion accretion caused by hurricanes typhoons when they landed at the intertidal wetlands yang et al 2003 turner et al 2006 williams and flanagan 2009 van ormondt et al 2015 liu et al 2017 in contrast less is known about the remote effect of hurricanes typhoons or about their comprehensive effects on hydrodynamics sediment transport and erosion accretion there is a great need to strengthen research in these fields because the sphere of influence of hurricanes typhoons may be much greater than their landing area and because the aspects of storm impact may be much more than the bed level change here we bridge the above knowledge gap by studying the yangtze delta as a model system because it is one of the world s largest deltas in terms of size and its intertidal wetland areas are known to be typically affected each summer by typhoons wang et al 2016 2018 zhu et al 2017 through combination of qualitative description and quantitative analysis we attempt to 1 divide the remote typhoons or typhoon durations into two parts i e the impacting and non impacting ones 2 address the quantitative characteristics of the impacting typhoons 3 quantify the magnitudes of the average and maximum typhoon impacts and 4 develop an impact factor for quantitative relationship between a remote typhoon and its impact this study is unique in that it focuses on how many typhoons that form in the pacific ocean and during how long duration they affect the wetlands in this delta the quantitative characteristics of the impacting typhoons i e their strength and distance from the delta and the comprehensive effects of typhoons including the hydrodynamic mechanism sediment transport

china sea branch of state oceanic administration 2 2 field observations field observations were carried out using a tripod system from august 29 to september 28 2016 on a tidal wetland in the yangtze delta front fig 1 the winds in the yangtze delta are influenced by monsoons and typhoons and the multi year average of wind speed is ca 4 m s yang et al 2008 the tides in this area are mixed semidiurnal with a mean tidal range of 3 2 m in our study site gao et al 2008 the intertidal area is approximately 900 m in width which consists of a salt marsh upper 150 m and a mudflat lower 750 m

on the bed surface to measure the wave parameters and water depth at an interval of 10 min the burst lasted for 256 s and conducted 1024 measurements an aquadopp hr profiler 1 hz nortek norway was deployed on a tripod and its downward facing probe was at a height of 0 7 m above the seabed to measure the current profile an alec current meter 1 hz alec electronics japan was attached to the tripod to measure the point currents at a height of 0 5 m the currents were measured at an interval of 5 min an argus surface meter iv asm 5 hz argus germany which has an array of sensors with a measuring profile of approximately 1 m was mounted to obtain the turbidity profile at an interval of 2 5 min fig 2 the elevations along the cross shore intertidal wetland profile were surveyed before and after typhoons using a high resolution high accuracy real time kinematic global positioning system unit trimble company usa with horizontal and vertical errors of 2 mm all surveys were based on the same reference benchmark that was built into a concrete seawall at the starting point of the central cross shore profile and all repeated surveys of elevation were conducted at fixed sites on the wetlands to avoid the influence of the footprints on the results of surveys we were careful not to trample on the soft soils at the survey points while reading the elevation we held the rtk gps and placed it just onto the sediment surface preventing it from sinking into the soils water samples were acquired at the observation site for suspended sediment concentration ssc calibration surficial bed sediments were collected each day during the ebb period to measure the water content and the grain size we used a buried plate method to measure relative bed level changes between tidal cycles zhu et al 2017 to avoid the disturbance of the tripod the buried plate site was 5 m away from the tripod in the longshore direction specifically we buried a square ceramic tile 0 3 m beneath the sediment surface then we smoothed the sediment surface to be consistent with the surrounding areas the first measurement was performed two tidal cycles after burial of the tile by which time the mudflat had been restored to its undisturbed state we measured the distance between the sediment surface and the plate using 16 thin sticks inserted vertically into the sediment to minimize the impact from the ripples we positioned eight sticks on ripple crests and a further eight within ripple troughs relative bed level changes were calculated from the difference between the two measurements 2 3 data processing in situ turbidity data obtained from the asm were converted to suspended sediment concentration data via a calibration equation in the laboratory using water samples collected in situ fig 3 grain size analyses were measured in laboratory for the surficial sediment samples using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer coulter ls100q coulter inc usa after removal of organic matter to obtain the grain size distribution curves of the sediment mean bed shear stress caused by combined wave current action τcw during 10 min periods and critical shear stress for the erosion of bottom sediment τe were computed see details in appendix a to study sediment transport and bed level changes to quantifiably describe the potential impacts of a remote typhoon on coastal meteorological hydrodynamics we developed a dimensionless impact factor of a typhoon ift which was defined as 1 if t 100 s t d t â c where st is the maximum wind speed near the typhoon center m s dt c is the distance between the typhoon center and the coast km the number 100 is used to ensure that the ift values range from 1 to 10 this factor is based on the assumption that a typhoon impact is mainly determined by the wind speed of the typhoon center and the distance between the typhoon and the coast and that ift is proportional to st but inversely proportional to dt c correlations between ift and wind speed wsy and wave height hn in the yangtze delta were established and the significance levels of the correlations were tested using regression approaches to investigate the time lag in wsy and hn after ift we established correlations with time lags of 1 5 tides and compared their correlation coefficients with the correlation coefficient of the in phase correlation we selected the correlation with the highest correlation coefficient we defined the time lag as that has the highest correlation coefficient the rate at which the wave group as a whole travels across the open ocean between the typhoon and the coast was calculated using the following equation 2 c g g t 4 π where g is the acceleration of gravity t is the wave period and π is the circumference ratio komar 1976 3 results and discussion during july through september 2016 thirteen typhoons were formed and moved northwestward through the western pacific fig 1 the maximum sustained wind speed near the typhoon center ranged from 17 to 70 m s the typhoon circle radius of 17 m s wind speed was between 100 and 600 km and the distance between the typhoon center and the yangtze delta varied from 200 to 4000 km fig 4 a the duration of these typhoons together amounted to 65 of time of the three months 3 1 remote impacts of typhoons on coastal winds at the yangtze delta the tide averaged wind speed ranged from 1 5 to 8 4 m s 4 8 m s on average during the non typhoon periods among the 115 tides when one or two typhoons were moving across the pacific ocean 10 tides were accompanied by wind speeds higher than the maximum wind speed during non typhoon periods the wind speeds during these 10 tides were 10 m s on average fig 4b table s1 during these 10 tides the wind speed at the yangtze delta were most likely influenced by typhoons on average the 6 5 m s wind speeds at the yangtze delta in the typhoon periods were equal to the wind speeds in the non typhoon periods thus the 6 5 8 4 m s wind speeds at the yangtze delta in the typhoon periods may also have been influenced by typhoons these wind speeds were observed during 22 tides table s1 therefore we conclude that the wind speeds at the yangtze delta were more or less influenced by typhoons during 32 tides or 28 of the duration of the typhoon periods during the impacting typhoons defined as the periods when a typhoon impact on wind speed in the yangtze delta was detected the distance between the typhoon center and the yangtze delta dt y the maximum wind speed near typhoon center wst the impact factor of typhoon ift and the wind speed in the yangtze delta wsy were on average 1650 km 38 m s 4 4 and 8 4 m s respectively during the non impacting typhoons defined as the periods when a typhoon impact on the yangtze delta was undetected the values of dt y wst ift and wsy were on average 1800 km 29 m s 2 2 and 4 8 m s equal to the mean wind speed under no typhoon conditions respectively during the impacting typhoons the correlation between wsy and ift was statistically significant r2 0 35 and p 0 001 for all the impacting periods and r2 ranging from 0 70 to 0 99 and p 0 001 for the three individual typhoon events fig s1 however there was no significant correlation between wsy and ift r2 0 009 p 0 4 during the non impacting typhoons data shown in table s1 in addition to increasing wind speed typhoons often changed wind direction and sometimes reduced wind speed at the yangtze delta this is because in summer the monsoon induced winds in the east china sea are typically northward or northwestward fig 4b sun et al 2016 on the other hand the typhoon generated winds at the yangtze delta tended to be southwestward or southward fig 4b because the typhoons were often to the southeast or east of the yangtze delta fig 1 and because typhoon systems rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere bridges 1987 thus at the beginning and end of the typhoon impact the winds at the yangtze delta tended to be weaker and change directions fig 4b 3 2 remote impacts of typhoons on coastal hydrodynamics 3 2 1 impact on waves during our observations of the mudflat in the yangtze delta the tide averaged significant wave height at the mudflat station was closely correlated with the tide averaged significant wave height at the nearshore station r2 0 56 data shown in table s1 thus the wave heights at the nearshore station prior to our mudflat observation can be used to understand the wave conditions on the mudflat for a longer time period at the nearshore station in the yangtze delta front the lowest wave heights were all found during calm weather wind speed 2 3 m s for example at the nearshore station where the water depth is 5 m on average the significant wave height 6 hour average was lowest ca 0 2 m on 15 july 4 august and 9 september fig 4c these minimal wave heights likely had little relation to tidal conditions because they were recorded under different tidal conditions ranging from neap 15 july to spring tides 5 august fig 4 on the other hand the highest wave heights were recorded during remote typhoons that increased the wind speed in the yangtze delta specifically the significant wave height at the nearshore station reached 1 5 m on 28 august t113 when typhoon lionrock was passing more than 1500 km away with a maximum wind speed 51 m s near the typhoon eye fig 4 this wave height was 7 5 times higher than the wave height under calm weather fig 4 the second largest wave height 1 4 m was recorded during t155 september 18 19 when typhoon malakas was passing 450 km away with a maximum wind speed 46 m s near the typhoon center the third largest wave height 1 35 m was observed during t173 september 28 when typhoon megi was passing 770 km away with a maximum wind speed of 29 m s near the typhoon center fig 4 similar to the wind speed in the yangtze delta the wave height at this delta was affected by only some remote typhoons and only during part of their duration the maximum tide averaged significant wave height during the non typhoon periods was 0 65 m among the 115 tides when one or two typhoons were moving across the pacific ocean 37 tides were accompanied by tide averaged significant wave heights higher than the maximum wave height during the non typhoon periods the significant wave heights during these 37 tides were on average 0 9 m the waves in the yangtze delta were most likely affected by remote typhoons during these 37 tides on average the 0 59 m significant wave heights in the typhoon periods were equal to the significant wave heights in the no typhoon periods thus the 0 59 65 m significant wave heights in the typhoon periods may also have been influenced by typhoons these significant wave heights were observed during 12 tides table s1 therefore we concluded that the significant wave heights were influenced to different extents by typhoons during 49 tides or 43 of the duration of the typhoon periods thus the number of tides associated with a detectable typhoon impact on waves in the yangtze delta was much greater than the number of tides associated with a detectable typhoon impact on wind speed this result suggests that the impacts of remote typhoons on waves in the yangtze delta included not only an increase in wind driven waves in the delta itself but also swells that propagated into the yangtze delta area from the remote pacific ocean where one or more typhoons generated tall waves thus even if the winds in the yangtze delta are not affected by a remote typhoon the waves generated by this typhoon in the far ocean may partly propagate into waters near the yangtze delta for typical typhoon events that significantly influenced the waves in the yangtze delta the wave height in the yangtze delta nearshore station hn was closely correlated with the impact factor of the typhoon for example the correlation coefficient r2 between hn and ift reached 0 94 significance level p 0 05 during typhoon malakas fig s2a for typhoon meranti when a 0 5 day 1 tide lag in wave height was considered the correlation coefficient between hn and ift reached its peak r2 0 58 p 0 05 fig s2b a similar time lag in wave height in the yangtze delta after the impact factor of typhoon was also observed during typhoon lionrock for this typhoon when a 2 day 4 tide lag in wave height was considered the correlation coefficient between hn and ift was at its highest r2 0 82 p 0 01 fig s2 c for all the impacting typhoons defined as the periods when a typhoon impact on wave height in the yangtze delta was detected the correlation coefficient between hn and ift reached its maximum at r2 0 43 p 0 001 when a 0 5 day lag in wave height was considered fig s2 d in contrast for the non impacting typhoons that did not affect the yangtze delta the correlation coefficient between hn and ift decreased to only r2 0 07 data shown in table s1 the time lag of hn after ift was presumably relevant to the progradation of the swells across the open pacific for example the distance between the yangtze delta and the storm center was on average 1600 km during typhoon lionrock based on equation 2 the period of waves travelling across the 1600 km distance over 2 days would be ca 12 s which is supported by the wave periods in the western pacific during the typhoon lionrock predicted by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ranging from 11 to 15 s and being 12 1 s on average although the origin and progradation of waves on the open ocean could be more complex than addressed above our coarse estimation likely explains the main mechanism of the time lag among the waves in the yangtze delta after a remote typhoon occurrence during the impacting typhoons the distance between the typhoon center and the yangtze delta the maximum wind speed near the typhoon center the impact factor of typhoon and the significant wave height at the nearshore station in the yangtze delta were on average 1600 km 38 m s 4 3 and 0 85 m respectively during the non impacting typhoons they were on average 2100 km 27 m s 1 9 and 0 42 m equal to the mean significant wave height under no typhoon weathers respectively at the mudflat station the tide averaged significant wave height was positively correlated with the tide averaged water depth during the periods of no typhoon non impacting typhoon and impacting typhoon the correlation between wave height and water depth under no typhoon was similar to that under non impacting typhoon however the correlation trendline of the impacting typhoon was far above the correlation trendlines of the no typhoon and non impacting typhoon fig 6a suggesting that the wave height during impacting typhoons were substantially higher than the wave heights during no typhoon and non impacting typhoon periods at equal water depths based on the correlation equations the wave heights under the impacting typhoons 0 55 m were on average 2 2 times higher than the wave heights under no typhoon and non impacting typhoon conditions 0 25 m the maximum typhoon impact on wave height occurred during the twin meranti and malakas typhoons when the tide averaged significant wave height measured at the mudflat station reached 1 16 m during tidal cycle t150 fig 5 and table s1 which was 4 2 times higher than that 0 28 m predicted by the correlations for non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations in fig 6 a for 2 06 m of water depth in tidal cycle t150 considering that the tide averaged water depth over the mudflat is mainly determined by tidal range the correlation between tide averaged wave height and water depth basically reflects the tide control the wave height measured at the mudflat station tended to show peak values in the flood phase of each tidal cycle fig 5c the asymmetry in the intra tidal wave height curve likely reflects the difference in influencing factors between the flood and ebb phases during the flood phase the wave propagation direction was the same as the onshore tidal current direction on the other hand during the ebb phase the wave propagation direction was opposite the offshore tidal current direction the intra tidal pattern of wave height i e increasing in the flood phase and decreasing in the ebb phase also reflects the strong influence of water depth on waves in tidal wetlands yang et al 2012 this intra tidal pattern was present because of the high resolution of the wave measurements i e 10 min average if the resolution of wave height was 6 h as at the nearshore station then the above intra tidal pattern could not be observed despite the intra tidal pattern of wave height the impact of typhoons on wave height in the yangtze delta was clearly detectable in addition to the statistical result for the impacting typhoons as a whole fig 6a typhoon impacts were also reflected in individual typhoon events specifically the wave heights during the twin typhoons meranti and malakas and typhoon megi were significantly higher than in other impacting typhoon periods the comparison of the intra tidal wave height curve between two typical tidal cycles t120 and t149 which were equal in tidal range 4 44 vs 4 43 m and high tide height 5 20 vs 5 17 m but were different in weather condition no typhoon vs twin typhoons meranti and malakas fig 5 table s1 strikingly shows the storm impact on waves at the yangtze delta fig 7 c during the non typhoon tidal cycle t120 the mean wind speed at the yangtze delta was 5 31 m s and the mean significant wave heights at the nearshore and mudflat stations were 0 46 and 0 34 m respectively in contrast during the typhoon affected tidal cycle t149 the mean wind speed was 8 44 m s and the mean significant wave heights at the nearshore and mudflat stations were 0 87 and 1 07 m respectively fig 5 and table s1 the intra tidal maximum wave height at the mudflat station was 0 72 m in t120 and 2 50 m in t149 fig 5c 3 2 2 impact on currents tidal current velocity increases with tidal range alvarez 2010 call et al 2015 this scenario is supported by our finding that the tide averaged near bed current velocity at the mudflat station was closely correlated with the astronomical tide range fig 6b however the correlation trendline of the impacting typhoon situation was significantly above the correlation trendlines of the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations whereas the correlation trendlines of the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations were similar this result suggests that given the same tidal range the current velocity during impacting typhoons was significantly higher than the current velocity during non impacting typhoons and no typhoon periods based on the correlation equations the current velocities during the impacting typhoons 0 41 m s were on average 24 higher than the current velocities during the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon periods 0 33 m s the maximum typhoon impact on current velocity occurred during the twin typhoons meranti and malakas when the tide averaged current velocity measured at the mudflat station reached 0 6 m s tidal cycle t150 fig 5 and table s1 which was 67 greater than that 0 36 m s predicted by the correlations for the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations in fig 6b for 4 25 m of tidal range during tidal cycle t150 strikingly the maximum typhoon impact on current velocity occurred at the same time as the maximum typhoon impact on wave height i e on september 16 t150 fig 5 and table s1 the typhoon impact on current velocity in the intertidal wetland was also reflected in the comparison of intra tidal velocity curves between two tides that were equal in astronomical tidal ranges but were different in wind speeds and wave heights for example during the two tidal cycles of t120 and t149 the astronomical tidal ranges were 4 44 and 4 43 m and the wind speeds were 5 31 and 8 44 m s respectively table s1 during these two tides the overall v shaped intra tidal pattern of the velocity curves hardly changed that is the velocity decreased during the flood phase reached a minimum approximately at the high tide and then increased during the ebb phase however the current velocity of t149 was generally higher than the velocity of t120 the increased velocity occurred mainly in the earlier or shallower flood stage fig 7d on average the current velocity was 0 37 m s during tide t120 and 0 55 m s during tide t149 corresponding to a significant wave height of 0 34 m in t120 and 1 07 m in t149 table s1 the overall increase in current velocity due to a typhoon impact was attributable to wind induced currents wu 1975 weber 1983 chang et al 2012 and wave induced flow shaikh and siddiqui 2011 the wind and wave induced near bed currents are assumed to be inversely proportional to water depth and to be significant in shallow waters such as that over the intertidal wetland the correlation coefficient between current velocity and tidal range was relatively lower under a typhoon impact r2 0 56 than under conditions of a non impacting typhoon and no typhoon r2 0 75 0 79 fig 6b this result likely reflects that the superposition of typhoon induced currents which are independent of tidal range somewhat disturbs the relationship between current velocity and tidal range furthermore the storm induced currents observed during this study likely varied among the typhoon events 3 2 3 impact on bed shear stress as an indicator of combined current wave action for estimating sediment pick up rate τcw measured on the mudflat showed spring neap and storm no storm patterns similar to current velocity and wave height fig 5 the change in τcw was the comprehensive impact of tidal variation local winds and typhoons like the tide averaged wave height and current velocity the tide averaged τcw was closely correlated with the tidal range however the correlation trendline of the impacting typhoon category was far above the correlation trendlines of the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon categories based on the equations of these correlations the τcw values under the impacting typhoons were on average 0 40 n m2 or 60 higher than the mean τcw value 0 25 n m2 predicted for the no typhoon and non impacting typhoon conditions the maximum typhoon impact on tide averaged τcw was also occurred during the twin typhoons meranti and malakas the measured τcw in the tidal cycle t147 was 0 61 n m2 which was 2 3 times higher than the 0 26 n m2 predicted for the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations using the correlations in fig 6c given the 3 86 m in tidal range that the time of the maximum typhoon impact on τcw slightly deviated from the time of the maximum typhoon impacts on wave height and current velocity is probably because the τcw is determined by not only wave height and current velocity but also water depth and velocity profile whitehouse et al 2000 the comparison of τcw between t120 and t149 that are equal in tidal condition was most convincing for the typhoon impact during an individual tidal cycle the average τcw was 0 29 n m2 during the no typhoon tide t120 and 0 53 n m2 during the stormy tide t149 the intra tidal patterns of τcw in the two tides were similar but τcw during t149 was significantly greater than during t120 for most of the tidal cycle fig 7e under no typhoon and neap tidal conditions τcw was close to the critical shear stress for erosion τe for example during the no typhoon neap tide t136 the τcw ranged from 0 01 to 0 45 and 0 12 n m2 on average in comparison with τe 0 09 n m2 this suggests that bottom sediment can be resuspended only in part of the tide duration in the period of calm weather and neap tides however during typhoon affected tidal cycles e g t147 t151 t153 t156 all τcw values could be greater than τ e and the averaged τ cw could be 5 times higher than τe in addition the water height and submergence duration on the intertidal wetland increased during 80 of the storm affected tidal cycles for example the water height at the high tide of t149 increased by 0 15 m and the submergence duration on the intertidal wetland lengthened by 0 25 h fig 6b the maximum increases in water height and submergence were 0 43 m and 0 7 h respectively 3 3 remote impact of typhoons on coastal suspended sediment concentration the ssc measured in the 1 m water column above the mudflat in the yangtze delta showed a similar temporal pattern to that of τ cw fig 5 there was a significant positive correlation between the tide averaged ssc and tide averaged τ cw fig 6d however the highest τ cw ssc data couples were measured during the impacting typhoons whereas no significant difference between non impacting typhoons and no typhoons was found fig 6d based on the correlation shown in fig 6d the ssc would be 7 9 kg m3 for the mean τ cw of impacting typhoon 0 40 n m2 and would be 5 5 kg m3 for the mean τ cw of non impacting typhoon and no typhoon 0 25 n m2 suggesting that the ssc was increased by 44 on average by the typhoon impacts similarly the ssc would be 11 3 kg m3 during the tidal cycle t147 when the typhoon impact on τ cw reached its maximum 0 61 n m2 and would be 5 7 kg m3 for the corresponding τ cw under presumed non impacting typhoon and no typhoon conditions 0 26 n m2 suggesting that the tide averaged ssc during the maximum impacting typhoon was 2 0 times greater than the ssc under non impacting typhoon and no typhoon situations that is some of the remote typhoons significantly increased the ssc in the intertidal wetland of the yangtze delta by affecting the delta hydrodynamics in the classic comparison between two tides that are equal in tidal range and high tidal level the ssc in the typhoon influenced tide t149 6 81 kg m3 was 1 7 times higher on average than the ssc in the no typhoon tide t120 3 94 kg m3 although the intra tidal and vertical patterns of ssc in the two tidal cycles were similar fig 7f fig 8 during the typhoon affected tides t153 t158 when the difference between τcw and τe becomes greater than during tide t149 fig 5f table s1 the tide averaged sscs reached 11 6 15 3 kg m3 table s1 suggesting that the amount of resuspended sediment is proportional to the difference between τcw and τe during these tides the ssc in several decimeters closest to the bottom even exceeded the upper detection limit of asm 17 3 kg m3 fig 8 it is necessary to indicate that the tidal cycles of t153 t158 were spring tides fig 5 the extremely high sscs during this period reflect the combined impact of typhoon and spring tides the tidal ranges of the tidal cycles t153 t158 were 4 75 m on average according to the correlations between tidal range and τcw under the non impacting typhoon and no typhoon conditions fig 6c the τcw would be 0 32 n m2 given the tidal range 4 75 this τcw value would result in an ssc of 6 6 kg m3 based on the correlation between ssc and τcw fig 6d the long term average tidal range in the study area is 3 2 m zhu et al 2014 which would result in a τcw of 0 21 n m2 and an ssc of 4 9 kg m3 under non impacting typhoon and no typhoon conditions based on the correlations in fig 6c and d the sscs observed during t153 t158 were on average 12 9 kg m3 table s1 thus compared with the ssc under normal weather and tidal conditions the ssc increased by 8 0 kg m3 during the stormy and spring tidal period of t153 t158 21 of this rise in ssc was attributed to increased tidal range whereas 79 of the rise in ssc was due to the impact of the remote typhoon malakas the ssc in the yangtze delta was closely correlated with the impact factor of the typhoon with a 2 tide lag in ssc after ift was considered the correlation coefficient reached the maximum r2 0 74 p 0 001 fig 6e that was significantly greater than the in phase correlation coefficient between the ssc and ift r2 0 36 p 0 001 for the non impacting typhoon category alone the in phase correlation between the ssc and ift was not statistically significant r2 0 01 p 0 92 correlation diagrams omitted even though the 2 tide lag correlation became closer fig 6e this suggests that the above significant correlation between the ssc and ift was contributed mainly by the data of impacting typhoon based on fig 6e we conclude 1 when ift 5 2 the remote typhoon was certainly an impacting typhoon that would cause sediment resuspension and increase ssc in the yangtze delta 2 when ift 5 2 the remote typhoon could be either an impacting typhoon or a non impacting typhoon considering that the ssc was also influenced by tidal range we established a binary regression relationship to reflect the combined influences of typhoon and tidal range 3 in phase correlation c 1 629 t r 0 428 if t 1 045 r 2 0 57 p 0 001 4 2 tide c lag behind if t c 0 654 t r 0 929 if t 0 262 r 2 0 79 p 0 001 where c represents the ssc kg m3 tr represents the tidal range these binary regressions suggest that as an ssc lag was considered 1 the correlation coefficient significantly increased 2 the module reflecting the weight of ift increased from 0 428 to 0 929 whereas the module reflecting the weight of tr decreased from 1 629 to 0 654 the ssc lag presumedly resulted from the hydrodynamics lag after the remote impacting typhoon as shown above thus it is necessary to consider a time lag in studying the impact of remote typhoon on sediment resuspension and bed stability the time duration of storm impact on ssc is likely longer than the impact on hydrodynamics because the deposition of suspended fine grained sediments after the decline of hydrodynamics in the post storm period requires some time this time lag of ssc decline was well shown in the post malakas period for example during tides t159 t162 after typhoon malakas the ssc was 8 6 10 3 kg m3 much higher than usual although the hydrodynamics had decreased to a very low level fig 5 table s1 it is also due to this time lag that the ssc during mean tides after spring tides tends to be higher than the ssc during mean tides prior to spring tides given similar weather conditions osborne and greenwood 2010 3 4 remote impact of typhoons on seabed stability in previous studies it was found that typhoon or hurricane landfall tends to cause severe erosion in the subtidal seabed mudflat and low marsh edges whereas it causes rapid accretion in the inner marsh area yang et al 2003 turner et al 2006 in the present study after the passing of a series of remote typhoons net erosion was found on the mudflat even though deposition was observed somewhere the comparison between the cross shore intertidal wetland profiles surveyed before and after the typhoons suggests that most of the mudflat experienced erosion during the typhoon season the net erosion in the mudflat profile was 3 cm and the maximum erosion reached 22 cm in the transitional zone between the mudflat and the marsh deposition was found only in the middle flat where the sediment surface was originally low lying fig 9 at the tripod system observation site the erosion during the twin meranti and malakas typhoons reached a maximum of ca 8 cm fig 5e after the twin meranti and malakas typhoons the mudflat experienced a week of deposition and bed level recovery fig 5e in a previous study of typhoon impact on intertidal wetland stability in the yangtze delta the bed level recovery period was also found to be approximately a week yang et al 2003 nevertheless the one week of bed level recovery coincided with a transition period from spring to neap tides both in the present and the previous study presumedly the ssc tends to decrease from spring to neap tides and the mudflat tends to experience deposition and bed level recovery unless this process is interrupted by storm events thus the bed level recovery period would be longer than a week under other conditions e g transition from neap to spring tides given the same storm generated erosion as found in this study the temporal trend of the relative bed level is overall opposite to that of the τcw on the mudflat fig 5e and the correlation coefficient r between these variables is 0 6 this suggests that the mudflat tends to erode as the τcw increases and vice versa as shown above although the increase in τcw during the twin typhoons was partly owing to the spring tides the impact from the typhoons was obvious therefore the erosion on the mudflat should be partly attributed to typhoons considering that the changes in ssc in the mudflat are the results of sediment deposition pick up and that sediment deposition pick up are directly link with bed level changes the significant increase in ssc during typhoon events also suggests strong seabed erosion during the same period we also found an erosion of 12 cm at the low marsh edge however most of the marshes experienced deposition the mean marsh deposition in the cross shore profile was 13 cm fig 9 noticeably we found the formation of a washover sand body in the low marsh which buried the existing plant scirpus mariqueter and silted up a tidal creek fig 10 the comparison between the pre and post typhoons profiles suggests that the formation of this washover sand likely linked with the landward movement of an earlier washover sand body and the maximum deposition in the center of the present washover sand body reached 31 cm fig 9 the washover sand body was composed of fine sands median size d50 0 13 0 16 mm which are much coarser than the mud found both on the mudflat d50 0 04 0 06 mm and on the inner marsh d50 0 007 0 024 mm the elevation of the washover sand body was 10 30 cm higher than the marshland on the landward side excavating the sand cover residual stems of the marsh plant were exposed suggesting that the washover sand body was rapid deposition on the marsh we infer that the washover sand body was formed during typhoon storm surges we found that under non typhoon conditions waves were low and currents were weak near the high tide which were unfavourable conditions for the movement of sands as bed load leading to only mud deposition in this area in contrast during typhoon storm surges extremely large and high waves hit the low marsh edge leading to strong wash flows which eroded the mud and left sands as a result a washover sand body was formed on the landward side of the low marsh edge storm generated washover sand bodies were often found in backbarrier marshes donnelly et al 2004 on other coasts of the yangtze delta washover sand deposits were also formed in low salt marshes during the landfalls of strong typhoons yang et al 2000 2003 in the present study we found that large washover sand bodies also developed in low salt marshes during storm surges even if the typhoons were passing hundreds of kilometers away the different morphological responses to typhoons between the marsh and the mudflat also increased the elevation gradient in the mudflat marsh transitional zone leonardi et al 2018 3 5 determinants of remote typhoon impacts our results suggest that the yangtze delta was affected by only some of the remote typhoons and during only part of the impacting typhoons the impact of a typhoon on an intertidal wetland is presumedly determined by the integration of multiple factors such as typhoon strength distance between a typhoon and the coast typhoon duration marine bathymetry coastal configuration sediment composition of the intertidal wetland marsh swamp vegetation tidal conditions e g microtidal mesotidal or macrotidal spring or neap tides and previous state of erosion accretion the typhoons that did not affect the yangtze delta were too far away or and relatively weak specifically typhoon lupit had maximum wind speeds of only 18 m s near the storm center and was more than 3400 km away from the yangtze delta typhoon nida had maximum wind speeds of 18 38 m s and was 1200 1600 km away typhoon conson had maximum wind speeds of 20 27 m s and was 3200 3700 km away and typhoon chanthu had maximum wind speeds of 18 23 m s and was 1900 3200 km away our attempt to use the ift factor to quantify the remote impact of typhoons was not perfect because it only reflects the impact of typhoon strength and the distance between the typhoon center and the studied coast eq 1 this approach fails to incorporate the impacts of other influencing factors as a result the correlations between ift and coastal wind speed wave height were not close when all typhoon events were considered r2 0 45 although the r2 could exceed 0 95 for individual typhoons fig s1 fig s2 when the ift was higher than 5 2 the intertidal wetlands in the yangtze delta was clearly affected by the remote typhoon however when the ift ws lower than 5 2 the intertidal wetlands in the yangtze delta could be impacted or could not be impacted by the remote typhoon depending on the influenced of other factors considering the shortcomings of the ift shown above more influencing factors need to be incorporated into this impact factor in future studies to improve its accuracy and applicability 4 conclusions the intertidal wetland in the yangtze delta was influenced to different extents by 8 of the 13 typhoons that occurred in the west pacific ocean during july through september 2016 the delta was affected during half of the duration of these 8 typhoons during the influenced periods the distance between the delta and the typhoon center was 450 2000 km and the maximum wind speed near the typhoon center was 20 62 m s the typhoons that did not affect the yangtze delta were too far 2000 km from the delta or and relatively weak 20 m s in maximum wind speed near the storm center the typhoons impacting the delta increased wind speed 11 5 m s with maximum impact vs 4 8 m s on average with no storm impact water height 3 73 m vs 3 30 m duration of tidal inundation 8 8 h vs 8 1 h wave height 1 2 m vs 0 26 m and current velocity 0 60 m s vs 0 31 m s thereby enhancing the bed shear stress due to combined current wave action 0 65 n m2 vs 0 27 n m2 and resulting in sediment suspension 15 3 kg m3 vs 4 5 kg m3 in near bed ssc during the periods of impacting typhoons the mudflat experienced considerable net erosion whereas the main marsh experience rapid deposition and the low marsh was buried by a washover fine sand body and a creek there was silted up we conclude that the hydrodynamic sedimentary and erosion accretion processes in intertidal wetlands can be significantly influenced by typhoons even if they pass hundreds of kilometers or more than a thousand kilometers away these findings contribute to increase knowledge of how far and in what extent hurricanes typhoons can affect intertidal wetlands that is needed for coastal

6377,this study investigates moisture origin characteristics and intra event scale variability of the isotopic signature of rainfall in a mediterranean mountain area based on data from the vallcebre research catchments ne spain weekly data and samples were used to analyse the general dynamics of the isotopic composition of precipitation and its relationship with meteorological variables at the sampling site then based on the data and samples available at the intra event scale the variability of the isotopic signature during rainfall events was characterised and an explanation of what caused the observed variability was attempted results at the weekly time scale show that the maximum relative deviation of the heavy isotopic content with respect to standard mean ocean water δ 18 o of the precipitation signature occurred during summer months and in contrast the minimum during winter months the intra annual trend of rainfall δ 18 o roughly followed the mean monthly air temperature using intra event information three main types of δ 18 o isotopic trends were found during rainfall events most of the events had a v shaped isotopic trend followed by l shaped and constant trend events changes in moisture sources diagnosed using a lagrangian approach and a previously existing contribution algorithm were one of the causes of the isotopic variability and changes at the intra event scale but these may also have been influenced by sub cloud processes that modified the isotopic signature moisture sources for analysed events showed the main influence of the mediterranean area but also an important influence of the atlantic basin keywords precipitation stable isotopes backward trajectories moisture source regions intra event scale analysis mediterranean area 1 introduction the stable isotopes of water oxygen 18 and deuterium play an important role in the study of the global hydrologic cycle gat 1996 natural waters mainly the oceans have a relatively uniform isotopic composition dansgaard 1964 legrande and schmidt 2006 whereas meteoric waters are not in partitioning equilibrium the reason is isotopic fractionation which can be differentiated into two types equilibrium and non equilibrium fractionations the former implies that the ratios of different isotopes in each compound are constant for a particular temperature kendall and mcdonnell 1998 an example would be the condensation of water vapour to form rain clouds where the molecules with heavier isotopes condense more easily than those with light isotopes in this case the liquid phase of water is enriched with heavy isotopes whereas light isotopes are left in the vapour phase the non equilibrium fractionations also known as kinetic fractionations rely on the ratios of the masses of the isotopes and their vibrational energies craig 1961 bonds of molecules with light isotopes are easily broken and react faster than molecules with heavy isotopes an example of kinetic fractionation is raindrops evaporation which implies the isotopic exchange between precipitation and the surrounding moisture in the sub cloud layer during its path to the surface dansgaard 1964 isotopic composition of precipitation varies greatly and depends on many factors among which are the origin of the air masses the rain out history evaporation and condensation conditions when the precipitation forms and atmospheric transport dansgaard 1964 gat and gonfiantini 1981 rozanski et al 1992 dansgaard 1964 also found a seasonal variation and latitude altitude and continental effects on isotopic composition of precipitation which are related to rain out history and temperature finally several studies e g dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1992 araguás araguás et al 2000 yu et al 2016 ren et al 2017 show a relationship between stable isotopes and local meteorological variables such as air temperature relative humidity or rainfall amount the variability of the isotopic composition of precipitation is not only present in the source area or during atmospheric transport but also at the intra event scale this has led to the study of single rain events in order to analyse the variations in the isotopic content of precipitation and relate these to atmospheric processes rindsberger et al 1990 good et al 2014 three main isotopic trends have been identified in different rainfall events l shaped v shaped and constant trends e g miyake 1968 celle jeanton et al 2001 celle jeanton et al 2004 muller et al 2015 the trend of the isotopic composition of precipitation at the event scale depends on rainfall intensity the altitude where rain forms whether it is convective or stratiform rain and if it is caused by a cold or warm front among other considerations apart from the analysis of isotopic trends the origin of air masses and the identification of moisture sources have also been the subjects of many studies celle jeanton et al 2001 found that precipitation from mediterranean sources was more enriched in heavy isotopes than that from atlantic sources liotta et al 2008 related the isotopic composition of rainfall events in sicily to evaporation from the different areas of the mediterranean sea around the island many other studies used a trajectory analysis to determine the moisture sources guan et al 2013 used the hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model model to analyse deuterium excess d excess variations in relation with atmospheric sources in australia tyler et al 2016 worked with the hysplit model to study moisture sources at daily time scale in the british isles guo et al 2017 also used the aforementioned model to derive the moisture transport path of individual events on the tibetan plateau lekshmy et al 2018 analysed the moisture source during monsoon in india pfahl and wernli 2008 winschall et al 2014 and krklec et al 2018 used a moisture diagnostic algorithm proposed by sodemann et al 2008 to determine quantitatively rather than only qualitatively the moisture sources in the eastern mediterranean the north western mediterranean and central europe respectively in addition pfahl and wernli 2008 used a lagrangian approach to relate the isotopic composition of water vapour to evaporative conditions rhsst of the moisture sources this information opened up the possibility of inferring whether intra event variability is related to a change in the moisture source or to other meteorological processes the quantitative approach followed by pfahl and wernli 2008 established a relationship between the moisture source s meteorological variables which include sea surface temperature and two meter relative humidity and d excess the relevance of using d excess is that it is a parameter correlated with the physical conditions of the moisture sources froehlich et al 2002 guan et al 2013 pfahl and sodemann 2014 for instance high deuterium excess values indicate low relative humidity at the moisture sources consequently a change in d excess value may be related to a change in the moisture source hence the isotope signature of precipitation at a specific measurement site represents the total imprint of all equilibrium and non equilibrium fractionation processes that occurred during its transport in the last 30 years the vallcebre research catchments have concentrated on many studies concerned with understanding the hydrological functioning of mediterranean mountain catchments llorens et al 2018 in some recent studies that used stable isotopes of water some significant variability in isotopic composition of precipitation at the event scale was observed this variability has been taken into account in the study of hydrological processes using stable isotopes cayuela et al 2018 but the dynamics and the reasons for this variability remain unclear this study focuses on what is happening before the precipitation reaches the ground and in particular addresses the question of which are the factors behind the variability in isotopic composition in precipitation events for this purpose the isotopic composition of precipitation sampled in the vallcebre research catchments was analysed to obtain a local meteoric water line and to test the relationship of δ 18 o with local air temperature and rain amount then based on intra event scale data the different trends followed by the isotopic composition of precipitation were analysed different processes may determine the isotopic variability and its values such as rainfall intensity conditions below the cloud altitude at which rain is produced the weather system involved and changes in air masses muller et al 2015 altogether were analysed to establish its importance in governing intra event isotopic variability and mean isotopic event values to account for changes in air masses a backward trajectory analysis based on the methodology proposed by sodemann et al 2008 was done with the hysplit model to quantify the origin of moisture this approach enabled us to document the moisture source of selected events and relate it to their d excess values so providing a deeper understanding of possible processes influencing isotopic variability of precipitation 2 methodology 2 1 study site the vallcebre research catchments are located at the headwaters of the llobregat river on the southern margin of the pyrenees ne spain 42 12 n 1 49 e with altitudes between 1100 and 1700 m above sea level a s l gallart et al 2005 there are different sub catchments cal parisa 0 32 km2 and cal rodó 4 17 km2 which in turn has two sub catchments can vila 0 56 km2 and ca l isard 1 32 km2 this area has been used since 1989 for the study and modelling of hydrological processes with the aim of providing new information to evaluate the effects of global change on water resources in mediterranean catchments latron et al 2014 a complete overview of the results obtained in the vallcebre research catchments can be found in llorens et al 2018 the site climate is defined as mediterranean humid with a mean annual temperature of 9 1 c at 1260 m a s l it has a mean of 90 rainy days per year with a mean annual rainfall of 880 200 mm llorens et al 2018 2 2 data acquisition and analyses the rainfall isotopic data used in this study were sampled in two periods between 2011 and 2016 the first from may 2011 to july 2013 and the second from may 2015 to december 2016 this information was complemented with rainfall and meteorological data measured at an automatic meteorological station located in the upper part of the can vila sub catchment rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge located 1 m above the ground casellas cell uk and air temperature and relative humidity with respective probes vaisala finland all data were measured every 10 s and recorded at 5 min intervals by a datalogger dt500 datataker australia two types of rainwater samplers located next to the rain gauge were used one was a bulk rainfall sampler consisting of a plastic funnel 130 mm diameter connected to a polyethylene plastic bottle by looped tubing the plastic bottle had 1 l capacity and was buried in the ground to prevent heating and evaporation the other sampling device was a plastic funnel 340 mm diameter connected to an automatic water sampler 24 polyethylene 500 ml bottles isco 3700c buried in the ground which allowed for automatic sampling at 5 mm rainfall intervals using this sampling device for 21 of the samples corresponding to intense rainfall i e rainfall intensity higher than 5 mm in 5 min a volume greater than 5 mm of rain may have been collected in a single isco bottle during the sampling periods all samples were collected once a week kept cold to avoid evaporation and sent to the laboratory rainfall samples were analysed for the relative deviation δ of the heavy isotopic content from a standard δ 18 o and δ d with a picarro l2120 i δ d δ 18 o isotopic water analyzer cavity ring down spectroscopy by the scientific technical services of lleida university lleida spain results were expressed as parts per thousand and calibrated to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow craig 1961 precision was 0 05 and 0 3 for δ 18 o and δ d respectively 2 3 general and local meteoric water lines the covariance between δ 18 o and δ d can be described by the relationship defined by craig 1961 and known as the global meteoric water line gmwl 1 δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 the intercept of 10 in eq 1 reflects that meteoric and oceanic waters are not in partitioning equilibrium this value is defined as deuterium excess d excess cancelling the covariation of deuterium and 18o and resulting in a parameter less variable than both isotopes dansgaard 1964 although the gmwl is a useful baseline for comparing stable isotopic data it may not reflect the characteristics or ratios of a local region for this reason a local meteoric water line lmwl with its own slope and intercept is often developed to represent local meteoric conditions that may differ from those described in the gmwl kendall and mcdonnell 1998 2 4 rainfall events characterization two parameters to characterize rainfall events were considered type of precipitation and isotopic trend the first one takes into account the synoptic meteorological situation which was derived from analysis synoptic charts met office 2006 to determine whether precipitation was due to a cold cf or warm front wf a low pressure system l or if it was a non frontal convective shower s the second one is based on a visual classification of the temporal evolution of the isotopic signature into one of the three commonly identified trends e g miyake 1968 celle jeanton et al 2001 celle jeanton et al 2004 l shaped constant and v shaped trend fig 1 a c respectively the l shaped trend describes a steadily decrease of δ followed by a stationary trend if the latter was followed by an increase of δ then the event would be labelled as v shaped finally if the isotopic signature remained mostly constant it would be labelled as constant trend for example if the δ 18 o evolution of an event followed first a depletion then a constant trend and finally an enrichment the trend event would be labelled as v shaped 2 5 moisture source identification and attribution in this study the identification and attribution of moisture sources was based on the quantitative lagrangian moisture source diagnosis proposed by sodemann et al 2008 and applied in several other studies sodemann et al 2008 sodemann and zubler 2010 pfahl and wernli 2008 winschall et al 2014 krklec et al 2018 this methodology was based on the changes in specific humidity of an air parcel during its trajectory from a particular location to the study area two assumptions were made i the integrity of the air parcels over several days and ii every change in specific humidity was related to evaporation or precipitation sodemann et al 2008 to calculate the backward trajectories of each selected rainfall event the hysplit model was used draxler and rolph 2003 stein et al 2015 one degree meteorological gdas global data assimilation system data were selected although a half degree gdas dataset was also available and provided a finer spatial resolution it lacked the vertical velocity that needed to be calculated from horizontal divergence su et al 2015 found that backward trajectories calculated with half degree gdas datasets generate greater uncertainties than those with one degree gdas data thus the coarser resolution gdas dataset was selected and downloaded from the portal available at the hysplit interface gdas is used by the national center for environmental predictions ncep global forecast system gfs model to place observations into a gridded model space with a 3 h temporal resolution it is used by hysplit which finally delivers interpolated trajectory information with hourly resolution the calculation process followed these three steps 1 definition of the starting location of the backward trajectories calculation in this study the vallcebre research catchments 42 12 n 1 49 e 2 the height levels required by the hysplit model were computed from selected pressure levels from 850 hpa to 450 hpa in steps of 50 hpa which were transformed to altitude using the barometric equation and assuming a standard international civil aviation organization icao atmosphere 3 a 10 day backward trajectory was calculated for each level and selected event calculations provided hourly coordinates of the air parcel and hourly meteorological data relevant to this study mixed layer depth relative humidity and specific humidity the vallcebre catchments were considered the end of the trajectory and the start was the location where the air parcel reached a specific humidity q of 0 g kg 1 or if this value was not reached the location where the trajectory was 240 h before the event once all the trajectories were calculated only those that had a decrease of q and a relative humidity higher than 80 at the end of the trajectory were selected this methodology is approximate due to several moisture transport processes that are ignored as sodemann et al 2008 pointed out the variation of specific humidity δ q was also retrieved by the algorithm proposed by sodemann et al 2008 2 δ q t q x t q x t 1 h where x t indicates the position of the air parcel at time t if δ q t 0 1 g kg 1 then there was an uptake of moisture this uptake was classified regarding the altitude of the air parcel in respect to mixed layer height in the present study following sodemann et al 2008 mixed layer height was multiplied by 1 5 henceforward mixed layer height times 1 5 is simply referred as mixed layer height if this uptake took place below the mixed layer height the location of the air parcel was considered a moisture source and the uptake was flagged as attributed however if the uptake happened above the mixed layer height then it was not possible to be certain that the moisture came from the area below the air parcel and the uptake was flagged as above in case δ q t 0 1 g kg 1 then the decrease was assumed to be caused by precipitation wang et al 2017 reported that moisture sources were sensitive to the δ q t threshold value to decide whether a positive δ q t should be considered or not a moisture uptake in the present study δ q t threshold was set to 0 1 g kg 1 although in sodemann et al 2008 a δ q t threshold of 0 2 g kg 1 was adopted the temporal resolution of uptake identification was 6 h whereas in the present study it was 1 h after a sensitivity analysis of δ q t and accounting for the finer δ q t values found for 1 h resolution in comparison to 6 h resolution the threshold of 0 1 g kg 1 was considered suitable details of this analysis are given in appendix a finally once all moisture sources were identified the relative contribution of each one to the moisture at the end of the trajectory was calculated in addition these contributions were classified in different regional divisions fig 2 including the atlantic atl western mediterranean wm eastern mediterranean em continental europe eur africa afr and polar pol regions sources falling outside these regional divisions were considered as not classified sources 3 results 3 1 rainfall stable isotope composition and lmwl the isotopic content of weekly rainfall samples n 125 collected in the vallcebre research catchments can be found in table 1 the δ d and δ 18 o data varied greatly δ d ranged from 152 2 to 4 4 and δ 18 o from 19 1 to 0 8 this variability was reflected in the relatively high values of standard deviations the minimum value of d excess was negative which is not common a d excess value smaller than 3 is considered anomalous due to possible post precipitation interference harvey and welker 2000 or a local isolated air mass yuan and miyamoto 2008 the scatter plot between δ d and δ 18 o is useful since it describes how the heavy isotope components behave in different ways dansgaard 1964 and how different the measurements from the gmwl are in order to calculate the lmwl for vallcebre isotopic composition of weekly rainfall was used isotopic values δ d and δ 18 o were weighted by the amount of rainfall corresponding to each sample fig 3 the local meteoric water line was calculated by an ordinary least squares fitting method with an r2 adjusted value of 0 96 p 0 01 the equation obtained was 3 δ d 7 9 δ 18 o 12 9 3 2 seasonality of rainfall signature fig 4 shows the intra annual variability of the δ 18 o precipitation signature weekly samples and its relationship with weekly mean air temperature and rainfall amount the maximum δ 18 o was recorded in summer 0 8 the minimum in winter 19 1 the intra annual trend of the δ 18 o precipitation signature roughly follows the mean monthly air temperature trend fig 4a a moderate correlation r2 0 44 p 0 01 was found between air temperature and the δ 18 o precipitation signature at vallcebre fig 4b the correlation suggested a reliable relationship between air temperature and isotopic composition of precipitation which is known as the temperature effect when precipitation was considered fig 4c and d no correlation r2 0 01 p 0 19 was found between rainfall amount and its δ 18 o content in this case the amount effect which implies depleted precipitation in heavy isotopes as rainfall depth increases was not seen the δ d precipitation signature followed the same trend as δ 18 o with a minimum value of 152 2 during winter and a maximum of 4 4 in summer 3 3 intra event dynamics out of all the rainfall events identified in the study period 15 events with at least 4 rainfall samples taken by the sequential rainfall sampler e g corresponding to at least 20 mm of rainfall were selected to evaluate the different isotopic trends and types of precipitation observed table 2 δ 18 o mean values for the selected events ranged from their minimum in april 10 8 to their maximum in july 3 0 d excess values ranged from 10 4 in an event in july to 22 2 in november in terms of rainfall characteristics 8 out of 15 events were classified as non frontal convective most of the selected events 12 out of 15 had a v shaped isotopic trend showing that in the first steps of the rainfall event depletion of heavy isotopes occurred however in the final stages of the event precipitation was enriched by heavy isotopes and isotopic composition recovered to be similar to that at the beginning of the rainfall event only two events followed an l shaped isotopic trend the third isotopic trend type with nearly constant isotopic content was identified once which led to minimum values for the standard deviation of δ 18 o and δ d the embedded graph in fig 5 suggests that half of the 15 events analysed fell above the lmwl showing a d excess higher than 12 9 two groups of events could be identified events with d excess values close to the lmwl and events with values further away from the lmwl although half of the events were above the lmwl this does not mean that all individual samples during a rainfall event showed the same trend to show intra event scale variability intra event scale samples are given fig 5 for three selected events that had different isotopic trends events 2 9 and 15 event 2 corresponded to a constant isotopic trend fig 6 and showed less variability the samples are concentrated in the same zone in fig 5 and aligned with a slope of 4 3 which suggests evaporation of raindrops although the precipitation accumulated for each sample events 9 and 15 in contrast had great variability and corresponded to l shaped and v shaped isotopic trends respectively figs 7b and 8 b both events can be associated with equilibrium fractionation effects as their isotopic variability approximately follows the linear relationship of the lmwl with a slope of 7 6 for event 9 and 7 5 for event 15 fig 5 however event 15 is partly affected by kinetic fractionation since its v shape also arise in the δ 18 o and δ d plane not following then the lmwl as event 9 does fig 5 it can be seen in the last sample of event 15 far from the lmwl and with small precipitation amount 3 4 moisture source attribution two or three representative instants of each event were selected to calculate moisture attribution depending on d excess trend e g three specific instants if the d excess decrease is gradual at the beginning in the middle and at the end of the event or only two if the decrease is sharp although the duration of some of the events was close to the gdas data temporal resolution different trajectory calculations were still considered to discard abrupt changes of moisture sources a total of 324 trajectories were calculated for the 15 selected events 113 of them 34 8 met the conditions described in section 2 5 to allow the computing of the moisture uptake history of the backward trajectories the frequency plot of all the valid trajectories fig 9 a had two features i most of the trajectories came from the west as expected from global atmospheric circulation ii the entry to vallcebre research catchments was concentrated in two sectors namely the gulf of bizkaia and the catalan coastline fig 9a from all 113 trajectories considered a 0 5 x 0 5 grid covering their extent was drawn and the contribution to the final moisture from each cell of the grid was calculated fig 9b results showed that 56 of the moisture present above the vallcebre catchments could be attributed to one of the six moisture source regions described in fig 2 40 of the moisture could not be attributed to any source region because it corresponded to uptakes above the boundary layer finally a remaining moisture amount was categorized as unknown in cases when the air parcel was not completely dry at the start position of the trajectory representing 4 of the moisture from the known moisture sources the regions that contributed most were the western mediterranean 58 the atlantic area 25 and the african region 14 contributions from the other regions were less than 1 each moisture source attribution at the event scale table 3 showed that most of the events with a high d excess were related to a predominance of air masses with a western mediterranean and african origin events 2 3 4 11 15 however this did not hold for events 6 and 7 event 9 whose main contributor for moisture origin was the atlantic area showed a mean d excess of 11 0 which may be related to the combination of wm and atl sources event 10 had a mixture of western mediterranean and atlantic moisture contribution sources with little influence from african and european regions this combination may explain the d excess value of 11 9 in event 1 d excess values varied slightly from 10 0 to 13 0 which was also reflected at intra event scale moisture source attribution table 4 in addition mean d excess value of 11 1 may be related to a mixture of wm and atl source regions 3 5 evaluation of the moisture source attribution method the method used to attribute moisture sources was examined in order to evaluate its performance in the study area as shown in fig 10 a period of two days back in time was enough to identify at least half the moisture present above the vallcebre research catchments the mean increase of the known fraction was 23 per day during the first 72 h of backward simulation 6 day from 72 h to 168 h and only 2 day during the last 72 h however identifying half the moisture present above the vallcebre research catchments was not equivalent to knowing 50 of the moisture sources because the known fraction includes the uptakes tagged as above i e not taken from the source region consequently the known fraction has to be divided into two parts attributed and above the 50 barrier of the attributed fraction was overtaken at day 5 when the remaining unknown fraction had a value of 16 this study also showed that 10 day backward trajectories were not sufficient to acquire full knowledge of the moisture origin above vallcebre still it was consistent with mean water residence time in the atmosphere 9 days 3 6 intra event scale variations of characteristic events three characteristic events with different isotopic trends were analysed more fully these were selected beforehand because of the clarity of their δ 18 o isotopic trend this clarity would show their intra event variability properly fig 5 3 6 1 constant trend event 2 30th july 2011 a cold air intrusion with temperatures between 15 c and 10 c at the 500 hpa level characterized the last two days of july 2011 this relatively low temperature at that height induced an unstable atmosphere favouring storms and precipitation the event started at 12 50 utc and ended at 15 20 utc leaving 35 8 mm of rainfall with a mean intensity of 14 7 mm h the event was classified as non frontal convection despite small fluctuations air temperature and relative humidity presented a decreasing trend although three different peaks were observed fig 6a the isotopic composition of precipitation was nearly constant the initial δ 18 o was 6 3 and experienced a slight enrichment to 5 5 as indicated before this event had the minimum values for the standard deviation of δ 18 o and δ d in accordance with the constant isotopic trend identified the d excess increased from an initial value of 19 4 to 21 1 and then decreased to a final value of 14 4 two different instants of the event were selected to calculate the backward trajectories and the moisture sources one at the beginning of the event and another at the end for this event 73 of the moisture origin could be identified 35 corresponded to the western mediterranean area and 29 to the european region the rest was attributed to the atlantic region table 4 the two selected instants had similar trajectory paths but their contribution differed in the first one the contribution from the western mediterranean region was dominant whereas in the second one the european region was the main contributor fig 6c and d 3 6 2 l shaped trend event 9 19th january 2013 this event lasting five days from 18th to 21st january 2013 was due to a cold front an anomaly in the medium tropospheric level thermal field was observed with temperatures below 25 c at 500 hpa at surface level a deep low pressure system with an associated cold front went from west to east over the iberian peninsula the precipitation started on 19th january at 06 15 utc and lasted more than 15 h until 21 50 utc giving 37 8 mm with a mean intensity of 2 4 mm h fig 7a air temperature followed a steadily decreasing trend from 5 c to 1 c whereas relative humidity was mostly constant at 94 during the event except at the start of it where it momentarily decreased to 83 a maximum δ 18 o of 6 1 was observed at the start of the rainfall event the precipitation s heavy isotope content fell steadily reaching a δ 18 o of 12 9 at the end of the event fig 7b the δ 18 o steady fall behaves similarly as air temperature as will be discussed in section 4 3 during the rainfall event the passage of the cold front coincided with maximum rainfall intensity and the highest depletion in heavy isotopes fig 7a and b d excess started with a value of 10 7 then increased to 13 3 later a similar decrease for δ 18 o led to a d excess of 6 6 at the end of the event these d excess changes were identified and used as starting times for the backward trajectories calculations fig 7b most of the trajectories in the three different instants considered had the same trend coming from the atlantic area and crossing over the iberian peninsula from sw to ne fig 7c e moisture source attribution results showed that 74 of the moisture could be associated with a specific region most of the water vapour was attributed to the atlantic area followed by the western mediterranean table 4 the three selected instants showed clear dominance of the atlantic region as a moisture source area the western mediterranean region showed a growing trend as the event developed whereas the atlantic region showed a decreasing trend even so the atlantic region maintained its dominance table 4 3 6 3 v shaped trend event 15 22nd july 2015 this event lasting four days from 19th to 23rd july 2015 was characterized by afternoon convective showers our study focused on the afternoon of 22nd of july from 17 05 utc to 20 15 utc when 54 6 mm of rainfall were recorded the mean intensity was 17 24 mm h and the event was classified as non frontal convection at surface level the situation was dominated by the azores high pressure system but with the presence of a relative low between the sw of the balearic islands and the iberian peninsula the situation at 500 hpa level was not particularly defined but the temperature was around 10 c which could enhance the instability of the atmosphere the bulk of the precipitation took place between 17 45 utc and 19 05 utc when maximum intensity reached nearly 10 mm in 5 min fig 8a air temperature and relative humidity values followed opposite trends on one hand the former experienced a sharp decrease from 16 5 c to 11 5 c coinciding with the bulk of rainfall and kept relatively constant at the end of the event on the other hand relative humidity experienced some fluctuations during the first part of the event with values between 88 and 98 but remained constant at 100 in the last part this event followed a v shaped isotopic trend δ 18 o had an initial value of 7 8 followed by a slight decrease to 10 5 once the storm subsided δ 18 o increased to a value higher than the initial one 7 2 d excess decreased steadily from 16 6 to a final value of 2 6 fig 8b in this event three significant instants were chosen to follow the d excess decreasing trend one at the start of the event a second one around the middle of the event when an increase was observed and a third and last one at the end of the event when d excess reached its minimum value the resultant backward trajectories in these three instants showed a dominance of the mediterranean origin combined with moisture from the atlantic region there was a clear dominance of the north west of the iberian peninsula as a moisture source area fig 8c e however the quantitative attribution of moisture sources shows a dominance of the western mediterranean area table 4 4 discussion 4 1 stable isotope composition and local meteorological variables weekly isotopic values of rainfall sampled in the vallcebre research catchments showed that the classification of precipitation as either enriched or depleted was not straightforward the western mediterranean region is under the influence of the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean the two sources have different isotopic content enriched values for the mediterranean and depleted for the atlantic region celle jeanton et al 2001 the mean value of 7 2 for δ 18 o observed in vallcebre was consistent with this mixed influence celle jeanton et al 2001 also obtained for barcelona a mean δ 18 o value of 5 5 for the period from 1985 to 1991 a possible explanation for the difference between these two isotopic values is the influence of altitude effect dansgaard 1964 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 this factor considering the altitude difference between barcelona and the vallcebre research catchments 0 m asl and 1200 m asl respectively probably explains the lighter precipitation found in the latter in addition comparing δ 18 o values for barcelona and vallcebre research catchments results in a δ 18 o depletion of 0 2 100 m which is consistent with gat 2010 another factor of differentiation between barcelona and vallcebre is temperature at the sampling site relationships between surface air temperature at the sampling site and δ 18 o have been widely studied e g dansgaard 1964 araguás araguás and diaz teijeiro 2005 yu et al 2016 all these studies showed an enrichment of heavy isotopes in precipitation as temperature increased temperature therefore also explains the more depleted values observed in vallcebre than at the barcelona station as mean annual temperature is much lower in vallcebre for vallcebre a weak to moderate correlation with a r2 of 0 44 between δ 18 o and temperature was found this relationship showed a slope of 0 4 c and an intercept of 10 8 it was nearly the same relationship as the one obtained by araguás araguás and diaz teijeiro 2005 for the madrid retiro station however in this latter study the r2 value was much higher 0 9 because the relationship was drawn from monthly data instead of weekly data dansgaard 1964 pointed out that the variations experienced by individual precipitation compositions are smoothed when average compositions are compared over a sufficiently long period of time the influence of rainfall amount on the isotopic composition of precipitation was tested however no correlation was found suggesting that at vallcebre temperature played a more significant role than rainfall amount in the heavy isotope content of precipitation weekly samples were also used to retrieve a lmwl the one obtained in this study eq 3 corroborates the one calculated by celle 2000 for the western mediterranean wmmwl 4 δ d 8 δ 18 o 13 7 d excess values confirm the singularity of the western mediterranean region celle jeanton et al 2001 compared to 22 gat and carmi 1970 for the eastern mediterranean and 10 of the gmwl characteristic of atlantic sources the difference in d excess between eq 3 and eq 4 may be explained by the atlantic moisture sources affecting the vallcebre research catchments more however the d excess value obtained in this study falls within the range of d excess values measured by huyghe et al 2018 for the southern pyrenees 7 14 4 2 selected rainfall events of the 15 rainfall events selected 3 of them representing the three main types of intra event isotopic trends were analysed in depth in this study most of the 15 events had a v shaped isotopic trend table 2 although not all of them had a totally clear trend some of the events had first a depletion in heavy isotopes then a constant trend until enrichment occurred fig 8b shows a clear example of a trend with final enrichment in this case reaching a similar value to the initial value however not all enrichments were so clear some of them indeed showed much lower enrichment but were still considered v shaped as celle jeanton et al 2001 also found half of the events fell above the lmwl fig 5 which may be related to reduced subcloud evaporation effects on heavy rainfall events and condensation occurring at a lower temperature resulting in higher d excess values guan et al 2013 the v shaped trends identified in this study were usually associated with convective or shower type precipitation as in celle jeanton et al 2004 the l shaped isotopic trend which involves steady depletion of heavy isotopes was usually associated with the passage of a cold front gedzelman and lawrence 1990 celle jeanton et al 2004 as found for the two events of that type observed in this study table 2 finally the only event with a constant isotopic trend corresponded to convective precipitation as also observed by celle jeanton et al 2004 4 3 intra event scale variations of three characteristic events 4 3 1 event 2 constant trend miyake 1968 argued that the constant trend was caused by precipitation forming at an unvarying height this explanation may not fit with the type of precipitation found in this study for event 2 fig 6a as this was convective in convective events the height where precipitation forms may vary much more than in stratiform precipitation events celle jeanton et al 2004 however suggested that the constant trend may be due to the steady state condensation rain out process attained by convection this explanation is more consistent with the characteristics found for event 2 although rain rates in this event were relatively high the isotopic signature of precipitation was not affected by the amount effect since more depleted values would be expected in the present case the enriched mean of 5 7 of δ 18 o may be explained by the slope of 4 3 obtained from individual samples fig 5 indicating evaporation effects with kinetic fractionation dansgaard 1964 in addition relative humidity values showed unsaturated air conditions these effects tend to enrich precipitation in heavy isotopes regarding d excess variability although there were changes in the moisture sources reflected by the increase of the european source table 4 the small difference between the two selected instants to calculate backward trajectories suggests that d excess trend was governed mostly by sub cloud processes in this case re evaporation yields a decrease of d excess julian et al 1992 risi et al 2010 which would explain the d excess decreasing trend at the end of the event from an event point of view moisture sources showing high influence of the western mediterranean and europe areas were in accordance with the high d excess values found 4 3 2 event 9 l shaped trend in the l shaped isotopic trend of event 9 δ 18 o decreased steadily from a temporal point of view fig 7a and following the lmwl in the δ 18 o vs δ d plane fig 5 the latter suggests that isotopic variations may mostly be associated to equilibrium fractionation alone rather than kinetic fractionation in this case an assumption of vapor liquid equilibrium during rainout occurring at progressively lower temperatures gat 1996 fits with the δ 18 o evolution and air temperature decrease fig 7a and b in addition the evolution of an isotopic trend can be related among others to rainfall intensity conditions below the cloud or the weather system risi et al 2010 aemisegger et al 2015 muller et al 2015 in the present case the decreasing trend of δ 18 o could be explained by the associated passage of a cold front as the cold front approaches the sampling site the local height where the precipitation is formed tends to increase resulting in the precipitation containing fewer heavy isotopes as discussed by gedzelman and lawrence 1990 during event 9 the peak of precipitation and its most depleted value were consistent with the passage of the cold front fig 7a and b the initial enriched values of δ 18 o may be due to evaporative effects that occurred when the sub cloud layer was not saturated ehhalt et al 1963 as indicated by the relative humidity values fig 7a at the end of the event a constant trend was reached which is usual after a decreasing trend of heavy isotopes muller et al 2015 in this case the character of the precipitation at the last stages of the event fig 7a was consistent with the suggestion made by miyake 1968 the d excess followed a trend similar to δ 18 o however the first and the middle part of the event followed a nearly constant trend in agreement with the aforementioned rainout conditions gat 1996 in this period of the event d excess fluctuated from 11 0 to 12 8 which could be attributed at some extent to the increasing influence of the western mediterranean moisture source in the middle of the event yielding a higher d excess in comparison to the start of it when the western mediterranean contribution was barely residual in front of atlantic source in the last part of the event however the d excess decrease could be explained due to a sub cloud process evaporation is unlikely due to high relative humidity values fig 7a then moisture exchange in residual rainwater guan et al 2013 which is in accordance with the precipitation type found in the last stages of the event offers a possible explanation for the d excess final trend overall if the event is taken as a whole regarding moisture sources the mean d excess value of 11 0 is in agreement with the atlantic predominant moisture source with some western mediterranean influence 4 3 3 event 15 v shaped trend v shaped isotopic trends usually appear in convective events muller et al 2015 risi et al 2010 which was the case of event 15 the initial enriched values of δ 18 o may result from the raindrops production in low altitude clouds affected by evaporation during their path to the surface muller et al 2015 and by the weak character of precipitation which made raindrops more susceptible to evaporation risi et al 2010 in the present case both explanations fit with the unsaturated air at the surface and the low rain rates during the initial stages of the event fig 8a however when the bulk of the precipitation happened an abrupt depletion in heavy isotopes occurred fig 8a and b this corresponded with the increased height of rain formation a similar process as for event 9 however in this case convection was responsible for increasing the altitude of rain formation indeed when convection cells reach their top height more depleted values of δ 18 o are expected muller et al 2015 in event 15 the minimum δ 18 o value coincided with the maximum rainfall intensity which is consistent with muller et al 2015 in addition although without air saturated conditions fig 8a evaporative effects were neglected by the rain intensity diminishing the interaction with ambient air gat 1996 therefore an amount effect was apparent with more depleted values as rainfall intensity increased furthermore a sharp decrease of air temperature also coincides with the δ 18 o depletion fig 8a and b the end of the event was characterized by an enrichment in heavy isotopes which is usually related to evaporative conditions however relative humidity values showed saturated air conditions which would limit evaporation in this case the final increasing trend could be related to residual precipitation formed at lower elevation celle jeanton et al 2004 or diffusive exchange between falling drops and water vapour near the ground risi et al 2010 regarding d excess evolution it followed a steadily decrease trend moisture sources were similar for the different selected starting points because of their small time separation thus d excess changes were mainly governed by sub cloud processes however moisture sources for the whole event were in agreement with the mean d excess value of 12 0 resulting from a combination of western mediterranean and atlantic sources fig 8c e and tables 3 and 4 overall final low d excess values may be due to diffusive exchange between raindrops and the surrounding vapor risi et al 2010 which is very efficient at high relative humidity 4 4 moisture source attribution for the selected events in addition to events 2 9 and 15 the moisture sources were calculated for the rest of the selected events table 2 as celle jeanton et al 2001 pointed out d excess values of 14 are characteristic of the western mediterranean area which ranges from 10 atlantic to 22 eastern mediterranean table 3 summarizes the contribution of different moisture sources and shows that most of the d excess values of the events with predominance of wm contributions range from 14 to 22 which may demonstrate the influence of moisture sources on d excess values however when analysing these results it is important to take into account the limitations of the attribution methodology used in this study as specified by sodemann et al 2008 in particular the omission of the effects of convection turbulence rainwater evaporation or evaporation occurring over land in addition sub cloud processes may play an important role in d excess variability as well as moisture source changes the total attributed moisture fraction 56 was lower than those reported in other studies such as 66 for greenland sodemann et al 2008 68 for israel pfahl and wernli 2008 and 85 91 for the nw mediterranean region winschall et al 2014 the lower values found in this study may be due to the differences or simplifications applied in the moisture attribution method proposed by sodemann et al 2008 the main differences were the following first the way the atmosphere was vertically differentiated in this study was less precise because height levels were used rather than pressure levels second noise areas with moisture uptakes below a small threshold were those with uptakes lower than 0 1 g kg 1 whereas in the other studies uptakes lower than 0 2 g kg 1 were considered as noise this latter simplification may explain the difference between the unknown moisture fraction 3 7 in this study and the 14 obtained by sodemann et al 2008 of the 56 of the moisture fraction that could be attributed nearly 58 of it corresponded to a western mediterranean source followed by the atlantic ocean with 25 these percentages were consistent with the mean isotopic values in table 1 confirming the influence of both sources to give δ 18 o a mean value of 7 2 in addition the d excess value of 13 2 confirmed the higher influence of the western mediterranean sources at least for the 15 events analysed in fig 10 the overall results from the backward trajectory calculations and moisture attributions showed that in only two days the unknown fraction of the moisture present above vallcebre was reduced by half however to overcome 50 of the attributed fraction five days back in time were needed in the hysplit interface used it was not possible to stop a backward trajectory when a specific humidity of 0 g kg 1 was reached or at a value that we considered dry enough for this reason a fixed 10 day backward time was employed similar to pfahl and wernli 2008 and winschall et al 2014 pfahl and wernli 2008 related d excess to the mean moisture source 2 meter relative humidity rh2m obtaining close correlation the correlation was tested with a different number of trajectories depending on their attributed fraction percentage 60 40 and 20 all of them showed nearly the same correlation this result may be useful in selecting the backward time considered for trajectory calculations in order to get a first approach and to test whether a correlation between rh2m and d excess exists this means that taking into account the results observed in fig 10 between two and three days back in time would be enough to establish or test a correlation between moisture source mean relative humidity and d excess fig 10 shows that a 10 day backward trajectory lasted long enough to know practically the entire origin of the moisture above vallcebre which is the sum of the moisture contributions tagged above and attributed the slope for the last hours of the backward trajectory calculations and its steady decrease over time suggested that at least two more days back in time would be needed to reduce the unknown fraction to zero 5 conclusions the following conclusions emerge from the results obtained in this study the isotopic signatures of meteoric waters in vallcebre are influenced by the western mediterranean and atlantic ocean this results in δ 18 o and δ d mean values that are neither systematically enriched nor depleted for the events selected the western mediterranean is the major contributor to the moisture above vallcebre 58 followed by the atlantic ocean 25 and the african region 14 a moderate but significant correlation suggests that temperature does have an effect on the isotopic signature whereas no correlation was found for the amount effect most of the events selected had a v shaped isotopic trend followed by those with l shaped and constant trends respectively the latter could be found in some events in the middle part of the v shaped trend or during the final stages of an l shaped isotopic trend isotopic variability at intra event time scale was mostly governed by sub cloud processes air temperature and relative humidity near the ground and the type of weather system moisture sources and their changes however were not sufficient to explain completely intra event variabilities but were generally in accordance with event mean d excess values the 10 day limit for the backward trajectory calculations is enough to classify nearly 96 of the moisture present above vallcebre research catchments despite the relatively small number of events selected and the simplifications used in the source region attribution method moisture origin attribution achieved 56 further studies using this methodology with a larger number of events could provide a more comprehensive analysis of isotopic variability in precipitation at the event scale in

the mediterranean experiment hymex the authors would also like to acknowledge the helpful and constructive suggestions and comments from three anonymous reviewers that have improved this study appendix a sensitivity analysis of δ q t a sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to evaluate the changes experienced by the moisture sources with different threshold values as in wang et al 2017 a specific humidity range from 0 1 g kg 1 to 0 4 g kg 1 using a 0 1 g kg 1 step was considered the results obtained show a reduction of moisture sources identification as the threshold increased table a 1 which is in accordance with sodemann et al 2008 in addition table a 1 includes the percentages of moisture that could be identified for the most important moisture source regions fig 2 it shows a progressive increase of moisture contribution for the western mediterranean area a decrease for the atlantic basin and a fluctuation for the african source region total moisture attribution differences due to considering 0 1 g kg 1 instead of 0 2 g kg 1 are below 8 which is negligible for the purpose of this study furthermore as uptakes in sodemann et al 2008 were at 6 h time resolution and in this study they were reduced to 1 h hysplit s output specific humidity value changes δ q t dependence on time resolution was also analysed the goal of this analysis was to determine the occurrence and subsequent contribution of 0 1 g kg 1 δ q t values at both indicated time resolutions compared to all possible moisture uptakes from all the trajectories calculated either considered valid or not section 2 5 all potential uptakes positive δ q t values were analysed the results obtained show that for 1 h time resolution uptake occurrences of 0 1 g kg 1 represented 49 of the potential uptakes whereas in case of 6 h this percentage was reduced to 17 in terms of total potential moisture uptakes 1 h resolution δ q t of 0 1 g kg 1 represented 19 and it only represented 2 for 6 h time resolution for all the above reasons a δ q t value of 0 1 g kg 1 was considered suitable 
6377,this study investigates moisture origin characteristics and intra event scale variability of the isotopic signature of rainfall in a mediterranean mountain area based on data from the vallcebre research catchments ne spain weekly data and samples were used to analyse the general dynamics of the isotopic composition of precipitation and its relationship with meteorological variables at the sampling site then based on the data and samples available at the intra event scale the variability of the isotopic signature during rainfall events was characterised and an explanation of what caused the observed variability was attempted results at the weekly time scale show that the maximum relative deviation of the heavy isotopic content with respect to standard mean ocean water δ 18 o of the precipitation signature occurred during summer months and in contrast the minimum during winter months the intra annual trend of rainfall δ 18 o roughly followed the mean monthly air temperature using intra event information three main types of δ 18 o isotopic trends were found during rainfall events most of the events had a v shaped isotopic trend followed by l shaped and constant trend events changes in moisture sources diagnosed using a lagrangian approach and a previously existing contribution algorithm were one of the causes of the isotopic variability and changes at the intra event scale but these may also have been influenced by sub cloud processes that modified the isotopic signature moisture sources for analysed events showed the main influence of the mediterranean area but also an important influence of the atlantic basin keywords precipitation stable isotopes backward trajectories moisture source regions intra event scale analysis mediterranean area 1 introduction the stable isotopes of water oxygen 18 and deuterium play an important role in the study of the global hydrologic cycle gat 1996 natural waters mainly the oceans have a relatively uniform isotopic composition dansgaard 1964 legrande and schmidt 2006 whereas meteoric waters are not in partitioning equilibrium the reason is isotopic fractionation which can be differentiated into two types equilibrium and non equilibrium fractionations the former implies that the ratios of different isotopes in each compound are constant for a particular temperature kendall and mcdonnell 1998 an example would be the condensation of water vapour to form rain clouds where the molecules with heavier isotopes condense more easily than those with light isotopes in this case the liquid phase of water is enriched with heavy isotopes whereas light isotopes are left in the vapour phase the non equilibrium fractionations also known as kinetic fractionations rely on the ratios of the masses of the isotopes and their vibrational energies craig 1961 bonds of molecules with light isotopes are easily broken and react faster than molecules with heavy isotopes an example of kinetic fractionation is raindrops evaporation which implies the isotopic exchange between precipitation and the surrounding moisture in the sub cloud layer during its path to the surface dansgaard 1964 isotopic composition of precipitation varies greatly and depends on many factors among which are the origin of the air masses the rain out history evaporation and condensation conditions when the precipitation forms and atmospheric transport dansgaard 1964 gat and gonfiantini 1981 rozanski et al 1992 dansgaard 1964 also found a seasonal variation and latitude altitude and continental effects on isotopic composition of precipitation which are related to rain out history and temperature finally several studies e g dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1992 araguás araguás et al 2000 yu et al 2016 ren et al 2017 show a relationship between stable isotopes and local meteorological variables such as air temperature relative humidity or rainfall amount the variability of the isotopic composition of precipitation is not only present in the source area or during atmospheric transport but also at the intra event scale this has led to the study of single rain events in order to analyse the variations in the isotopic content of precipitation and relate these to atmospheric processes rindsberger et al 1990 good et al 2014 three main isotopic trends have been identified in different rainfall events l shaped v shaped and constant trends e g miyake 1968 celle jeanton et al 2001 celle jeanton et al 2004 muller et al 2015 the trend of the isotopic composition of precipitation at the event scale depends on rainfall intensity the altitude where rain forms whether it is convective or stratiform rain and if it is caused by a cold or warm front among other considerations apart from the analysis of isotopic trends the origin of air masses and the identification of moisture sources have also been the subjects of many studies celle jeanton et al 2001 found that precipitation from mediterranean sources was more enriched in heavy isotopes than that from atlantic sources liotta et al 2008 related the isotopic composition of rainfall events in sicily to evaporation from the different areas of the mediterranean sea around the island many other studies used a trajectory analysis to determine the moisture sources guan et al 2013 used the hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model model to analyse deuterium excess d excess variations in relation with atmospheric sources in australia tyler et al 2016 worked with the hysplit model to study moisture sources at daily time scale in the british isles guo et al 2017 also used the aforementioned model to derive the moisture transport path of individual events on the tibetan plateau lekshmy et al 2018 analysed the moisture source during monsoon in india pfahl and wernli 2008 winschall et al 2014 and krklec et al 2018 used a moisture diagnostic algorithm proposed by sodemann et al 2008 to determine quantitatively rather than only qualitatively the moisture sources in the eastern mediterranean the north western mediterranean and central europe respectively in addition pfahl and wernli 2008 used a lagrangian approach to relate the isotopic composition of water vapour to evaporative conditions rhsst of the moisture sources this information opened up the possibility of inferring whether intra event variability is related to a change in the moisture source or to other meteorological processes the quantitative approach followed by pfahl and wernli 2008 established a relationship between the moisture source s meteorological variables which include sea surface temperature and two meter relative humidity and d excess the relevance of using d excess is that it is a parameter correlated with the physical conditions of the moisture sources froehlich et al 2002 guan et al 2013 pfahl and sodemann 2014 for instance high deuterium excess values indicate low relative humidity at the moisture sources consequently a change in d excess value may be related to a change in the moisture source hence the isotope signature of precipitation at a specific measurement site represents the total imprint of all equilibrium and non equilibrium fractionation processes that occurred during its transport in the last 30 years the vallcebre research catchments have concentrated on many studies concerned with understanding the hydrological functioning of mediterranean mountain catchments llorens et al 2018 in some recent studies that used stable isotopes of water some significant variability in isotopic composition of precipitation at the event scale was observed this variability has been taken into account in the study of hydrological processes using stable isotopes cayuela et al 2018 but the dynamics and the reasons for this variability remain unclear this study focuses on what is happening before the precipitation reaches the ground and in particular addresses the question of which are the factors behind the variability in isotopic composition in precipitation events for this purpose the isotopic composition of precipitation sampled in the vallcebre research catchments was analysed to obtain a local meteoric water line and to test the relationship of δ 18 o with local air temperature and rain amount then based on intra event scale data the different trends followed by the isotopic composition of precipitation were analysed different processes may determine the isotopic variability and its values such as rainfall intensity conditions below the cloud altitude at which rain is produced the weather system involved and changes in air masses muller et al 2015 altogether were analysed to establish its importance in governing intra event isotopic variability and mean isotopic event values to account for changes in air masses a backward trajectory analysis based on the methodology proposed by sodemann et al 2008 was done with the hysplit model to quantify the origin of moisture this approach enabled us to document the moisture source of selected events and relate it to their d excess values so providing a deeper understanding of possible processes influencing isotopic variability of precipitation 2 methodology 2 1 study site the vallcebre research catchments are located at the headwaters of the llobregat river on the southern margin of the pyrenees ne spain 42 12 n 1 49 e with altitudes between 1100 and 1700 m above sea level a s l gallart et al 2005 there are different sub catchments cal parisa 0 32 km2 and cal rodó 4 17 km2 which in turn has two sub catchments can vila 0 56 km2 and ca l isard 1 32 km2 this area has been used since 1989 for the study and modelling of hydrological processes with the aim of providing new information to evaluate the effects of global change on water resources in mediterranean catchments latron et al 2014 a complete overview of the results obtained in the vallcebre research catchments can be found in llorens et al 2018 the site climate is defined as mediterranean humid with a mean annual temperature of 9 1 c at 1260 m a s l it has a mean of 90 rainy days per year with a mean annual rainfall of 880 200 mm llorens et al 2018 2 2 data acquisition and analyses the rainfall isotopic data used in this study were sampled in two periods between 2011 and 2016 the first from may 2011 to july 2013 and the second from may 2015 to december 2016 this information was complemented with rainfall and meteorological data measured at an automatic meteorological station located in the upper part of the can vila sub catchment rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge located 1 m above the ground casellas cell uk and air temperature and relative humidity with respective probes vaisala finland all data were measured every 10 s and recorded at 5 min intervals by a datalogger dt500 datataker australia two types of rainwater samplers located next to the rain gauge were used one was a bulk rainfall sampler consisting of a plastic funnel 130 mm diameter connected to a polyethylene plastic bottle by looped tubing the plastic bottle had 1 l capacity and was buried in the ground to prevent heating and evaporation the other sampling device was a plastic funnel 340 mm diameter connected to an automatic water sampler 24 polyethylene 500 ml bottles isco 3700c buried in the ground which allowed for automatic sampling at 5 mm rainfall intervals using this sampling device for 21 of the samples corresponding to intense rainfall i e rainfall intensity higher than 5 mm in 5 min a volume greater than 5 mm of rain may have been collected in a single isco bottle during the sampling periods all samples were collected once a week kept cold to avoid evaporation and sent to the laboratory rainfall samples were analysed for the relative deviation δ of the heavy isotopic content from a standard δ 18 o and δ d with a picarro l2120 i δ d δ 18 o isotopic water analyzer cavity ring down spectroscopy by the scientific technical services of lleida university lleida spain results were expressed as parts per thousand and calibrated to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow craig 1961 precision was 0 05 and 0 3 for δ 18 o and δ d respectively 2 3 general and local meteoric water lines the covariance between δ 18 o and δ d can be described by the relationship defined by craig 1961 and known as the global meteoric water line gmwl 1 δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 the intercept of 10 in eq 1 reflects that meteoric and oceanic waters are not in partitioning equilibrium this value is defined as deuterium excess d excess cancelling the covariation of deuterium and 18o and resulting in a parameter less variable than both isotopes dansgaard 1964 although the gmwl is a useful baseline for comparing stable isotopic data it may not reflect the characteristics or ratios of a local region for this reason a local meteoric water line lmwl with its own slope and intercept is often developed to represent local meteoric conditions that may differ from those described in the gmwl kendall and mcdonnell 1998 2 4 rainfall events characterization two parameters to characterize rainfall events were considered type of precipitation and isotopic trend the first one takes into account the synoptic meteorological situation which was derived from analysis synoptic charts met office 2006 to determine whether precipitation was due to a cold cf or warm front wf a low pressure system l or if it was a non frontal convective shower s the second one is based on a visual classification of the temporal evolution of the isotopic signature into one of the three commonly identified trends e g miyake 1968 celle jeanton et al 2001 celle jeanton et al 2004 l shaped constant and v shaped trend fig 1 a c respectively the l shaped trend describes a steadily decrease of δ followed by a stationary trend if the latter was followed by an increase of δ then the event would be labelled as v shaped finally if the isotopic signature remained mostly constant it would be labelled as constant trend for example if the δ 18 o evolution of an event followed first a depletion then a constant trend and finally an enrichment the trend event would be labelled as v shaped 2 5 moisture source identification and attribution in this study the identification and attribution of moisture sources was based on the quantitative lagrangian moisture source diagnosis proposed by sodemann et al 2008 and applied in several other studies sodemann et al 2008 sodemann and zubler 2010 pfahl and wernli 2008 winschall et al 2014 krklec et al 2018 this methodology was based on the changes in specific humidity of an air parcel during its trajectory from a particular location to the study area two assumptions were made i the integrity of the air parcels over several days and ii every change in specific humidity was related to evaporation or precipitation sodemann et al 2008 to calculate the backward trajectories of each selected rainfall event the hysplit model was used draxler and rolph 2003 stein et al 2015 one degree meteorological gdas global data assimilation system data were selected although a half degree gdas dataset was also available and provided a finer spatial resolution it lacked the vertical velocity that needed to be calculated from horizontal divergence su et al 2015 found that backward trajectories calculated with half degree gdas datasets generate greater uncertainties than those with one degree gdas data thus the coarser resolution gdas dataset was selected and downloaded from the portal available at the hysplit interface gdas is used by the national center for environmental predictions ncep global forecast system gfs model to place observations into a gridded model space with a 3 h temporal resolution it is used by hysplit which finally delivers interpolated trajectory information with hourly resolution the calculation process followed these three steps 1 definition of the starting location of the backward trajectories calculation in this study the vallcebre research catchments 42 12 n 1 49 e 2 the height levels required by the hysplit model were computed from selected pressure levels from 850 hpa to 450 hpa in steps of 50 hpa which were transformed to altitude using the barometric equation and assuming a standard international civil aviation organization icao atmosphere 3 a 10 day backward trajectory was calculated for each level and selected event calculations provided hourly coordinates of the air parcel and hourly meteorological data relevant to this study mixed layer depth relative humidity and specific humidity the vallcebre catchments were considered the end of the trajectory and the start was the location where the air parcel reached a specific humidity q of 0 g kg 1 or if this value was not reached the location where the trajectory was 240 h before the event once all the trajectories were calculated only those that had a decrease of q and a relative humidity higher than 80 at the end of the trajectory were selected this methodology is approximate due to several moisture transport processes that are ignored as sodemann et al 2008 pointed out the variation of specific humidity δ q was also retrieved by the algorithm proposed by sodemann et al 2008 2 δ q t q x t q x t 1 h where x t indicates the position of the air parcel at time t if δ q t 0 1 g kg 1 then there was an uptake of moisture this uptake was classified regarding the altitude of the air parcel in respect to mixed layer height in the present study following sodemann et al 2008 mixed layer height was multiplied by 1 5 henceforward mixed layer height times 1 5 is simply referred as mixed layer height if this uptake took place below the mixed layer height the location of the air parcel was considered a moisture source and the uptake was flagged as attributed however if the uptake happened above the mixed layer height then it was not possible to be certain that the moisture came from the area below the air parcel and the uptake was flagged as above in case δ q t 0 1 g kg 1 then the decrease was assumed to be caused by precipitation wang et al 2017 reported that moisture sources were sensitive to the δ q t threshold value to decide whether a positive δ q t should be considered or not a moisture uptake in the present study δ q t threshold was set to 0 1 g kg 1 although in sodemann et al 2008 a δ q t threshold of 0 2 g kg 1 was adopted the temporal resolution of uptake identification was 6 h whereas in the present study it was 1 h after a sensitivity analysis of δ q t and accounting for the finer δ q t values found for 1 h resolution in comparison to 6 h resolution the threshold of 0 1 g kg 1 was considered suitable details of this analysis are given in appendix a finally once all moisture sources were identified the relative contribution of each one to the moisture at the end of the trajectory was calculated in addition these contributions were classified in different regional divisions fig 2 including the atlantic atl western mediterranean wm eastern mediterranean em continental europe eur africa afr and polar pol regions sources falling outside these regional divisions were considered as not classified sources 3 results 3 1 rainfall stable isotope composition and lmwl the isotopic content of weekly rainfall samples n 125 collected in the vallcebre research catchments can be found in table 1 the δ d and δ 18 o data varied greatly δ d ranged from 152 2 to 4 4 and δ 18 o from 19 1 to 0 8 this variability was reflected in the relatively high values of standard deviations the minimum value of d excess was negative which is not common a d excess value smaller than 3 is considered anomalous due to possible post precipitation interference harvey and welker 2000 or a local isolated air mass yuan and miyamoto 2008 the scatter plot between δ d and δ 18 o is useful since it describes how the heavy isotope components behave in different ways dansgaard 1964 and how different the measurements from the gmwl are in order to calculate the lmwl for vallcebre isotopic composition of weekly rainfall was used isotopic values δ d and δ 18 o were weighted by the amount of rainfall corresponding to each sample fig 3 the local meteoric water line was calculated by an ordinary least squares fitting method with an r2 adjusted value of 0 96 p 0 01 the equation obtained was 3 δ d 7 9 δ 18 o 12 9 3 2 seasonality of rainfall signature fig 4 shows the intra annual variability of the δ 18 o precipitation signature weekly samples and its relationship with weekly mean air temperature and rainfall amount the maximum δ 18 o was recorded in summer 0 8 the minimum in winter 19 1 the intra annual trend of the δ 18 o precipitation signature roughly follows the mean monthly air temperature trend fig 4a a moderate correlation r2 0 44 p 0 01 was found between air temperature and the δ 18 o precipitation signature at vallcebre fig 4b the correlation suggested a reliable relationship between air temperature and isotopic composition of precipitation which is known as the temperature effect when precipitation was considered fig 4c and d no correlation r2 0 01 p 0 19 was found between rainfall amount and its δ 18 o content in this case the amount effect which implies depleted precipitation in heavy isotopes as rainfall depth increases was not seen the δ d precipitation signature followed the same trend as δ 18 o with a minimum value of 152 2 during winter and a maximum of 4 4 in summer 3 3 intra event dynamics out of all the rainfall events identified in the study period 15 events with at least 4 rainfall samples taken by the sequential rainfall sampler e g corresponding to at least 20 mm of rainfall were selected to evaluate the different isotopic trends and types of precipitation observed table 2 δ 18 o mean values for the selected events ranged from their minimum in april 10 8 to their maximum in july 3 0 d excess values ranged from 10 4 in an event in july to 22 2 in november in terms of rainfall characteristics 8 out of 15 events were classified as non frontal convective most of the selected events 12 out of 15 had a v shaped isotopic trend showing that in the first steps of the rainfall event depletion of heavy isotopes occurred however in the final stages of the event precipitation was enriched by heavy isotopes and isotopic composition recovered to be similar to that at the beginning of the rainfall event only two events followed an l shaped isotopic trend the third isotopic trend type with nearly constant isotopic content was identified once which led to minimum values for the standard deviation of δ 18 o and δ d the embedded graph in fig 5 suggests that half of the 15 events analysed fell above the lmwl showing a d excess higher than 12 9 two groups of events could be identified events with d excess values close to the lmwl and events with values further away from the lmwl although half of the events were above the lmwl this does not mean that all individual samples during a rainfall event showed the same trend to show intra event scale variability intra event scale samples are given fig 5 for three selected events that had different isotopic trends events 2 9 and 15 event 2 corresponded to a constant isotopic trend fig 6 and showed less variability the samples are concentrated in the same zone in fig 5 and aligned with a slope of 4 3 which suggests evaporation of raindrops although the precipitation accumulated for each sample events 9 and 15 in contrast had great variability and corresponded to l shaped and v shaped isotopic trends respectively figs 7b and 8 b both events can be associated with equilibrium fractionation effects as their isotopic variability approximately follows the linear relationship of the lmwl with a slope of 7 6 for event 9 and 7 5 for event 15 fig 5 however event 15 is partly affected by kinetic fractionation since its v shape also arise in the δ 18 o and δ d plane not following then the lmwl as event 9 does fig 5 it can be seen in the last sample of event 15 far from the lmwl and with small precipitation amount 3 4 moisture source attribution two or three representative instants of each event were selected to calculate moisture attribution depending on d excess trend e g three specific instants if the d excess decrease is gradual at the beginning in the middle and at the end of the event or only two if the decrease is sharp although the duration of some of the events was close to the gdas data temporal resolution different trajectory calculations were still considered to discard abrupt changes of moisture sources a total of 324 trajectories were calculated for the 15 selected events 113 of them 34 8 met the conditions described in section 2 5 to allow the computing of the moisture uptake history of the backward trajectories the frequency plot of all the valid trajectories fig 9 a had two features i most of the trajectories came from the west as expected from global atmospheric circulation ii the entry to vallcebre research catchments was concentrated in two sectors namely the gulf of bizkaia and the catalan coastline fig 9a from all 113 trajectories considered a 0 5 x 0 5 grid covering their extent was drawn and the contribution to the final moisture from each cell of the grid was calculated fig 9b results showed that 56 of the moisture present above the vallcebre catchments could be attributed to one of the six moisture source regions described in fig 2 40 of the moisture could not be attributed to any source region because it corresponded to uptakes above the boundary layer finally a remaining moisture amount was categorized as unknown in cases when the air parcel was not completely dry at the start position of the trajectory representing 4 of the moisture from the known moisture sources the regions that contributed most were the western mediterranean 58 the atlantic area 25 and the african region 14 contributions from the other regions were less than 1 each moisture source attribution at the event scale table 3 showed that most of the events with a high d excess were related to a predominance of air masses with a western mediterranean and african origin events 2 3 4 11 15 however this did not hold for events 6 and 7 event 9 whose main contributor for moisture origin was the atlantic area showed a mean d excess of 11 0 which may be related to the combination of wm and atl sources event 10 had a mixture of western mediterranean and atlantic moisture contribution sources with little influence from african and european regions this combination may explain the d excess value of 11 9 in event 1 d excess values varied slightly from 10 0 to 13 0 which was also reflected at intra event scale moisture source attribution table 4 in addition mean d excess value of 11 1 may be related to a mixture of wm and atl source regions 3 5 evaluation of the moisture source attribution method the method used to attribute moisture sources was examined in order to evaluate its performance in the study area as shown in fig 10 a period of two days back in time was enough to identify at least half the moisture present above the vallcebre research catchments the mean increase of the known fraction was 23 per day during the first 72 h of backward simulation 6 day from 72 h to 168 h and only 2 day during the last 72 h however identifying half the moisture present above the vallcebre research catchments was not equivalent to knowing 50 of the moisture sources because the known fraction includes the uptakes tagged as above i e not taken from the source region consequently the known fraction has to be divided into two parts attributed and above the 50 barrier of the attributed fraction was overtaken at day 5 when the remaining unknown fraction had a value of 16 this study also showed that 10 day backward trajectories were not sufficient to acquire full knowledge of the moisture origin above vallcebre still it was consistent with mean water residence time in the atmosphere 9 days 3 6 intra event scale variations of characteristic events three characteristic events with different isotopic trends were analysed more fully these were selected beforehand because of the clarity of their δ 18 o isotopic trend this clarity would show their intra event variability properly fig 5 3 6 1 constant trend event 2 30th july 2011 a cold air intrusion with temperatures between 15 c and 10 c at the 500 hpa level characterized the last two days of july 2011 this relatively low temperature at that height induced an unstable atmosphere favouring storms and precipitation the event started at 12 50 utc and ended at 15 20 utc leaving 35 8 mm of rainfall with a mean intensity of 14 7 mm h the event was classified as non frontal convection despite small fluctuations air temperature and relative humidity presented a decreasing trend although three different peaks were observed fig 6a the isotopic composition of precipitation was nearly constant the initial δ 18 o was 6 3 and experienced a slight enrichment to 5 5 as indicated before this event had the minimum values for the standard deviation of δ 18 o and δ d in accordance with the constant isotopic trend identified the d excess increased from an initial value of 19 4 to 21 1 and then decreased to a final value of 14 4 two different instants of the event were selected to calculate the backward trajectories and the moisture sources one at the beginning of the event and another at the end for this event 73 of the moisture origin could be identified 35 corresponded to the western mediterranean area and 29 to the european region the rest was attributed to the atlantic region table 4 the two selected instants had similar trajectory paths but their contribution differed in the first one the contribution from the western mediterranean region was dominant whereas in the second one the european region was the main contributor fig 6c and d 3 6 2 l shaped trend event 9 19th january 2013 this event lasting five days from 18th to 21st january 2013 was due to a cold front an anomaly in the medium tropospheric level thermal field was observed with temperatures below 25 c at 500 hpa at surface level a deep low pressure system with an associated cold front went from west to east over the iberian peninsula the precipitation started on 19th january at 06 15 utc and lasted more than 15 h until 21 50 utc giving 37 8 mm with a mean intensity of 2 4 mm h fig 7a air temperature followed a steadily decreasing trend from 5 c to 1 c whereas relative humidity was mostly constant at 94 during the event except at the start of it where it momentarily decreased to 83 a maximum δ 18 o of 6 1 was observed at the start of the rainfall event the precipitation s heavy isotope content fell steadily reaching a δ 18 o of 12 9 at the end of the event fig 7b the δ 18 o steady fall behaves similarly as air temperature as will be discussed in section 4 3 during the rainfall event the passage of the cold front coincided with maximum rainfall intensity and the highest depletion in heavy isotopes fig 7a and b d excess started with a value of 10 7 then increased to 13 3 later a similar decrease for δ 18 o led to a d excess of 6 6 at the end of the event these d excess changes were identified and used as starting times for the backward trajectories calculations fig 7b most of the trajectories in the three different instants considered had the same trend coming from the atlantic area and crossing over the iberian peninsula from sw to ne fig 7c e moisture source attribution results showed that 74 of the moisture could be associated with a specific region most of the water vapour was attributed to the atlantic area followed by the western mediterranean table 4 the three selected instants showed clear dominance of the atlantic region as a moisture source area the western mediterranean region showed a growing trend as the event developed whereas the atlantic region showed a decreasing trend even so the atlantic region maintained its dominance table 4 3 6 3 v shaped trend event 15 22nd july 2015 this event lasting four days from 19th to 23rd july 2015 was characterized by afternoon convective showers our study focused on the afternoon of 22nd of july from 17 05 utc to 20 15 utc when 54 6 mm of rainfall were recorded the mean intensity was 17 24 mm h and the event was classified as non frontal convection at surface level the situation was dominated by the azores high pressure system but with the presence of a relative low between the sw of the balearic islands and the iberian peninsula the situation at 500 hpa level was not particularly defined but the temperature was around 10 c which could enhance the instability of the atmosphere the bulk of the precipitation took place between 17 45 utc and 19 05 utc when maximum intensity reached nearly 10 mm in 5 min fig 8a air temperature and relative humidity values followed opposite trends on one hand the former experienced a sharp decrease from 16 5 c to 11 5 c coinciding with the bulk of rainfall and kept relatively constant at the end of the event on the other hand relative humidity experienced some fluctuations during the first part of the event with values between 88 and 98 but remained constant at 100 in the last part this event followed a v shaped isotopic trend δ 18 o had an initial value of 7 8 followed by a slight decrease to 10 5 once the storm subsided δ 18 o increased to a value higher than the initial one 7 2 d excess decreased steadily from 16 6 to a final value of 2 6 fig 8b in this event three significant instants were chosen to follow the d excess decreasing trend one at the start of the event a second one around the middle of the event when an increase was observed and a third and last one at the end of the event when d excess reached its minimum value the resultant backward trajectories in these three instants showed a dominance of the mediterranean origin combined with moisture from the atlantic region there was a clear dominance of the north west of the iberian peninsula as a moisture source area fig 8c e however the quantitative attribution of moisture sources shows a dominance of the western mediterranean area table 4 4 discussion 4 1 stable isotope composition and local meteorological variables weekly isotopic values of rainfall sampled in the vallcebre research catchments showed that the classification of precipitation as either enriched or depleted was not straightforward the western mediterranean region is under the influence of the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean the two sources have different isotopic content enriched values for the mediterranean and depleted for the atlantic region celle jeanton et al 2001 the mean value of 7 2 for δ 18 o observed in vallcebre was consistent with this mixed influence celle jeanton et al 2001 also obtained for barcelona a mean δ 18 o value of 5 5 for the period from 1985 to 1991 a possible explanation for the difference between these two isotopic values is the influence of altitude effect dansgaard 1964 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 this factor considering the altitude difference between barcelona and the vallcebre research catchments 0 m asl and 1200 m asl respectively probably explains the lighter precipitation found in the latter in addition comparing δ 18 o values for barcelona and vallcebre research catchments results in a δ 18 o depletion of 0 2 100 m which is consistent with gat 2010 another factor of differentiation between barcelona and vallcebre is temperature at the sampling site relationships between surface air temperature at the sampling site and δ 18 o have been widely studied e g dansgaard 1964 araguás araguás and diaz teijeiro 2005 yu et al 2016 all these studies showed an enrichment of heavy isotopes in precipitation as temperature increased temperature therefore also explains the more depleted values observed in vallcebre than at the barcelona station as mean annual temperature is much lower in vallcebre for vallcebre a weak to moderate correlation with a r2 of 0 44 between δ 18 o and temperature was found this relationship showed a slope of 0 4 c and an intercept of 10 8 it was nearly the same relationship as the one obtained by araguás araguás and diaz teijeiro 2005 for the madrid retiro station however in this latter study the r2 value was much higher 0 9 because the relationship was drawn from monthly data instead of weekly data dansgaard 1964 pointed out that the variations experienced by individual precipitation compositions are smoothed when average compositions are compared over a sufficiently long period of time the influence of rainfall amount on the isotopic composition of precipitation was tested however no correlation was found suggesting that at vallcebre temperature played a more significant role than rainfall amount in the heavy isotope content of precipitation weekly samples were also used to retrieve a lmwl the one obtained in this study eq 3 corroborates the one calculated by celle 2000 for the western mediterranean wmmwl 4 δ d 8 δ 18 o 13 7 d excess values confirm the singularity of the western mediterranean region celle jeanton et al 2001 compared to 22 gat and carmi 1970 for the eastern mediterranean and 10 of the gmwl characteristic of atlantic sources the difference in d excess between eq 3 and eq 4 may be explained by the atlantic moisture sources affecting the vallcebre research catchments more however the d excess value obtained in this study falls within the range of d excess values measured by huyghe et al 2018 for the southern pyrenees 7 14 4 2 selected rainfall events of the 15 rainfall events selected 3 of them representing the three main types of intra event isotopic trends were analysed in depth in this study most of the 15 events had a v shaped isotopic trend table 2 although not all of them had a totally clear trend some of the events had first a depletion in heavy isotopes then a constant trend until enrichment occurred fig 8b shows a clear example of a trend with final enrichment in this case reaching a similar value to the initial value however not all enrichments were so clear some of them indeed showed much lower enrichment but were still considered v shaped as celle jeanton et al 2001 also found half of the events fell above the lmwl fig 5 which may be related to reduced subcloud evaporation effects on heavy rainfall events and condensation occurring at a lower temperature resulting in higher d excess values guan et al 2013 the v shaped trends identified in this study were usually associated with convective or shower type precipitation as in celle jeanton et al 2004 the l shaped isotopic trend which involves steady depletion of heavy isotopes was usually associated with the passage of a cold front gedzelman and lawrence 1990 celle jeanton et al 2004 as found for the two events of that type observed in this study table 2 finally the only event with a constant isotopic trend corresponded to convective precipitation as also observed by celle jeanton et al 2004 4 3 intra event scale variations of three characteristic events 4 3 1 event 2 constant trend miyake 1968 argued that the constant trend was caused by precipitation forming at an unvarying height this explanation may not fit with the type of precipitation found in this study for event 2 fig 6a as this was convective in convective events the height where precipitation forms may vary much more than in stratiform precipitation events celle jeanton et al 2004 however suggested that the constant trend may be due to the steady state condensation rain out process attained by convection this explanation is more consistent with the characteristics found for event 2 although rain rates in this event were relatively high the isotopic signature of precipitation was not affected by the amount effect since more depleted values would be expected in the present case the enriched mean of 5 7 of δ 18 o may be explained by the slope of 4 3 obtained from individual samples fig 5 indicating evaporation effects with kinetic fractionation dansgaard 1964 in addition relative humidity values showed unsaturated air conditions these effects tend to enrich precipitation in heavy isotopes regarding d excess variability although there were changes in the moisture sources reflected by the increase of the european source table 4 the small difference between the two selected instants to calculate backward trajectories suggests that d excess trend was governed mostly by sub cloud processes in this case re evaporation yields a decrease of d excess julian et al 1992 risi et al 2010 which would explain the d excess decreasing trend at the end of the event from an event point of view moisture sources showing high influence of the western mediterranean and europe areas were in accordance with the high d excess values found 4 3 2 event 9 l shaped trend in the l shaped isotopic trend of event 9 δ 18 o decreased steadily from a temporal point of view fig 7a and following the lmwl in the δ 18 o vs δ d plane fig 5 the latter suggests that isotopic variations may mostly be associated to equilibrium fractionation alone rather than kinetic fractionation in this case an assumption of vapor liquid equilibrium during rainout occurring at progressively lower temperatures gat 1996 fits with the δ 18 o evolution and air temperature decrease fig 7a and b in addition the evolution of an isotopic trend can be related among others to rainfall intensity conditions below the cloud or the weather system risi et al 2010 aemisegger et al 2015 muller et al 2015 in the present case the decreasing trend of δ 18 o could be explained by the associated passage of a cold front as the cold front approaches the sampling site the local height where the precipitation is formed tends to increase resulting in the precipitation containing fewer heavy isotopes as discussed by gedzelman and lawrence 1990 during event 9 the peak of precipitation and its most depleted value were consistent with the passage of the cold front fig 7a and b the initial enriched values of δ 18 o may be due to evaporative effects that occurred when the sub cloud layer was not saturated ehhalt et al 1963 as indicated by the relative humidity values fig 7a at the end of the event a constant trend was reached which is usual after a decreasing trend of heavy isotopes muller et al 2015 in this case the character of the precipitation at the last stages of the event fig 7a was consistent with the suggestion made by miyake 1968 the d excess followed a trend similar to δ 18 o however the first and the middle part of the event followed a nearly constant trend in agreement with the aforementioned rainout conditions gat 1996 in this period of the event d excess fluctuated from 11 0 to 12 8 which could be attributed at some extent to the increasing influence of the western mediterranean moisture source in the middle of the event yielding a higher d excess in comparison to the start of it when the western mediterranean contribution was barely residual in front of atlantic source in the last part of the event however the d excess decrease could be explained due to a sub cloud process evaporation is unlikely due to high relative humidity values fig 7a then moisture exchange in residual rainwater guan et al 2013 which is in accordance with the precipitation type found in the last stages of the event offers a possible explanation for the d excess final trend overall if the event is taken as a whole regarding moisture sources the mean d excess value of 11 0 is in agreement with the atlantic predominant moisture source with some western mediterranean influence 4 3 3 event 15 v shaped trend v shaped isotopic trends usually appear in convective events muller et al 2015 risi et al 2010 which was the case of event 15 the initial enriched values of δ 18 o may result from the raindrops production in low altitude clouds affected by evaporation during their path to the surface muller et al 2015 and by the weak character of precipitation which made raindrops more susceptible to evaporation risi et al 2010 in the present case both explanations fit with the unsaturated air at the surface and the low rain rates during the initial stages of the event fig 8a however when the bulk of the precipitation happened an abrupt depletion in heavy isotopes occurred fig 8a and b this corresponded with the increased height of rain formation a similar process as for event 9 however in this case convection was responsible for increasing the altitude of rain formation indeed when convection cells reach their top height more depleted values of δ 18 o are expected muller et al 2015 in event 15 the minimum δ 18 o value coincided with the maximum rainfall intensity which is consistent with muller et al 2015 in addition although without air saturated conditions fig 8a evaporative effects were neglected by the rain intensity diminishing the interaction with ambient air gat 1996 therefore an amount effect was apparent with more depleted values as rainfall intensity increased furthermore a sharp decrease of air temperature also coincides with the δ 18 o depletion fig 8a and b the end of the event was characterized by an enrichment in heavy isotopes which is usually related to evaporative conditions however relative humidity values showed saturated air conditions which would limit evaporation in this case the final increasing trend could be related to residual precipitation formed at lower elevation celle jeanton et al 2004 or diffusive exchange between falling drops and water vapour near the ground risi et al 2010 regarding d excess evolution it followed a steadily decrease trend moisture sources were similar for the different selected starting points because of their small time separation thus d excess changes were mainly governed by sub cloud processes however moisture sources for the whole event were in agreement with the mean d excess value of 12 0 resulting from a combination of western mediterranean and atlantic sources fig 8c e and tables 3 and 4 overall final low d excess values may be due to diffusive exchange between raindrops and the surrounding vapor risi et al 2010 which is very efficient at high relative humidity 4 4 moisture source attribution for the selected events in addition to events 2 9 and 15 the moisture sources were calculated for the rest of the selected events table 2 as celle jeanton et al 2001 pointed out d excess values of 14 are characteristic of the western mediterranean area which ranges from 10 atlantic to 22 eastern mediterranean table 3 summarizes the contribution of different moisture sources and shows that most of the d excess values of the events with predominance of wm contributions range from 14 to 22 which may demonstrate the influence of moisture sources on d excess values however when analysing these results it is important to take into account the limitations of the attribution methodology used in this study as specified by sodemann et al 2008 in particular the omission of the effects of convection turbulence rainwater evaporation or evaporation occurring over land in addition sub cloud processes may play an important role in d excess variability as well as moisture source changes the total attributed moisture fraction 56 was lower than those reported in other studies such as 66 for greenland sodemann et al 2008 68 for israel pfahl and wernli 2008 and 85 91 for the nw mediterranean region winschall et al 2014 the lower values found in this study may be due to the differences or simplifications applied in the moisture attribution method proposed by sodemann et al 2008 the main differences were the following first the way the atmosphere was vertically differentiated in this study was less precise because height levels were used rather than pressure levels second noise areas with moisture uptakes below a small threshold were those with uptakes lower than 0 1 g kg 1 whereas in the other studies uptakes lower than 0 2 g kg 1 were considered as noise this latter simplification may explain the difference between the unknown moisture fraction 3 7 in this study and the 14 obtained by sodemann et al 2008 of the 56 of the moisture fraction that could be attributed nearly 58 of it corresponded to a western mediterranean source followed by the atlantic ocean with 25 these percentages were consistent with the mean isotopic values in table 1 confirming the influence of both sources to give δ 18 o a mean value of 7 2 in addition the d excess value of 13 2 confirmed the higher influence of the western mediterranean sources at least for the 15 events analysed in fig 10 the overall results from the backward trajectory calculations and moisture attributions showed that in only two days the unknown fraction of the moisture present above vallcebre was reduced by half however to overcome 50 of the attributed fraction five days back in time were needed in the hysplit interface used it was not possible to stop a backward trajectory when a specific humidity of 0 g kg 1 was reached or at a value that we considered dry enough for this reason a fixed 10 day backward time was employed similar to pfahl and wernli 2008 and winschall et al 2014 pfahl and wernli 2008 related d excess to the mean moisture source 2 meter relative humidity rh2m obtaining close correlation the correlation was tested with a different number of trajectories depending on their attributed fraction percentage 60 40 and 20 all of them showed nearly the same correlation this result may be useful in selecting the backward time considered for trajectory calculations in order to get a first approach and to test whether a correlation between rh2m and d excess exists this means that taking into account the results observed in fig 10 between two and three days back in time would be enough to establish or test a correlation between moisture source mean relative humidity and d excess fig 10 shows that a 10 day backward trajectory lasted long enough to know practically the entire origin of the moisture above vallcebre which is the sum of the moisture contributions tagged above and attributed the slope for the last hours of the backward trajectory calculations and its steady decrease over time suggested that at least two more days back in time would be needed to reduce the unknown fraction to zero 5 conclusions the following conclusions emerge from the results obtained in this study the isotopic signatures of meteoric waters in vallcebre are influenced by the western mediterranean and atlantic ocean this results in δ 18 o and δ d mean values that are neither systematically enriched nor depleted for the events selected the western mediterranean is the major contributor to the moisture above vallcebre 58 followed by the atlantic ocean 25 and the african region 14 a moderate but significant correlation suggests that temperature does have an effect on the isotopic signature whereas no correlation was found for the amount effect most of the events selected had a v shaped isotopic trend followed by those with l shaped and constant trends respectively the latter could be found in some events in the middle part of the v shaped trend or during the final stages of an l shaped isotopic trend isotopic variability at intra event time scale was mostly governed by sub cloud processes air temperature and relative humidity near the ground and the type of weather system moisture sources and their changes however were not sufficient to explain completely intra event variabilities but were generally in accordance with event mean d excess values the 10 day limit for the backward trajectory calculations is enough to classify nearly 96 of the moisture present above vallcebre research catchments despite the relatively small number of events selected and the simplifications used in the source region attribution method moisture origin attribution achieved 56 further studies using this methodology with a larger number of events could provide a more comprehensive analysis of isotopic variability in precipitation at the event scale in

al 2017 a specific humidity range from 0 1 g kg 1 to 0 4 g kg 1 using a 0 1 g kg 1 step was considered the results obtained show a reduction of moisture sources identification as the threshold increased table a 1 which is in accordance with sodemann et al 2008 in addition table a 1 includes the percentages of moisture that could be identified for the most important moisture source regions fig 2 it shows a progressive increase of moisture contribution for the western mediterranean area a decrease for the atlantic basin and a fluctuation for the african source region total moisture attribution differences due to considering 0 1 g kg 1 instead of 0 2 g kg 1 are below 8 which is negligible for the purpose of this study furthermore as uptakes in sodemann et al 2008 were at 6 h time resolution and in this study they were reduced to 1 h hysplit s output specific humidity value changes δ q t dependence on time resolution was also analysed the goal of this analysis was to determine the occurrence and subsequent contribution of 0 1 g kg 1 δ q t values at both indicated time resolutions compared to all possible moisture uptakes from all the trajectories calculated either considered valid or not section 2 5 all potential uptakes positive δ q t values were analysed the results obtained show that for 1 h time resolution uptake occurrences of 0 1 g kg 1 represented 49 of the potential uptakes whereas in case of 6 h this percentage was reduced to 17 in terms of total potential moisture uptakes 1 h resolution δ q t of 0 1 g kg 1 represented 19 and it only represented 2 for 6 h time resolution for all the above reasons a δ q t value of 0 1 g kg 1 was considered suitable 
6378,advances in sensor technologies provide the potential for real time monitoring of soil moisture status little work has been conducted to study the spatial and temporal variations of soil water content at the field scale and the interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors in cropped fields during the growing season in this study we assessed the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content 0 0 1 m using seven in situ soil moisture probes and sentinel 1 satellite data over the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons in irrigated fields of the central sands plains wisconsin usa an empirical multiple linear regression model was developed between the soil water content with sentinel 1 backscatter data the model was evaluated with leave one group out cross validation which showed an r2 of 0 60 mean error of 0 00 m3 m 3 root mean square error of 0 02 m3 m 3 and lin s concordance correlation coefficient of 0 75 soil volumetric water content vwc and soil water deficit swd were mapped at 30 m resolution every 6 12 days across one field du field at the wallendal farm using two statistical metrics first metric and last metric and a bootstrapping approach the location specific and time dependent interactions between estimated soil water content and environmental controlling factors across the du field during the cropping season were evaluated and it was found that such interactions were affected by initial soil water content and plant stress status the robustness of the model needs to be improved in the future by collecting more vwc measurements in different soil and crop conditions the method has the potential to provide a baseline soil moisture map and can be coupled with mechanistic models and subsoil vwc measurements for improved irrigation management and water use efficiency under a changing climate keywords remote sensing soil moisture network soil water deficit precision irrigation water use efficiency soil water forecasting 1 introduction knowledge of soil water dynamics is important in agriculture because real time estimation of soil water content at the field scale will improve irrigation effectiveness liang et al 2016 and crop water use efficiency huang et al 2018 it is also important in hydrology climate science and ecology because it couples the water and energy cycles via evapotranspiration robinson et al 2008 seneviratne et al 2010 with the advent of digital agriculture united nations 2017 advances in sensor technologies and the internet of things have emphasized the need for real time monitoring of soil moisture status such soil moisture monitoring networks include usda s natural resources conservation service s soil climate analysis network scan schaefer et al 2007 us climate reference network uscrn bell et al 2013 and other national and international soil moisture networks dorigo et al 2011 quiring et al 2016 although these networks have provided knowledge at regional to continental scales in evaluating satellite based soil moisture products al bitar et al 2012 monitoring drought mozny et al 2012 and estimating deep drainage wyatt et al 2017 they cannot be directly used to understand the variation of soil water content at the field scale the lack of soil moisture estimates at the field scale at high spatial and temporal resolutions is mainly due to two reasons firstly soil water content is heterogeneous in space and dynamics in time with environmental controlling factors e g meteorological forcing topography soil vegetation varying at different scales joshi and mohanty 2010 vereecken et al 2014 however soil moisture networks are often sparse and available at a much coarser spatial scale e g one station per state for uscrn which cannot be used to characterize the heterogeneity of soil water content at the field scale for agricultural application or hydrological and ecological modeling secondly long term soil moisture networks are installed mainly in forest or grassland soils in an effort to minimize human disturbances during data collection dorigo et al 2011 quiring et al 2016 although soil moisture sensors can be used in cropland for research oriented experiments e g liang et al 2016 huang et al 2017a it is cost prohibitive to install and maintain these sensors during the growing seasons and remove them prior to harvesting therefore information is limited about the spatial and temporal variations of soil water content at the field scale as well as the location specific and time dependent interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors particularly over the cropping seasons e g liang et al 2016 scudiero et al 2018 advances in remote sensing and spatial temporal modeling provide a potential solution by coupling data from soil moisture probes with remotely sensed datasets it is possible to use various physical and empirical models to predict soil moisture across large

such as the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 pan et al 2016 more recently active microwave sensors have

researchers have used microwave sensors for estimating soil water content little research has been done to understand the interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors in cropland over the growing seasons because these environmental controlling factors e g rainfall irrigation soil texture vegetation often vary in space and time it is expected that the interactions between soil water content and controlling factors are time dependent zhu and lin 2011 in this study we first present a model that estimates the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content 0 0 1 m depth using in situ soil moisture probes and sentinel 1 data collected over two cropping seasons in irrigated fields of the central sands plains wisconsin usa this region covers over 708 000 ha and is an important crop production area that relies on irrigation the study will test two hypotheses 1 surface 0 0 1 m soil water content can be predicted at the high resolution 30 m in sandy soils using a novel empirical model established using the sentinel 1 data over the cropping seasons and 2 the interactions between soil water content and controlling factors are location specific and time dependent and can be quantified using the estimates of soil water content at the high spatial resolution i e 30 m 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study areas included 6 irrigated fields at the wallendal longitude 89 6748 latitude 43 9054 and coloma farms longitude 89 5955 latitude 44 0156 in central sands plains in wisconsin usa the fields are approximately 25 40 ha in size fig 1 the soils are mostly sandy with sand content larger than 80 yost et al 2019 soils are classified as typic udipsamments and arenic hapludalfs according to usda soil taxonomy the fields at wallendal farms are used for potato soybean and corn production with the rotation of various vegetables and fruits e g kidney bean and pumpkin and forage crops e g alfalfa and cover crops e g hay sudan grass while the fields at coloma farms are mainly cropped with potato and soybeans different crops may be planted within the same field to maximize the water use efficiency based on variations in soil texture for example at the du field of wallendal farms fig 1 kidney bean hay sudan grass and pumpkin were planted over the 2016 cropping season irrigation is applied using center pivot systems with irrigation events scheduled every 2 or 3 days during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 the study sites are irrigated based on adjusted evapotranspiration estimates from the climate data measured at the hancock agricultural research station approximately 12 km northeast of the study site at hancock daily potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 adjusted evapotranspiration is calculated by multiplying the potential evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient based on the crop type and growth stage wisconsin irrigation scheduler 2018 for instance different irrigation rates were applied for different crops using the center pivot irrigator at the du field table 1 2 2 soil moisture probe data the soil moisture probes used were manufactured by aquaspy inc san diego ca usa they are based on the capacitance method one set of soil moisture probes have 12 individual sensors and can measure relative soil water content with a 0 1 m depth increment at 12 depths between 0 and 1 2 m paterson et al 2009 seven sets of moisture probes were installed at six irrigated fields at the wallendal and coloma farms in either 2016 or 2017 one set of soil moisture probes were installed in each of the four fields at the wallendal farm i e du krm lobby east thorson fig 1 at the coloma farm a set of probes were installed in the center of field home and two sets of probes were installed in the two irrigation management zones powell dry and powell wet of field powell the irrigation management zones of the powell field were delineated based on a map of soil apparent electrical conductivity measured by a veris 3100 see section 2 5 for details a universal calibration equation was applied to convert the soil moisture sensor measurements to soil volumetric water content vwc m3 m 3 yost et al 2019 in this study a depth of 0 10 cm was used because it was close to the effective measuring depth of the active microwave sensor paloscia et al 2013 2 3 sentinel 1 data the remote sensing data collected from the recently launched european space agency sentinel 1 was used in the study it is a phase preserving dual polarization synthetic aperture radar sar system the sar transmits a signal at a dual polarization c band frequency in either horizontal or vertical polarization and then receives the backscatter intensity in both horizontal and vertical polarizations as soil vwc increases the dielectric constant of the soil water mixture increases with the change detected by backscatter intensity njoku and kong 1977 dobson et al 1985 sentinel 1 platform is a two satellite constellation and provides land surface backscatter measurements at 10 m 10 m every 6 12 days depending on the number of available satellites that fly over the study area sentinel 1 satellite data were obtained over the cropping seasons across the study fields from 2016 to 2017 using the google earth engine platform gorelick et al 2017 the data used in the study area included the ground range detected scenes collected in the interferometric wide swath mode every 6 12 days each image contained the single band vv single co polarization vertical transmit vertical receive and dual band vv vh dual band cross polarization vertical transmit horizontal receive and the incidence angle of the sensor each scene was pre processed with sentinel 1 toolbox following thermal noise removal radiometric calibration terrain correction using srtm 30 m digital elevation model rabus et al 2003 the final terrain corrected values were converted to decibels via log scaling 10 log10 x and quantized to 16 bits https developers google com earth engine sentinel1 in this study we used the sentinel 1 data at 30 m resolution instead of 10 m because it can eliminate the speckle effects in the sentinel 1 radar data gao et al 2017 the resampling of original 10 m sentinel 1 data to 30 m resolution was carried out using the nearest neighbor algorithm different spatial upscaling crow et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 and downscaling peng et al 2017 methods have been previously used to interpolate soil moisture estimates from soil moisture sensor networks or remote sensing platforms onto the targeted resolutions using other remote sensing platform measurements or geoinformation based information such as topographical soil attribute and vegetation characteristics in terms of mapping soil vwc using sentinel 1 the change detection methods based on the linear relationship between changes in vwc and backscatter data are popular and have been recently applied to obtain global soil vwc retrievals at 500 m resolution bauer marschallinger et al 2018 based on previous studies an empirical modeling approach was used in this study given soil texture is relatively homogenous sandy across the study fields first the temporal statistics of the vv and vh backscatter data were calculated at each pixel over the whole 2016 and 2017 cropping period these include temporal minimum mean maximum range and standard deviation these temporal statistics of the sensor measurements over time are used because they often contain useful information related to the characteristics of the soil and vegetation in the field robinson et al 2012 pierdicca et al 2014 huang et al 2017a pedrera parrilla et al 2017 attarzadeh et al 2018 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 and thus could be included as covariates to predict soil water content 2 4 establishing an empirical soil water content model a multiple linear regression mlr model was used to predict soil vwc at 0 0 10 m using the sentinel vv vh their temporal statistics and the incidence angle of the sensor the incidence angle was used to account for the effect of the relative position of the microwave sensor on the backscatter of the signal as suggested by alexakis et al 2017 due to the strong correlations between several temporal statistics of vv and vh data e g vv vv max we excluded them as input covariates a backward elimination approach was used to select the significant covariates for the regression model at a significance level of 0 05 to evaluate the model uncertainty the 95 upper and lower confidence intervals of the predicted vwc from the mlr model established using all 7 locations were calculated using the jmp software jmp 14 sas given the small number of observation points used for establishing the mlr model i e 58 and the relatively uniform landscape and soil texture across the study area we did not use the non linear models such as artificial neural networks as suggested by other researchers paloscia et al 2013 alexakis et al 2017 gao et al 2017 note that a larger soil vwc sentinel 1 dataset was not available in this study area over two years due to two reasons first the farmers rotated the sensors for different fields every year after harvesting the crops as such soil vwc measurements were not available in one field for both years table 2 second although the repeat cycle for sentinel 1 2 satellites is 6 12 days the cropping season in wisconsin usa is short i e from mid may to early september because different sensors needed to be installed in different fields after planting and removed before harvesting the available soil vwc measurements became fewer during the two years although the sampling size of the vwc sentinel 1 measurements was small i e 58 we used it to predict vwc and to infer the soil moisture variability in the study area whereby the soils were dominated by relatively uniform sandy soils with sand content larger than 80 yost et al 2019 to assess the robustness of the mlr model with selected covariates we used leave one group out cross validation as performed by huang et al 2017b to predict soil water content at one sampling location one set of moisture probes at different times we first used the remaining 6 sampling locations 6 moisture probes to fit the linear regression model with the same covariates as selected above and applied the model onto this sampling location to obtain the predicted vwc we then performed this validation approach 7 times to obtain the predicted vwc at all 7 locations at different times in turn note that 7 mlr models were established in turn to evaluate the model performance via the cross validation approach while the mlr model that used vwc measurements from all 7 locations was used in the next section to predict vwc in the du field and for the following analysis of interactions between soil vwc and environmental factors the coefficient of determination r2 lin s concordance correlation coefficient lin 1989 mean error bias and root mean square error accuracy were calculated based on the measured vwc from soil moisture probes and predicted vwc from the leave one group out cross validation note that lin s concordance correlation coefficient lin 1989 measures the agreement between two variables and is calculated from a sample as ρ c 2 s xy s x 2 s y 2 x y 2 where x and y are the means for the measured and predicted variables and s x 2 and s y 2 are the corresponding variances s xy 1 n i 1 n x i x y i y ρ c has a value between 0 and 1 with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger agreement of measured variables versus predicted variables closer to 1 1 line 2 5 predicting the spatial and temporal variations in vwc across the field the fitted mlr model based on vwc measurements from all the soil moisture probes and selected covariates in section 2 4 were applied onto a 30 m grid across one study field i e field du in the wallendal farm at different times over the 2016 cropping season this field was selected for illustration purpose given that three crops were planted in 2016 the resulting maps of vwc were at 30 m resolutions every 6 12 days information about the environmental controlling factors was also obtained across the du field a digital elevation model was obtained from the us geological surveys usgs 2018 at a 1 3rd arc second 10 m spatial resolution topographic wetness index twi was calculated using saga gis conrad et al 2015 based on the 10 m digital elevation model maps of soil particle size fractions i e clay silt and sand contents bulk density bd and soil organic carbon soc concentration at the depth of 0 0 05 m and 100 m resolution were obtained from ramcharan et al 2018 field capacity fc at 10 kpa and permanent wilting point pwp at 1 500 kpa were estimated based on published pedo transfer functions from the same region using soil clay silt and sand content bd and soc concentration yost and hartemink 2019 1 f

measured soil eca at an effective depth of 0 0 0 30 m low eca values often indicate sandy and drier soils while higher eca values represent clayey and wetter soils corwin and lesch 2003 to quantify the relative amount of soil water that is available to plants we calculated soil water deficit swd across the du field using the following formula berliner and oosterhuis 1987 patanè and cosentino 2010 3 s w d 1 v w c p w p f c p w p 100 where v w c was the soil water content estimated on one day over the 2016 cropping season and f c and p w p were estimated from eqs 1 and 2 2 6 understanding the location specific and time dependent interactions between vwc and environmental controlling factors to quantify the relative contribution of different environmental controlling factors on vwc two statistical metrics were used the first metric determines which covariate i e environmental factor alone is able to explain the response it calculates the univariate coefficient of determination r2 values from the linear regression models of vwc with one covariate only e g soil clay content in other words these univariate r2 values are identical to the squared correlation coefficients of the covariate with the response if covariates are correlated the sum of these individual contributions is often higher than the overall r2 of the model with all covariates together i e the overall model explains less than the sum of all individual models for brevity we call this metric the first metric grömping 2006 the second metric used determines which covariate is able to explain the variance of response in addition to all other covariates that are present we ascribe to each covariate the increase in r2 when including this covariate as the last covariate if covariates are correlated these contributions often add up to far less than the overall r2 of the model with all covariates together we call this metric the last metric grömping 2006 to understand the location specific controls of environmental factors on vwc we calculated the temporal mean and standard deviation sd of the estimated vwc across the du field during the 2016 cropping season we assumed that the long term i e during the entire cropping season temporal mean and sd of vwc at the field scale were mainly affected by the spatial variations in the environmental factors i e crop types soil texture and thus the interactions between vwc and environmental factors were mainly location specific to understand the time dependent effects of environmental controlling factors on vwc changes of vwc over short periods i e between june 9th and 14th and between july 15th and 20th in 2016 at the du field were used dates of june 9th and 14th were selected because no irrigation event occurred during this period and the water input came from rainfall only dates of july 15th and 20th were selected to represent the scenario when both irrigation and rainfall occurred over the period table 1 note that mean vwc on june 9th 0 13 m3 m 3 was smaller than that of july 15th mean vwc of 0 15 m3 m 3 this enabled us to study the initial soil water condition on the interactions between vwc and environmental controlling factors the conditions include an initially dry soil condition june 9th and an initially wet soil condition july 15th we assumed that the short term i e during a few days changes of vwc at the field scale were mainly affected by the temporal variations in the environmental factors e g rainfall irrigation and thus the interactions between vwc and environmental factors were mainly event based and time dependent here the first and last metrics were used to quantify the correlations between vwc and environmental factors in terms of the location specific effects of environmental factors on vwc the model response is the temporal mean or temporal sd of vwc over the 2016 cropping season calculated for each pixel across the du field in terms of the time dependent effects of environmental factors on vwc the model response is the changes of vwc over short periods i e between june 9th and 14th and between july 15th and 20th in 2016 that were calculated for every pixel across the du field at 30 m resolution for both effects the covariates are the different environmental controlling factors including factors varying in space such as soil properties eca clay and sand contents bd soc crop types and topography elevation and twi and factors varying in space and time such as sum of cumulative rainfall and irrigation in terms of space varying factors spatial distributions of soil properties and topography were obtained from various maps described in section 2 5 silt content was not used due to its strong correlation with sand content spatial distributions of crop types were obtained from the farmers fig 1 numeric values of 1 2 and 3 were assigned to the areas of kidney bean hay sudan grass and pumpkin respectively based on their increasing initial evapotranspiration et coefficient determined by the fao 2018 in terms of spatial temporal varying factors cumulative rainfall was measured using a rain gauge on the farm over different time intervals assuming it was uniform across the whole field cumulative irrigation was calculated based on the actual irrigation maps provided by the farmers over different time intervals whereby different irrigation rates were used for different crop types in this study we assumed the average rates of irrigation water applied by the center pivot along the radial direction were proportional to the rates applied for the different crop types fig 1 this led to an average irrigation rate within the same crop type over different periods table 1 because the rainfall was relatively uniform across the field the sum of rainfall and irrigation was used to represent the overall water input as mentioned in section 2 4 only 58 coupled vwc sentinel 1 measurements were available in this study to minimize the effect of the small sample size on the robustness of the mlr model and the following interaction analysis between vwc and environmental factors we adopted a bootstrapping approach we described this in turn as follows 1 randomly sample the 58 coupled vwc sentinel 1 measurements 58 times with replacement this generated a dataset of 58 vwc sentinel 1 measurements with identical measurements 2 fit an mlr model using this bootstrap dataset and the selected covariates in section 2 4 and predict soil vwc across the du field on different days over the 2016 cropping season 3 calculate the temporal mean and sd of the vwc and short term changes of vwc i e june 9th 14th and july 15th 20th across the du field and calculate the first and last metrics 4 repeat steps 1 3 1 000 times and calculate the histograms of the first and last metrics calculation of the first and last metrics was done using the relaimpo package of the r software grömping 2006 and the bootstrapping approach was done using the base sample function in the r software r core team 2019 the relative contributions of different environmental factors to the temporal sd and short term changes of vwc did not change for different bootstrap datasets because the effects of bootstrapping sampling were canceled out when the sd and changes of vwc were calculated therefore only the relative contributions were reported for these scenarios 3 results 3 1 summary temporal statistics of soil water content soil vwc at 0 0 1 m depth measured with a sensor on a daily basis in the du field over the 2016 cropping season is presented in fig 2 vwc ranged from 0 14 m3 m 3 to 0 28 m3 m 3 the pattern of soil vwc is consistent with the irrigation and rainfall events the summary temporal statistics of vwc at all 7 locations in 2016 or 2017 are shown in table 2 in general vwc values are normally distributed during the cropping seasons in 2016 and 2017 the minimum mean median maximum standard deviation and coefficient of variation cv of vwc vary between different locations with the minimum vwc ranging from 0 05 m3 m 3 in coloma powell dry field to 0 14 m3 m 3 in wallendal du field and the maximum vwc ranging from 0 20 m3 m 3 in coloma powell dry field to 0 31 m3 m 3 in wallendal thorson field table 2 it was also noted that in coloma powell field mean vwc values measured by the probe in the dry zone 0 10 m3 m 3 coloma powell dry selected based on a veris eca map were generally smaller than those measured by another probe in the wet zone 0 19 m3 m 3 coloma powell wet selected based on the veris eca map 3 2 model accuracy and precision the summary of the multiple linear regression model is shown in table 3 backscatter data from vh mean and maximum values of vh mean values of vv and incidence angle were selected for predicting vwc at 0 0 1 m soil depth with all the covariates selected the fitted mlr had an r2 value of 0 678 and root mean square error of 0 02 m3 m 3 when applied onto the soil moisture probe over the 2016 growing season the model had a good performance given that the most of the vwc measurements were within 95 upper and lower confidence intervals of the prediction fig 2 the leave one group out cross validation results for the mlr model are presented fig 3 the model had a moderate r2 of 0 60 mean error of 0 00 m3 m 3 and rmse of 0 02 m3 m 3 note that the range of vwc at these sites was only 0 2 m3 m 3 lin s concordance correlation coefficient of the validation result is 0 75 indicating a reasonably good agreement between the measured vwc and predicted vwc lin 1989 it was noted that the mlr model had different performance in different fields due to the variations in soil properties and crop types fig 3 the model performance was different for different fields with varying soil texture ground roughness and crops as shown in fig 3 the model had a highest accuracy in wallendal thorson seed corn r2 0 88 rmse 0 021 followed by wallendal krm soybean r2 0 67 rmse 0 017 wallendal lobby east pumpkin r2 0 35 rmse 0 026 wallendal du kidney bean r2 0 28 rmse 0 021 coloma powell wet potato r2 0 28 rmse 0 024 coloma home potato r2 0 27 rmse 0 031 and coloma powell dry potato r2 0 02 rmse 0 025 3 3 spatial distributions of estimated environmental controlling factors and soil properties the spatial distributions of estimated environmental controlling factors and soil properties are presented for the du field fig 4 the elevation is relatively uniform and it gradually decreases from the southeast corner 313 m towards the north and west 310 m of the field fig 4a the variations of eca fig 4b and clay content fig 4c are small but not negligible across the field whereby soil of high eca greater than5 ms m 1 and clay content 9 11 is located in the northwest and center of the field while soil of low eca 2 3 ms m 1 and clay content 4 6 is found in isolated places and particularly close to the southwest corner of the field the spatial distributions of soc fig 4d fc fig 4e and pwp fig 4f are similar to that of clay content 3 4 spatial and temporal variations of estimated vwc and swd during the cropping season the spatial and temporal variations of estimated vwc using the empirical mlr model at the du field over the 2016 cropping season are presented fig 5 in general vwc values increased from june 9th to 14th due to a rainfall event of 32 8 mm and increased from july 15th to 20th due to a rainfall event of 26 4 mm and three irrigation events with cumulative amount of water of 27 9 mm for kidney bean and hay sudan grass and 20 3 mm for pumpkin table 1 and fig 2 the changes of vwc were different during these two periods across the field the change of vwc from june 9th to 14th was mostly in the north and west of the field while the change of vwc from july 15th to 20th was mostly in the south and east the spatial and temporal variations of estimated soil water deficit swd are also presented during these two periods fig 6 in general the patterns are similar to those of the estimated vwc values and changes of vwc values 4 discussion 4 1 advantages and disadvantages of the empirical mlr model a trade off exists between the accuracy and spatial resolutions of the soil vwc retrieval models well established models based on microwave remote sensing can have good model accuracy e g rmse 0 04 m3 m 3 but the spatial resolutions are often too coarse such as 3 km to 36 km for smap nasa 2019 and 500 m for sentinel 1 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 for field scale agricultural management and hydrological studies the multiple linear regression model is reasonably good in this study this can be attributed to the relatively uniform soil texture sandy soil across the study fields fig 4 compared to other physical e g fung et al 1992 semi empirical e g dubois et al 1995 and empirical e g oh et al 1992 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 vreugdenhil et al 2018 models that relate microwave backscatter measurements to soil vwc this empirical model is relatively easy to build because it does not require the measurement or estimation of other model parameters such as the ground roughness conditions there are a few disadvantages of the empirical mlr model that need to be overcome in the future first the good model performance may decrease when the model is applied to a different study area where the soil conditions e g soil texture ground surface roughness and vegetation types fall outside the range of the calibration datasets table 2 and fig 3 this was indicated in fig 3 whereby the model performance varied with soil conditions and crop types in this study the model performed worst in the potato field coloma powell dry most likely due to the low vwc values the model also performed poorly in the fields cropped with potato most likely due to the limited penetration depth of c band microwave into the soil during the cropping season to overcome this limitation collecting soil vwc data at other soil conditions and vegetation types should be done in the future alternatively as suggested by bauer marschallinger et al 2018 amongst other researchers interfering factors on the model performance include surface roughness tillage plant canopy water content vegetation density and orientation and the interactions are complex and often difficult to mitigate therefore an alternative approach to utilize sentinel 1 data for soil water retrieval is to upscale data to a coarser scale and minimize the effects of these interfering factors bauer marschallinger et al 2018 second the relationship between sentinel 1 backscatter data and soil vwc were often not linear and needs to be corrected for the crop in real time shoshany et al 2000 for example gao et al 2017 synergistically used sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 data for soil moisture mapping at 100 m resolution across a 20 km by 20 km study area in spain to correct the effect of crop cover on soil water dynamics they used the ndvi index calculated from sentinel 2 data as a proxy for detecting the changing crop cover over the cropping season and reduced the rmse of the model from 0 087 with a change detection algorithm using only sentinel 1 data to 0 059 m3 m 3 by including the ndvi index synergetic use of sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 data was also attempted by attarzadeh et al 2018 which generated an rmse value of 0 049 m3 m 3 in our study we did not include optical sentinel 2 or landsat because of the large cloud cover during the two cropping seasons across the study area if the method were to be applied elsewhere data fusion between sentinel 1 and other optical remote sensing measurements e g ndvi from landsat and sentinel 2 may be explored in addition to data fusions non linear models and machine learning algorithms can also be used to improve the model performance possible models include artificial neural network paloscia et al 2013 random forest vreugdenhil et al 2018 support vector regression attarzadeh et al 2018 and bayesian multi temporal algorithm pierdicca et al 2014 however these non linear models often require a large calibration dataset and thus are not applicable in this study third the number of coupled vwc sentinel 1 measurements i e 58 was too small for building a robust mlr model although the mlr model established in this study was relatively accurate it would be difficult to apply it to other areas for predicting soil vwc therefore it is worth collecting more soil vwc measurements in the cropped fields in the future to improve the robustness of the soil vwc retrieval algorithm 4 2 location specific interactions between soil vwc and environmental controlling factors to investigate the location specific relationship between soil vwc and different environmental controlling factors two statistical metrics are calculated using 1 000 bootstrap datasets table 4 in terms of the temporal mean vwc in the 2016 cropping season considering the contribution of each environmental controlling factor independently based on the first metric table 4a rainfall irrigation explained 4 8 of the total variance followed by bd 4 0 eca 3 1 clay content 2 8 soc 1 8 sand content 1 0 elevation 0 2 crop 0 2 and twi 0 1 the relative importance of different environmental controlling factors was slightly different table 4b when considered together in explaining the total variance of mean vwc in 2016 in this case the most important covariate was still rainfall irrigation 4 7 followed by crop 3 8 eca 1 6 clay content 1 4 bd 0 2 sand content 0 1 elevation 0 1 soc 0 1 and twi 0 0 this indicated that temporal mean vwc in this sandy field is mostly controlled by meteorological forcing rainfall and irrigation followed by crop soil properties and topography note that only 13 6 of the total variance was explained by all the environmental controlling factors shown in table 4 this can be due to three seasons first the maps of soil properties were obtained at the 100 m spatial resolution based on a machine learning approach with a large amount of uncertainty ramcharan et al 2018 and the use of a 10 m digital elevation model may not well represent the local topography characteristics at the scale of soil moisture probes 0 5 m2 second other environmental controlling factors may also contribute to the variance of mean vwc such as evapotranspiration deep drainage and runoff which cannot be mapped as such fine spatial and temporal resolutions using the available datasets third the variance of mean and sd of vwc can be due to random errors that cannot be explained by any environmental factors vinnikov et al 1996 the histograms of the percentage contributions of different environmental factors generated using 1 000 bootstrap datasets are shown in fig 7 in general the estimation of relative contributions of different environmental factors was reliable given the narrow 95 percentiles in addition the orders of importance of different environmental factors calculated using the first and second metrics remained the same this suggested that the small sampling size i e 58 did not affect the estimation of relative contributions of different environmental factors to the mean of vwc much and the analysis was robust different patterns were observed for the temporal sd of vwc during the 2016 cropping season unlike the temporal mean vwc all the environmental controlling factors explained 39 5 of the total variance of the sd of vwc this was not unexpected because the sd of vwc is mainly driven by water input from rainfall and irrigation water storage as represented by field capacity and porosity as a function of soil particle size fractions bd and soc and water output as evapotranspiration crop and runoff topography when considering the relative contribution of each individual environmental controlling factor in explaining the sd of vwc in 2016 table 4 a crop was ranked most important 35 4 followed by bd 21 7 rainfall irrigation 21 1 sand content 11 8 elevation 5 1 soc 2 1 clay content 0 4 eca 0 5 and twi 0 0 when considering the relative contribution with all factors considered the crop was ranked most importantly followed by soil properties and topography twi and elevation in this case rainfall irrigation was not significant because it was masked by the strongly correlated crop factor that was used to determine irrigation rates the correlations between soil vwc and various environmental controlling factors are consistent with the previous studies these include meteorological forcing such as rainfall oldak et al 2002 gaur and mohanty 2013 and solar radiation joshi and mohanty 2010 irrigation malash et al 2008 soil properties such as soil texture joshi and mohanty 2010 hydraulic properties shao et al 1997 soil organic carbon yost and hartemink 2019 eca as a representation of different soil properties corwin and lesch 2003 vegetation wang et al 2014 wang and franz 2015 li et al 2018 and topography bonan et al 1993 vanderlinden et al 2012 the difference between this study and other studies is that meteorological forcing such as rainfall and solar radiation is less important in explaining the variations in temporal mean and sd of vwc as compared to other factors because they are relatively uniform at the field scale 4 3 time dependent interactions between soil vwc and environmental controlling factors changes in soil vwc are also time dependent event based fig 5 and fig 6 the relative contribution of environmental controlling factors on changes of soil vwc calculated using 1 000 bootstrap datasets is also presented table 5 in terms of changes of vwc due to rainfall and evapotranspiration only june 9th to 15th 2016 the time dependent controls on soil vwc dynamics are mainly caused by crop 13 5 followed by soil properties such as bd 6 3 sand content 4 7 eca 1 2 clay content 0 7 soc 0 2 and topography 1 2 for twi and 0 3 elevation table 5 a however when the changes of vwc is due to both rainfall and irrigation and evapotranspiration july 15th to 20th 2016 the time dependent controls on soil vwc is mainly due to crop 11 7 irrigation 8 3 soil properties such sand content 5 8 and bd 2 5 and elevation 3 7 the time dependent interactions between soil vwc and environmental factors have also been reported by other researchers first the interactions between soil vwc and environmental factors are controlled by the initial soil vwc for example gardner and ehlig 1962 showed that the water removal from the soil as a function of impedance to water movement was largely in the plant when the soil was wet and largely in the soil when the soil became dry this may explain while the relative contribution of crop to changing vwc was similar at the periods of june 9th 15th relatively dry initial soil condition on june 9th with a mean vwc of 0 13 m3 m 3 and july 15th 20th relatively wet initial soil condition on july 15th with a mean vwc of 0 15 m3 m 3 the relative contribution of soil decreased greatly second the interactions between soil vwc and environmental controlling factors are also controlled by plant stress status for example based on the simulation results teuling and troch 2005 found both soil and vegetation controls can act to either create or destroy spatial variance depending on whether or not the soil dried below the critical moisture content namely the transition between unstressed and stressed transpiration in this study this was confirmed by the time dependent contribution of environmental controlling factors on changing soil vwc and thus soil water deficit swd table 5 note that the percentage contributions for the changes in swd were the same to those of the vwc data not shown because swd was calculated by rescaling vwc based on field capacity and permanent wilting point third a number of researchers have found the temporal stability of soil vwc variations in natural landscapes with variable vegetation and soil types and complicated topography and concluded that these can be used for remote sensing of soil vwc and soil moisture parameterization in climate models vachaud et al 1985 vinnikov et al 1996 mohanty and skaggs 2001 vanderlinden et al 2012 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 in our study we calculated the temporal statistics of the sentinel 1 backscatter measurements based on the available measurements collected in both 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons we also explored the potential to use temporal statistics calculated in 2016 or 2017 only but failed to fit an accurate mlr model the difference between our study and the studies mentioned above is our remote sensing data were collected in the cropland over the growing seasons with different crop rotations for the same field in different years one potential explanation to the good model performance can be that the ground roughness was relatively stable over time and can be separated from the crop canopy dynamics as suggested by bauer marschallinger et al 2018 however future work is required to further investigate this issue in places with dense vegetation it is also worth noting that our study did not reveal the importance of meteorological forcing in explaining soil vwc variations as discovered by others at different scales for example in extremely dry surface soils researchers have found soil vwc is controlled by high potential evaporation which leads to upward vapor movement e g saito et al 2006 du et al 2018 in our study the influence of meteorological forcing was not significant because the soil moisture probes were installed at the field scale and the annual rainfall is larger than the annual evaporation in the study area therefore it is possible to apply this approach to other climate regimes in the future so that the location specific and time dependent interactions between soil vwc and meteorological forcing can be revealed seneviratne et al 2010 wang et al 2017 in addition it is also worth further investigating the interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors under cropping and non cropping seasons and compare them for different vegetation types across a large spatial extent and over a long period as explored by zhu and lin 2011 4 4 implications for soil water conservation and irrigation management under climate change the maps of soil vwc fig 5 and swd fig 6 illustrated the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content over a cropping season these can be used in the future as baseline soil moisture maps for the farmers to schedule irrigation particularly when patterns of precipitation are changing across the globe ipcc 2014 in order to achieve this mechanistic hydrological models need to be used in combination with surface soil vwc retrieved from remote sensing data soil hydrological properties montzka et al 2017 chaney et al 2019 at different depths and subsoil vwc measurements from soil moisture probes as validation for forecasting soil water dynamics at different depths and irrigation scheduling in the real time das and mohanty 2006 huang et al 2017a de lannoy et al 2007 das et al 2008 lievens et al 2017 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 when the spatial information about soil hydrological properties is available e g field capacity permanent wilting point maps of changes in swd can be used to identify areas where irrigation is not necessary occurs low swd values and design maps for variable rate irrigation lo et al 2017 5 conclusion an empirical multiple linear regression model for predicting soil water dynamics at the surface 0 0 1 m in cropped fields was established using sentinel 1 data and soil moisture probes backscatter measurements of sentinel 1 backscatter data were used in combination with temporal statistics e g mean and maximum and incidence angle of the sensor as covariates to predict soil water content in space and time the model was reasonably accurate given the small rmse 0 02 m3 m 3 large r2 0 60 and lin s concordance correlation coefficient of 0 75 from a leave one group out cross validation soil water content was mapped at 30 m resolution every 6 12 days across one study field using two statistical metrics and bootstrapping sampling the results revealed location specific and time dependent interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors including crop soil properties irrigation and topography the time dependent interactions are affected by initial soil water content and plant stress status future work should include more soil moisture probe data in the cropland over the growing seasons and applying non linear modeling algorithms the method has the potential to provide a baseline surface soil moisture map and to be coupled with mechanistic hydrological models for improved irrigation management and water use efficiency under climate change further research is required to study location specific and time dependent interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors across different climate regimes and investigate the issues of time stable scales of variations in soil water content in places where vegetation is changing over time declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments we thank megan wallendal eric wallendal andy wallendal john wallendal wallendal farms and andy and steve diercks

6378,advances in sensor technologies provide the potential for real time monitoring of soil moisture status little work has been conducted to study the spatial and temporal variations of soil water content at the field scale and the interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors in cropped fields during the growing season in this study we assessed the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content 0 0 1 m using seven in situ soil moisture probes and sentinel 1 satellite data over the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons in irrigated fields of the central sands plains wisconsin usa an empirical multiple linear regression model was developed between the soil water content with sentinel 1 backscatter data the model was evaluated with leave one group out cross validation which showed an r2 of 0 60 mean error of 0 00 m3 m 3 root mean square error of 0 02 m3 m 3 and lin s concordance correlation coefficient of 0 75 soil volumetric water content vwc and soil water deficit swd were mapped at 30 m resolution every 6 12 days across one field du field at the wallendal farm using two statistical metrics first metric and last metric and a bootstrapping approach the location specific and time dependent interactions between estimated soil water content and environmental controlling factors across the du field during the cropping season were evaluated and it was found that such interactions were affected by initial soil water content and plant stress status the robustness of the model needs to be improved in the future by collecting more vwc measurements in different soil and crop conditions the method has the potential to provide a baseline soil moisture map and can be coupled with mechanistic models and subsoil vwc measurements for improved irrigation management and water use efficiency under a changing climate keywords remote sensing soil moisture network soil water deficit precision irrigation water use efficiency soil water forecasting 1 introduction knowledge of soil water dynamics is important in agriculture because real time estimation of soil water content at the field scale will improve irrigation effectiveness liang et al 2016 and crop water use efficiency huang et al 2018 it is also important in hydrology climate science and ecology because it couples the water and energy cycles via evapotranspiration robinson et al 2008 seneviratne et al 2010 with the advent of digital agriculture united nations 2017 advances in sensor technologies and the internet of things have emphasized the need for real time monitoring of soil moisture status such soil moisture monitoring networks include usda s natural resources conservation service s soil climate analysis network scan schaefer et al 2007 us climate reference network uscrn bell et al 2013 and other national and international soil moisture networks dorigo et al 2011 quiring et al 2016 although these networks have provided knowledge at regional to continental scales in evaluating satellite based soil moisture products al bitar et al 2012 monitoring drought mozny et al 2012 and estimating deep drainage wyatt et al 2017 they cannot be directly used to understand the variation of soil water content at the field scale the lack of soil moisture estimates at the field scale at high spatial and temporal resolutions is mainly due to two reasons firstly soil water content is heterogeneous in space and dynamics in time with environmental controlling factors e g meteorological forcing topography soil vegetation varying at different scales joshi and mohanty 2010 vereecken et al 2014 however soil moisture networks are often sparse and available at a much coarser spatial scale e g one station per state for uscrn which cannot be used to characterize the heterogeneity of soil water content at the field scale for agricultural application or hydrological and ecological modeling secondly long term soil moisture networks are installed mainly in forest or grassland soils in an effort to minimize human disturbances during data collection dorigo et al 2011 quiring et al 2016 although soil moisture sensors can be used in cropland for research oriented experiments e g liang et al 2016 huang et al 2017a it is cost prohibitive to install and maintain these sensors during the growing seasons and remove them prior to harvesting therefore information is limited about the spatial and temporal variations of soil water content at the field scale as well as the location specific and time dependent interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors particularly over the cropping seasons e g liang et al 2016 scudiero et al 2018 advances in remote sensing and spatial temporal modeling provide a potential solution by coupling data from soil moisture probes with remotely sensed datasets it is possible to use various physical and empirical models to predict soil moisture across large spatial extents at fine spatial and temporal resolutions wang and qu 2009 recently microwave remote sensing has become popular because it is less affected by atmosphere noises e g clouds compared with

such as the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos mission kerr et al 2001 and soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 pan et al 2016 more recently active microwave sensors have

researchers have used microwave sensors for estimating soil water content little research has been done to understand the interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors in cropland over the growing seasons because these environmental controlling factors e g rainfall irrigation soil texture vegetation often vary in space and time it is expected that the interactions between soil water content and controlling factors are time dependent zhu and lin 2011 in this study we first present a model that estimates the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content 0 0 1 m depth using in situ soil moisture probes and sentinel 1 data collected over two cropping seasons in irrigated fields of the central sands plains wisconsin usa this region covers over 708 000 ha and is an important crop production area that relies on irrigation the study will test two hypotheses 1 surface 0 0 1 m soil water content can be predicted at the high resolution 30 m in sandy soils using a novel empirical model established using the sentinel 1 data over the cropping seasons and 2 the interactions between soil water content and controlling factors are location specific and time dependent and can be quantified using the estimates of soil water content at the high spatial resolution i e 30 m 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study areas included 6 irrigated fields at the wallendal longitude 89 6748 latitude 43 9054 and coloma farms longitude 89 5955 latitude 44 0156 in central sands plains in wisconsin usa the fields are approximately 25 40 ha in size fig 1 the soils are mostly sandy with sand content larger than 80 yost et al 2019 soils are classified as typic udipsamments and arenic hapludalfs according to usda soil taxonomy the fields at wallendal farms are used for potato soybean and corn production with the rotation of various vegetables and fruits e g kidney bean and pumpkin and forage crops e g alfalfa and cover crops e g hay sudan grass while the fields at coloma farms are mainly cropped with potato and soybeans different crops may be planted within the same field to maximize the water use efficiency based on variations in soil texture for example at the du field of wallendal farms fig 1 kidney bean hay sudan grass and pumpkin were planted over the 2016 cropping season irrigation is applied using center pivot systems with irrigation events scheduled every 2 or 3 days during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 the study sites are irrigated based on adjusted evapotranspiration estimates from the climate data measured at the hancock agricultural research station approximately 12 km northeast of the study site at hancock daily potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 adjusted evapotranspiration is calculated by multiplying the potential evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient based on the crop type and growth stage wisconsin irrigation scheduler 2018 for instance different irrigation rates were applied for different crops using the center pivot irrigator at the du field table 1 2 2 soil moisture probe data the soil moisture probes used were manufactured by aquaspy inc san diego ca usa they are based on the capacitance method one set of soil moisture probes have 12 individual sensors and can measure relative soil water content with a 0 1 m depth increment at 12 depths between 0 and 1 2 m paterson et al 2009 seven sets of moisture probes were installed at six irrigated fields at the wallendal and coloma farms in either 2016 or 2017 one set of soil moisture probes were installed in each of the four fields at the wallendal farm i e du krm lobby east thorson fig 1 at the coloma farm a set of probes were installed in the center of field home and two sets of probes were installed in the two irrigation management zones powell dry and powell wet of field powell the irrigation management zones of the powell field were delineated based on a map of soil apparent electrical conductivity measured by a veris 3100 see section 2 5 for details a universal calibration equation was applied to convert the soil moisture sensor measurements to soil volumetric water content vwc m3 m 3 yost et al 2019 in this study a depth of 0 10 cm was used because it was close to the effective measuring depth of the active microwave sensor paloscia et al 2013 2 3 sentinel 1 data the remote sensing data collected from the recently launched european space agency sentinel 1 was used in the study it is a phase preserving dual polarization synthetic aperture radar sar system the sar transmits a signal at a dual polarization c band frequency in either horizontal or vertical polarization and then receives the backscatter intensity in both horizontal and vertical polarizations as soil vwc increases the dielectric constant of the soil water mixture increases with the change detected by backscatter intensity njoku and kong 1977 dobson et al 1985 sentinel 1 platform is a two satellite constellation and provides land surface backscatter measurements at 10 m 10 m every 6 12 days depending on the number of available satellites that fly over the study area sentinel 1 satellite data were obtained over the cropping seasons across the study fields from 2016 to 2017 using the google earth engine platform gorelick et al 2017 the data used in the study area included the ground range detected scenes collected in the interferometric wide swath mode every 6 12 days each image contained the single band vv single co polarization vertical transmit vertical receive and dual band vv vh dual band cross polarization vertical transmit horizontal receive and the incidence angle of the sensor each scene was pre processed with sentinel 1 toolbox following thermal noise removal radiometric calibration terrain correction using srtm 30 m digital elevation model rabus et al 2003 the final terrain corrected values were converted to decibels via log scaling 10 log10 x and quantized to 16 bits https developers google com earth engine sentinel1 in this study we used the sentinel 1 data at 30 m resolution instead of 10 m because it can eliminate the speckle effects in the sentinel 1 radar data gao et al 2017 the resampling of original 10 m sentinel 1 data to 30 m resolution was carried out using the nearest neighbor algorithm different spatial upscaling crow et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 and downscaling peng et al 2017 methods have been previously used to interpolate soil moisture estimates from soil moisture sensor networks or remote sensing platforms onto the targeted resolutions using other remote sensing platform measurements or geoinformation based information such as topographical soil attribute and vegetation characteristics in terms of mapping soil vwc using sentinel 1 the change detection methods based on the linear relationship between changes in vwc and backscatter data are popular and have been recently applied to obtain global soil vwc retrievals at 500 m resolution bauer marschallinger et al 2018 based on previous studies an empirical modeling approach was used in this study given soil texture is relatively homogenous sandy across the study fields first the temporal statistics of the vv and vh backscatter data were calculated at each pixel over the whole 2016 and 2017 cropping period these include temporal minimum mean maximum range and standard deviation these temporal statistics of the sensor measurements over time are used because they often contain useful information related to the characteristics of the soil and vegetation in the field robinson et al 2012 pierdicca et al 2014 huang et al 2017a pedrera parrilla et al 2017 attarzadeh et al 2018 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 and thus could be included as covariates to predict soil water content 2 4 establishing an empirical soil water content model a multiple linear regression mlr model was used to predict soil vwc at 0 0 10 m using the sentinel vv vh their temporal statistics and the incidence angle of the sensor the incidence angle was used to account for the effect of the relative position of the microwave sensor on the backscatter of the signal as suggested by alexakis et al 2017 due to the strong correlations between several temporal statistics of vv and vh data e g vv vv max we excluded them as input covariates a backward elimination approach was used to select the significant covariates for the regression model at a significance level of 0 05 to evaluate the model uncertainty the 95 upper and lower confidence intervals of the predicted vwc from the mlr model established using all 7 locations were calculated using the jmp software jmp 14 sas given the small number of observation points used for establishing the mlr model i e 58 and the relatively uniform landscape and soil texture across the study area we did not use the non linear models such as artificial neural networks as suggested by other researchers paloscia et al 2013 alexakis et al 2017 gao et al 2017 note that a larger soil vwc sentinel 1 dataset was not available in this study area over two years due to two reasons first the farmers rotated the sensors for different fields every year after harvesting the crops as such soil vwc measurements were not available in one field for both years table 2 second although the repeat cycle for sentinel 1 2 satellites is 6 12 days the cropping season in wisconsin usa is short i e from mid may to early september because different sensors needed to be installed in different fields after planting and removed before harvesting the available soil vwc measurements became fewer during the two years although the sampling size of the vwc sentinel 1 measurements was small i e 58 we used it to predict vwc and to infer the soil moisture variability in the study area whereby the soils were dominated by relatively uniform sandy soils with sand content larger than 80 yost et al 2019 to assess the robustness of the mlr model with selected covariates we used leave one group out cross validation as performed by huang et al 2017b to predict soil water content at one sampling location one set of moisture probes at different times we first used the remaining 6 sampling locations 6 moisture probes to fit the linear regression model with the same covariates as selected above and applied the model onto this sampling location to obtain the predicted vwc we then performed this validation approach 7 times to obtain the predicted vwc at all 7 locations at different times in turn note that 7 mlr models were established in turn to evaluate the model performance via the cross validation approach while the mlr model that used vwc measurements from all 7 locations was used in the next section to predict vwc in the du field and for the following analysis of interactions between soil vwc and environmental factors the coefficient of determination r2 lin s concordance correlation coefficient lin 1989 mean error bias and root mean square error accuracy were calculated based on the measured vwc from soil moisture probes and predicted vwc from the leave one group out cross validation note that lin s concordance correlation coefficient lin 1989 measures the agreement between two variables and is calculated from a sample as ρ c 2 s xy s x 2 s y 2 x y 2 where x and y are the means for the measured and predicted variables and s x 2 and s y 2 are the corresponding variances s xy 1 n i 1 n x i x y i y ρ c has a value between 0 and 1 with values closer to 1 indicating a stronger agreement of measured variables versus predicted variables closer to 1 1 line 2 5 predicting the spatial and temporal variations in vwc across the field the fitted mlr model based on vwc measurements from all the soil moisture probes and selected covariates in section 2 4 were applied onto a 30 m grid across one study field i e field du in the wallendal farm at different times over the 2016 cropping season this field was selected for illustration purpose given that three crops were planted in 2016 the resulting maps of vwc were at 30 m resolutions every 6 12 days information about the environmental controlling factors was also obtained across the du field a digital elevation model was obtained from the us geological surveys usgs 2018 at a 1 3rd arc second 10 m spatial resolution topographic wetness index twi was calculated using saga gis conrad et al 2015 based on the 10 m digital elevation model maps of soil particle size fractions i e clay silt and sand contents bulk density bd and soil organic carbon soc concentration at the depth of 0 0 05 m and 100 m resolution were obtained from ramcharan et al 2018 field capacity fc at 10 kpa and permanent wilting point pwp at 1 500 kpa were estimated based on published pedo transfer functions from the same region using soil clay silt and sand content bd and soc concentration yost and hartemink 2019 1 f

measured soil eca at an effective depth of 0 0 0 30 m low eca values often indicate sandy and drier soils while higher eca values represent clayey and wetter soils corwin and lesch 2003 to quantify the relative amount of soil water that is available to plants we calculated soil water deficit swd across the du field using the following formula berliner and oosterhuis 1987 patanè and cosentino 2010 3 s w d 1 v w c p w p f c p w p 100 where v w c was the soil water content estimated on one day over the 2016 cropping season and f c and p w p were estimated from eqs 1 and 2 2 6 understanding the location specific and time dependent interactions between vwc and environmental controlling factors to quantify the relative contribution of different environmental controlling factors on vwc two statistical metrics were used the first metric determines which covariate i e environmental factor alone is able to explain the response it calculates the univariate coefficient of determination r2 values from the linear regression models of vwc with one covariate only e g soil clay content in other words these univariate r2 values are identical to the squared correlation coefficients of the covariate with the response if covariates are correlated the sum of these individual contributions is often higher than the overall r2 of the model with all covariates together i e the overall model explains less than the sum of all individual models for brevity we call this metric the first metric grömping 2006 the second metric used determines which covariate is able to explain the variance of response in addition to all other covariates that are present we ascribe to each covariate the increase in r2 when including this covariate as the last covariate if covariates are correlated these contributions often add up to far less than the overall r2 of the model with all covariates together we call this metric the last metric grömping 2006 to understand the location specific controls of environmental factors on vwc we calculated the temporal mean and standard deviation sd of the estimated vwc across the du field during the 2016 cropping season we assumed that the long term i e during the entire cropping season temporal mean and sd of vwc at the field scale were mainly affected by the spatial variations in the environmental factors i e crop types soil texture and thus the interactions between vwc and environmental factors were mainly location specific to understand the time dependent effects of environmental controlling factors on vwc changes of vwc over short periods i e between june 9th and 14th and between july 15th and 20th in 2016 at the du field were used dates of june 9th and 14th were selected because no irrigation event occurred during this period and the water input came from rainfall only dates of july 15th and 20th were selected to represent the scenario when both irrigation and rainfall occurred over the period table 1 note that mean vwc on june 9th 0 13 m3 m 3 was smaller than that of july 15th mean vwc of 0 15 m3 m 3 this enabled us to study the initial soil water condition on the interactions between vwc and environmental controlling factors the conditions include an initially dry soil condition june 9th and an initially wet soil condition july 15th we assumed that the short term i e during a few days changes of vwc at the field scale were mainly affected by the temporal variations in the environmental factors e g rainfall irrigation and thus the interactions between vwc and environmental factors were mainly event based and time dependent here the first and last metrics were used to quantify the correlations between vwc and environmental factors in terms of the location specific effects of environmental factors on vwc the model response is the temporal mean or temporal sd of vwc over the 2016 cropping season calculated for each pixel across the du field in terms of the time dependent effects of environmental factors on vwc the model response is the changes of vwc over short periods i e between june 9th and 14th and between july 15th and 20th in 2016 that were calculated for every pixel across the du field at 30 m resolution for both effects the covariates are the different environmental controlling factors including factors varying in space such as soil properties eca clay and sand contents bd soc crop types and topography elevation and twi and factors varying in space and time such as sum of cumulative rainfall and irrigation in terms of space varying factors spatial distributions of soil properties and topography were obtained from various maps described in section 2 5 silt content was not used due to its strong correlation with sand content spatial distributions of crop types were obtained from the farmers fig 1 numeric values of 1 2 and 3 were assigned to the areas of kidney bean hay sudan grass and pumpkin respectively based on their increasing initial evapotranspiration et coefficient determined by the fao 2018 in terms of spatial temporal varying factors cumulative rainfall was measured using a rain gauge on the farm over different time intervals assuming it was uniform across the whole field cumulative irrigation was calculated based on the actual irrigation maps provided by the farmers over different time intervals whereby different irrigation rates were used for different crop types in this study we assumed the average rates of irrigation water applied by the center pivot along the radial direction were proportional to the rates applied for the different crop types fig 1 this led to an average irrigation rate within the same crop type over different periods table 1 because the rainfall was relatively uniform across the field the sum of rainfall and irrigation was used to represent the overall water input as mentioned in section 2 4 only 58 coupled vwc sentinel 1 measurements were available in this study to minimize the effect of the small sample size on the robustness of the mlr model and the following interaction analysis between vwc and environmental factors we adopted a bootstrapping approach we described this in turn as follows 1 randomly sample the 58 coupled vwc sentinel 1 measurements 58 times with replacement this generated a dataset of 58 vwc sentinel 1 measurements with identical measurements 2 fit an mlr model using this bootstrap dataset and the selected covariates in section 2 4 and predict soil vwc across the du field on different days over the 2016 cropping season 3 calculate the temporal mean and sd of the vwc and short term changes of vwc i e june 9th 14th and july 15th 20th across the du field and calculate the first and last metrics 4 repeat steps 1 3 1 000 times and calculate the histograms of the first and last metrics calculation of the first and last metrics was done using the relaimpo package of the r software grömping 2006 and the bootstrapping approach was done using the base sample function in the r software r core team 2019 the relative contributions of different environmental factors to the temporal sd and short term changes of vwc did not change for different bootstrap datasets because the effects of bootstrapping sampling were canceled out when the sd and changes of vwc were calculated therefore only the relative contributions were reported for these scenarios 3 results 3 1 summary temporal statistics of soil water content soil vwc at 0 0 1 m depth measured with a sensor on a daily basis in the du field over the 2016 cropping season is presented in fig 2 vwc ranged from 0 14 m3 m 3 to 0 28 m3 m 3 the pattern of soil vwc is consistent with the irrigation and rainfall events the summary temporal statistics of vwc at all 7 locations in 2016 or 2017 are shown in table 2 in general vwc values are normally distributed during the cropping seasons in 2016 and 2017 the minimum mean median maximum standard deviation and coefficient of variation cv of vwc vary between different locations with the minimum vwc ranging from 0 05 m3 m 3 in coloma powell dry field to 0 14 m3 m 3 in wallendal du field and the maximum vwc ranging from 0 20 m3 m 3 in coloma powell dry field to 0 31 m3 m 3 in wallendal thorson field table 2 it was also noted that in coloma powell field mean vwc values measured by the probe in the dry zone 0 10 m3 m 3 coloma powell dry selected based on a veris eca map were generally smaller than those measured by another probe in the wet zone 0 19 m3 m 3 coloma powell wet selected based on the veris eca map 3 2 model accuracy and precision the summary of the multiple linear regression model is shown in table 3 backscatter data from vh mean and maximum values of vh mean values of vv and incidence angle were selected for predicting vwc at 0 0 1 m soil depth with all the covariates selected the fitted mlr had an r2 value of 0 678 and root mean square error of 0 02 m3 m 3 when applied onto the soil moisture probe over the 2016 growing season the model had a good performance given that the most of the vwc measurements were within 95 upper and lower confidence intervals of the prediction fig 2 the leave one group out cross validation results for the mlr model are presented fig 3 the model had a moderate r2 of 0 60 mean error of 0 00 m3 m 3 and rmse of 0 02 m3 m 3 note that the range of vwc at these sites was only 0 2 m3 m 3 lin s concordance correlation coefficient of the validation result is 0 75 indicating a reasonably good agreement between the measured vwc and predicted vwc lin 1989 it was noted that the mlr model had different performance in different fields due to the variations in soil properties and crop types fig 3 the model performance was different for different fields with varying soil texture ground roughness and crops as shown in fig 3 the model had a highest accuracy in wallendal thorson seed corn r2 0 88 rmse 0 021 followed by wallendal krm soybean r2 0 67 rmse 0 017 wallendal lobby east pumpkin r2 0 35 rmse 0 026 wallendal du kidney bean r2 0 28 rmse 0 021 coloma powell wet potato r2 0 28 rmse 0 024 coloma home potato r2 0 27 rmse 0 031 and coloma powell dry potato r2 0 02 rmse 0 025 3 3 spatial distributions of estimated environmental controlling factors and soil properties the spatial distributions of estimated environmental controlling factors and soil properties are presented for the du field fig 4 the elevation is relatively uniform and it gradually decreases from the southeast corner 313 m towards the north and west 310 m of the field fig 4a the variations of eca fig 4b and clay content fig 4c are small but not negligible across the field whereby soil of high eca greater than5 ms m 1 and clay content 9 11 is located in the northwest and center of the field while soil of low eca 2 3 ms m 1 and clay content 4 6 is found in isolated places and particularly close to the southwest corner of the field the spatial distributions of soc fig 4d fc fig 4e and pwp fig 4f are similar to that of clay content 3 4 spatial and temporal variations of estimated vwc and swd during the cropping season the spatial and temporal variations of estimated vwc using the empirical mlr model at the du field over the 2016 cropping season are presented fig 5 in general vwc values increased from june 9th to 14th due to a rainfall event of 32 8 mm and increased from july 15th to 20th due to a rainfall event of 26 4 mm and three irrigation events with cumulative amount of water of 27 9 mm for kidney bean and hay sudan grass and 20 3 mm for pumpkin table 1 and fig 2 the changes of vwc were different during these two periods across the field the change of vwc from june 9th to 14th was mostly in the north and west of the field while the change of vwc from july 15th to 20th was mostly in the south and east the spatial and temporal variations of estimated soil water deficit swd are also presented during these two periods fig 6 in general the patterns are similar to those of the estimated vwc values and changes of vwc values 4 discussion 4 1 advantages and disadvantages of the empirical mlr model a trade off exists between the accuracy and spatial resolutions of the soil vwc retrieval models well established models based on microwave remote sensing can have good model accuracy e g rmse 0 04 m3 m 3 but the spatial resolutions are often too coarse such as 3 km to 36 km for smap nasa 2019 and 500 m for sentinel 1 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 for field scale agricultural management and hydrological studies the multiple linear regression model is reasonably good in this study this can be attributed to the relatively uniform soil texture sandy soil across the study fields fig 4 compared to other physical e g fung et al 1992 semi empirical e g dubois et al 1995 and empirical e g oh et al 1992 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 vreugdenhil et al 2018 models that relate microwave backscatter measurements to soil vwc this empirical model is relatively easy to build because it does not require the measurement or estimation of other model parameters such as the ground roughness conditions there are a few disadvantages of the empirical mlr model that need to be overcome in the future first the good model performance may decrease when the model is applied to a different study area where the soil conditions e g soil texture ground surface roughness and vegetation types fall outside the range of the calibration datasets table 2 and fig 3 this was indicated in fig 3 whereby the model performance varied with soil conditions and crop types in this study the model performed worst in the potato field coloma powell dry most likely due to the low vwc values the model also performed poorly in the fields cropped with potato most likely due to the limited penetration depth of c band microwave into the soil during the cropping season to overcome this limitation collecting soil vwc data at other soil conditions and vegetation types should be done in the future alternatively as suggested by bauer marschallinger et al 2018 amongst other researchers interfering factors on the model performance include surface roughness tillage plant canopy water content vegetation density and orientation and the interactions are complex and often difficult to mitigate therefore an alternative approach to utilize sentinel 1 data for soil water retrieval is to upscale data to a coarser scale and minimize the effects of these interfering factors bauer marschallinger et al 2018 second the relationship between sentinel 1 backscatter data and soil vwc were often not linear and needs to be corrected for the crop in real time shoshany et al 2000 for example gao et al 2017 synergistically used sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 data for soil moisture mapping at 100 m resolution across a 20 km by 20 km study area in spain to correct the effect of crop cover on soil water dynamics they used the ndvi index calculated from sentinel 2 data as a proxy for detecting the changing crop cover over the cropping season and reduced the rmse of the model from 0 087 with a change detection algorithm using only sentinel 1 data to 0 059 m3 m 3 by including the ndvi index synergetic use of sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 data was also attempted by attarzadeh et al 2018 which generated an rmse value of 0 049 m3 m 3 in our study we did not include optical sentinel 2 or landsat because of the large cloud cover during the two cropping seasons across the study area if the method were to be applied elsewhere data fusion between sentinel 1 and other optical remote sensing measurements e g ndvi from landsat and sentinel 2 may be explored in addition to data fusions non linear models and machine learning algorithms can also be used to improve the model performance possible models include artificial neural network paloscia et al 2013 random forest vreugdenhil et al 2018 support vector regression attarzadeh et al 2018 and bayesian multi temporal algorithm pierdicca et al 2014 however these non linear models often require a large calibration dataset and thus are not applicable in this study third the number of coupled vwc sentinel 1 measurements i e 58 was too small for building a robust mlr model although the mlr model established in this study was relatively accurate it would be difficult to apply it to other areas for predicting soil vwc therefore it is worth collecting more soil vwc measurements in the cropped fields in the future to improve the robustness of the soil vwc retrieval algorithm 4 2 location specific interactions between soil vwc and environmental controlling factors to investigate the location specific relationship between soil vwc and different environmental controlling factors two statistical metrics are calculated using 1 000 bootstrap datasets table 4 in terms of the temporal mean vwc in the 2016 cropping season considering the contribution of each environmental controlling factor independently based on the first metric table 4a rainfall irrigation explained 4 8 of the total variance followed by bd 4 0 eca 3 1 clay content 2 8 soc 1 8 sand content 1 0 elevation 0 2 crop 0 2 and twi 0 1 the relative importance of different environmental controlling factors was slightly different table 4b when considered together in explaining the total variance of mean vwc in 2016 in this case the most important covariate was still rainfall irrigation 4 7 followed by crop 3 8 eca 1 6 clay content 1 4 bd 0 2 sand content 0 1 elevation 0 1 soc 0 1 and twi 0 0 this indicated that temporal mean vwc in this sandy field is mostly controlled by meteorological forcing rainfall and irrigation followed by crop soil properties and topography note that only 13 6 of the total variance was explained by all the environmental controlling factors shown in table 4 this can be due to three seasons first the maps of soil properties were obtained at the 100 m spatial resolution based on a machine learning approach with a large amount of uncertainty ramcharan et al 2018 and the use of a 10 m digital elevation model may not well represent the local topography characteristics at the scale of soil moisture probes 0 5 m2 second other environmental controlling factors may also contribute to the variance of mean vwc such as evapotranspiration deep drainage and runoff which cannot be mapped as such fine spatial and temporal resolutions using the available datasets third the variance of mean and sd of vwc can be due to random errors that cannot be explained by any environmental factors vinnikov et al 1996 the histograms of the percentage contributions of different environmental factors generated using 1 000 bootstrap datasets are shown in fig 7 in general the estimation of relative contributions of different environmental factors was reliable given the narrow 95 percentiles in addition the orders of importance of different environmental factors calculated using the first and second metrics remained the same this suggested that the small sampling size i e 58 did not affect the estimation of relative contributions of different environmental factors to the mean of vwc much and the analysis was robust different patterns were observed for the temporal sd of vwc during the 2016 cropping season unlike the temporal mean vwc all the environmental controlling factors explained 39 5 of the total variance of the sd of vwc this was not unexpected because the sd of vwc is mainly driven by water input from rainfall and irrigation water storage as represented by field capacity and porosity as a function of soil particle size fractions bd and soc and water output as evapotranspiration crop and runoff topography when considering the relative contribution of each individual environmental controlling factor in explaining the sd of vwc in 2016 table 4 a crop was ranked most important 35 4 followed by bd 21 7 rainfall irrigation 21 1 sand content 11 8 elevation 5 1 soc 2 1 clay content 0 4 eca 0 5 and twi 0 0 when considering the relative contribution with all factors considered the crop was ranked most importantly followed by soil properties and topography twi and elevation in this case rainfall irrigation was not significant because it was masked by the strongly correlated crop factor that was used to determine irrigation rates the correlations between soil vwc and various environmental controlling factors are consistent with the previous studies these include meteorological forcing such as rainfall oldak et al 2002 gaur and mohanty 2013 and solar radiation joshi and mohanty 2010 irrigation malash et al 2008 soil properties such as soil texture joshi and mohanty 2010 hydraulic properties shao et al 1997 soil organic carbon yost and hartemink 2019 eca as a representation of different soil properties corwin and lesch 2003 vegetation wang et al 2014 wang and franz 2015 li et al 2018 and topography bonan et al 1993 vanderlinden et al 2012 the difference between this study and other studies is that meteorological forcing such as rainfall and solar radiation is less important in explaining the variations in temporal mean and sd of vwc as compared to other factors because they are relatively uniform at the field scale 4 3 time dependent interactions between soil vwc and environmental controlling factors changes in soil vwc are also time dependent event based fig 5 and fig 6 the relative contribution of environmental controlling factors on changes of soil vwc calculated using 1 000 bootstrap datasets is also presented table 5 in terms of changes of vwc due to rainfall and evapotranspiration only june 9th to 15th 2016 the time dependent controls on soil vwc dynamics are mainly caused by crop 13 5 followed by soil properties such as bd 6 3 sand content 4 7 eca 1 2 clay content 0 7 soc 0 2 and topography 1 2 for twi and 0 3 elevation table 5 a however when the changes of vwc is due to both rainfall and irrigation and evapotranspiration july 15th to 20th 2016 the time dependent controls on soil vwc is mainly due to crop 11 7 irrigation 8 3 soil properties such sand content 5 8 and bd 2 5 and elevation 3 7 the time dependent interactions between soil vwc and environmental factors have also been reported by other researchers first the interactions between soil vwc and environmental factors are controlled by the initial soil vwc for example gardner and ehlig 1962 showed that the water removal from the soil as a function of impedance to water movement was largely in the plant when the soil was wet and largely in the soil when the soil became dry this may explain while the relative contribution of crop to changing vwc was similar at the periods of june 9th 15th relatively dry initial soil condition on june 9th with a mean vwc of 0 13 m3 m 3 and july 15th 20th relatively wet initial soil condition on july 15th with a mean vwc of 0 15 m3 m 3 the relative contribution of soil decreased greatly second the interactions between soil vwc and environmental controlling factors are also controlled by plant stress status for example based on the simulation results teuling and troch 2005 found both soil and vegetation controls can act to either create or destroy spatial variance depending on whether or not the soil dried below the critical moisture content namely the transition between unstressed and stressed transpiration in this study this was confirmed by the time dependent contribution of environmental controlling factors on changing soil vwc and thus soil water deficit swd table 5 note that the percentage contributions for the changes in swd were the same to those of the vwc data not shown because swd was calculated by rescaling vwc based on field capacity and permanent wilting point third a number of researchers have found the temporal stability of soil vwc variations in natural landscapes with variable vegetation and soil types and complicated topography and concluded that these can be used for remote sensing of soil vwc and soil moisture parameterization in climate models vachaud et al 1985 vinnikov et al 1996 mohanty and skaggs 2001 vanderlinden et al 2012 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 in our study we calculated the temporal statistics of the sentinel 1 backscatter measurements based on the available measurements collected in both 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons we also explored the potential to use temporal statistics calculated in 2016 or 2017 only but failed to fit an accurate mlr model the difference between our study and the studies mentioned above is our remote sensing data were collected in the cropland over the growing seasons with different crop rotations for the same field in different years one potential explanation to the good model performance can be that the ground roughness was relatively stable over time and can be separated from the crop canopy dynamics as suggested by bauer marschallinger et al 2018 however future work is required to further investigate this issue in places with dense vegetation it is also worth noting that our study did not reveal the importance of meteorological forcing in explaining soil vwc variations as discovered by others at different scales for example in extremely dry surface soils researchers have found soil vwc is controlled by high potential evaporation which leads to upward vapor movement e g saito et al 2006 du et al 2018 in our study the influence of meteorological forcing was not significant because the soil moisture probes were installed at the field scale and the annual rainfall is larger than the annual evaporation in the study area therefore it is possible to apply this approach to other climate regimes in the future so that the location specific and time dependent interactions between soil vwc and meteorological forcing can be revealed seneviratne et al 2010 wang et al 2017 in addition it is also worth further investigating the interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors under cropping and non cropping seasons and compare them for different vegetation types across a large spatial extent and over a long period as explored by zhu and lin 2011 4 4 implications for soil water conservation and irrigation management under climate change the maps of soil vwc fig 5 and swd fig 6 illustrated the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content over a cropping season these can be used in the future as baseline soil moisture maps for the farmers to schedule irrigation particularly when patterns of precipitation are changing across the globe ipcc 2014 in order to achieve this mechanistic hydrological models need to be used in combination with surface soil vwc retrieved from remote sensing data soil hydrological properties montzka et al 2017 chaney et al 2019 at different depths and subsoil vwc measurements from soil moisture probes as validation for forecasting soil water dynamics at different depths and irrigation scheduling in the real time das and mohanty 2006 huang et al 2017a de lannoy et al 2007 das et al 2008 lievens et al 2017 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 when the spatial information about soil hydrological properties is available e g field capacity permanent wilting point maps of changes in swd can be used to identify areas where irrigation is not necessary occurs low swd values and design maps for variable rate irrigation lo et al 2017 5 conclusion an empirical multiple linear regression model for predicting soil water dynamics at the surface 0 0 1 m in cropped fields was established using sentinel 1 data and soil moisture probes backscatter measurements of sentinel 1 backscatter data were used in combination with temporal statistics e g mean and maximum and incidence angle of the sensor as covariates to predict soil water content in space and time the model was reasonably accurate given the small rmse 0 02 m3 m 3 large r2 0 60 and lin s concordance correlation coefficient of 0 75 from a leave one group out cross validation soil water content was mapped at 30 m resolution every 6 12 days across one study field using two statistical metrics and bootstrapping sampling the results revealed location specific and time dependent interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors including crop soil properties irrigation and topography the time dependent interactions are affected by initial soil water content and plant stress status future work should include more soil moisture probe data in the cropland over the growing seasons and applying non linear modeling algorithms the method has the potential to provide a baseline surface soil moisture map and to be coupled with mechanistic hydrological models for improved irrigation management and water use efficiency under climate change further research is required to study location specific and time dependent interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors across different climate regimes and investigate the issues of time stable scales of variations in soil water content in places where

6379,there has been a series of water resource problems such as imbalances of the water supply and demand and serious water pollution in china it is important for the chinese government to formulate a sustainable development strategy for water resources and to effectively guarantee the national water resource security this paper divides the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources into the following three aspects the water resource balance capacity the water resource pressure and driving force and the water resource development and utilization capacity taking 31 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions of china as research objects the catastrophe progression method is adopted to evaluate the comprehensive carrying capacity of interprovincial water resources in china from 2010 to 2016 the direct effects and spatial spillover effects of different factors on water resources are discussed by constructing a spatial durbin model sdm the results show that there are obvious spatial differences in the water resource balance ability pressure and driving force and development and utilization ability the spatial distribution follows a decreasing trend from east to west and from south to north the water supply water demand investment in environmental management economic development and balance of the ecosystem have obvious direct effects on the carrying capacity of water resources the spatial spillover effect of the water supply and demand energy consumption the proportion of protected areas and the newly increased areas of soil erosion control are significant and will have a strong impact on the water resource carrying capacity of surrounding areas the conclusion of this paper can provide a reference for the government in making water resource management policies keywords water resources comprehensive carrying capacity spatial effect china 1 introduction 1 1 research background at present global water security is facing increasing challenges safeguarding water security and achieving the 2030 united nations sustainable development water related goals have become a common vision of all countries in the world although china is rich in total water resources due to its large population base and serious water and environmental pollution its per capita water resources are less than 2400 m3 which is only 1 4 of the world s per capita water resources and the country is suffering from extreme water shortages among the more than 600 cities in china more than 400 have an insufficient water supply and the total water shortage in cities is as high as 6 billion m3 protection of water resource 360 wikipedia 2019 at the same time the development and utilization efficiency of water resources in china is low and the total amount of industrial water is five or even ten times higher than that in developed countries however the reuse rate of industrial water is only 20 to 30 which is far lower than the standard for developed countries water pollution is serious and nearly 50 of the water quality monitored in key cities does not meet the drinking water standards current situation and prevention of water pollution in china water pollution 2019 from the perspective of spatial distribution the distribution of water resources in china is extremely mismatched with the land and productivity showing the overall distribution characteristic of a greater amount in the south than in the north as for north of the yangtze river basin it s area accounts for 63 5 of the country s total area while the amount of water resources accounts for only 19 of the country s total water resources the natural fresh water resources in the southwest and southeast china provide 610 billion m3 year accounting for 71 of the total fresh water in china while the six provinces in northwest china account for approximately 30 of the country s total area but have only 15 of the country s water resources water 2019 at the same time the precipitation distribution in china shows a general trend of decreasing from the southeast coast to the northwest inland the annual precipitation in southeast china is mostly more than 1600 mm while that in taiwan is as high as 3000 mm and that in northwest china is less than 400 mm the precipitation in the xinjiang tarim basin the qaidam basin and many other marginal areas which are in an extremely arid zones is less than 20 mm china s annual precipitation spatial distribution characteristics baidu know 2019 in the context of the increasingly frequent floods and droughts in china and the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources across the country it is of great significance to study the carrying capacity of water resources in different regions of china to solve the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources and to improve the problem of water resource shortage 1 2 literature review the carrying capacity of water resources refers to the maximum scale of population economy society and other aspects that can be carried by water resources in a certain region under the premise of sustainable development with the guarantee of the existing social and economic development level shi and qu 1992 at present research on the carrying capacity of water resources involves the evaluation and prediction of the carrying capacity and the factors influencing the carrying capacity research on water resource carrying capacity evaluation mainly focuses on three aspects the urban scale ait aoudiab and berezowska azzag 2014 wang et al 2018 the regional scale dou et al 2015 harris 1999 kisakye and bruggen 2018 and the basin scale matrosov et al 2015 peterson 2002 urban scale research focuses on a specific urban area and a number of urban groups with similar water distribution characteristics studies at the regional scale examine the water resources of some parts of the country such as the eastern central or western areas or certain provinces from the perspectives of economy terrain humanities and climate studies at the basin scale set the study area as within a circle surrounded by watersheds in hydrogeography these specific river catchments are considered to have similar hydrological characteristics areas with larger basin areas have richer water volumes and the yangtze river basin and the pearl river basin have become hot spots in china s water resource research in general the research scale of the water resource carrying capacity is similar in terms of geographical conditions natural climate economic society and culture no matter whether conducted in cities regions or basins the conclusions obtained from the empirical analysis of these similar areas are well targeted which can facilitate planning water resources according to the actual situation of the region and improve the efficiency of water resource management a small number of scholars have studied the water resource carrying capacity on a national scale jia et al 2018 yao et al 2019 and obtained the coordination relationship between the overall economic status ecological development and water resources studies involving the evaluation of the national water resource carrying capacity have all indicated that there are significant differences in the carrying capacity between different regions and narrowing the differences in carrying capacity between neighboring regions is a key problem to be solved there are many methods for the carrying capacity evaluation of water resources and with the continuous expansion of the research field the research methods have become more diversified the traditional carrying capacity evaluation methods including the comprehensive index evaluation method magri and berezowska azzag 2018 widodo et al 2015 multiple objective decision method zheng 2019 principal component analysis zhang et al 2019 topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method li et al 2019 zyoud et al 2016 etc although these methods are objective and involve distinct simple and convenient calculation indexes it is difficult to determine the elements involved and the interaction between the dynamic change processes of the carrying capacity with the deepening of research existing studies have paid more attention to the combination of theory and carrying capacity calculation emphasizing the theoretical basis of empirical analysis the system dynamics method wang et al 2018 slesser 1990 fiddaman 2002 ecological footprint method veettil and mishra 2016 sun et al 2017 catastrophe progression method jia et al 2018 and projection pursuit method yu and lu 2018 zhang and dong 2009 are some of the research methods used in recent years these methods attempt to explain the connotations of system development and simulate the evolution process and feedback mechanism of the ecosystem taking into account the internal relations of various factors the application of these methods to the research of water resource carrying capacity can enrich the theoretical background of the research and the conclusions obtained are more convincing some scholars have also adopted the analytic hierarchy process entropy weight determination method gray correlation topsis method and other composite methods zyoud et al 2016 wu et al 2018 for carrying capacity evaluation these methods combine subjective and objective observations as well as quantitative and qualitative measurements making up for the inherent defects of single methods in carrying capacity evaluation in recent years with the constant updating of econometric theories the var model logistic set pair analysis model and other economic models have also been applied in the field of resource management to reflect the relationship between the resource carrying capacity and economic and social development breaking through the limitations of traditional research methods of carrying capacity tian and sun 2018 mitchell 1999 thus it can be seen that the research of water resource carrying capacity has experienced a development process from simple to complex constantly emphasizing the internal mechanisms of the complex system in general existing reports have described good studies on the evaluation of water resource carrying capacity which has strongly promoted research progress concerning water resource carrying capacity however existing studies still have the following limitations first most of the research subjects only cover some areas and there are few comparative studies of multiple regions at the national level most of the research objects for water resource carrying capacity are local areas such as the western central and northeastern provinces as well as specific urban groups such as the pearl river delta the yangtze river delta the beijing tianjin hebei region etc these studies cannot make a comparative analysis from the national level and the result can only reflect the status of a particular region of water resources while reference values regarding national water policy formulation are rare second the index system needs to be further improved most of existing studies adopted the system theory method or the pressure state response model while some scholars have selected indexes from the perspective of system theory and divided them into the sublevels of economy society and ecology as a whole rijiberman and van de venb 2000 simonovic and davies 2001 wu et al 2018 other scholars used the pressure state response model psr to divide the indicator levels wang et al 2019 bai and tang 2010 these two traditional methods divide the indicator system into independent sublevels and fail to take into account the interrelation between the indicators the overall indicator construction has a lack of scientific nature and has not yet formed a relatively complete system third the influencing factors of the water resource carrying capacity need to be further analyzed most existing studies have measured and evaluated the regional water resource carrying capacity well but few have made systematic analyses of various factors affecting the water resource carrying capacity some studies scored the carrying capacity of the same region in different times to determine the dynamic changes of the bearing capacity of a specific region and make longitudinal comparisons over time zhang et al 2019 lu et al 2017 in others the bearing capacity was considered from the perspective of the spatial layout and the differences in water resource carrying capacity between different geographical locations were investigated for horizontal comparison jia et al 2018 kuzdas et al 2016 however there are some factors influencing the carrying capacity of water resources which need further analysis 1 3 the main work and innovations of this paper based on the existing research status this paper evaluates the ability to balance water resources the pressure and driving forces of water resources and the development and utilization ability of water resources in chinese provinces on this basis considering the impact of geographical location on the carrying capacity of water resources the effects of each factor are divided into direct effects and indirect effects compared with the existing research the main work and innovations of this paper are mainly reflected in the following aspects first taking china s interprovincial water resource carrying capacity as the core of this research the differences between water resources in different provinces and regions are analyzed from the national level in this paper the catastrophe progression theory is used to evaluate the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources in each province the evaluation results can visually show the water resource carrying capacity corresponding to different geographical regions which is beneficial to the regulation of resource allocation from the macro level and to reducing the differences between provinces and it can provide a reference for the formulation of policies such as the cross regional mobilization of water resources second a comprehensive evaluation system for water resources is constructed by combining the classification method of the system theory with the pressure state response model psr the comprehensive evaluation system is constructed by selecting indexes from three sublevels of the ability to achieve water resource balance the water resource pressure and driving force and the water resource development and utilization ability the indexes of these three sublevels are selected according to the classification methods of the system theory and the psr model and the water resource situation in china is presented from different perspectives in consideration of the environmental pollution caused by greenhouse gas emissions variable energy consumption was added in this paper to seek the impact of climate change on water resources and further explore the influencing factors of the water resource carrying capacity compared with previous studies the new system construction standards and newly added variables make the whole index layer more comprehensive third the spatial panel model is introduced into the study of the factors affecting the carrying capacity of water resources based on the geographical weight matrix the direct and indirect effects of different variables on the carrying capacity of water resources are discussed and their internal relations are analyzed from the perspective of spatial autocorrelation through the transfer of explanatory variables and explained variable spatial lag terms the correlation between the water resource carrying capacity and influencing factors in various regions was clarified the overall research process of this paper is shown in fig 1 the rest of this paper is arranged as follows the second section includes the method introduction and data source the third section provides the results analysis for china s interprovincial water resource carrying capacity the fourth section contains the results analysis for the spatial effect of china s comprehensive water resource carrying capacity the fifth section includes the discussion and analysis and the last section provides the main conclusions and policy suggestions 2 research methods and data sources 2 1 evaluation system for the water resource comprehensive carrying capacity according to the principles of the systematic nature typicality and comparability of index selection the availability of data is also taken into consideration on the basis of previous studies this paper selects 22 evaluation indexes from the three sublevels of water resource balance capacity water resource pressure and driving force and water resource development and utilization capacity to build an evaluation system for the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources and determines the weight of each index using the gray correlation rule the index system is shown in table 1 2 2 evaluation model for the comprehensive water resource carrying capacity grey correlation catastrophe progression method the catastrophe theory studies the qualitative change processes of natural phenomena and the continuous interruption of various social activities describing phenomena and general laws the catastrophe progression method was researched and developed on the basis of the catastrophe theory it takes the potential function f x as the research object and describes the mutation through state variables and external parameters the system bifurcation set equation can be solved by the combination of the critical point equation and the singular point solution equation variables in the bifurcation set will cause the potential function to mutate since the units of the variables are not uniform the normalization formula needs to be derived the catastrophe progression model and normalization formula this paper used are shown in table 2 in this paper the initial weight of each index is determined by the grey relational analysis method and the index layers are sorted reasonably a measure of the degree of association between two systems that varies from time to time or from object to object is called the degree of association in the process of system development if the trend of the two factors changes that is the degree of synchronous change is higher it can be said that the degree of correlation between the two is higher otherwise it is lower therefore the grey correlation analysis method is based on the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between the development trends of factors that is the grey correlation degree as a method to measure the degree of association between factors the basic steps are as follows 1 the original index matrix is formula 1 1 x x ij m n 2 the data normalization processing uses formula 2 2 x ij x ij min x j max x j min x j 3 the grey correlation coefficient can be calculated by formula 3 3 r ij min n min m x 0 j x ij ρ max n max m x 0 j x ij x 0 j x ij ρ max n max m x 0 j x ij in formula 3 x 0 is the reference sequence and ρ is the resolution coefficient usually assigned as 0 5 4 the weight formula is shown as formula 4 4 w j 1 n i 1 n rij then the index weight vector 5 is obtained 5 w w 1 w 2 w n t each indicator is sorted by importance according to its weight 5 the normalized formula is derived from the bifurcation set equation of the mutation system 6 comprehensive scoring was conducted according to the normalized formula there are two main criteria for scoring if the effects of each control variable can complement each other take the average and if the role of each control variable cannot be defined the value shall be determined according to the principle of the minimax choice 2 3 spatial effect model of the comprehensive water resources carrying capacity spatial panel durbin model the first law of geography says that all things are related but two things that are closer are more strongly related in the study of interprovincial issues we usually believe that there is a close relationship between provinces and that neighboring provinces are more closely related chen 2014 the spatial econometric model can provide a reference for studying spatial direct effects and spillover effects 2 3 1 construction of the space weight matrix the first premise of space analysis is to construct a space weight matrix if there are n regions and the distance between two regions is denoted as wij then the space weighted matrix w can be defined as formula 6 6 w w 11 w 1 n w n 1 w nn the distance between two regions can use the adjacency matrix geographic distance matrix economic distance matrix geo economic distance matrix etc the matrix used in this paper is the geographic distance matrix 2 3 2 spatial autocorrelation global and local moran index in determining whether the spatial econometric model can be used it is necessary to examine the spatial dependence the most common indicator is the moran index the calculation formula is shown in eq 7 7 i i 1 n j 1 n wij xi x xj x s 2 i 1 n j 1 n wij the local moran index examines the spatial agglomeration around region i and the calculation formula is shown in eq 8 8 ii x i x s 2 i 1 n w i j xj x the moran index i is generally between 1 and 1 where a value greater than zero means a positive autocorrelation high value phase aggregation and low value phase aggregation a value less than zero indicates a negative autocorrelation and that high values are adjacent to low values if the moran index is close to zero it means that there is no spatial correlation that is the spatial distribution is random 2 3 3 spatial durbin model early studies on spatial models show that when individuals are spatially dependent spatial lag or spatial error terms may be included in the panel model which respectively constitute the spatial lag model and the spatial error model kelley pace et al 1998 griffith 2000 driscoll and kraay 1998 hordijk 1979 the principle of the spatial lag model is the same as that of the time lag model intuitively the explained variables of adjacent regions may depend on each other and eventually form a balanced result for the consideration of competition or game the governments of different regions will consider the level of surrounding regions when formulating their local policies however the spatial error model reflects the spatial dependence through the error term which means that the omitted variables that are not included in x but have an impact on y have a spatial correlation or the random shocks that cannot be observed have a spatial correlation these two cases consider the space lag and space error respectively and these two effects may also occur simultaneously so the more general space econometric model is to use the two together the general expression of the spatial lag model slm is formula 9 9 yit ρ j 1 n ω i j y j t x i t β μ i λ i ε i t the general expression of the spatial error model sem is formula 10 10 yit x i t β μ i i γ i λ ϖ i ε i v i t in formula 10 yit represents the endogenous variable of the unit i in the period t xit represents the exogenous variable of the unit i in the period t ϖ i j represents the spatial weight matrix ρ measures the interaction between two exogenous variables β represents the corresponding coefficient x variable μ represents the individual effect λ represents the time effect and ε is the random error term in general the spatial model will be preliminarily determined according to the lagrange multiplier test however due to problems involving data measurement errors and environmental uncertainty misjudgment may occur therefore more scholars choose the general and universal spatial durbin model sdm which contains the spatial lag term of the interpreted variables as well as the spatial lag term of the explanatory variables the general form of the spatial durbin model is formula 11 11 yit ρ j 1 n ω i j y j t x i t β γ j 1 n ω i j x j t μ i λ i ε i t the corresponding coefficient variable x is expressed by γ in eq 11 in this paper the balance capacity of water resources the pressure and driving force of water resources and the development and utilization capacity of water resources are discussed respectively therefore three models are constructed for the spatial analysis of effects to respectively discuss the influence of these three factors and their direct effects and indirect effects water resource balance capacity model the water resource balance capacity is affected by eight factors including the annual precipitation per capita water resource amount total water supply per capita water consumption water saving irrigation area agricultural water industrial water and domestic water which are represented by x 1 x 8 respectively the model is shown in formula 12 12 y it ρ j 1 n ω ij y jt x 1 i t β 1 γ 1 j 1 n ω ij x 1 j t

affected area energy consumption natural rate of population growth contribution rate of the tertiary industry gdp growth rate and the total protected area in the area of jurisdiction which are represented by x 1 x 6 respectively the model is shown in formula 13 13 yit ρ j 1 n ω i j y j t x 1 i t β 1 γ 1 j 1 n ω i j x 1 j t x 2 i t β 2 γ 2 j 1 n ω i j x 2 j t x 3 i t β 3 γ 3 j 1 n ω i j x 3

resource development and utilization capacity is affected by eight factors including the forest cover rate proportion of investment in environmental pollution control relative to the gdp industrial water reuse rate sewage treatment capacity of treatment plants urban sewage treatment rate green coverage rate in built up areas ecological environment hydration and soil erosion area increase in the current year which are represented by x 1 x 8 respectively the model is shown in formula 14 14 yit ρ j 1 n ω i j y j t x 1 i t β 1 γ 1 j 1 n ω i j x 1 j t x 2 i t β 2 γ 2 j 1 n ω i j x 2 j t x 3 i t β

partial derivatives were obtained for the exogenous variables of each spatial unit as shown in eq 17 17 y x 1 k l y x n k i n δ w 1 β β w in matrix 17 the mean value of the diagonal elements is the direct effect which represents the mean value of the variation of the explained variables in the region resulting in the variation of the explained variables in the region the mean value of the nondiagonal elements in the matrix is the spillover effect which represents the mean value of the variation of the explained variables in the adjacent region caused by the change of the explained variables in this region 2 4 the data source the research objects for the comprehensive water resources carrying capacity evaluation are 31 provinces cities and autonomous regions in china due to the absence of some data in tibet the spatial effect of the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources was studied in 30 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions excluding tibet the data required for this study are from the china environmental statistics yearbook from 2010 to 2016 national bureau of statistics 2018 and statistical yearbooks of various provinces from 2010 to 2016 3 analysis of the evaluation results of the comprehensive water resource carrying capacity of china s provinces the catastrophe progression method was used to obtain the 2016 comprehensive water resource carrying capacity scores of the provinces and the results are shown in fig 2 3 1 china s interprovincial water resource balance capacity the balance capacity of water resources is discussed from the perspective of supply and demand as well as the relationship between them the uneven distribution of water resources in space and time coupled with the excessive consumption of water resources by human beings leads to a sharp decline in the availability of water resources and the increasingly prominent contradiction between the supply and demand therefore it is necessary to analyze the balance between the supply and demand of water resources the water resource balance capacity of each province in china is shown in fig 2 1 the balance of water resources in china is strong in the south and east and weak in the west and north as shown in fig 2 1 the regions with the weakest water resource balance capacity are concentrated in the densely populated areas such as beijing tianjin and shanghai the western regions such as xinjiang qinghai and ningxia and the central regions such as shaanxi and shanxi which have the most serious pollution the regions with strong balance abilities are distributed in the south of guangxi hunan and guangdong east china and central china have the highest average scores while north china and northwest china have the lowest average scores on the one hand the balance of water resources in various regions will be affected by the supply level and a higher water supply will improve the balance of water resources southeast china has abundant rainfall a humid climate and relatively high total water resources in the coastal provinces so these regions have relatively strong water balance abilities data on the distribution of the population and water resources show that the population south of the yangtze river basin accounts for 54 of that in the whole country but the water resources account for 81 china s annual precipitation spatial distribution characteristics baidu know 2019 in addition due to changes of the natural environment and the high intensity of human activities the water resources in the north are further reduced aggravating the imbalance of water resources between the north and the south natural disasters and water quality can affect the balance of water resources the severe pollution in the yellow river basin coupled with the long drought in the central and western regions and the relatively backward economic development have caused an extreme shortage of water resources in shanxi shaanxi and other provinces the inland province xinjiang is quite short of water and the continuous expansion of the desert causes sandstorms and serious soil erosion resulting in the weak balance ability of water resources in xinjiang meanwhile tibet which is also a sparsely populated region has a rich water flow a small amount of sand and good water quality so it shows a strong balance ability of water resources on the other hand water resource balance capacity will be affected by the demand level and relatively low water resource demand will improve the water resource balance capacity in beijing shanghai and other regions with dense populations and industrial agglomeration excessive water use will lead to excessive demands for water resources and reduce the balance capacity of water resources the northwest region is sparsely populated and its economic activities are weak although it is in a relatively water deficient zone it does not cause strong water imbalance in addition china s water use structure is changing urban water consumption and industrial production water consumption is gradually increasing increasing the degree of demand for water resources thus aggravating the imbalance of water resources 3 2 china s interprovincial water resource pressure and driving force the pressure and driving force of water resources are evaluated comprehensively from the two aspects of pressure and driving force water resource pressure reflects the imbalance between the supply and demand caused by environmental damage and water system pollution while the driving force of water resource reflects the increase of water demand for production to meet the increase of the material demand from population growth pressure and driving forces put forward higher requirements for water resource management and resource allocation the pressure and driving forces of water resource in various provinces and regions in china are shown in fig 2 2 the pressure and driving forces of water resources in china are weak in the south and strong in the north the scores of the water resource pressure and driving force in most regions are within the range of 0 8 to 0 85 and the scores of some regions such as liaoning and zhejiang are relatively low in terms of the selected factors water resources in areas with high pollution degrees are under high pressure and driving force and most provinces with high disaster areas and energy consumption will receive a high score compared with the southern provinces the overall level of science and technology in the northern region is lower than that in the southern region and its water resources management and recovery measures need to be further improved which may lead to greater pressure on water resources water resources in xinjiang inner mongolia hubei and shandong are under high pressure and driving forces the climate in xinjiang and inner mongolia is dry and the rural population accounts for a large proportion so the ecological water use is crowded the economic and scientific and technological development is relatively backward and the water resource management system lacks technical support therefore the water ecological balance is under great pressure as a province with a large population and a large economy shandong province has a high demand for water and serious water pollution in its reservoirs as a province rich in water resources hubei province is also threatened by the pollution of water resources the eutrophication of lakes and urban inner lakes in the province is intensified more than half of the reservoirs fail to meet water quality requirements water pollution accidents occur frequently and widely which seriously damage the balance system of water resources 3 3 china s interprovincial water resource development and utilization capacity the development and utilization of water resources refers to reducing the use of water resources through reasonable technical measures based on considering the water used for production living and the ecological environment and at the same time effectively recovering and utilizing the waste water as people have not paid enough attention to the protection of water resources there have been some phenomena such as the excessive development of water resources and water waste and the water use efficiency is far lower than the international level human beings must improve the development and utilization ability of water resources through effective measures to maintain sustainable development which requires us to make a systematic evaluation of the development and utilization degree of water resources fig 2 3 shows china s interprovincial water resource development and utilization capacity overall the level of water resources development and utilization across the country is uneven as shown in fig 2 3 the development and utilization degree of water resources in china gradually increases from west to east some eastern provinces such as zhejiang score more than 0 94 while the lowest score in tibet is only 0 6 the increase in demand and the reduction of the total amount of available water resources are the essential reasons for the great importance of water resources development and utilization in addition due to the change of water structure and the excessive exploitation of groundwater there are major problems in the development and utilization of water resources in china the lack of environmental management has led to the low development and utilization of water resources in western china due to the abuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides the area of soil erosion has increased and the sewage treatment fails to meet the standard some water bodies have reached the maximum carrying capacity and the water quality has been seriously degraded seriously threatening the ecological security of water on the other hand the economic development in northwest china is relatively slow and there is a lack of sufficient investment in environmental governance and scientific waste water treatment facilities as a result the pollution of water resources is increasingly aggravated and the available amount of water resources is further reduced the development and utilization capacity of water resources in eastern and central china are good guangdong zhejiang and anhui have the highest scores this region has a relatively high level of social development urban and industrial water use is higher than agricultural water use the sewage treatment facilities are relatively advanced and the efficiency of water resource reuse is relatively high the development and utilization of water resources in the central and northeastern regions are also relatively high on the whole the daily treatment capacity of sewage treatment plants the reuse rate of industrial water and the treatment rate of urban sewage in each province have all been significantly improved compared with previous years and the water system management has gradually become more scientific and perfected summaries affected by economic development natural geographical conditions and other factors the spatial distributions of the water resource balance capacity water resource pressure and driving force and water resource development and utilization capacity are significantly different and the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources has certain regularity in geographical space 4 analysis of the spatial effect of the comprehensive water resource carrying capacity in chinese provinces 4 1 analysis of the spatial correlation results before constructing the spatial durbin model the spatial autocorrelation of the model was first tested in this paper the global autocorrelation and local autocorrelation are reflected by the moran index 4 1 1 global moran index the global moran index from 2010 to 2016 calculated by stata software is shown in table 3 as seen from table 3 the moran index values of the three models mostly passed the significance test the moran index values of the water resource balance ability models are all greater than 0 1 and the significance test shows that since 2010 the water resource balance ability of each province in china has shown obvious spatial autocorrelation that is the water resource balance ability of a region is affected by the water resource balance abilities of neighboring regions the moran index of the water stress and driving force model and the water resources development and utilization capacity model are both greater than zero and passed the test at the 10 significance level indicating that since 2010 water resources have been under pressure and driving forces the development and utilization capacity has a spatial positive autocorrelation that is the pressure and driving force and the development and utilization capacity of water resources within a certain region will be affected by those of neighboring regions the three types of scores do not show a random distribution in space but instead exhibit a spatial agglomeration state therefore a spatial durbin model can be introduced to explore the correlation and heterogeneity of the spatial distribution 4 1 2 local moran index fig 3 1 to 3 show the local moran index scatter diagrams of the resource balance capacity water resource pressure and driving force and water resource development and utilization capacity in various regions of china in 2016 note that numbers 1 to 30 in order represent beijing tianjin hebei shanxi inner mongolia liaoning jilin heilongjiang shanghai jiangsu zhejiang anhui fujian jiangxi shandong henan hubei hunan guangdong guangxi hainan chongqing sichuan guizhou yunnan shaanxi gansu qinghai ningxia and xinjiang the water balance local moran scatter diagram fig 3 1 shows that in the first quadrant including the provinces of henan yunnan zhejiang fujian jiangxi hubei anhui hunan guangxi guangdong and jiangsu the water resource balance ability of these province is higher and that of the surrounding provinces is also higher showing a high high aggregation along with a positive local moran index correspondingly the provinces in the third quadrant are beijing tianjin ningxia qinghai shanxi shaanxi liaoning and gansu the water resource carrying capacities of these provinces are low and those of the surrounding provinces are also low showing a low low aggregation state the local moran index is also positive other provinces are distributed in the second and fourth quadrants which share a common characteristic the levels of water resource balance capacity in these provinces are opposite to those of surrounding areas and they all show high low aggregation or low high aggregation their local moran index values are negative showing a negative spatial correlation the water pressure and driving force local moran scatter diagram fig 3 2 shows that in the first quadrant including the provinces of zhejiang fujian yunnan henan guangxi jiangsu guangdong anhui hunan and hubei the driving forces from the pressure on water resources and the scores are higher and the surrounding areas also show higher states with the distribution characterized by a high value concentration and a positive local moran index correspondingly the scores of beijing tianjin qinghai ningxia shanxi and liaoning are low and the scores of the surrounding provinces are also low showing low low aggregation with the local moran index also being positive the rest of the provinces are distributed in the first and third quadrants the score results of these region are opposite to those of the surrounding regions showing high low aggregation or high low aggregation the local moran index values of these provinces are negative the local moran scatter plot of the water resource development and utilization capacity fig 3 3 shows that zhejiang yunnan henan guangxi fujian anhui hunan hubei jiangsu and guangdong are in the first quadrant the ability for the development and utilization of water resources in these provinces is relatively good the scores are higher and the scores of the surrounding areas are is higher showing a high high aggregation state with a positive local moran index beijing tianjin ningxia qinghai shanxi and liaoning are located in the third quadrant the water resource development and utilization capacities of these provinces are poor the scores are low and the scores of the surrounding areas are low showing low low aggregation the remaining provinces are located in the first and third quadrants in which the results of the region are opposite to those of the surrounding areas showing high low aggregation or low high aggregation so the local moran index values are negative 4 2 analysis of the spatial durbin model results according to the spatial durbin model constructed in the previous part of this paper based on the geographic distance matrix of the 30 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions the model was estimated and tested using the extended functions of stata the model estimation results are shown in appendix 1 to appendix 5 4 2 1 the estimation results of the water resource balance ability model before the spatial model estimation an ordinary panel estimation was first carried out appendix 1 shows that most of the variables passed the significance test and the goodness of fit was 0 783 the hausman test shows that the results cannot reject the null hypothesis of random effects therefore the random effect spatial durbin model has a goodness of fit of 0 868 which is higher than that of the normal panel estimation results indicating that the spatial durbin model is more reasonable the coefficient and its lagging term estimate reflect the influence of various variables on the region and surrounding areas the coefficient estimation result for the annual precipitation is positive and it passed the significance test indicating that the higher is the degree of annual precipitation the higher is the water resource balance ability moreover the spatial lag term passed the significance test at the level of 5 indicating that the annual precipitation in surrounding areas will have a positive impact on the water resource balance ability of this region the estimated results of the total water supply and per capita water consumption are positive the significance test at the 1 level shows that the levels of the total water supply and per capita water consumption in this region will directly affect the balance capacity of water resources in this region and the effect is positive the coefficient for domestic water is positive and the significance test at the 5 level shows that the effect of domestic water on the balance capacity of water resources is positive in addition the lagging coefficients for the water saving irrigation area and industrial water use are positive and the significance test at the 1 level shows that increases of the water saving irrigation area and industrial water use in surrounding areas will improve the balance capacity of the region the lagging term for agricultural water is negative and the significance test at the 1 level shows that the increase of agricultural water in surrounding areas will reduce the balance capacity of the region the direct and indirect effects of each factor are obtained by the effect decomposition of the spatial durbin model appendix 1 shows that the direct effects of the annual precipitation total water supply and per capita water consumption are positive and they have positive effects on improving the regional balance capacity as shown through the significance test at the 1 level the direct effect of domestic water is positive and the significance level test at the 10 level also indicates that it plays a positive role in improving the balance capacity of the region the indirect effects of the water saving irrigation area agricultural water and industrial water all passed the significance test at the 1 level according to the coefficient the two factors have positive effects on the balance capacity of the surrounding areas the indirect effect of the annual precipitation and domestic water consumption passed the significance test at the levels of 5 and 10 respectively and the coefficients were positive indicating that the two factors have a positive effect on the balance capacity of the surrounding areas to some extent 4 2 2 the estimation results of the water resource pressure and driving force model the hausman test results show that prob c h i 2 0 the null hypothesis of the random effects model is rejected thus fitting the fixed effect space to the durbin model it can be seen from appendix 2 to appendix 4 that the goodness of fit values of the individual effect time effect and individual time doubled fixed effect models are 0 484 0 815 and 0 311 respectively it can be seen that the spatial durbin model with time fixed effects has a good fit it is more conducive to explaining the relationship between variables so the results are analyzed by the time fixed effect model the estimated values of the coefficients and lags are shown in appendix 3 the affected area energy consumption and ratio of the protected area to the area under the jurisdiction all passed the significance test at the 1 level it can be seen from the positive or negative value of the coefficients that the areas affected by disasters and the energy consumption are directly related to the pressure and driving forces of water resources the resulting positive effect indicates that the higher are the areas affected by the disaster and the energy consumption the greater is the pressure on the water resource system and the more vulnerable is the water system to damage the coefficient of the protected area relative to the total area under the jurisdiction is negative which proves that when the protected area is larger the pressure on the water system is less the coefficient of the contribution rate of the tertiary industry is negative and the saliency test at the 5 level indicates that regions with relatively fast economic development and dense industries in the third industry will be under lower pressure and driving forces from the perspective of the estimated results of lag items the affected area energy consumption and ratio of protected area to the area under the jurisdiction all passed the significance test at the 10 level and the coefficients are negative which indicates that in areas surrounding the affected area the energy consumption and conservation area proportion will have a negative impact on the water pressure and driving force in addition the estimation results of the individual fixed effect and bidirectional fixed effect can also yield the same conclusion which verifies the reliability of the conclusion the result of spatial durbin model is decomposed by effect appendix 3 shows that the direct effects from the affected area energy consumption contribution rate of the tertiary industry and proportion of protected area all tested at the 1 level according to the coefficient the areas affected by disaster and the energy consumption have positive impacts on the pressure and driving force while the contribution rate of the tertiary industry and the area ratio of the protected area are negatively correlated with the pressure and driving force from the indirect effect the indirect effect coefficients of energy consumption and the proportion of the protected area tested at the 10 significance level and the energy consumption has a positive impact on the pressure and driving force of the surrounding area while the proportion of protected area has a negative impact 4 2 3 the estimation results of the water resource development and utilization capacity model before the model fitting a significance test was carried out for the variables and two nonsignificant variables namely the green coverage rate of the built up area and the ecological environment water replenishment were excluded the results of the ordinary panel regression show that the goodness of fit is 0 204 while the goodness of fit of the spatial durbin model is 0 368 which is higher than the results of the ols estimation so the fitting of the spatial model is more consistent with the reality the hausman test results show that prob c h i 2 0 881 indicating that the hypothesis that the model is a random effect cannot be rejected so the random effect model should be fitted the estimated results of the coefficient and lag terms are shown in appendix 5 the coefficients of the forest coverage rate and environmental pollution investment ratio are positive and both pass the significance test at the 1 level indicating that they have a positive effect on the development and utilization ability of water resources the coefficient of the new soil erosion area is negative and the significance test at the 10 level shows that this variable has a negative effect on the development and utilization capacity of water resources in addition the sewage treatment capacity will also have a negative impact on the development and utilization of water resources to a certain extent from the perspective of the estimated results of variable lag items the estimated results of the proportion of investment in environmental pollution control relative to the gdp and the soil erosion area increase in the current year are negative and passed the significance test at the 10 level which shows that the proportion of investment in environmental pollution control relative to the gdp and the soil erosion area increase in the current year in the surrounding area will have negative impacts on the development and utilization of water resources in the region the result of spatial durbin model is decomposed by effect showing that the estimated results of the forest coverage rate and environmental pollution investment proportion pass the 1 level of significance test and it can be seen from the coefficient that both have a positive direct impact on the development and utilization capacity of water resources the sewage treatment capacity of treatment plants and the soil erosion area increase in the current year are negative and they also passed the significance test indicating that they have a negative direct effect on the development and utilization capacity of water resources from the perspective of indirect effects only the estimated value of the soil erosion area increase in the current year passed the significance test at the 10 level indicating that the soil erosion area increase in the current year in this region has a negative effect on the development and utilization ability of water resources in surrounding areas summaries the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources has spatial interaction effects the direct effect is that the carrying capacity factors of the region will affect the carrying capacity of this region the spillover effect is that the carrying capacity factors of the region will have positive or negative effects on the surrounding areas and the spatial effect is obvious 5 discussion and analysis 5 1 comparative analysis of this paper and existing research in this paper the catastrophe progression method is used to calculate the carrying capacity scores of chinese provinces then by constructing the spatial durbin model the direct and indirect effects of the carrying capacity are analyzed by comparing the results of this study with previous studies it was found that the conclusions obtained are similar and there are also large differences in the evaluation of the water resource carrying capacity this paper and those by liu et al 2011 jia et al 2018 and zhao et al 2017 found that china s water resources are unevenly distributed and the water resources in the eastern coastal areas are more balanced but the development and utilization degree is relatively high the carrying capacity growth potential is low the water resources in the northwestern region are seriously lacking the carrying capacity has been gradually depleted and the water resource utilization basically follows an east high and low west trend however liu et al 2011 found that the development potential of southwestern china is relatively high while the eastern region has no carrying capacity advantage but the research in this paper shows that the eastern part of china has a stronger balance ability higher development and utilization and lower pressure as well as that its relative carrying capacity is relatively high this difference is mainly because liu et al 2011 believe that higher levels of water resource development and utilization makes the regional water resource carrying capacity smaller and that the improvement potential is weak this paper is based on the three aspects that allow comprehensive consideration of the status of the water resource carrying capacity not just the development and utilization of water resources concerning the influencing factors of the water resource carrying capacity this paper and those by zhao et al 2017 and yan et al 2018 have shown that the per capita water consumption urban sewage treatment rate ecological environment quality and population have greater impacts on the carrying capacity at the same time the variable contribution rate of the tertiary industry used in this paper and the per capita gdp used in other studies indicate the economic development status and each study shows that the economic development status is also one of the main influencing factors of the carrying capacity in addition to the above research conclusions this paper also finds that the proportion of energy consumption and environmental pollution investment will also have a greater impact on the water resource carrying capacity mainly due to the increase of environmental pollution in china and the government s investment in environmental governance in recent years these two factors have an increasing impact on the water resource carrying capacity and in the future over a long period of time environmental pollution and environmental governance input will have a more dramatic impact on the water resource carrying capacity 5 2 the reference significance of this paper the research object of this paper is the carrying capacity of water resources in addition to water resources the research object of the carrying capacity can be expanded to cover a wider range of study objects such as land carrying capacity ecological carrying capacity ocean carrying capacity etc which are also hot areas of academic concern with the continuous growth of the population research on carrying capacities has also been gradually extended to transportation city tourism and other aspects the research ideas in this paper provide a reference for research on carrying capacities in other fields although the research object of this paper is the carrying capacity of water resources in china s provinces the research in this paper has good reference significance for other countries and regions with uneven distributions of water resources in addition to china there are many countries in the world with uneven spatial distributions of water resources a characteristic which has an important impact on regional economic and social development an in depth analysis of the regional water resource carrying capacity is conducive to the formulation of water resource management policies in various countries from the perspective of research methods the spatial durbin model used in this paper can present the direct and indirect relations of various variables in a scientific and reasonable manner the model added the location as an important factor in the analysis and the interpretation of the obtained conclusion is no longer reliant on the variables of a single relation but involves evaluation on the basis of considering the spatial lag items the overall effects are decomposed into direct effects and spillover effects which provides new enlightenment for the study of the influencing factors of the research object the adjacent multi region association study can use the space model to better explore whether the spatial position will affect the explanatory variables 5 3 the future research direction of this paper it should be noted that due to the limitation of data availability this paper did not take into account the actual climate temperature and other natural conditions of each province when selecting the factors affecting the carrying capacity of water resources and the index system constructed needs to be improved which may have some impact on the research conclusions of this paper in future studies this research will pay more attention to the selection of variables and their precise quantification to enhance the accuracy of the results 6 conclusions and suggestions 6 1 the main conclusions of this paper this paper takes the comprehensive water resource carrying capacity of chinese provinces as the research core and the research content includes the evaluation of the water resource carrying capacity and the spatial effects the detailed conclusions of this study are shown in appendix 6 the main conclusions are as follows first from the perspective of the spatial distribution there are significant regional differences in the water resource balance capacity pressure and driving force and development and utilization capacity the balance abilities of central china and coastal areas of east china are relatively good while the balance abilities of north china and northwest china are relatively weak in the arid areas and these areas are under high pressure and driving forces facing severe resource allocation problems from the perspective of development and utilization the development and utilization capacities of east china and central china are relatively good while those of the corresponding southwest and northwest regions are relatively weak from the three considered aspects the eastern coastal areas and the economically and technically developed area of southern china have strong resource carrying capacities which shows a high balance and development and utilization capacity and are under low pressure and driving forces however northwest and north china suffer from higher pressure and lower balance ability and development and utilization ability and this region has more severe problems in terms of resource allocation second the water supply and water demand affect the balance of water resources the total precipitation and water supply will not only promote the balance of water resources in the region but will also improve the balance of the surrounding areas to a certain extent the increase of agricultural and industrial water consumption will promote the resource balance capacity of surrounding areas in different periods the available water supply and actual water demand are constantly changing and the relationship between them is also variable the balance between supply and demand of water resources is only relative and the imbalance between them always exists we need to constantly adjust the supply and demand to achieve a dynamic relative balance third the pressure and driving forces of water resources mainly depend on the degree of environmental pollution and economic development areas with severe environmental pollution of water resources frequent disasters and arid climates will be under greater pressure for water resources while economically developed and densely populated areas will have greater demands for water resources and thus be more driven energy consumption and the proportion of protected areas will produce a spillover effect and higher energy consumption and a lower proportion of protected area will place surrounding areas under greater pressure and driving force fourth the development and utilization capacity of water resources is affected by the forest coverage rate environmental management input and soil erosion control in the development and utilization status of multiple factors the forest coverage rate and the maximum effect of environmental protection investment a high forest coverage rate and degree of environmental governance investment will promote the development and utilization of water resources and the increase of water loss and soil erosion control areas will reduce the excessive development of water resources thus restoring the ecological environment in terms of spatial spillover effects the newly added area of soil erosion control in the current year will not only promote the ecological recovery of this region but will also play a positive role in the ecological protection of neighboring regions 6 2 policy and recommendations first focus should be placed on solving the problem of large differences in the balance of water resources among regions in the future due to the impact of the natural environment and high intensity human activities the water resources in the north may be further reduced while those in the south will be further increased aggravating the difference in the balance of water resources between the north and the south to alleviate the regional differences in water resources the feasibility of the south to north water diversion project should be accelerated the government should support the project increase investment in science and technology and provide technical support at the same time since each province is different in terms of economy population climate and other aspects the government should take corresponding measures according to the actual situation of each province adjust measures to local conditions centralize governance by province and region and improve the efficiency of water resource allocation second water resource pressure should be reduced by improving water quality and promoting recycling improving the ability of routine and emergency support of water resources flood utilization water pollution response and drought resistance and disaster prevention will play a positive role in reducing the pressure on water resources water resources play an important role in economic and social development the quality of water resources has a direct impact on economic development we should accelerate the adjustment of the industrial structure change the mode of economic growth and establish a water saving circular economy model third to improve the efficiency of water resource development and utilization measures should be taken toward the improvement of the water structure and the improvement of the sewage treatment capacity on the one hand china s agricultural water consumption is relatively large through increasing industrial energy emission reductions china promotes water saving irrigation technology encourages the research and development of new technologies and production processes improves the reuse rate of industrial water raises citizens awareness of water conservation and improves the supervision and management mechanisms of water resources on the other hand the discharge of sewage and waste water is an obstacle in the process of improving the development and utilization of water resources the government should strengthen the effective monitoring of industrial sewage discharge strictly regulate the sewage treatment process and realize the effective treatment of sewage and waste water from the perspective of sustainable development it is necessary to combine soil and water loss control with resource development and utilization emphasize the equal importance of ecological recovery benefits and economic benefits and achieve scientific control at high levels with high efficiency and environmental friendliness fourth the spatial correlation spillover and heterogeneity should be fully considered in solving water resource problems this paper shows that china s regional water resource carrying capacity has obvious spatial agglomeration and spatial spillover effects when factors such as economic growth the water resource supply and demand natural disasters and climate change affect the water resource situation in this region they will produce spillover effects to some extent which will cause mutual influence and interaction among provinces in the future to focus on solving the complex problems concerning the water environment it is necessary to curb the unreasonable demand for water promote the formation of a mechanism through which water resource factors will upgrade the economic and social production mode and industrial structure accelerate the construction of a new pattern of water resource management and strengthen regional cooperation and exchanges declaration of competing

6379,there has been a series of water resource problems such as imbalances of the water supply and demand and serious water pollution in china it is important for the chinese government to formulate a sustainable development strategy for water resources and to effectively guarantee the national water resource security this paper divides the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources into the following three aspects the water resource balance capacity the water resource pressure and driving force and the water resource development and utilization capacity taking 31 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions of china as research objects the catastrophe progression method is adopted to evaluate the comprehensive carrying capacity of interprovincial water resources in china from 2010 to 2016 the direct effects and spatial spillover effects of different factors on water resources are discussed by constructing a spatial durbin model sdm the results show that there are obvious spatial differences in the water resource balance ability pressure and driving force and development and utilization ability the spatial distribution follows a decreasing trend from east to west and from south to north the water supply water demand investment in environmental management economic development and balance of the ecosystem have obvious direct effects on the carrying capacity of water resources the spatial spillover effect of the water supply and demand energy consumption the proportion of protected areas and the newly increased areas of soil erosion control are significant and will have a strong impact on the water resource carrying capacity of surrounding areas the conclusion of this paper can provide a reference for the government in making water resource management policies keywords water resources comprehensive carrying capacity spatial effect china 1 introduction 1 1 research background at present global water security is facing increasing challenges safeguarding water security and achieving the 2030 united nations sustainable development water related goals have become a common vision of all countries in the world although china is rich in total water resources due to its large population base and serious water and environmental pollution its per capita water resources are less than 2400 m3 which is only 1 4 of the world s per capita water resources and the country is suffering from extreme water shortages among the more than 600 cities in china more than 400 have an insufficient water supply and the total water shortage in cities is as high as 6 billion m3 protection of water resource 360 wikipedia 2019 at the same time the development and utilization efficiency of water resources in china is low and the total amount of industrial water is five or even ten times higher than that in developed countries however the reuse rate of industrial water is only 20 to 30 which is far lower than the standard for developed countries water pollution is serious and nearly 50 of the water quality monitored in key cities does not meet the drinking water standards current situation and prevention of water pollution in china water pollution 2019 from the perspective of spatial distribution the distribution of water resources in china is extremely mismatched with the land and productivity showing the overall distribution characteristic of a greater amount in the south than in the north as for north of the yangtze river basin it s area accounts for 63 5 of the country s total area while the amount of water resources accounts for only 19 of the country s total water resources the natural fresh water resources in the southwest and southeast china provide 610 billion m3 year accounting for 71 of the total fresh water in china while the six provinces in northwest china account for approximately 30 of the country s total area but have only 15 of the country s water resources water 2019 at the same time the precipitation distribution in china shows a general trend of decreasing from the southeast coast to the northwest inland the annual precipitation in southeast china is mostly more than 1600 mm while that in taiwan is as high as 3000 mm and that in northwest china is less than 400 mm the precipitation in the xinjiang tarim basin the qaidam basin and many other marginal areas which are in an extremely arid zones is less than 20 mm china s annual precipitation spatial distribution characteristics baidu know 2019 in the context of the increasingly frequent floods and droughts in china and the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources across the country it is of great significance to study the carrying capacity of water resources in different regions of china to solve the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources and to improve the problem of water resource shortage 1 2 literature review the carrying capacity of water resources refers to the maximum scale of population economy society and other aspects that can be carried by water resources in a certain region under the premise of sustainable development with the guarantee of the existing social and economic development level shi and qu 1992 at present research on the carrying capacity of water resources involves the evaluation and prediction of the carrying capacity and the factors influencing the carrying capacity research on water resource carrying capacity evaluation mainly focuses on three aspects the urban scale ait aoudiab and berezowska azzag 2014 wang et al 2018 the regional scale dou et al 2015 harris 1999 kisakye and bruggen 2018 and the basin scale matrosov et al 2015 peterson 2002 urban scale research focuses on a specific urban area and a number of urban groups with similar water distribution characteristics studies at the regional scale examine the water resources of some parts of the country such as the eastern central or western areas or certain provinces from the perspectives of economy terrain humanities and climate studies at the basin scale set the study area as within a circle surrounded by watersheds in hydrogeography these specific river catchments are considered to have similar hydrological characteristics areas with larger basin areas have richer water volumes and the yangtze river basin and the pearl river basin have become hot spots in china s water resource research in general the research scale of the water resource carrying capacity is similar in terms of geographical conditions natural climate economic society and culture no matter whether conducted in cities regions or basins the conclusions obtained from the empirical analysis of these similar areas are well targeted which can facilitate planning water resources according to the actual situation of the region and improve the efficiency of water resource management a small number of scholars have studied the water resource carrying capacity on a national scale jia et al 2018 yao et al 2019 and obtained the coordination relationship between the overall economic status ecological development and water resources studies involving the evaluation of the national water resource carrying capacity have all indicated that there are significant differences in the carrying capacity between different regions and narrowing the differences in carrying capacity between neighboring regions is a key problem to be solved there are many methods for the carrying capacity evaluation of water resources and with the continuous expansion of the research field the research methods have become more diversified the traditional carrying capacity evaluation methods including the comprehensive index evaluation method magri and berezowska azzag 2018 widodo et al 2015 multiple objective decision method zheng 2019 principal component analysis zhang et al 2019 topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method li et al 2019 zyoud et al 2016 etc although these methods are objective and involve distinct simple and convenient calculation indexes it is difficult to determine the elements involved and the interaction between the dynamic change processes of the carrying capacity with the deepening of research existing studies have paid more attention to the combination of theory and carrying capacity calculation emphasizing the theoretical basis of empirical analysis the system dynamics method wang et al 2018 slesser 1990 fiddaman 2002 ecological footprint method veettil and mishra 2016 sun et al 2017 catastrophe progression method jia et al 2018 and projection pursuit method yu and lu 2018 zhang and dong 2009 are some of the research methods used in recent years these methods attempt to explain the connotations of system development and simulate the evolution process and feedback mechanism of the ecosystem taking into account the internal relations of various factors the application of these methods to the research of water resource carrying capacity can enrich the theoretical background of the research and the conclusions obtained are more convincing some scholars have also adopted the analytic hierarchy process entropy weight determination method gray correlation topsis method and other composite methods zyoud et al 2016 wu et al 2018 for carrying capacity evaluation these methods combine subjective and objective observations as well as quantitative and qualitative measurements making up for the inherent defects of single methods in carrying capacity evaluation in recent years with the constant updating of econometric theories the var model logistic set pair analysis model and other economic models have also been applied in the field of resource management to reflect the relationship between the resource carrying capacity and economic and social development breaking through the limitations of traditional research methods of carrying capacity tian and sun 2018 mitchell 1999 thus it can be seen that the research of water resource carrying capacity has experienced a development process from simple to complex constantly emphasizing the internal mechanisms of the complex system in general existing reports have described good studies on the evaluation of water resource carrying capacity which has strongly promoted research progress concerning water resource carrying capacity however existing studies still have the following limitations first most of the research subjects only cover some areas and there are few comparative studies of multiple regions at the national level most of the research objects for water resource carrying capacity are local areas such as the western central and northeastern provinces as well as specific urban groups such as the pearl river delta the yangtze river delta the beijing tianjin hebei region etc these studies cannot make a comparative analysis from the national level and the result can only reflect the status of a particular region of water resources while reference values regarding national water policy formulation are rare second the index system needs to be further improved most of existing studies adopted the system theory method or the pressure state response model while some scholars have selected indexes from the perspective of system theory and divided them into the sublevels of economy society and ecology as a whole rijiberman and van de venb 2000 simonovic and davies 2001 wu et al 2018 other scholars used the pressure state response model psr to divide the indicator levels wang et al 2019 bai and tang 2010 these two traditional methods divide the indicator system into independent sublevels and fail to take into account the interrelation between the indicators the overall indicator construction has a lack of scientific nature and has not yet formed a relatively complete system third the influencing factors of the water resource carrying capacity need to be further analyzed most existing studies have measured and evaluated the regional water resource carrying capacity well but few have made systematic analyses of various factors affecting the water resource carrying capacity some studies scored the carrying capacity of the same region in different times to determine the dynamic changes of the bearing capacity of a specific region and make longitudinal comparisons over time zhang et al 2019 lu et al 2017 in others the bearing capacity was considered from the perspective of the spatial layout and the differences in water resource carrying capacity between different geographical locations were investigated for horizontal comparison jia et al 2018 kuzdas et al 2016 however there are some factors influencing the carrying capacity of water resources which need further analysis 1 3 the main work and innovations of this paper based on the existing research status this paper evaluates the ability to balance water resources the pressure and driving forces of water resources and the development and utilization ability of water resources in chinese provinces on this basis considering the impact of geographical location on the carrying capacity of water resources the effects of each factor are divided into direct effects and indirect effects compared with the existing research the main work and innovations of this paper are mainly reflected in the following aspects first taking china s interprovincial water resource carrying capacity as the core of this research the differences between water resources in different provinces and regions are analyzed from the national level in this paper the catastrophe progression theory is used to evaluate the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources in each province the evaluation results can visually show the water resource carrying capacity corresponding to different geographical regions which is beneficial to the regulation of resource allocation from the macro level and to reducing the differences between provinces and it can provide a reference for the formulation of policies such as the cross regional mobilization of water resources second a comprehensive evaluation system for water resources is constructed by combining the classification method of the system theory with the pressure state response model psr the comprehensive evaluation system is constructed by selecting indexes from three sublevels of the ability to achieve water resource balance the water resource pressure and driving force and the water resource development and utilization ability the indexes of these three sublevels are selected according to the classification methods of the system theory and the psr model and the water resource situation in china is presented from different perspectives in consideration of the environmental pollution caused by greenhouse gas emissions variable energy consumption was added in this paper to seek the impact of climate change on water resources and further explore the influencing factors of the water resource carrying capacity compared with previous studies the new system construction standards and newly added variables make the whole index layer more comprehensive third the spatial panel model is introduced into the study of the factors affecting the carrying capacity of water resources based on the geographical weight matrix the direct and indirect effects of different variables on the carrying capacity of water resources are discussed and their internal relations are analyzed from the perspective of spatial autocorrelation through the transfer of explanatory variables and explained variable spatial lag terms the correlation between the water resource carrying capacity and influencing factors in various regions was clarified the overall research process of this paper is shown in fig 1 the rest of this paper is arranged as follows the second section includes the method introduction and data source the third section provides the results analysis for china s interprovincial water resource carrying capacity the fourth section contains the results analysis for the spatial effect of china s comprehensive water resource carrying capacity the fifth section includes the discussion and analysis and the last section provides the main conclusions and policy suggestions 2 research methods and data sources 2 1 evaluation system for the water resource comprehensive carrying capacity according to the principles of the systematic nature typicality and comparability of index selection the availability of data is also taken into consideration on the basis of previous studies this paper selects 22 evaluation indexes from the three sublevels of water resource balance capacity water resource pressure and driving force and water resource development and utilization capacity to build an evaluation system for the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources and determines the weight of each index using the gray correlation rule the index system is shown in table 1 2 2 evaluation model for the comprehensive water resource carrying capacity grey correlation catastrophe progression method the catastrophe theory studies the qualitative change processes of natural phenomena and the continuous interruption of various social activities describing phenomena and general laws the catastrophe progression method was researched and developed on the basis of the catastrophe theory it takes the potential function f x as the research object and describes the mutation through state variables and external parameters the system bifurcation set equation can be solved by the combination of the critical point equation and the singular point solution equation variables in the bifurcation set will cause the potential function to mutate since the units of the variables are not uniform the normalization formula needs to be derived the catastrophe progression model and normalization formula this paper used are shown in table 2 in this paper the initial weight of each index is determined by the grey relational analysis method and the index layers are sorted reasonably a measure of the degree of association between two systems that varies from time to time or from object to object is called the degree of association in the process of system development if the trend of the two factors changes that is the degree of synchronous change is higher it can be said that the degree of correlation between the two is higher otherwise it is lower therefore the grey correlation analysis method is based on the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between the development trends of factors that is the grey correlation degree as a method to measure the degree of association between factors the basic steps are as follows 1 the original index matrix is formula 1 1 x x ij m n 2 the data normalization processing uses formula 2 2 x ij x ij min x j max x j min x j 3 the grey correlation coefficient can be calculated by formula 3 3 r ij min n min m x 0 j x ij ρ max n max m x 0 j x ij x 0 j x ij ρ max n max m x 0 j x ij in formula 3 x 0 is the reference sequence and ρ is the resolution coefficient usually assigned as 0 5 4 the weight formula is shown as formula 4 4 w j 1 n i 1 n rij then the index weight vector 5 is obtained 5 w w 1 w 2 w n t each indicator is sorted by importance according to its weight 5 the normalized formula is derived from the bifurcation set equation of the mutation system 6 comprehensive scoring was conducted according to the normalized formula there are two main criteria for scoring if the effects of each control variable can complement each other take the average and if the role of each control variable cannot be defined the value shall be determined according to the principle of the minimax choice 2 3 spatial effect model of the comprehensive water resources carrying capacity spatial panel durbin model the first law of geography says that all things are related but two things that are closer are more strongly related in the study of interprovincial issues we usually believe that there is a close relationship between provinces and that neighboring provinces are more closely related chen 2014 the spatial econometric model can provide a reference for studying spatial direct effects and spillover effects 2 3 1 construction of the space weight matrix the first premise of space analysis is to construct a space weight matrix if there are n regions and the distance between two regions is denoted as wij then the space weighted matrix w can be defined as formula 6 6 w w 11 w 1 n w n 1 w nn the distance between two regions can use the adjacency matrix geographic distance matrix economic distance matrix geo economic distance matrix etc the matrix used in this paper is the geographic distance matrix 2 3 2 spatial autocorrelation global and local moran index in determining whether the spatial econometric model can be used it is necessary to examine the spatial dependence the most common indicator is the moran index the calculation formula is shown in eq 7 7 i i 1 n j 1 n wij xi x xj x s 2 i 1 n j 1 n wij the local moran index examines the spatial agglomeration around region i and the calculation formula is shown in eq 8 8 ii x i x s 2 i 1 n w i j xj x the moran index i is generally between 1 and 1 where a value greater than zero means a positive autocorrelation high value phase aggregation and low value phase aggregation a value less than zero indicates a negative autocorrelation and that high values are adjacent to low values if the moran index is close to zero it means that there is no spatial correlation that is the spatial distribution is random 2 3 3 spatial durbin model early studies on spatial models show that when individuals are spatially dependent spatial lag or spatial error terms may be included in the panel model which respectively constitute the spatial lag model and the spatial error model kelley pace et al 1998 griffith 2000 driscoll and kraay 1998 hordijk 1979 the principle of the spatial lag model is the same as that of the time lag model intuitively the explained variables of adjacent regions may depend on each other and eventually form a balanced result for the consideration of competition or game the governments of different regions will consider the level of surrounding regions when formulating their local policies however the spatial error model reflects the spatial dependence through the error term which means that the omitted variables that are not included in x but have an impact on y have a spatial correlation or the random shocks that cannot be observed have a spatial correlation these two cases consider the space lag and space error respectively and these two effects may also occur simultaneously so the more general space econometric model is to use the two together the general expression of the spatial lag model slm is formula 9 9 yit ρ j 1 n ω i j y j t x i t β μ i λ i ε i t the general expression of the spatial error model sem is formula 10 10 yit x i t β μ i i γ i λ ϖ i ε i v i t in formula 10 yit represents the endogenous variable of the unit i in the period t xit represents the exogenous variable of the unit i in the period t ϖ i j represents the spatial weight matrix ρ measures the interaction between two exogenous variables β represents the corresponding coefficient x variable μ represents the individual effect λ represents the time effect and ε is the random error term in general the spatial model will be preliminarily determined according to the lagrange multiplier test however due to problems involving data measurement errors and environmental uncertainty misjudgment may occur therefore more scholars choose the general and universal spatial durbin model sdm which contains the spatial lag term of the interpreted variables as well as the spatial lag term of the explanatory variables the general form of the spatial durbin model is formula 11 11 yit ρ j 1 n ω i j y j t x i t β γ j 1 n ω i j x j t μ i λ i ε i t the corresponding coefficient variable x is expressed by γ in eq 11 in this paper the balance capacity of water resources the pressure and driving force of water resources and the development and utilization capacity of water resources are discussed respectively therefore three models are constructed for the spatial analysis of effects to respectively discuss the influence of these three factors and their direct effects and indirect effects water resource balance capacity model the water resource balance capacity is affected by eight factors including the annual precipitation per capita water resource amount total water supply per capita water consumption water saving irrigation area agricultural water industrial water and domestic water which are represented by x 1 x 8 respectively the model is shown in formula 12 12 y it ρ j 1 n ω ij y jt x 1 i t β 1 γ 1 j 1 n ω ij x 1 j t

affected area energy consumption natural rate of population growth contribution rate of the tertiary industry gdp growth rate and the total protected area in the area of jurisdiction which are represented by x 1 x 6 respectively the model is shown in formula 13 13 yit ρ j 1 n ω i j y j t x 1 i t β 1 γ 1 j 1 n ω i j x 1 j t x 2 i t β 2 γ 2 j 1 n ω i j x 2 j t x 3 i t β 3 γ 3 j 1 n ω i j x 3

resource development and utilization capacity is affected by eight factors including the forest cover rate proportion of investment in environmental pollution control relative to the gdp industrial water reuse rate sewage treatment capacity of treatment plants urban sewage treatment rate green coverage rate in built up areas ecological environment hydration and soil erosion area increase in the current year which are represented by x 1 x 8 respectively the model is shown in formula 14 14 yit ρ j 1 n ω i j y j t x 1 i t β 1 γ 1 j 1 n ω i j x 1 j t x 2 i t β 2 γ 2 j 1 n ω i j x 2 j t x 3 i t β

partial derivatives were obtained for the exogenous variables of each spatial unit as shown in eq 17 17 y x 1 k l y x n k i n δ w 1 β β w in matrix 17 the mean value of the diagonal elements is the direct effect which represents the mean value of the variation of the explained variables in the region resulting in the variation of the explained variables in the region the mean value of the nondiagonal elements in the matrix is the spillover effect which represents the mean value of the variation of the explained variables in the adjacent region caused by the change of the explained variables in this region 2 4 the data source the research objects for the comprehensive water resources carrying capacity evaluation are 31 provinces cities and autonomous regions in china due to the absence of some data in tibet the spatial effect of the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources was studied in 30 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions excluding tibet the data required for this study are from the china environmental statistics yearbook from 2010 to 2016 national bureau of statistics 2018 and statistical yearbooks of various provinces from 2010 to 2016 3 analysis of the evaluation results of the comprehensive water resource carrying capacity of china s provinces the catastrophe progression method was used to obtain the 2016 comprehensive water resource carrying capacity scores of the provinces and the results are shown in fig 2 3 1 china s interprovincial water resource balance capacity the balance capacity of water resources is discussed from the perspective of supply and demand as well as the relationship between them the uneven distribution of water resources in space and time coupled with the excessive consumption of water resources by human beings leads to a sharp decline in the availability of water resources and the increasingly prominent contradiction between the supply and demand therefore it is necessary to analyze the balance between the supply and demand of water resources the water resource balance capacity of each province in china is shown in fig 2 1 the balance of water resources in china is strong in the south and east and weak in the west and north as shown in fig 2 1 the regions with the weakest water resource balance capacity are concentrated in the densely populated areas such as beijing tianjin and shanghai the western regions such as xinjiang qinghai and ningxia and the central regions such as shaanxi and shanxi which have the most serious pollution the regions with strong balance abilities are distributed in the south of guangxi hunan and guangdong east china and central china have the highest average scores while north china and northwest china have the lowest average scores on the one hand the balance of water resources in various regions will be affected by the supply level and a higher water supply will improve the balance of water resources southeast china has abundant rainfall a humid climate and relatively high total water resources in the coastal provinces so these regions have relatively strong water balance abilities data on the distribution of the population and water resources show that the population south of the yangtze river basin accounts for 54 of that in the whole country but the water resources account for 81 china s annual precipitation spatial distribution characteristics baidu know 2019 in addition due to changes of the natural environment and the high intensity of human activities the water resources in the north are further reduced aggravating the imbalance of water resources between the north and the south natural disasters and water quality can affect the balance of water resources the severe pollution in the yellow river basin coupled with the long drought in the central and western regions and the relatively backward economic development have caused an extreme shortage of water resources in shanxi shaanxi and other provinces the inland province xinjiang is quite short of water and the continuous expansion of the desert causes sandstorms and serious soil erosion resulting in the weak balance ability of water resources in xinjiang meanwhile tibet which is also a sparsely populated region has a rich water flow a small amount of sand and good water quality so it shows a strong balance ability of water resources on the other hand water resource balance capacity will be affected by the demand level and relatively low water resource demand will improve the water resource balance capacity in beijing shanghai and other regions with dense populations and industrial agglomeration excessive water use will lead to excessive demands for water resources and reduce the balance capacity of water resources the northwest region is sparsely populated and its economic activities are weak although it is in a relatively water deficient zone it does not cause strong water imbalance in addition china s water use structure is changing urban water consumption and industrial production water consumption is gradually increasing increasing the degree of demand for water resources thus aggravating the imbalance of water resources 3 2 china s interprovincial water resource pressure and driving force the pressure and driving force of water resources are evaluated comprehensively from the two aspects of pressure and driving force water resource pressure reflects the imbalance between the supply and demand caused by environmental damage and water system pollution while the driving force of water resource reflects the increase of water demand for production to meet the increase of the material demand from population growth pressure and driving forces put forward higher requirements for water resource management and resource allocation the pressure and driving forces of water resource in various provinces and regions in china are shown in fig 2 2 the pressure and driving forces of water resources in china are weak in the south and strong in the north the scores of the water resource pressure and driving force in most regions are within the range of 0 8 to 0 85 and the scores of some regions such as liaoning and zhejiang are relatively low in terms of the selected factors water resources in areas with high pollution degrees are under high pressure and driving force and most provinces with high disaster areas and energy consumption will receive a high score compared with the southern provinces the overall level of science and technology in the northern region is lower than that in the southern region and its water resources management and recovery measures need to be further improved which may lead to greater pressure on water resources water resources in xinjiang inner mongolia hubei and shandong are under high pressure and driving forces the climate in xinjiang and inner mongolia is dry and the rural population accounts for a large proportion so the ecological water use is crowded the economic and scientific and technological development is relatively backward and the water resource management system lacks technical support therefore the water ecological balance is under great pressure as a province with a large population and a large economy shandong province has a high demand for water and serious water pollution in its reservoirs as a province rich in water resources hubei province is also threatened by the pollution of water resources the eutrophication of lakes and urban inner lakes in the province is intensified more than half of the reservoirs fail to meet water quality requirements water pollution accidents occur frequently and widely which seriously damage the balance system of water resources 3 3 china s interprovincial water resource development and utilization capacity the development and utilization of water resources refers to reducing the use of water resources through reasonable technical measures based on considering the water used for production living and the ecological environment and at the same time effectively recovering and utilizing the waste water as people have not paid enough attention to the protection of water resources there have been some phenomena such as the excessive development of water resources and water waste and the water use efficiency is far lower than the international level human beings must improve the development and utilization ability of water resources through effective measures to maintain sustainable development which requires us to make a systematic evaluation of the development and utilization degree of water resources fig 2 3 shows china s interprovincial water resource development and utilization capacity overall the level of water resources development and utilization across the country is uneven as shown in fig 2 3 the development and utilization degree of water resources in china gradually increases from west to east some eastern provinces such as zhejiang score more than 0 94 while the lowest score in tibet is only 0 6 the increase in demand and the reduction of the total amount of available water resources are the essential reasons for the great importance of water resources development and utilization in addition due to the change of water structure and the excessive exploitation of groundwater there are major problems in the development and utilization of water resources in china the lack of environmental management has led to the low development and utilization of water resources in western china due to the abuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides the area of soil erosion has increased and the sewage treatment fails to meet the standard some water bodies have reached the maximum carrying capacity and the water quality has been seriously degraded seriously threatening the ecological security of water on the other hand the economic development in northwest china is relatively slow and there is a lack of sufficient investment in environmental governance and scientific waste water treatment facilities as a result the pollution of water resources is increasingly aggravated and the available amount of water resources is further reduced the development and utilization capacity of water resources in eastern and central china are good guangdong zhejiang and anhui have the highest scores this region has a relatively high level of social development urban and industrial water use is higher than agricultural water use the sewage treatment facilities are relatively advanced and the efficiency of water resource reuse is relatively high the development and utilization of water resources in the central and northeastern regions are also relatively high on the whole the daily treatment capacity of sewage treatment plants the reuse rate of industrial water and the treatment rate of urban sewage in each province have all been significantly improved compared with previous years and the water system management has gradually become more scientific and perfected summaries affected by economic development natural geographical conditions and other factors the spatial distributions of the water resource balance capacity water resource pressure and driving force and water resource development and utilization capacity are significantly different and the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources has certain regularity in geographical space 4 analysis of the spatial effect of the comprehensive water resource carrying capacity in chinese provinces 4 1 analysis of the spatial correlation results before constructing the spatial durbin model the spatial autocorrelation of the model was first tested in this paper the global autocorrelation and local autocorrelation are reflected by the moran index 4 1 1 global moran index the global moran index from 2010 to 2016 calculated by stata software is shown in table 3 as seen from table 3 the moran index values of the three models mostly passed the significance test the moran index values of the water resource balance ability models are all greater than 0 1 and the significance test shows that since 2010 the water resource balance ability of each province in china has shown obvious spatial autocorrelation that is the water resource balance ability of a region is affected by the water resource balance abilities of neighboring regions the moran index of the water stress and driving force model and the water resources development and utilization capacity model are both greater than zero and passed the test at the 10 significance level indicating that since 2010 water resources have been under pressure and driving forces the development and utilization capacity has a spatial positive autocorrelation that is the pressure and driving force and the development and utilization capacity of water resources within a certain region will be affected by those of neighboring regions the three types of scores do not show a random distribution in space but instead exhibit a spatial agglomeration state therefore a spatial durbin model can be introduced to explore the correlation and heterogeneity of the spatial distribution 4 1 2 local moran index fig 3 1 to 3 show the local moran index scatter diagrams of the resource balance capacity water resource pressure and driving force and water resource development and utilization capacity in various regions of china in 2016 note that numbers 1 to 30 in order represent beijing tianjin hebei shanxi inner mongolia liaoning jilin heilongjiang shanghai jiangsu zhejiang anhui fujian jiangxi shandong henan hubei hunan guangdong guangxi hainan chongqing sichuan guizhou yunnan shaanxi gansu qinghai ningxia and xinjiang the water balance local moran scatter diagram fig 3 1 shows that in the first quadrant including the provinces of henan yunnan zhejiang fujian jiangxi hubei anhui hunan guangxi guangdong and jiangsu the water resource balance ability of these province is higher and that of the surrounding provinces is also higher showing a high high aggregation along with a positive local moran index correspondingly the provinces in the third quadrant are beijing tianjin ningxia qinghai shanxi shaanxi liaoning and gansu the water resource carrying capacities of these provinces are low and those of the surrounding provinces are also low showing a low low aggregation state the local moran index is also positive other provinces are distributed in the second and fourth quadrants which share a common characteristic the levels of water resource balance capacity in these provinces are opposite to those of surrounding areas and they all show high low aggregation or low high aggregation their local moran index values are negative showing a negative spatial correlation the water pressure and driving force local moran scatter diagram fig 3 2 shows that in the first quadrant including the provinces of zhejiang fujian yunnan henan guangxi jiangsu guangdong anhui hunan and hubei the driving forces from the pressure on water resources and the scores are higher and the surrounding areas also show higher states with the distribution characterized by a high value concentration and a positive local moran index correspondingly the scores of beijing tianjin qinghai ningxia shanxi and liaoning are low and the scores of the surrounding provinces are also low showing low low aggregation with the local moran index also being positive the rest of the provinces are distributed in the first and third quadrants the score results of these region are opposite to those of the surrounding regions showing high low aggregation or high low aggregation the local moran index values of these provinces are negative the local moran scatter plot of the water resource development and utilization capacity fig 3 3 shows that zhejiang yunnan henan guangxi fujian anhui hunan hubei jiangsu and guangdong are in the first quadrant the ability for the development and utilization of water resources in these provinces is relatively good the scores are higher and the scores of the surrounding areas are is higher showing a high high aggregation state with a positive local moran index beijing tianjin ningxia qinghai shanxi and liaoning are located in the third quadrant the water resource development and utilization capacities of these provinces are poor the scores are low and the scores of the surrounding areas are low showing low low aggregation the remaining provinces are located in the first and third quadrants in which the results of the region are opposite to those of the surrounding areas showing high low aggregation or low high aggregation so the local moran index values are negative 4 2 analysis of the spatial durbin model results according to the spatial durbin model constructed in the previous part of this paper based on the geographic distance matrix of the 30 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions the model was estimated and tested using the extended functions of stata the model estimation results are shown in appendix 1 to appendix 5 4 2 1 the estimation results of the water resource balance ability model before the spatial model estimation an ordinary panel estimation was first carried out appendix 1 shows that most of the variables passed the significance test and the goodness of fit was 0 783 the hausman test shows that the results cannot reject the null hypothesis of random effects therefore the random effect spatial durbin model has a goodness of fit of 0 868 which is higher than that of the normal panel estimation results indicating that the spatial durbin model is more reasonable the coefficient and its lagging term estimate reflect the influence of various variables on the region and surrounding areas the coefficient estimation result for the annual precipitation is positive and it passed the significance test indicating that the higher is the degree of annual precipitation the higher is the water resource balance ability moreover the spatial lag term passed the significance test at the level of 5 indicating that the annual precipitation in surrounding areas will have a positive impact on the water resource balance ability of this region the estimated results of the total water supply and per capita water consumption are positive the significance test at the 1 level shows that the levels of the total water supply and per capita water consumption in this region will directly affect the balance capacity of water resources in this region and the effect is positive the coefficient for domestic water is positive and the significance test at the 5 level shows that the effect of domestic water on the balance capacity of water resources is positive in addition the lagging coefficients for the water saving irrigation area and industrial water use are positive and the significance test at the 1 level shows that increases of the water saving irrigation area and industrial water use in surrounding areas will improve the balance capacity of the region the lagging term for agricultural water is negative and the significance test at the 1 level shows that the increase of agricultural water in surrounding areas will reduce the balance capacity of the region the direct and indirect effects of each factor are obtained by the effect decomposition of the spatial durbin model appendix 1 shows that the direct effects of the annual precipitation total water supply and per capita water consumption are positive and they have positive effects on improving the regional balance capacity as shown through the significance test at the 1 level the direct effect of domestic water is positive and the significance level test at the 10 level also indicates that it plays a positive role in improving the balance capacity of the region the indirect effects of the water saving irrigation area agricultural water and industrial water all passed the significance test at the 1 level according to the coefficient the two factors have positive effects on the balance capacity of the surrounding areas the indirect effect of the annual precipitation and domestic water consumption passed the significance test at the levels of 5 and 10 respectively and the coefficients were positive indicating that the two factors have a positive effect on the balance capacity of the surrounding areas to some extent 4 2 2 the estimation results of the water resource pressure and driving force model the hausman test results show that prob c h i 2 0 the null hypothesis of the random effects model is rejected thus fitting the fixed effect space to the durbin model it can be seen from appendix 2 to appendix 4 that the goodness of fit values of the individual effect time effect and individual time doubled fixed effect models are 0 484 0 815 and 0 311 respectively it can be seen that the spatial durbin model with time fixed effects has a good fit it is more conducive to explaining the relationship between variables so the results are analyzed by the time fixed effect model the estimated values of the coefficients and lags are shown in appendix 3 the affected area energy consumption and ratio of the protected area to the area under the jurisdiction all passed the significance test at the 1 level it can be seen from the positive or negative value of the coefficients that the areas affected by disasters and the energy consumption are directly related to the pressure and driving forces of water resources the resulting positive effect indicates that the higher are the areas affected by the disaster and the energy consumption the greater is the pressure on the water resource system and the more vulnerable is the water system to damage the coefficient of the protected area relative to the total area under the jurisdiction is negative which proves that when the protected area is larger the pressure on the water system is less the coefficient of the contribution rate of the tertiary industry is negative and the saliency test at the 5 level indicates that regions with relatively fast economic development and dense industries in the third industry will be under lower pressure and driving forces from the perspective of the estimated results of lag items the affected area energy consumption and ratio of protected area to the area under the jurisdiction all passed the significance test at the 10 level and the coefficients are negative which indicates that in areas surrounding the affected area the energy consumption and conservation area proportion will have a negative impact on the water pressure and driving force in addition the estimation results of the individual fixed effect and bidirectional fixed effect can also yield the same conclusion which verifies the reliability of the conclusion the result of spatial durbin model is decomposed by effect appendix 3 shows that the direct effects from the affected area energy consumption contribution rate of the tertiary industry and proportion of protected area all tested at the 1 level according to the coefficient the areas affected by disaster and the energy consumption have positive impacts on the pressure and driving force while the contribution rate of the tertiary industry and the area ratio of the protected area are negatively correlated with the pressure and driving force from the indirect effect the indirect effect coefficients of energy consumption and the proportion of the protected area tested at the 10 significance level and the energy consumption has a positive impact on the pressure and driving force of the surrounding area while the proportion of protected area has a negative impact 4 2 3 the estimation results of the water resource development and utilization capacity model before the model fitting a significance test was carried out for the variables and two nonsignificant variables namely the green coverage rate of the built up area and the ecological environment water replenishment were excluded the results of the ordinary panel regression show that the goodness of fit is 0 204 while the goodness of fit of the spatial durbin model is 0 368 which is higher than the results of the ols estimation so the fitting of the spatial model is more consistent with the reality the hausman test results show that prob c h i 2 0 881 indicating that the hypothesis that the model is a random effect cannot be rejected so the random effect model should be fitted the estimated results of the coefficient and lag terms are shown in appendix 5 the coefficients of the forest coverage rate and environmental pollution investment ratio are positive and both pass the significance test at the 1 level indicating that they have a positive effect on the development and utilization ability of water resources the coefficient of the new soil erosion area is negative and the significance test at the 10 level shows that this variable has a negative effect on the development and utilization capacity of water resources in addition the sewage treatment capacity will also have a negative impact on the development and utilization of water resources to a certain extent from the perspective of the estimated results of variable lag items the estimated results of the proportion of investment in environmental pollution control relative to the gdp and the soil erosion area increase in the current year are negative and passed the significance test at the 10 level which shows that the proportion of investment in environmental pollution control relative to the gdp and the soil erosion area increase in the current year in the surrounding area will have negative impacts on the development and utilization of water resources in the region the result of spatial durbin model is decomposed by effect showing that the estimated results of the forest coverage rate and environmental pollution investment proportion pass the 1 level of significance test and it can be seen from the coefficient that both have a positive direct impact on the development and utilization capacity of water resources the sewage treatment capacity of treatment plants and the soil erosion area increase in the current year are negative and they also passed the significance test indicating that they have a negative direct effect on the development and utilization capacity of water resources from the perspective of indirect effects only the estimated value of the soil erosion area increase in the current year passed the significance test at the 10 level indicating that the soil erosion area increase in the current year in this region has a negative effect on the development and utilization ability of water resources in surrounding areas summaries the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources has spatial interaction effects the direct effect is that the carrying capacity factors of the region will affect the carrying capacity of this region the spillover effect is that the carrying capacity factors of the region will have positive or negative effects on the surrounding areas and the spatial effect is obvious 5 discussion and analysis 5 1 comparative analysis of this paper and existing research in this paper the catastrophe progression method is used to calculate the carrying capacity scores of chinese provinces then by constructing the spatial durbin model the direct and indirect effects of the carrying capacity are analyzed by comparing the results of this study with previous studies it was found that the conclusions obtained are similar and there are also large differences in the evaluation of the water resource carrying capacity this paper and those by liu et al 2011 jia et al 2018 and zhao et al 2017 found that china s water resources are unevenly distributed and the water resources in the eastern coastal areas are more balanced but the development and utilization degree is relatively high the carrying capacity growth potential is low the water resources in the northwestern region are seriously lacking the carrying capacity has been gradually depleted and the water resource utilization basically follows an east high and low west trend however liu et al 2011 found that the development potential of southwestern china is relatively high while the eastern region has no carrying capacity advantage but the research in this paper shows that the eastern part of china has a stronger balance ability higher development and utilization and lower pressure as well as that its relative carrying capacity is relatively high this difference is mainly because liu et al 2011 believe that higher levels of water resource development and utilization makes the regional water resource carrying capacity smaller and that the improvement potential is weak this paper is based on the three aspects that allow comprehensive consideration of the status of the water resource carrying capacity not just the development and utilization of water resources concerning the influencing factors of the water resource carrying capacity this paper and those by zhao et al 2017 and yan et al 2018 have shown that the per capita water consumption urban sewage treatment rate ecological environment quality and population have greater impacts on the carrying capacity at the same time the variable contribution rate of the tertiary industry used in this paper and the per capita gdp used in other studies indicate the economic development status and each study shows that the economic development status is also one of the main influencing factors of the carrying capacity in addition to the above research conclusions this paper also finds that the proportion of energy consumption and environmental pollution investment will also have a greater impact on the water resource carrying capacity mainly due to the increase of environmental pollution in china and the government s investment in environmental governance in recent years these two factors have an increasing impact on the water resource carrying capacity and in the future over a long period of time environmental pollution and environmental governance input will have a more dramatic impact on the water resource carrying capacity 5 2 the reference significance of this paper the research object of this paper is the carrying capacity of water resources in addition to water resources the research object of the carrying capacity can be expanded to cover a wider range of study objects such as land carrying capacity ecological carrying capacity ocean carrying capacity etc which are also hot areas of academic concern with the continuous growth of the population research on carrying capacities has also been gradually extended to transportation city tourism and other aspects the research ideas in this paper provide a reference for research on carrying capacities in other fields although the research object of this paper is the carrying capacity of water resources in china s provinces the research in this paper has good reference significance for other countries and regions with uneven distributions of water resources in addition to china there are many countries in the world with uneven spatial distributions of water resources a characteristic which has an important impact on regional economic and social development an in depth analysis of the regional water resource carrying capacity is conducive to the formulation of water resource management policies in various countries from the perspective of research methods the spatial durbin model used in this paper can present the direct and indirect relations of various variables in a scientific and reasonable manner the model added the location as an important factor in the analysis and the interpretation of the obtained conclusion is no longer reliant on the variables of a single relation but involves evaluation on the basis of considering the spatial lag items the overall effects are decomposed into direct effects and spillover effects which provides new enlightenment for the study of the influencing factors of the research object the adjacent multi region association study can use the space model to better explore whether the spatial position will affect the explanatory variables 5 3 the future research direction of this paper it should be noted that due to the limitation of data availability this paper did not take into account the actual climate temperature and other natural conditions of each province when selecting the factors affecting the carrying capacity of water resources and the index system constructed needs to be improved which may have some impact on the research conclusions of this paper in future studies this research will pay more attention to the selection of variables and their precise quantification to enhance the accuracy of the results 6 conclusions and suggestions 6 1 the main conclusions of this paper this paper takes the comprehensive water resource carrying capacity of chinese provinces as the research core and the research content includes the evaluation of the water resource carrying capacity and the spatial effects the detailed conclusions of this study are shown in appendix 6 the main conclusions are as follows first from the perspective of the spatial distribution there are significant regional differences in the water resource balance capacity pressure and driving force and development and utilization capacity the balance abilities of central china and coastal areas of east china are relatively good while the balance abilities of north china and northwest china are relatively weak in the arid areas and these areas are under high pressure and driving forces facing severe resource allocation problems from the perspective of development and utilization the development and utilization capacities of east china and central china are relatively good while those of the corresponding southwest and northwest regions are relatively weak from the three considered aspects the eastern coastal areas and the economically and technically developed area of southern china have strong resource carrying capacities which shows a high balance and development and utilization capacity and are under low pressure and driving forces however northwest and north china suffer from higher pressure and lower balance ability and development and utilization ability and this region has more severe problems in terms of resource allocation second the water supply and water demand affect the balance of water resources the total precipitation and water supply will not only promote the balance of water resources in the region but will also improve the balance of the surrounding areas to a certain extent the increase of agricultural and industrial water consumption will promote the resource balance capacity of surrounding areas in different periods the available water supply and actual water demand are constantly changing and the relationship between them is also variable the balance between supply and demand of water resources is only relative and the imbalance between them always exists we need to constantly adjust the supply and demand to achieve a dynamic relative balance third the pressure and driving forces of water resources mainly depend on the degree of environmental pollution and economic development areas with severe environmental pollution of water resources frequent disasters and arid climates will be under greater pressure for water resources while economically developed and densely populated areas will have greater demands for water resources and thus be more driven energy consumption and the proportion of protected areas will produce a spillover effect and higher energy consumption and a lower proportion of protected area will place surrounding areas under greater pressure and driving force fourth the development and utilization capacity of water resources is affected by the forest coverage rate environmental management input and soil erosion control in the development and utilization status of multiple factors the forest coverage rate and the maximum effect of environmental protection investment a high forest coverage rate and degree of environmental governance investment will promote the development and utilization of water resources and the increase of water loss and soil erosion control areas will reduce the excessive development of water resources thus restoring the ecological environment in terms of spatial spillover effects the newly added area of soil erosion control in the current year will not only promote the ecological recovery of this region but will also play a positive role in the ecological protection of neighboring regions 6 2 policy and recommendations first focus should be placed on solving the problem of large differences in the balance of water resources among regions in the future due to the impact of the natural environment and high intensity human activities the water resources in the north may be further reduced while those in the south will be further increased aggravating the difference in the balance of water resources between the north and the south to alleviate the regional differences in water resources the feasibility of the south to north water diversion project should be accelerated the government should support the project increase investment in science and technology and provide technical support at the same time since each province is different in terms of economy population climate and other aspects the government should take corresponding measures according to the actual situation of each province adjust measures to local conditions centralize governance by province and region and improve the efficiency of water resource allocation second water resource pressure should be reduced by improving water quality and promoting recycling improving the ability of routine and emergency support of water resources flood utilization water pollution response and drought resistance and disaster prevention will play a positive role in reducing the pressure on water resources water resources play an important role in economic and social development the quality of water resources has a direct impact on economic development we should accelerate the adjustment of the industrial structure change the mode of economic growth and establish a water saving circular economy model third to improve the efficiency of water resource development and utilization measures should be taken toward the improvement of the water structure and the improvement of the sewage treatment capacity on the one hand china s agricultural water consumption is relatively large through increasing industrial energy emission reductions china promotes water saving irrigation technology encourages the research and development of new technologies and production processes improves the reuse rate of industrial water raises citizens awareness of water conservation and improves the supervision and management mechanisms of water resources on the other hand the discharge of sewage and waste water is an obstacle in the process of improving the development and utilization of water resources the government should strengthen the effective monitoring of industrial sewage discharge strictly regulate the sewage treatment process and realize the effective treatment of sewage and waste water from the perspective of sustainable development it is necessary to combine soil and water loss control with resource development and utilization emphasize the equal importance of ecological recovery benefits and economic benefits and achieve scientific control at high levels with high efficiency and environmental friendliness fourth the spatial correlation spillover and heterogeneity should be fully considered in solving water resource problems this paper shows that china s regional water resource carrying capacity has obvious spatial agglomeration and spatial spillover effects when factors such as economic growth the water resource supply and demand natural disasters and climate change affect the water resource situation in this region they will produce spillover effects to some extent which will cause mutual influence and interaction among provinces in the future to focus on solving the complex problems concerning the water environment it is necessary to curb the unreasonable demand for water promote the formation of a mechanism through which water resource factors will upgrade the economic and social production mode and industrial structure accelerate the construction of a new pattern of water resource management and strengthen regional cooperation and exchanges declaration of competing
