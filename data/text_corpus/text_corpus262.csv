1310,to facilitate regional water resources allocation an integrated bi level multi objective programming ibmp model with dual random fuzzy variables was developed in this research the proposed model was derived through incorporating dual random fuzzy variables multi objective programming and interval parameter programming within a bi level optimization framework this approach improved upon the previous bi level programming methods and had two advantages firstly it was capable of reflecting tradeoffs among multiple conflict preferences for water related bi level hierarchical decision making processes secondly random fuzzy variables were used to tackle the dual uncertainties in both sides of the constraints which were characterize as probability density functions and discrete intervals then a real world water resources planning problem was employed for illustrating feasibility of the application of ibmp model in dongjiang river watershed of south china results reflected the alternative decisions for water allocation schemes under a set of probability levels and fuzzy α cut levels which can support in depth analysis of tradeoffs among multiple levels and objective values moreover modeling comparison analysis was undertaken to illustrate the performances of the proposed model graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bi level optimization dual uncertainties water resources planning dongjiang river watershed 1 introduction sustainable and efficient water resources management is of significance for many countries particularly in the backdrop of burgeoning population rapid urbanization and increasing water shortage singh 2014 yue et al 2020a 2020b presently unreasonable water planning strategies have exacerbated problems of water resource deficiency which has become a core limiting factor for economic development in many countries lei et al 2017 yue et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2020 consequently it is desired to formulate a reliable water resource management approach for help alleviate effects of any potential water shortage mathematical modeling as a useful tool for water resources management have been widely used in recent years akhbari and grigg 2013 chung et al 2009 li et al 2016 maqsood et al 2005 mortada et al 2018 teegavarapu 2010 zhou et al 2015 among them bi level programming bp proved to be a practical tool in tackling the hierarchical structure between basin authority and subarea administrators that may probably accept the leader follower stackelberg game in the decision making process xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a nevertheless except for the bi level decision making the actual water allocation system was extremely complex and had many characteristics influenced by multiple factors such as multi objective users uncertainties and nonlinearities kuil et al 2018 roozbahani et al 2014 li et al 2017 li et al 2013 yan et al 2020 the high complexities made the general bi level model face difficulties in handling real world problems it is essential to develop an enhanced bi level programming bp model through combining multiple optimization techniques in recent years many scholars attempted to improve bp to tackle a variety of resource allocation problems for example cai et al 2018a 2018b proposed an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ec ifblmop model for dealing with the complexities and uncertainties of agricultural water systems zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d developed a bi level multi objective stochastic approach to address multiple concerns by two level decision makers and the randomness of runoff in agrarian planting rong et al 2019 proposed an interval stochastic bi level multi objective programming model for supporting watershed water quality management wang et al 2019 developed a bi level multi objective linear fractional programming bmlfp approach for the optimization of water consumption structure zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d constructed a bi level multi objective programming model to distribute the flood drainage rights of the sunan canal in the taihu lake basin the above mentioned research proved the feasibility and usefulness of coupling bp with any other optimization techniques however in many real world problems the existence of uncertainties wang et al 2017 such as dual or even multiple uncertainties in an optimization model makes it challenging to obtain optimal water resources allocation schemes for instance water availability was influenced by many factors in a specific basin e g hydrological cycle and precipitation which can be considered as a random variable li et al 2018 moreover the loss rate for water transport may appear randomness due to the influences of technological strength and climate change meanwhile subjective decision judgment and data error normally made the statistical information of these random variables with high vagueness xie et al 2018 the dual uncertainties placed the water allocation schemes extremely intricacy which beyond the capabilities of traditional bp or the corresponding coupled approaches previously methods based on random fuzzy variables rfvs proved to be a practical tool for dealing multiple uncertainties and it can describe parameter characteristics in a hybrid form i e intervals probability density functions pdf and fuzzy numbers particularly in the mixed fuzzy and stochastic environment which is extremely common for many water related problems random fuzzy variables may exist katagiri et al 2013 sinova et al 2012 xu et al 2009 for example liu et al 2013 developed a double sided dual uncertainty based chance constrained programming ddccp model for supporting municipal solid waste management under uncertainty li and guo 2015 proposed a random fuzzy variable based inexact two stage stochastic chance constrained programming model to address dual uncertainties associated with the fluctuating stream conditions and irrigation quotas in crop area optimization although rfvs based tool can handle dual uncertainties problems effectively however few methods were applied in the water resources management field moreover they was incapable of tackling bi level multi objective and inexact intervals e g imprecise data existed in the optimization model simultaneously thereupon to break through the above dilemma an integrated optimization model considering the intricate complexities was desired therefore this paper attempts to develop an integrated bi level multi objective programming ibmp model with dual random fuzzy variables for water resources allocation under complexities the ibmp model will be formulated through incorporating interval parameter programming ipp multi objective programming mop and random fuzzy variables rfvs into a general bi level programming bp optimization framework it can support tradeoff analysis of the multiple conflicting preferences for bi level hierarchical decision making processes and tackle dual uncertainties in both sides of the system constraints that can be described as distribution functions and discrete intervals subsequently the method will be applied to a real life case i e dongjiang river basin to illustrate how the ibmp model addresses such in depth complexities which can assist the decision makers in identifying the optimal water allocation schemes this research involves several sections i e formulation of an ibmp model and development of its solution method application of the developed ibmp model to a real case in south china and analysis of result with the comparisons of ibmp with multiple traditional models 2 methodology the real world water allocation is an extremely complex problem which is characterized by various factors such as multiple decision maker levels multi objective multi users multiple uncertainties and nonlinearity features for example there are two levels of decision making processes in a typical water allocation problem which consists of basin authority and subarea administrators decision makers at each level usually have multiple and perhaps conflicting preferences moreover uncertainties related to the socio economic and hydrological cycle factors exist in the water allocation system what is more these parameters may have multiple uncertain characteristics which seriously aggravates the complexities of water allocation systems thus it is necessary to combine several modeling techniques to better reflect and tackle such system in depth complexities the study framework is as shown in fig 1 2 1 dual random fuzzy variables for an optimization problem due to the decision maker affected by subjective or objective factors upon a same problem which would lead to system parameters represent dual uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness such dual uncertainties parameters can express as random numbers and fuzzy sets through random fuzzy variables rfvs method therefore a typical dual rfvs programming model can formulate as follows 1a min f j 1 n a j x j subject to 1b pr j 1 n p ij rfv ω x j q j rfv ω 1 φ i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 j 1 2 n 1d p ij rfv ω n μ p ij δ p ij 2 1e q j rfv ω n μ q j δ q j 2 where f is the objective function and x j is a vector of decision variables μ p ij and μ q j represents the corresponding expectations of p and q and δ p ij and δ q j represents the corresponding standard variations of p and q meanwhile μ and δ are presented as fuzzy numbers and φ i represents the constraint violated probability levels 0 φ i 1 i 1 2 m generally in order to solve this model eq 1b should be transferred to a linearization form the detailed solution can be divided into two parts part 1 transforming the eq 1b to its approximated linearization form based on the following theorems ji et al 2015 theorem 1 eq 2a can be equivalent to eq 1b 2a j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 0 where φ 1 represents the inverse cumulative distribution function proof because p ij rfv and q j rfv following normal distributions then the linear combination of them must be following a standardized normally distributed thus 2b j 1 n p ij rfv ω x j q j rfv ω n j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 and according to eq 2b a standard normal random variable t can be expressed as 2c t j 1 n p ij rfv ω x j q j rfv ω j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 based on eq 2b and eq 2c eq 1b can be converted into 2d pr t j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 1 φ i i 1 2 m thereupon the chance constraint eq 2d can be satisfied if and only if 2e φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 therefore eq 2e is equivalent to eq 2a which represents theorem has been proved theorem 2 eq 2f is a sufficient condition for eq 2a where φi 0 5 and xj 0 2f j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j 0 proof when j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j r and j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j 0 we have 2g j 1 n δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j due to φ i 0 5 we have φ 1 1 φ i 0 based on eq 2f and eq 2g we can j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 2h j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j thus according to the above theorems if inequality eq 2f obeys sufficient condition then from inequality eq 2g we have eq 2a thereupon eq 1b can be transformed into eq 2f 2i j 1 n μ p ij x j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j μ q j i 1 2 m part 2 handling the fuzziness problems now convert eq 2i into a deterministic type via the fuzzy set theory here μ p ij μ q j δ p ij and δ q j are assumed as triangular fuzzy numbers the triangle function can be described as ren et al 2017 3 α μ g 0 g g 1 min or g 2 max g α g 1 min g 1 g 1 min g 1 min g g 1 g 2 max g α g 2 max g 1 g 1 g g 2 max 1 g g 1 where g 1min g 2max and g 1 represents the corresponding lowest possible values most credible values and highest possible values of fuzzy numbers g respectively therefore the fuzzy parameter g under each α cut level can be included within a closed interval g α g α 1 α g 1min αg 1 1 α g 2max αg 1 2 2 model development in practical problems the hydrologic cycle and water related events would lead to the stochastic characteristics of water availability and water loss rates meanwhile due to the different subjective judgments of decision makers these variables will be attached to fuzzy properties thus the two variables showed dual uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness and they can be called rfvs moreover due to the market fluctuations some economic parameters can be expressed as discrete intervals especially fully considering two typical decision levels i e river basin authority and administrative manager levels and multiple conflicting preferences of each level in this research the objectives of each decision make level were providing in the following sections thereupon through incorporating ipp mop and dual rfvs theory into the bp optimization framework an integrated bi level multi objective programming ibmp for water resources management with the consideration of dual rfvs can be formulated 2 2 1 objective functions for dual decision levels 1 objective functions for the upper level decision process objective 1 maximize social benefits the gini coefficient can be applied to measure resource distribution inequality i e measures the social benefits and it ranges from 0 to 1 rougoor and van marrewijk 2015 thus minimize the gini coefficient as an upper level objective 4a min f u 1 1 2 n i 1 i j 1 j t i j id ij i 1 1 i i 2 1 i j 1 j

j in subarea i 2 3 model solution due to the integration of bp imp mop and dual rfvs there is no existing method for solving the developed ibmp model thus the solution of the complicated ibmp model can be decomposed into three parts part 1 converting the dual rfvs constraints into a linearization form that the detailed steps see section 2 2 part 2 solving the interval multi objective problems at each decision level in this study the fuzzy method fm lence et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b and an interactive algorithm cai et al 2018a was used to solve the interval multi objective im model part 3 solving the interval bi level programming ibp i e transforming the bi level structure into a singer level programming model based on the parts 1 and 2 the ibmp model has been converted to an ibp model thereupon the fuzzy coordination method fcm jin et al 2018 and an interactive solution algorithm can be used for solving the ibp model the detailed process and transforming steps are shown in appendix a 3 application 3 1 overview of the study area in this study the dongjiang river djr basin 113 52 115 52 e 22 38 25 14 n was selected as the study area fig 2 the main body of the djr basin is located in guangdong province in south china and is one of the three major water systems of the pearl river it originates in xunwu county of jiangxi province and flows southward to the coastal alluvial plain eventually into the south china sea with a total length of 562 km and a basin area of approximately 35 340 km2 the djr basin has a typical subtropic monsoon climate the average annual rainfall is approximately 1795 mm and the average annual temperature is around 20 4 c the majority of precipitation occurs during the spring months accounting for 83 of the total annual precipitation the average annual water resources amount to 3 266 1010 m3 while its current water supply capacity is over 1 0 1010 m3 ding et al 2016 he et al 2018 in the past three decades the population and gdp gross domestic product of the djr basin have increased rapidly resulting in a rapid increase in water consumption in 2014 agricultural water consumption accounted for 45 8 of the total water consumption in addition the djr basin also provides domestic industrial and environmental water for heyuan huizhou dongguan guangzhou shenzhen meizhou and shaoguan with a total population of more than 30 million in particular 80 of hong kong s water supply comes from dongjiang he et al 2018 he et al 2013 meanwhile the existence of the apparent difference in the economic structure and population distribution of the djr basin the population density in the upper and middle reaches is relatively small mainly agricultural activities and high tech industries are weak while the downstream areas have high population density and rapid economic development as fig 2 shows the study area is divided into five administrative regions including huizhou hz i 1 shenzhen sz i 2 dongguan dg i 3 heyuan hy i 4 and zengcheng district guangzhou gz i 5 besides the water use sectors are divided into three categories including domestic sector ds j 1 agricultural sector as j 2 and industrial sector is j 3 recently the increase in water demand of various industries sector and coupled with severe water pollution the multi functional comprehensive benefits of water resources in the djr basin have been seriously threatened which leads to the contradiction of water supply demand has become increasingly prominent in order to coordinate the conflicts of water allocation in different regions and sectors effectively it is necessary to adjust the structure and improve the efficiency of water use however water resources decision makers are facing many challenges when formulating reasonable water resources planning strategy such as a how to aptly describe the two level hierarchical relationship and handle multiple concerns in decision making process and b how to deal with the dual uncertainties of system parameters caused by subjective or objective factors thus the aim is to develop a reasonable water resources allocation strategy and help the sustainable development of the regional social economy 3 2 data collection formulation of the water resources planning of the djr basin necessary data were collected from related statistical websites literature surveys local yearbooks 2008 2017 and relevant research papers lei et al 2017 the necessary data of the ibmp model can be divided into the following two parts in this research which corresponding to input parameter types of the study system framework the first part is the main social economic parameters and shown in table 1 which including unit cost and benefit coefficients of water utilization minimum and maximum water demand index of different water use sectors in each subarea the data involved in the second part are two random fuzzy variables i e water availability and water loss coefficient among which the random information about water availability was obtained based on the runoff data 1956 to 2015 of boluo hydrological station table 2 presents the numerical characteristic of these parameters which include mean value and standard deviation under five α cut level values i e 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 respectively 4 result analysis and discussions in this research in order to study the variation trend of decision variables and objective functions under multiple scenarios five α cut level values i e 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 and three violated probability levels φ i of ccp i e 0 05 0 10 0 15 are chosen which increases with the arithmetic sequence by solving the established ibmp model then a series of feasible solutions were obtained under given scenarios i e α cut levels and violated probability φ i levels subsequently the model results are described in the following sections 4 1 optimal water allocation strategies two types of scenarios were considered for this model and generate fifteen water allocation schemes here in order to study the changing trend of the allocation results it is necessary to make one parameter fixed and change the other parameter therefore there are total two combination scenarios i e scenario 1 φ 0 1 with α cut levels changing from 0 to 1 scenario 2 α 0 5 with violated probability φ levels changing from 0 05 to 0 15 fig 3 provides the results for water allocation to three water use sectors in five subareas under scenario 1 i e φ 0 1 it is obvious from fig 3a that except for dg and hy the water allocation of ds in other subarea has reached the optimal water demand target among which the result of water allocation to ds would be 10 20 10 51 108 m3 10 29 10 51 108 m3 10 37 10 51 108 m3 10 44 10 51 108 m3 10 51 10 51 108 m3 under different α cut levels in dongguan subarea i 3 and the results of heyuan subarea i 4 all would be 1 66 1 97 108 m3 this is because the net benefit of the domestic sector is much higher than in other sectors which would be prioritized when water resources are insufficient after analyzing the results of the water allocation model which demonstrates that water shortages existed in both the agricultural and industrial sectors meanwhile the agricultural sector was the most serious it can also be seen from fig 3 b c that the upper bound of water flow is decreasing while the corresponding lower bound is increasing and the gap of interval results would be narrow as α cut levels increased the above phenomena can be attributed to the membership function i e larger α cut levels that could lead to the smaller probability of fuzzy events similarly fig 4 shows the different water allocation patterns under scenario 2 i e α 0 5 it can be seen from this figure that the water allocation to each sector changes with the violated probability φ level changes the higher φ level means a higher risk of the system which also means more water availability moreover as the level of violation probability increases the amount of water allocated to each sector has increased slightly especially in the agricultural fig 4b and industrial sectors fig 4c on the contrary the trend of the domestic sector results changing with the probability level is very unobvious because the domestic water demand almost has been met fig 4a shows both the upper and lower boundaries of the water allocation results of the domestic sector are nearly equal to their corresponding demand targets under scenario 2 which are similar to the changing trend of domestic water allocation results in scenario 1 in a word when the per unit net benefits of water use are much higher than in other sectors the demand target for domestic water is easily achieved it also shows that the ibmp model is in line with reality 4 2 optimization objectives fig 5 shows the system benefit and gini coefficient of the upper level under different φ levels and α cut levels there is an obvious increase of the upper bound of the gini coefficient value and a decreasing trend of the lower bound from high value to low ones as α cut levels increasing on the other hand the variation trend of system benefit is reverse to the gini coefficient completely because of obtaining higher economic benefits will inevitably lead to a decrease in the fairness of the system taking the φ 0 15 level as an example fig 5c the system benefit would be 21 940 50 27 522 96 108 cny 21 995 52 27 492 13 108 cny 22 048 37 27 461 25 108 cny 22 101 95 27 430 42 108 cny 22 155 68 27 397 67 108 cny under α cut level with the value of 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 respectively while gini value would be 0 350 0 404 0 349 0 405 0 348 0 407 0 347 0 408 0 346 0 409 under five α cut levels respectively meanwhile the variation trend of these two types of target values is mainly attributed to the triangular fuzzy membership function it shows that an increase in α cut level means an increased strictness for the upper bound constraints and a decreased strictness for the lower bound constraints which may then result in a changing trend of the two objective results similarly from the comparison of fig 5 a to c its discovery that the results of these two objectives will also vary with the violated probability φ levels for instance when α 0 5 the system benefit would be 21 576 47 27 117 48 108 cny 21 872 41 27 333 17 108 cny 22 048 37 27 461 25 108 cny and the gini value would be 0 355 0 416 0 351 0 410 0 348 0 407 under φ fixed with the value of 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 respectively an increased φ level means an increased total water availability which resulted in a better system benefit and gini value but this also leads to an increase in the risk of system failure under this environment decision makers need to tradeoff the risks and system benefits on the other hand fig 6 shows the results of the lower level optimization objectives from this figure it found that the variation trend of these objective functions is consistent with the variation trend of system benefit in fig 5 because they are the same type of function that is they all take economic benefits as the objective function 4 3 discussions the optimization results indicated that the ibmp model established in this study could provide a reliable water resource allocation scheme for two level decision makers under dual uncertainties simultaneously therefore to better demonstrate the performance of the ibmp model this section will mainly focus on the two principal parts which are the bi level structure and the dual random fuzzy variables of the model firstly a comparison has been made between the ibmp model and four sub models which have the same constraints the objective functions and names of each sub model are shown in table 3 after solving these models a series of objective values of each sub model are obtained under different α cut levels and violated probability φ levels due to the many scenario results so the intermediate values of each level i e α 0 5 and φ 0 1 were selected to compare the advantages and disadvantages among the models fig 7 shows the objective value results comparison as shown in fig 7 the single objective models can only generate the optimal value while the poor performance of other objectives for example model u1 can obtain a better gini value but the system benefit result is worse than other models besides the multi objective models have advantages tradeoff among multiple concerns under different dimensions however these four sub models all oversimple the vital relationship between different decision making levels which may make the water allocation scheme have limitations on the other hand it clear that the objective values generated by the ibmp model are in the range of model u and model l which illustrates the developed model makes a tradeoff between two decision makers effectively from a systematic perspective the results of ibmp are closer to model u than model l which shows that bi level decision makers in the ibmp model accept the leader follower stackelberg game secondly in order to highlight the advantages better of the ibmp model this study compared the model with the one side rfv method based on considering the two level multi objective problem the multiple model comparisons see fig 8 among the three models model left and model right corresponding to left hand and right hand side rfv model model dual represents the dual rfvs model i e the ibmp model taking the upper level systemic goal as an example when φ 0 1 and α 0 5 indicating that compared with model left and model right 1 and in terms of system economic benefits the ibmp model reduces 1 91 3 81 and 0 10 0 17 respectively 2 the gini coefficient has increased by 5 98 7 39 and 0 15 0 18 respectively meanwhile compared with these two models the system efficiency i e economic and social benefit of the ibmp model has reduced to some extent and model left model right model dual which also illustrates that the right hand side uncertainty parameter is more sensitive to the system result the above phenomenon can be explained like that compared with the one sided rfv method the ibmp model has stricter requirements on the system attribute to the existence of dual rfvs in short the ibmp model combines the advantages of the two models and has stronger system stability which can provide a clear scope for decision makers 5 conclusions an integrated bi level multi objective programming ibmp model with dual random fuzzy variables has been developed for supporting optimal regional water resources under multiple uncertainties the following two points can highlight the advantages of the ibmp model a support tradeoff analysis of the multiple conflict preferences for bi level hierarchical decision making processes and b handle dual uncertainties through rfv tools in both sides of the system constraints and described as distribution functions and intervals with the systematic consideration of complexity and uncertainty the ibmp model has been applied to a real world study successfully to identify the optimal water allocation scheme in the djr basin south china a series of probability levels and fuzzy α cut levels jointly considered as scenario analysis for this study subsequently sensible water allocation solutions and multiple model comparisons have been obtained which were valuable for water managers however there are still some research extensions to be addressed the solution method of the random fuzzy variable was based on the assumption of obeying normal distribution in this study which should be enhanced extent to other types of probability density functions in future research work moreover the impact of climate change on water availability was not considered in this paper therefore it is necessary to address the above limitations further to enhance the flexibility of the model funding this research was supported by the key area research and development

1310,to facilitate regional water resources allocation an integrated bi level multi objective programming ibmp model with dual random fuzzy variables was developed in this research the proposed model was derived through incorporating dual random fuzzy variables multi objective programming and interval parameter programming within a bi level optimization framework this approach improved upon the previous bi level programming methods and had two advantages firstly it was capable of reflecting tradeoffs among multiple conflict preferences for water related bi level hierarchical decision making processes secondly random fuzzy variables were used to tackle the dual uncertainties in both sides of the constraints which were characterize as probability density functions and discrete intervals then a real world water resources planning problem was employed for illustrating feasibility of the application of ibmp model in dongjiang river watershed of south china results reflected the alternative decisions for water allocation schemes under a set of probability levels and fuzzy α cut levels which can support in depth analysis of tradeoffs among multiple levels and objective values moreover modeling comparison analysis was undertaken to illustrate the performances of the proposed model graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bi level optimization dual uncertainties water resources planning dongjiang river watershed 1 introduction sustainable and efficient water resources management is of significance for many countries particularly in the backdrop of burgeoning population rapid urbanization and increasing water shortage singh 2014 yue et al 2020a 2020b presently unreasonable water planning strategies have exacerbated problems of water resource deficiency which has become a core limiting factor for economic development in many countries lei et al 2017 yue et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2020 consequently it is desired to formulate a reliable water resource management approach for help alleviate effects of any potential water shortage mathematical modeling as a useful tool for water resources management have been widely used in recent years akhbari and grigg 2013 chung et al 2009 li et al 2016 maqsood et al 2005 mortada et al 2018 teegavarapu 2010 zhou et al 2015 among them bi level programming bp proved to be a practical tool in tackling the hierarchical structure between basin authority and subarea administrators that may probably accept the leader follower stackelberg game in the decision making process xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2019a nevertheless except for the bi level decision making the actual water allocation system was extremely complex and had many characteristics influenced by multiple factors such as multi objective users uncertainties and nonlinearities kuil et al 2018 roozbahani et al 2014 li et al 2017 li et al 2013 yan et al 2020 the high complexities made the general bi level model face difficulties in handling real world problems it is essential to develop an enhanced bi level programming bp model through combining multiple optimization techniques in recent years many scholars attempted to improve bp to tackle a variety of resource allocation problems for example cai et al 2018a 2018b proposed an export coefficient based inexact fuzzy bi level multi objective programming ec ifblmop model for dealing with the complexities and uncertainties of agricultural water systems zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d developed a bi level multi objective stochastic approach to address multiple concerns by two level decision makers and the randomness of runoff in agrarian planting rong et al 2019 proposed an interval stochastic bi level multi objective programming model for supporting watershed water quality management wang et al 2019 developed a bi level multi objective linear fractional programming bmlfp approach for the optimization of water consumption structure zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c 2019d constructed a bi level multi objective programming model to distribute the flood drainage rights of the sunan canal in the taihu lake basin the above mentioned research proved the feasibility and usefulness of coupling bp with any other optimization techniques however in many real world problems the existence of uncertainties wang et al 2017 such as dual or even multiple uncertainties in an optimization model makes it challenging to obtain optimal water resources allocation schemes for instance water availability was influenced by many factors in a specific basin e g hydrological cycle and precipitation which can be considered as a random variable li et al 2018 moreover the loss rate for water transport may appear randomness due to the influences of technological strength and climate change meanwhile subjective decision judgment and data error normally made the statistical information of these random variables with high vagueness xie et al 2018 the dual uncertainties placed the water allocation schemes extremely intricacy which beyond the capabilities of traditional bp or the corresponding coupled approaches previously methods based on random fuzzy variables rfvs proved to be a practical tool for dealing multiple uncertainties and it can describe parameter characteristics in a hybrid form i e intervals probability density functions pdf and fuzzy numbers particularly in the mixed fuzzy and stochastic environment which is extremely common for many water related problems random fuzzy variables may exist katagiri et al 2013 sinova et al 2012 xu et al 2009 for example liu et al 2013 developed a double sided dual uncertainty based chance constrained programming ddccp model for supporting municipal solid waste management under uncertainty li and guo 2015 proposed a random fuzzy variable based inexact two stage stochastic chance constrained programming model to address dual uncertainties associated with the fluctuating stream conditions and irrigation quotas in crop area optimization although rfvs based tool can handle dual uncertainties problems effectively however few methods were applied in the water resources management field moreover they was incapable of tackling bi level multi objective and inexact intervals e g imprecise data existed in the optimization model simultaneously thereupon to break through the above dilemma an integrated optimization model considering the intricate complexities was desired therefore this paper attempts to develop an integrated bi level multi objective programming ibmp model with dual random fuzzy variables for water resources allocation under complexities the ibmp model will be formulated through incorporating interval parameter programming ipp multi objective programming mop and random fuzzy variables rfvs into a general bi level programming bp optimization framework it can support tradeoff analysis of the multiple conflicting preferences for bi level hierarchical decision making processes and tackle dual uncertainties in both sides of the system constraints that can be described as distribution functions and discrete intervals subsequently the method will be applied to a real life case i e dongjiang river basin to illustrate how the ibmp model addresses such in depth complexities which can assist the decision makers in identifying the optimal water allocation schemes this research involves several sections i e formulation of an ibmp model and development of its solution method application of the developed ibmp model to a real case in south china and analysis of result with the comparisons of ibmp with multiple traditional models 2 methodology the real world water allocation is an extremely complex problem which is characterized by various factors such as multiple decision maker levels multi objective multi users multiple uncertainties and nonlinearity features for example there are two levels of decision making processes in a typical water allocation problem which consists of basin authority and subarea administrators decision makers at each level usually have multiple and perhaps conflicting preferences moreover uncertainties related to the socio economic and hydrological cycle factors exist in the water allocation system what is more these parameters may have multiple uncertain characteristics which seriously aggravates the complexities of water allocation systems thus it is necessary to combine several modeling techniques to better reflect and tackle such system in depth complexities the study framework is as shown in fig 1 2 1 dual random fuzzy variables for an optimization problem due to the decision maker affected by subjective or objective factors upon a same problem which would lead to system parameters represent dual uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness such dual uncertainties parameters can express as random numbers and fuzzy sets through random fuzzy variables rfvs method therefore a typical dual rfvs programming model can formulate as follows 1a min f j 1 n a j x j subject to 1b pr j 1 n p ij rfv ω x j q j rfv ω 1 φ i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 j 1 2 n 1d p ij rfv ω n μ p ij δ p ij 2 1e q j rfv ω n μ q j δ q j 2 where f is the objective function and x j is a vector of decision variables μ p ij and μ q j represents the corresponding expectations of p and q and δ p ij and δ q j represents the corresponding standard variations of p and q meanwhile μ and δ are presented as fuzzy numbers and φ i represents the constraint violated probability levels 0 φ i 1 i 1 2 m generally in order to solve this model eq 1b should be transferred to a linearization form the detailed solution can be divided into two parts part 1 transforming the eq 1b to its approximated linearization form based on the following theorems ji et al 2015 theorem 1 eq 2a can be equivalent to eq 1b 2a j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 0 where φ 1 represents the inverse cumulative distribution function proof because p ij rfv and q j rfv following normal distributions then the linear combination of them must be following a standardized normally distributed thus 2b j 1 n p ij rfv ω x j q j rfv ω n j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 and according to eq 2b a standard normal random variable t can be expressed as 2c t j 1 n p ij rfv ω x j q j rfv ω j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 based on eq 2b and eq 2c eq 1b can be converted into 2d pr t j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 1 φ i i 1 2 m thereupon the chance constraint eq 2d can be satisfied if and only if 2e φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 therefore eq 2e is equivalent to eq 2a which represents theorem has been proved theorem 2 eq 2f is a sufficient condition for eq 2a where φi 0 5 and xj 0 2f j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j 0 proof when j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j r and j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j 0 we have 2g j 1 n δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j due to φ i 0 5 we have φ 1 1 φ i 0 based on eq 2f and eq 2g we can j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j 2 δ q j 2 2h j 1 n μ p ij x j μ q j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j thus according to the above theorems if inequality eq 2f obeys sufficient condition then from inequality eq 2g we have eq 2a thereupon eq 1b can be transformed into eq 2f 2i j 1 n μ p ij x j φ 1 1 φ i j 1 n δ p ij x j δ q j μ q j i 1 2 m part 2 handling the fuzziness problems now convert eq 2i into a deterministic type via the fuzzy set theory here μ p ij μ q j δ p ij and δ q j are assumed as triangular fuzzy numbers the triangle function can be described as ren et al 2017 3 α μ g 0 g g 1 min or g 2 max g α g 1 min g 1 g 1 min g 1 min g g 1 g 2 max g α g 2 max g 1 g 1 g g 2 max 1 g g 1 where g 1min g 2max and g 1 represents the corresponding lowest possible values most credible values and highest possible values of fuzzy numbers g respectively therefore the fuzzy parameter g under each α cut level can be included within a closed interval g α g α 1 α g 1min αg 1 1 α g 2max αg 1 2 2 model development in practical problems the hydrologic cycle and water related events would lead to the stochastic characteristics of water availability and water loss rates meanwhile due to the different subjective judgments of decision makers these variables will be attached to fuzzy properties thus the two variables showed dual uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness and they can be called rfvs moreover due to the market fluctuations some economic parameters can be expressed as discrete intervals especially fully considering two typical decision levels i e river basin authority and administrative manager levels and multiple conflicting preferences of each level in this research the objectives of each decision make level were providing in the following sections thereupon through incorporating ipp mop and dual rfvs theory into the bp optimization framework an integrated bi level multi objective programming ibmp for water resources management with the consideration of dual rfvs can be formulated 2 2 1 objective functions for dual decision levels 1 objective functions for the upper level decision process objective 1 maximize social benefits the gini coefficient can be applied to measure resource distribution inequality i e measures the social benefits and it ranges from 0 to 1 rougoor and van marrewijk 2015 thus minimize the gini coefficient as an upper level objective 4a min f u 1 1 2 n i 1 i j 1 j t i j id ij i 1 1 i i 2 1 i j 1 j

j in subarea i 2 3 model solution due to the integration of bp imp mop and dual rfvs there is no existing method for solving the developed ibmp model thus the solution of the complicated ibmp model can be decomposed into three parts part 1 converting the dual rfvs constraints into a linearization form that the detailed steps see section 2 2 part 2 solving the interval multi objective problems at each decision level in this study the fuzzy method fm lence et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b and an interactive algorithm cai et al 2018a was used to solve the interval multi objective im model part 3 solving the interval bi level programming ibp i e transforming the bi level structure into a singer level programming model based on the parts 1 and 2 the ibmp model has been converted to an ibp model thereupon the fuzzy coordination method fcm jin et al 2018 and an interactive solution algorithm can be used for solving the ibp model the detailed process and transforming steps are shown in appendix a 3 application 3 1 overview of the study area in this study the dongjiang river djr basin 113 52 115 52 e 22 38 25 14 n was selected as the study area fig 2 the main body of the djr basin is located in guangdong province in south china and is one of the three major water systems of the pearl river it originates in xunwu county of jiangxi province and flows southward to the coastal alluvial plain eventually into the south china sea with a total length of 562 km and a basin area of approximately 35 340 km2 the djr basin has a typical subtropic monsoon climate the average annual rainfall is approximately 1795 mm and the average annual temperature is around 20 4 c the majority of precipitation occurs during the spring months accounting for 83 of the total annual precipitation the average annual water resources amount to 3 266 1010 m3 while its current water supply capacity is over 1 0 1010 m3 ding et al 2016 he et al 2018 in the past three decades the population and gdp gross domestic product of the djr basin have increased rapidly resulting in a rapid increase in water consumption in 2014 agricultural water consumption accounted for 45 8 of the total water consumption in addition the djr basin also provides domestic industrial and environmental water for heyuan huizhou dongguan guangzhou shenzhen meizhou and shaoguan with a total population of more than 30 million in particular 80 of hong kong s water supply comes from dongjiang he et al 2018 he et al 2013 meanwhile the existence of the apparent difference in the economic structure and population distribution of the djr basin the population density in the upper and middle reaches is relatively small mainly agricultural activities and high tech industries are weak while the downstream areas have high population density and rapid economic development as fig 2 shows the study area is divided into five administrative regions including huizhou hz i 1 shenzhen sz i 2 dongguan dg i 3 heyuan hy i 4 and zengcheng district guangzhou gz i 5 besides the water use sectors are divided into three categories including domestic sector ds j 1 agricultural sector as j 2 and industrial sector is j 3 recently the increase in water demand of various industries sector and coupled with severe water pollution the multi functional comprehensive benefits of water resources in the djr basin have been seriously threatened which leads to the contradiction of water supply demand has become increasingly prominent in order to coordinate the conflicts of water allocation in different regions and sectors effectively it is necessary to adjust the structure and improve the efficiency of water use however water resources decision makers are facing many challenges when formulating reasonable water resources planning strategy such as a how to aptly describe the two level hierarchical relationship and handle multiple concerns in decision making process and b how to deal with the dual uncertainties of system parameters caused by subjective or objective factors thus the aim is to develop a reasonable water resources allocation strategy and help the sustainable development of the regional social economy 3 2 data collection formulation of the water resources planning of the djr basin necessary data were collected from related statistical websites literature surveys local yearbooks 2008 2017 and relevant research papers lei et al 2017 the necessary data of the ibmp model can be divided into the following two parts in this research which corresponding to input parameter types of the study system framework the first part is the main social economic parameters and shown in table 1 which including unit cost and benefit coefficients of water utilization minimum and maximum water demand index of different water use sectors in each subarea the data involved in the second part are two random fuzzy variables i e water availability and water loss coefficient among which the random information about water availability was obtained based on the runoff data 1956 to 2015 of boluo hydrological station table 2 presents the numerical characteristic of these parameters which include mean value and standard deviation under five α cut level values i e 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 respectively 4 result analysis and discussions in this research in order to study the variation trend of decision variables and objective functions under multiple scenarios five α cut level values i e 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 and three violated probability levels φ i of ccp i e 0 05 0 10 0 15 are chosen which increases with the arithmetic sequence by solving the established ibmp model then a series of feasible solutions were obtained under given scenarios i e α cut levels and violated probability φ i levels subsequently the model results are described in the following sections 4 1 optimal water allocation strategies two types of scenarios were considered for this model and generate fifteen water allocation schemes here in order to study the changing trend of the allocation results it is necessary to make one parameter fixed and change the other parameter therefore there are total two combination scenarios i e scenario 1 φ 0 1 with α cut levels changing from 0 to 1 scenario 2 α 0 5 with violated probability φ levels changing from 0 05 to 0 15 fig 3 provides the results for water allocation to three water use sectors in five subareas under scenario 1 i e φ 0 1 it is obvious from fig 3a that except for dg and hy the water allocation of ds in other subarea has reached the optimal water demand target among which the result of water allocation to ds would be 10 20 10 51 108 m3 10 29 10 51 108 m3 10 37 10 51 108 m3 10 44 10 51 108 m3 10 51 10 51 108 m3 under different α cut levels in dongguan subarea i 3 and the results of heyuan subarea i 4 all would be 1 66 1 97 108 m3 this is because the net benefit of the domestic sector is much higher than in other sectors which would be prioritized when water resources are insufficient after analyzing the results of the water allocation model which demonstrates that water shortages existed in both the agricultural and industrial sectors meanwhile the agricultural sector was the most serious it can also be seen from fig 3 b c that the upper bound of water flow is decreasing while the corresponding lower bound is increasing and the gap of interval results would be narrow as α cut levels increased the above phenomena can be attributed to the membership function i e larger α cut levels that could lead to the smaller probability of fuzzy events similarly fig 4 shows the different water allocation patterns under scenario 2 i e α 0 5 it can be seen from this figure that the water allocation to each sector changes with the violated probability φ level changes the higher φ level means a higher risk of the system which also means more water availability moreover as the level of violation probability increases the amount of water allocated to each sector has increased slightly especially in the agricultural fig 4b and industrial sectors fig 4c on the contrary the trend of the domestic sector results changing with the probability level is very unobvious because the domestic water demand almost has been met fig 4a shows both the upper and lower boundaries of the water allocation results of the domestic sector are nearly equal to their corresponding demand targets under scenario 2 which are similar to the changing trend of domestic water allocation results in scenario 1 in a word when the per unit net benefits of water use are much higher than in other sectors the demand target for domestic water is easily achieved it also shows that the ibmp model is in line with reality 4 2 optimization objectives fig 5 shows the system benefit and gini coefficient of the upper level under different φ levels and α cut levels there is an obvious increase of the upper bound of the gini coefficient value and a decreasing trend of the lower bound from high value to low ones as α cut levels increasing on the other hand the variation trend of system benefit is reverse to the gini coefficient completely because of obtaining higher economic benefits will inevitably lead to a decrease in the fairness of the system taking the φ 0 15 level as an example fig 5c the system benefit would be 21 940 50 27 522 96 108 cny 21 995 52 27 492 13 108 cny 22 048 37 27 461 25 108 cny 22 101 95 27 430 42 108 cny 22 155 68 27 397 67 108 cny under α cut level with the value of 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 respectively while gini value would be 0 350 0 404 0 349 0 405 0 348 0 407 0 347 0 408 0 346 0 409 under five α cut levels respectively meanwhile the variation trend of these two types of target values is mainly attributed to the triangular fuzzy membership function it shows that an increase in α cut level means an increased strictness for the upper bound constraints and a decreased strictness for the lower bound constraints which may then result in a changing trend of the two objective results similarly from the comparison of fig 5 a to c its discovery that the results of these two objectives will also vary with the violated probability φ levels for instance when α 0 5 the system benefit would be 21 576 47 27 117 48 108 cny 21 872 41 27 333 17 108 cny 22 048 37 27 461 25 108 cny and the gini value would be 0 355 0 416 0 351 0 410 0 348 0 407 under φ fixed with the value of 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 respectively an increased φ level means an increased total water availability which resulted in a better system benefit and gini value but this also leads to an increase in the risk of system failure under this environment decision makers need to tradeoff the risks and system benefits on the other hand fig 6 shows the results of the lower level optimization objectives from this figure it found that the variation trend of these objective functions is consistent with the variation trend of system benefit in fig 5 because they are the same type of function that is they all take economic benefits as the objective function 4 3 discussions the optimization results indicated that the ibmp model established in this study could provide a reliable water resource allocation scheme for two level decision makers under dual uncertainties simultaneously therefore to better demonstrate the performance of the ibmp model this section will mainly focus on the two principal parts which are the bi level structure and the dual random fuzzy variables of the model firstly a comparison has been made between the ibmp model and four sub models which have the same constraints the objective functions and names of each sub model are shown in table 3 after solving these models a series of objective values of each sub model are obtained under different α cut levels and violated probability φ levels due to the many scenario results so the intermediate values of each level i e α 0 5 and φ 0 1 were selected to compare the advantages and disadvantages among the models fig 7 shows the objective value results comparison as shown in fig 7 the single objective models can only generate the optimal value while the poor performance of other objectives for example model u1 can obtain a better gini value but the system benefit result is worse than other models besides the multi objective models have advantages tradeoff among multiple concerns under different dimensions however these four sub models all oversimple the vital relationship between different decision making levels which may make the water allocation scheme have limitations on the other hand it clear that the objective values generated by the ibmp model are in the range of model u and model l which illustrates the developed model makes a tradeoff between two decision makers effectively from a systematic perspective the results of ibmp are closer to model u than model l which shows that bi level decision makers in the ibmp model accept the leader follower stackelberg game secondly in order to highlight the advantages better of the ibmp model this study compared the model with the one side rfv method based on considering the two level multi objective problem the multiple model comparisons see fig 8 among the three models model left and model right corresponding to left hand and right hand side rfv model model dual represents the dual rfvs model i e the ibmp model taking the upper level systemic goal as an example when φ 0 1 and α 0 5 indicating that compared with model left and model right 1 and in terms of system economic benefits the ibmp model reduces 1 91 3 81 and 0 10 0 17 respectively 2 the gini coefficient has increased by 5 98 7 39 and 0 15 0 18 respectively meanwhile compared with these two models the system efficiency i e economic and social benefit of the ibmp model has reduced to some extent and model left model right model dual which also illustrates that the right hand side uncertainty parameter is more sensitive to the system result the above phenomenon can be explained like that compared with the one sided rfv method the ibmp model has stricter requirements on the system attribute to the existence of dual rfvs in short the ibmp model combines the advantages of the two models and has stronger system stability which can provide a clear scope for decision makers 5 conclusions an integrated bi level multi objective programming ibmp model with dual random fuzzy variables has been developed for supporting optimal regional water resources under multiple uncertainties the following two points can highlight the advantages of the ibmp model a support tradeoff analysis of the multiple conflict preferences for bi level hierarchical decision making processes and b handle dual uncertainties through rfv tools in both sides of the system constraints and described as distribution functions and intervals with the systematic consideration of complexity and uncertainty the ibmp model has been applied to a real world study successfully to identify the optimal water allocation scheme in the djr basin south china a series of probability levels and fuzzy α cut levels jointly considered as scenario analysis for this study subsequently sensible water allocation solutions and multiple model comparisons have been obtained which were valuable for water managers however there are still some research extensions to be addressed the solution method of the random fuzzy variable was based on the assumption of obeying normal distribution in this study which should be enhanced extent to other types of probability density functions in future research work moreover the impact of climate change on water availability was not considered in this paper therefore it is necessary to address the above limitations further to enhance the flexibility of the model funding this research was supported by the key area research and development

1311,nano silica nsio2 induces potential harmful effects on the living environment and human health it is well established that sio2 facilitates the co transport of a variety of other contaminants including heavy metals and pesticides the current study focused on the systematic evaluation of the effects of multiple physicochemical parameters such as ph 5 7 and 9 ionic strength 10 50 and 100 mm and humic acid 0 1 1 and 10 mg l on the transport and retention of nsio2 in saturated porous medium additionally the influent concentration of nsio2 10 50 and 100 mg l was also varied our experimental findings indicate that the size of nsio2 aggregates was directly related to the ph ionic strength ha and particle concentration had a significant impact on the breakthrough curves btcs the stability provided by the varying concentrations of ph and humic acid had a significant effect on the size of nsio2 aggregates and transport c c0 0 7 the presence of a greater magnitude of negative charge on the surface of both nsio2 and quartz sand resulted in less aggregation and enhanced flow of nsio2 through the sand column the electrostatic and steric repulsion forces were the primary governing mechanisms in relation to the size of nsio2 aggregates affecting the single collector efficiency and attachment efficiency which determined the maximal transport of nsio2 conversely a probable increase in van der waals force of attraction exacerbated the particle deposition and reduced their mobility for high ionic strength and particle concentrations c c0 0 1 the formation of large nsio2 aggregates in particular was principally responsible for the enhancement of nsio2 retention in sand columns over a broad range of is and particle concentration the interaction energy profiles based on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory were determined to understand the mechanism of nsio2 deposition aditionally all the experimental btcs were mathematically simulated and justified by the colloidal filtration theory cft considering the environmental ramifications the transport behavior of nsio2 was further evaluated in various natural matrices such as river lake ground and tap water the nsio2 suspended in the river lake and tap water had significantly higher mobility c c0 0 7 whereas groundwater indicated higher retention c c0 0 3 the study advances our collective knowledge of physicochemical and environmental parameters that can affect particle mobility graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nsio2 porous media dlvo theory cft transport retention 1 introduction nano silica is a non metallic inorganic material that is widely produced and has significant industrial applications wang et al 2016b they are frequently employed as catalyst carriers and abrasive agents zhang et al 2020b nsio2 also acts as a potential adsorbent for the removal of contaminants and heavy metals like lead from aquatic ecosystems shukla et al 2015 furthermore the negative charge on nsio2 provides a large number of electrostatic binding sites which enhances their utility in medicinal and biotechnological applications laranjeira et al 2017 a recent study indicated that highly dispersive silicate glass particles were discharged during the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant disaster enhanced the transfer of contaminants in subsurface environments resulting in environmental pollution fujita and kobayashi 2016 inexorable amounts of nsio2 released into the environment may pose a threat to both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems ayatallahzadeh shirazi et al 2016 reported that nsio2 has toxic effects like decreased cell viability on marine microalgae dunaliella salina nsio2 also impacts the animal morphology and behavioral parameters in hydra vulgaris cnidaria ambrosone et al 2014 in addition nsio2 causes dna damage inflammatory reactions and cell cycle arrest in a variety of cell types croissant et al 2020 therefore it is important to critically analyze the toxic impacts of nsio2 in different environmental matrices highly dispersible colloidal silica improves the mobility of pollutants that are firmly adsorbed numerous research has highlighted the fact that silica nanoparticles facilitate the co transport of various environmental pollutants sio2 was found to promote the transport of heavy metals pb2 and cd2 in a recent study due to the significant adsorption of positively charged heavy metal ions on its negatively charged surface in a separate study it was reported that silica enhanced the retention of virus escherichia coli phage in the saturated porous media qin et al 2020 whereas under unsaturated conditions it concomitantly facilitated the transport of virus by electrostatic repulsion of similarly charged particles wang et al 2016a studied the co transport of nsio2 and pesticide acetamiprid in biochar amended porous media by competing for binding sites on the biochar surfaces the co presence of acetamiprid and nsio2 in the solutions improved the transport of both acetamiprid and nps in the biochar amended sand the infiltration caused by rainfall or irrigation can transport the nanoparticles from the topsoil zone to the saturated zone babakhani et al 2017 nsio2 increases the stability of other metal oxide nanoparticles tio2 zno and cuo and enhances their percolation into the soil layers of municipal waste landfills hence reducing the effectiveness of the soil layer further the transport behavior of nanoparticles is generally affected by organic matter and chemicals present in porous mediums wang et al 2016b it is important to understand that realistic exposure parameters such as ph ionic strength natural organic matter nom can alter the physicochemical properties and hence the transport pattern of nsio2 abbas et al 2020 amirbahman and olson 1995 thorough knowledge of the fate and movement of nsio2 in porous media is essential for designing reliable waste management and disposal methods for nsio2 to avoid nanoparticle contamination in the environment over the recent years the research on the transport of several nanoparticles including tio2 khan and şengül 2016 agnps cornelis et al 2013 zno sun et al 2015 feo carstens et al 2017 cnt sharma and fagerlund 2015 al2o3 rahman et al 2013 have received considerable attention previous reports suggest that different environmental factors have a strong role to play in modifying the surface characteristics of the nanoparticles this will determine their mobility or deposition in the transport media bueno et al 2022 fujita and kobayashi 2016 investiagated the effect of charge on the transport of colloidal silica in quartz sand a narrow range of ph 5 to 7 was selected to perform the study the effect of alkaline ph on the transport phenomenon was not considered in another study the effect of humic acid on the transport of colloidal silica was examined under different hydrochemical conditions zhou et al 2017 collidal silica was passed through the sand column suspended in 10 mg l of humic acid solution the effect of varying the humic acid concentrations on nsio2 transport was not analyzed here the transport and retention of various engineered metal oxide nanoparticles al2o3 tio2 and sio2 in quartz sand was emphasized by bayat et al 2015 the transport behavior was evaluated considering only a single influent concentration of 50 mg l nsio2 the influence of particle concentrations on the nanoparticle retention and transport in the porous media is another factor that requires more attention overall numerous research gaps remain to be addressed regarding transport of nano sio2 in saturated porous media to the best of our knowledge this is the first ever work that systaematically investigated the transport behavior of nsio2 in the saturated porous medium at different ph ionic strength nom and influent particle concentrations and validated the results with the different real water systems in the present study it was hypothesized that various physicochemical parameters would alter the surface chemistry of both nsio2 and the collector quartz sand which would eventually impact its mobility our findings indicate that interactive forces that cause interparticle attraction or repulsion determine the fate of nsio2 in the porous media dlvo interaction energies and cft was used as the mathematical model to validate the observed btcs additionally xrd ftir tem and edax were performed to examine the crystallographic and morphological structure size surface functional group and elemental composition of nsio2 the findings of this study will form a basis for a better understanding of the transport and release behavior of nsio2 in the subsurface environment 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sio2

spectra and uv visible spectrophotometer with a wavelength range of 200 800 nm was employed uv 2600 shimadzu additionally the mean hydrodynamic diameter mhd and surface charge zeta potential of nsio2 were analyzed using 90 plus particle analyzer brookhaven instruments corporation usa the hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles was determined using dynamic light scattering dls and the zeta potential was calculated using the smoluchowski approximation based on their electrophoretic mobility the measurements were recorded at a room temperature of 25 1 c and a scattering angle of 90o to determine the zeta potentials of quartz sand under different chemical conditions ph ionic strengths and humic acid 10 g of pure quartz sand was crushed into fine powder and was mixed with 50 ml of milli q water it was then sonicated for 30 min after which approximately 1 ml of the suspension was loaded into a disposable cuvette and analyzed zhou 2017 the nsio2 suspension was prepared freshly before being used in the column transport experiment in a 150 ml beaker 50 ml of milli q water was taken to which 50 mg l of nsio2 was added at room temperature the ph of the solution was adjusted by adding 0 1 m hcl or naoh to adjust the ph in the acidic or basic range respectively the ionic strength of the solution was changed by adding 10 50 and 100 mm of nacl salt as per the requirement of the experiment the solution was then sonicated with a probe sonicator for 30 min at an amplitude of 40 khz sonics vibra cell 500 w usa zhou et al 2017 after sonication to ensure that the nanoparticle is suspended properly 1 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer a humic acid stock solution of 100 mg l was prepared in a screw cap bottle from the powder by its dissolution in milli q water at ph 7 the screw cap bottle was then kept on a rotary shaker for 24 h for uniform dissolution after which it was filtered using a 0 45 μm nylon membrane filter to remove any coarse particles after which it was kept in refrigerated condition at 4 c for further use jung et al 2014 to check the total organic carbon concentration of the prepared stock solution a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu was employed which showed that the concentration 100 mg l was the same as before after filtration the stock was then serially diluted to achieve the appropriate working concentration 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 2 3 determination of point of zero charge phpzc of nsio2 the point of zero charge phpzc was determined using 0 01 m nacl adjusted to ph 2 4 6 8 and 10 in an aqueous solution of 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh in a screw cap bottle 50 mg l of nsio2 was added in 100 ml of aqueous solution after which they were kept in a rotary shaker for 48 h the ph of the supernatant was then measured using a ph meter after it was decanted the phpzc value of nsio2 was calculated from the plot of initial versus the final ph ph of the supernatant the point at which the final ph intersects the initial ph i e when the initial ph equals the final ph is considered as the point of zero charge rajput et al 2016 2 4 column transport experiments effects of ph ionic strength and nom to confirm that the column setup was functioning well potassium bromide kbr was used as a tracer chemical bromide solution was prepared by dissolving analytical grade kbr in milli q water at ph 7 to obtain a working concentration of 1 mg l even though bromide is a conservative tracer it may interact with nsio2 affecting transportation studies as a result the tracer experiment was conducted separately from the nsio2 transport tests but under the same experimental method and conditions the column effluent was collected periodically and a conductance metre ecotestr was used to assess the bromide ion concentration in terms of electrical conductivity by dipping the probe at a depth of 5 cm masipan et al 2016 fig s1 shows the experimental setup for flow column transport studies transport experiments were performed in a fixed bed glass column reactor internal diameter 1 5 cm and length 30 cm in which quartz sand used as the porous media was loaded using a metal spatula and was gently tapped after each loading to ensure the uniform packing of sand to ensure clean and pristine quality of quartz sand it was washed thoroughly with 0 1 m hcl followed by rinsing with milli q water and was dried completely before each loading a bed height of 5 cm was made and the pore volume and tubing factor were calculated accordingly to stabilize the porous media 5 pore volumes pvs of background solution solution without the nanoparticle was pumped via silicon tube into the glass column using a peristaltic pump miclins pp 30 ex at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min three procedures were used sequentially to conduct the transportation experiments in the beginning in phase i deposition phase 4 pvs of nanoparticle suspension which was homogenized by probe sonication was introduced

100 mg l the column effluent was collected for every pv and was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 265 nm for nsio2 the calibration curves for nsio2 were plotted using several concentration ranges i e 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 mg l vs absorbance measurement obtained from uv vis spectrophotometer based on which the transport of nsio2 was quantified fig s2 the breakthrough curves btcs of c c0 where the concentrations of nanoparticle in influent c0 and effluent c were determined as a function of pv li et al 2011 zhang et al 2020b to establish the reproducibility of the column transport studies all the experiments were carried out in duplicates at a constant room temperature of 25 1 c and the data are presented as mean standard deviation 2 5 calculation of the dlvo interaction energy the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to investigate the electrostatic and van der waals interactions between nanoparticles and quartz sand surfaces as shown in eq 1 1 v total v vdw v edl where vtotal total interaction energy vvdw van der waals interaction energy and vedl electrostatic repulsion the following equations were used to calculate the interaction

2 6 estimation of attachment efficiency and deposition by cft in order to estimate attachment efficiency and hence deposition rates for colloid transport under favourable deposition conditions the clean bed filtration theory cft was developed schrick et al 2004 the phenomena that affect the transport and retention properties of colloid particles in porous media are the true filtration process which consists of brownian diffusion interception and gravitational sedimentation and the physical filtration process which consists of blocking straining and ripening effects the deposition of nanoparticles on the surface of porous media is assumed to occur in two stages i particle collision with the surface and ii particle adherence to the surface the current work seeks a straightforward relationship for estimating particle attachment efficiency and deposition rate with the collector as a result column attachment efficiency α is introduced which is defined as the ratio of the rate of particle deposition on a collector to the rate of collisions with the same collector α can be represented as a function of the relative effluent concentration c c0 in column studies where c0 is the influent concentration and c is the effluent concentration at time t as stated in eq 5 5 α 2 d c 3 1 θ l η 0 ln c c 0 where dc diameter of the quartz sand grain θ porosity of the porous media l length

in in various environmental systems the water samples were collected from a variety of places around the campus such as a municipal tap lat 12 937650669757266 long 79 14840288358211 a dug well lat 12

1 filter paper to remove all the colloidal particles the filtered water was then autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min and the sterilized water samples were used in the transport experiments the methodology of which is similar to that of the column transport experiment as discussed earlier roy et al 2021 the physicochemical characteristics of natural water ph tds ionic strength electrical conductivity and total organic carbon toc were analyzed and presented in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nsio2 the xrd analysis of nsio2 is shown in fig 1a the xrd spectra indicated the existence of amorphous nsio2 due to peak broadening at 2θ 22 diffraction peaks at 2θ 20 88 36 65 39 37 40 25 42 40 and 45 80 corresponding to the reflection from crystal planes 100 110 102 111 200 and 201 respectively jcpds card 850335 clearly indicated the presence of nsio2 the primitive lattice having lattice parameters were a b 4 913 å and c 5 405 å which confirmed a hexagonal crystal structure nandanwar et al 2015 the ft ir spectral analysis of nsio2 is shown in fig 1b the strong bands at 791 cm 1 and 1073 cm 1 correspond to asymmetric and symmetric si o si stretching vibrations the band at 1631 cm 1 indicates the presence of an oh stretching bond the broad peaks in the range 3000 3400 cm 1 correspond to the presence of the oh group all these functional groups confirm the presence of nsio2 saravanan and dubey 2020 fig 1c represents the transmission electron microscope tem image of nsio2 from the tem image it was observed that the shape of nsio2 is almost spherical with an average size of 47 nm the edax spectrum of nsio2 fig 1d confirms the weight of si 58 69 and o 41 31 which signifies the presence of nsio2 without any impurities thus it is in perfect stoichiometry huseynov et al 2016 the uv visible spectra were recorded at room temperature and the absorbance maxima were obtained at 265 nm for nsio2 suspension as shown in fig s3 the uv vis spectra of nsio2 in presence of humic acid is shown in fig s4 a similar result was reported by verma and bhattacharya 2018 which indicate that the value is in good agreement with the literature 3 2 point of zero charge phpzc mean hydrodynamic diameter mhd and surface zeta potential values of the nsio2 suspension in the column transport studies phpzc is an important parameter that determines the working ph conditions required to prevent the nanoparticle aggregation fiol and villaescusa 2009 from the graph fig s5 it can be inferred that the point of zero charge pzc of nsio2 in milli q water is ph 3 9 this is consistent with previous studies reporting a comparable pzc value of ph 3 0 for colloidal nsio2 vidrich et al 2005 phanichphant et al 2016 table s2 represents the mhd and zeta potential values of nsio2 at various solution chemistry ph ionic strength humic acid and influent particle concentration the polydispersity index pdi for nsio2 was 0 28 0 33 under all the experimental conditions indicating uniform colloidal dispersion nidhin et al 2008 the zeta potential of nsio2 varied between 12 21 mv and 28 52 mv at different ph values 5 7 and 9 indicating a threshold of delicate dispersion the electric double layer edl compression induced considerable particle aggregation decreasing the nsio2 surface charge low zeta potential values 8 33 mv to 9 79 mv correlated well with the increased mhd the addition of ha in the colloidal solution stabilized nsio2 the zeta potentials ranged from 37 83 mv and 49 52 mv a decrease in zeta potential 13 92 mv to 5 93 mv with an increase in the nsio2 concentrations 10 to 100 mg l resulted in instability and aggregation of the particles the zeta potential values of nsio2 in river lake and tap water were 42 42 mv 40 53 mv and 39 21 mv respectively indicating excellent nanoparticle stability in the case of groundwater the presence of more tds probably reduced the zeta potential value to 8 74 mv riddick 1968 3 3 influence of various environmental factors on the transport of nsio2 3 3 1 tracer experiment the breakthrough curve for the conservative bromide tracer in the saturated condition is shown in fig s6 symmetrical breakthrough curves with short tailing suggested a uniform flow of bromide solution from a homogeneously packed column at pv 1 more than 90 of the inlet concentration was measured at the column outlet the btc reached a plateau with an average c c0 value of 0 99 0 18 from the column outlet an excellent recovery rate of 99 40 was obtained for bromide ions yecheskel et al 2016 the tracer tests were repeated several times and the average porosity was found to be 0 41 0 01 3 3 2 influence of ph the btcs of nsio2 suspension in various ph 5 7 and 9 is represented in fig 2 the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 2 for ph 5 and 7 and pv 3 for ph 9 at ph 5 and 9 the breakthrough curve of nsio2 increased quickly and then reached a plateau at pv 6 maximum elution of nsio2 occurred in the case of ph 5 followed by ph 9 whereas elution of nsio2 at ph 7 was relatively less as compared to another ph having a maximum c c0 ratio at pv 5 at ph 5 and 9 transport recoveries of nsio2 were 73 56 and 71 66 respectively indicating high mobility and low retention whereas in the case of ph 7 the transport recovery was 58 34 indicating lesser mobility in contrast to ph 5 and 9 due to the leaching of nsio2 from the porous media a small spike was observed at pv 12 in the btcs for suspension of all ph values 5 7 and 9 maximum for ph 5 this suggested reversible binding of nsio2 with quartz sand the btc increased rapidly for all the values of ph which demonstrated that nsio2 was mobile in the column matrix the observations can be explained in terms of zeta potential and cft the zeta potential values of nsio2 table 1 were 12 21 mv 17 48 mv and 26 75 mv while that of quartz sand table s3 were 27 53 mv 32 21 mv and 34 05 mv at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively it suggested that the nsio2 suspension was moderately stable at ph 9 and had a threshold of delicate dispersion at ph 5 and 7 riddick 1968 due to the presence of strong electrostatic double layer edl repulsion between nsio2 and quartz sand which acted as the critical governing mechanism particles were pushed farther away from one another as a result nsio2 was prevented from adhering to the surface of quartz sand and increased transport was observed under these unfavorable conditions overall the enhanced mobility of nsio2 at all ph values was attributed to the negative surface charges of the nanoparticles and quartz sand bayat et al 2015 from table 1 we observed that the attachment efficiency α was high α 0 20 in the case of ph 7 whereas for ph 5 and 9 a lower value of α 0 09 and 0 11 respectively indicated higher mobility of nsio2 jiang et al 2017 3 3 3 influence of ionic strength the btcs of nsio2 suspended in solutions of various ionic strengths 10 50 and 100 mm at ph 7 are represented in fig 3 we observed that the transport of nsio2 was affected by the ionic strength of the colloidal suspension with an increase in the influent s ionic strength a lesser c c0 ratio was observed in the btcs the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 1 for ionic strength 10 and 50 mm and at pv 2 for ionic strength 100 mm maximum elution of nsio2 occurred at ionic strength 10 mm at pv 5 followed by ionic strength 50 and 100 mm at pv 4 the transport recoveries of nsio2 from the column outlet were 45 66 38 37 and 39 for ionic strength 10 50 and 100 mm respectively indicating high retention and low mobility minimal nsio2 leaching from quartz sand resulted in a small rise in the btcs at pv 12 for suspension of all ionic strengths this indicated the reversible binding of nsio2 with quartz sand nsio2 exhibited lesser mobility in the column matrix with an increase in ionic strength 1 100 mm as per the previous reports an increase in the ionic strength of the background solution compresses the edl of nsio2 making them less negatively charged conway et al 2015 reduction in the electrostatic repulsion results in a decrease in the zeta potential of the nsio2 which further alleviates the mobility of the particles conway et al 2015 domingos et al 2013 han et al 2014 however it was observed that when the ionic strength of the suspension was increased from 50 to 100 mm the btc and retention profiles did not decrease drastically this could be because increasing salt concentration was unable to compress the edl of nsio2 after a certain extent this phenomenon could be explained in the terms of critical coagulation concentration ccc previously the researchers reported that in the natural environment a colloidal suspension with high ccc values will be stable zhou et al 2013 zhou and keller 2010 hence ionic strength of 100 mm was unable to further induce aggregation of nsio2 in the colloidal suspension these observations were well supported by the zeta potential values riddick 1968 and cft model too in the solution of ionic strength of 10 mm the zeta potential value of nsio2 decreased to 9 79 mv lying in the unstable region further increase of ionic strength from 50 to 100 mm resulted in zeta potential values of 8 40 and 8 33 mv respectively the zeta potentials of quartz sand under ionic strengths 10 50 and 100 mm were 30 26 25 29 and 21 11 mv respectively the charge on the surface of nsio2 plays a critical role in their transport across porous media under these conditions dunphy guzman et al 2006 reduced surface charge of nsio2 renders the particles unstable and causes them to aggregate and adhere in the presence of ionic strength due to the substantial charge difference between nsio2 and quartz sand the van der walls force of attraction between them increased allowing the larger aggregates to adhere to the quartz sand surface yecheskel et al 2016 from table 1 we observe that the attachment efficiency α was the highest in the case of the suspension with ionic strength of 50 mm followed by 100 mm corresponding to higher deposition rate kd 3 3 4 influence of humic acid addition to study the influence of nom in the terrestrial environment on the transport of nsio2 ha was selected as the representative of nom nsio2 was suspended in ha solution of different concentrations the adsorption of ha changed the surface characteristics of nsio2 which affected their transport pattern johnson et al 2009 the btcs of nsio2 suspended in a solution with various ha concentrations 0 1 1 and 10 mg l at ph 7 is represented in fig 4 the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 1 for all the ha concentrations in the background solution maximum elution of nsio2 observed for 10 mg l of ha concentration at pv 2 followed by 1 mg l at pv 4 and 0 1 mg l at pv 2 the transport recoveries of nsio2 from the column outlet were 84 17 77 56 and 68 58 for ha concentrations 10 1 and 0 1 mg l respectively ha enhanced the mobility of nsio2 in the column matrix to a great extent and lowered the retention a minor peak was seen for 0 1 and 1 mg l concentrations of ha at pv 12 possibly due to the leaching behavior of nsio2 from porous media in the case of a background solution containing 10 mg l of ha no such spike was observed indicating that nsio2 had irreversibly bound to the quartz sand for ha concentration 10 mg l the btc increased rapidly reached a steady state at pv 2 and achieved an extensive plateau it illustrated that nsio2 was highly stable in this condition and ensured maximum mobility in the column matrix for the background solutions with ha concentrations 1 and 0 1 mg l nsio2 was highly stable but with a relatively smaller plateau than the ha concentration of 10 mg l therefore with increasing ha concentration the mobility of nsio2 increased in the column the adsorption of ha on the surface of nsio2 and quartz sand modified the particle s surface chemistry and increased the steric repulsion between them preventing nsio2 aggregation and deposition zhang et al 2020a the ft ir spectrum analysis fig s7 of the humic acid interacted nsio2 shows peaks at 1580 cm 1 and 1730 cm 1 which corresponds to the co bond stretching and the presence of the cooh group respectively fatema et al 2015 the peak obtained at 2980 cm 1 refers to the ch stretching of the methyl groups of aliphatics alberts and filip 1998 all these functional groups confirm the adsorption of ha on the surface of nsio2 the above observations could be explained by the zeta potential data also in the presence of solutions containing 0 1 1 and 10 mg l of ha a surface charge of 37 83 mv 43 40 mv and 49 52 mv was obtained for nsio2 and 33 38 mv 37 02 mv and 38 62 mv for quartz sand was obtained respectively it signified that the carboxyl group r cooh of humic acid drastically enhanced the colloidal stability of nsio2 by increasing the electrostatic repulsion among the the particles additionally since both nsio2 and quartz sand have incredibly high negative charges on their surfaces they showed strong edl repulsion among them as a result of this repulsive force which is the key mechanism nsio2 had a poor propensity for attaching to the sand grain surfaces thereby enhancing the transport of nsio2 through porous media abe et al 2011 from table 1 we noted that the attachment efficiency α was higher in the case of suspension with 0 1 mg l of ha indicating more retention than 1 and 10 mg l of ha concentrations increased concentrations of ha in the suspension decreased the attachment efficiency α and deposition rate kd riddick 1968 zhang et al 2020a 3 3 5 influence of nanoparticle concentrations the btcs of different influent concentrations of nsio2 10 50 and 100 mg l at ph 7 is represented in fig 5 the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 2 for 10 and 50 mg l whereas no such breakthrough was observed in the case of 100 mg l of influent nsio2 maximum elution of nsio2 occurred for both the nsio2 concentrations 10 and 50 mg l at pv 6 and pv 5 respectively the transport recoveries of nsio2 from the column outlet were 41 73 39 67 and 6 89 for particle concentrations 10 50 and 100 mg l respectively a small peak was observed in the btcs at pv 12 for 10 and 50 mg l of nsio2 concentrations corresponding to the reversible binding of nsio2 with quartz sand zhang et al 2020a no such spike was seen in the case of 100 mg l of nsio2 concentration it suggested very high deposition and irreversible binding of nsio2 with quartz sand for 10 and 50 mg l of nsio2 concentrations a low btc was observed as the high ionic strength 100 mm in the background solution possibly compressed the edl of both nsio2 and quartz sand as per colloidal stability theory compression of edl reduced the magnitude of zeta potential of nsio2 which in turn lowered the electrostatic repulsion among them previous studies have also incorporated nacl final concentration 100 mm while studying the transport behavior of different concentrations of nsio2 through the sand column wang et al 2012 the increase in nsio2 concentration from 10 to 100 mg l played a significant role in particle deposition and retention in this case btc was not observed for 100 mg l of nsio2 as an increase in influent particle concentration increased the brownian motion of nsio2 causing the particle to form large aggregates baalousha 2009 maximova and dahl 2006 the results are well supported by the zeta potential measurements at nsio2 concentrations 10 and 50 mg l the particles were unstable and tend to aggregate which resulted in a surface charge of 13 92 and 8 39 mv at particle concentration 100 mg l the suspension was highly unstable and the surface charge obtained was 5 93 mv at is 100 mm the zeta potential of quartz sand was determined to be 21 11 mv due to the considerable difference in surface charges between the nsio2 and quartz sand an increase in the van der waals force of attraction induced the nsio2 to aggregate and enhanced their affinity to adhere to the quartz sand surface as a result the attachment process is the critical mechanism for nsio2 retention in the quartz sand porous media attachment efficiency α and deposition rate kd was maximum for 100 mg l of nsio2 concentration as a consequence of which deposition of nsio2 increased in the sand column table 1 furthermore a larger hydrodynamic diameter 1200 nm of nsio2 justified the phenomenon since it had a higher possibility of being intercepted by the quartz sand for 10 and 50 mg l of particle concentration the α and kd were less as result mobility of nsio2 improved considerably 3 4 transport behavior of nsio2 in the different environmental water matrix fig 6 represents the observed btcs for the transport of nsio2 suspended in various real water samples to mimic the natural environment table s1 lists the distinct characteristics of tap ground lake and river water the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 1 for all the environmental water samples maximum elution of nsio2 occurred in the case of river water followed by the lake and tap water a significant reduction of btc was observed for nsio2 in the case of groundwater the percentage recovery of nsio2 obtained at the column outlet was 78 51 73 12 71 50 and 25 17 for river lake tap and groundwater respectively leaching of nsio2 from the porous media occurred for tap and groundwater which was indicated by the presence of a small spike at pv 12 in the btc in river and lake water due to the presence of an exorbitant amount of nom irreversible binding of nsio2 occurred with the porous media in the case of river and lake water the btc increased steeply and an extensive plateau was observed which indicated very high mobility and less retention this might be attributed to the very high concentration of nom present in river and lake water lowry et al 2012 several studies have shown that when the concentration of nom increases 30 mg l the stability of the nanoparticles increases greatly and agglomeration is prevented maurer jones et al 2013 the concentration of nom dominates its effect over ionic strength as a result a high c c0 ratio was obtained for river and lake water domingos et al 2013 the zeta potential values for nsio2 suspended in river and lake water was 42 42 and 40 53 mv respectively a rise in the magnitude of zeta potential enhanced the steric repulsion among the nanoparticles and quartz sand increasing the mobility in the case of tap water nsio2 showed high mobility in the column matrix and the btc reached a steady state at pv3 the zeta potential value of nsio2 at ph 7 was 17 48 mv as a consequence a high electrostatic repulsion prevailed among the nanoparticles which greatly enhanced their stability and transport in the porous medium baalousha et al 2012 in the groundwater due to the presence of a high concentration of dissolved salts it limited the transport of nsio2 conway et al 2015 han et al 2014 from table 1 we observed that the α and k d were high in the case of groundwater indicating high deposition and retention in the case of river water followed by the lake and tap water lower value of α and k d indicated less retention and increased transport 3 5 dlvo interaction energy profiles to understand the mechanism s governing the nanoparticle aggregation and deposition in environment dlvo interaction energies were computed between nsio2 and the collector sand the dlvo interaction energy profiles for nsio2 suspended in the solutions with varied background chemistry ph ionic strength humic acid and particle concentration were demonstrated as a function of separation distance fig 7 nsio2 and quartz sand interactions were repulsive under all the investigated circumstances indicating unfavorable deposition conditions the repulsive forces between the nsio2 and quartz sand surfaces resulted in elevated energy barriers and the absence of secondary minima under these conditions table s4 positive interaction energy profiles were obtained when nsio2 was suspended in milli q water with different ph values 5 7 and 9 at ph 9 high electrostatic repulsion was observed between nsio2 and quartz sand at ph 5 and 7 the entire interaction energy was repulsive however the energy barrier dropped steadily with decrease in ph and with increasing distance between the particle and the collector the colloids remained kinetically stable given the substantial values of the maximum energy barriers φmax for ph 5 7 and 9 it was expected that the deposition of nsio2 onto the quartz sand surface would be limited resulting in high mobility as a result the c c0 ratios of nsio2 btcs suspended in background solution of various ph values were significantly increased when nsio2 was suspended in the background solutions of desired ionic strength 10 50 and 100 mm positive interaction energy profiles were obtained the presence of the salts increases the amount of counterions migrating to the nanoparticles solvation layer thereby decreasing the debye length and repulsive electrostatic forces in the light of the low φmax values it was projected that the van der waals force of attraction would significantly increase the primary minimum tended to increase as the ionic strength was increased from 10 to 100 mm due to the decreased repulsion and enhanced attraction of nsio2 with quartz sand the nanoparticle aggregated and retained more in the column matrix therefore lesser c c0 values were obtained in the btcs of nsio2 suspended in background solution of various ionic strengths in case of nsio2 suspended in a background solution containing varying concentrations of humic acid 0 1 1 and 10 mg l the particle and quartz sand displayed strong electrostatic repulsion with increasing humic acid concentration an increase in the height of φmax was noticed which prevented the aggregation and deposition of nsio2 on quartz sand according to the dlvo interaction energy profiles adding humic acid at environmentally relevant concentrations enhanced nsio2 stability and dispersity which corroborated the high c c0 values observed in the btcs when the influent nanoparticle concentration was varied the dlvo interaction energy profiles indicated strong van der waals force of attraction between the particles and the quartz sand the primary minimum for the nsio2 sand interaction increased significantly as the particle concentration was increased from 10 to 100 mg l the calculated total interaction energies resulted in a lower energy barrier φmax as a result increased deposition of nsio2 occurred on the quartz sand surface corroborating the lower c c0 values obtained in the btcs when nsio2 was suspended in the river lake tap and ground water positive interaction energy profiles were noted the height of the maximum energy barrier φmax increased dramatically in the river lake and tap waters this may be attributed to the presence of strong electrostatic repulsion between nsio2 and quartz sand the colloid was highly stable allowing it to flow freely through the sand column as evidenced by the btcs the primary minimum increased and the φmax decreased when nsio2 was suspended in the ground water it indicated that nsio2 was more prone to deposition onto the surface of quartz sand in ground water than other environmental waters 4 conclusion in the present study the transport and retention behavior of nsio2 in the presence of environmentally relevant physicochemical parameters were investigated the presence of natural organic matter and modifying the ph of the nsio2 suspensions promoted their mobility and transport the key findings of this study suggest that nom induced repulsive forces stabilized the nanoparticles resulting in improved transport of nsio2 in the porous media further it can be concluded that salt and particle concentrations were also key determinants that affected the transport of nsio2 at higher ionic strengths and particle concentrations the nsio2 would aggregate in the porous media the btcs of the nsio2 was successfully simulated with the help of cft under various experimental conditions dlvo interaction energy profiles were employed successfully to interpret these effects the real water samples gnerellay containing a high amount of naturally occurring humic substances markedly increased the transport phenomenon water reserves that possess a high concentration of dissolved salts impeded the mobility and transport of nsio2 to gain better insights the transport behavior of nsio2 can be evaluated in complex representative

1311,nano silica nsio2 induces potential harmful effects on the living environment and human health it is well established that sio2 facilitates the co transport of a variety of other contaminants including heavy metals and pesticides the current study focused on the systematic evaluation of the effects of multiple physicochemical parameters such as ph 5 7 and 9 ionic strength 10 50 and 100 mm and humic acid 0 1 1 and 10 mg l on the transport and retention of nsio2 in saturated porous medium additionally the influent concentration of nsio2 10 50 and 100 mg l was also varied our experimental findings indicate that the size of nsio2 aggregates was directly related to the ph ionic strength ha and particle concentration had a significant impact on the breakthrough curves btcs the stability provided by the varying concentrations of ph and humic acid had a significant effect on the size of nsio2 aggregates and transport c c0 0 7 the presence of a greater magnitude of negative charge on the surface of both nsio2 and quartz sand resulted in less aggregation and enhanced flow of nsio2 through the sand column the electrostatic and steric repulsion forces were the primary governing mechanisms in relation to the size of nsio2 aggregates affecting the single collector efficiency and attachment efficiency which determined the maximal transport of nsio2 conversely a probable increase in van der waals force of attraction exacerbated the particle deposition and reduced their mobility for high ionic strength and particle concentrations c c0 0 1 the formation of large nsio2 aggregates in particular was principally responsible for the enhancement of nsio2 retention in sand columns over a broad range of is and particle concentration the interaction energy profiles based on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory were determined to understand the mechanism of nsio2 deposition aditionally all the experimental btcs were mathematically simulated and justified by the colloidal filtration theory cft considering the environmental ramifications the transport behavior of nsio2 was further evaluated in various natural matrices such as river lake ground and tap water the nsio2 suspended in the river lake and tap water had significantly higher mobility c c0 0 7 whereas groundwater indicated higher retention c c0 0 3 the study advances our collective knowledge of physicochemical and environmental parameters that can affect particle mobility graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nsio2 porous media dlvo theory cft transport retention 1 introduction nano silica is a non metallic inorganic material that is widely produced and has significant industrial applications wang et al 2016b they are frequently employed as catalyst carriers and abrasive agents zhang et al 2020b nsio2 also acts as a potential adsorbent for the removal of contaminants and heavy metals like lead from aquatic ecosystems shukla et al 2015 furthermore the negative charge on nsio2 provides a large number of electrostatic binding sites which enhances their utility in medicinal and biotechnological applications laranjeira et al 2017 a recent study indicated that highly dispersive silicate glass particles were discharged during the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant disaster enhanced the transfer of contaminants in subsurface environments resulting in environmental pollution fujita and kobayashi 2016 inexorable amounts of nsio2 released into the environment may pose a threat to both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems ayatallahzadeh shirazi et al 2016 reported that nsio2 has toxic effects like decreased cell viability on marine microalgae dunaliella salina nsio2 also impacts the animal morphology and behavioral parameters in hydra vulgaris cnidaria ambrosone et al 2014 in addition nsio2 causes dna damage inflammatory reactions and cell cycle arrest in a variety of cell types croissant et al 2020 therefore it is important to critically analyze the toxic impacts of nsio2 in different environmental matrices highly dispersible colloidal silica improves the mobility of pollutants that are firmly adsorbed numerous research has highlighted the fact that silica nanoparticles facilitate the co transport of various environmental pollutants sio2 was found to promote the transport of heavy metals pb2 and cd2 in a recent study due to the significant adsorption of positively charged heavy metal ions on its negatively charged surface in a separate study it was reported that silica enhanced the retention of virus escherichia coli phage in the saturated porous media qin et al 2020 whereas under unsaturated conditions it concomitantly facilitated the transport of virus by electrostatic repulsion of similarly charged particles wang et al 2016a studied the co transport of nsio2 and pesticide acetamiprid in biochar amended porous media by competing for binding sites on the biochar surfaces the co presence of acetamiprid and nsio2 in the solutions improved the transport of both acetamiprid and nps in the biochar amended sand the infiltration caused by rainfall or irrigation can transport the nanoparticles from the topsoil zone to the saturated zone babakhani et al 2017 nsio2 increases the stability of other metal oxide nanoparticles tio2 zno and cuo and enhances their percolation into the soil layers of municipal waste landfills hence reducing the effectiveness of the soil layer further the transport behavior of nanoparticles is generally affected by organic matter and chemicals present in porous mediums wang et al 2016b it is important to understand that realistic exposure parameters such as ph ionic strength natural organic matter nom can alter the physicochemical properties and hence the transport pattern of nsio2 abbas et al 2020 amirbahman and olson 1995 thorough knowledge of the fate and movement of nsio2 in porous media is essential for designing reliable waste management and disposal methods for nsio2 to avoid nanoparticle contamination in the environment over the recent years the research on the transport of several nanoparticles including tio2 khan and şengül 2016 agnps cornelis et al 2013 zno sun et al 2015 feo carstens et al 2017 cnt sharma and fagerlund 2015 al2o3 rahman et al 2013 have received considerable attention previous reports suggest that different environmental factors have a strong role to play in modifying the surface characteristics of the nanoparticles this will determine their mobility or deposition in the transport media bueno et al 2022 fujita and kobayashi 2016 investiagated the effect of charge on the transport of colloidal silica in quartz sand a narrow range of ph 5 to 7 was selected to perform the study the effect of alkaline ph on the transport phenomenon was not considered in another study the effect of humic acid on the transport of colloidal silica was examined under different hydrochemical conditions zhou et al 2017 collidal silica was passed through the sand column suspended in 10 mg l of humic acid solution the effect of varying the humic acid concentrations on nsio2 transport was not analyzed here the transport and retention of various engineered metal oxide nanoparticles al2o3 tio2 and sio2 in quartz sand was emphasized by bayat et al 2015 the transport behavior was evaluated considering only a single influent concentration of 50 mg l nsio2 the influence of particle concentrations on the nanoparticle retention and transport in the porous media is another factor that requires more attention overall numerous research gaps remain to be addressed regarding transport of nano sio2 in saturated porous media to the best of our knowledge this is the first ever work that systaematically investigated the transport behavior of nsio2 in the saturated porous medium at different ph ionic strength nom and influent particle concentrations and validated the results with the different real water systems in the present study it was hypothesized that various physicochemical parameters would alter the surface chemistry of both nsio2 and the collector quartz sand which would eventually impact its mobility our findings indicate that interactive forces that cause interparticle attraction or repulsion determine the fate of nsio2 in the porous media dlvo interaction energies and cft was used as the mathematical model to validate the observed btcs additionally xrd ftir tem and edax were performed to examine the crystallographic and morphological structure size surface functional group and elemental composition of nsio2 the findings of this study will form a basis for a better understanding of the transport and release behavior of nsio2 in the subsurface environment 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials sio2

spectra and uv visible spectrophotometer with a wavelength range of 200 800 nm was employed uv 2600 shimadzu additionally the mean hydrodynamic diameter mhd and surface charge zeta potential of nsio2 were analyzed using 90 plus particle analyzer brookhaven instruments corporation usa the hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticles was determined using dynamic light scattering dls and the zeta potential was calculated using the smoluchowski approximation based on their electrophoretic mobility the measurements were recorded at a room temperature of 25 1 c and a scattering angle of 90o to determine the zeta potentials of quartz sand under different chemical conditions ph ionic strengths and humic acid 10 g of pure quartz sand was crushed into fine powder and was mixed with 50 ml of milli q water it was then sonicated for 30 min after which approximately 1 ml of the suspension was loaded into a disposable cuvette and analyzed zhou 2017 the nsio2 suspension was prepared freshly before being used in the column transport experiment in a 150 ml beaker 50 ml of milli q water was taken to which 50 mg l of nsio2 was added at room temperature the ph of the solution was adjusted by adding 0 1 m hcl or naoh to adjust the ph in the acidic or basic range respectively the ionic strength of the solution was changed by adding 10 50 and 100 mm of nacl salt as per the requirement of the experiment the solution was then sonicated with a probe sonicator for 30 min at an amplitude of 40 khz sonics vibra cell 500 w usa zhou et al 2017 after sonication to ensure that the nanoparticle is suspended properly 1 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer a humic acid stock solution of 100 mg l was prepared in a screw cap bottle from the powder by its dissolution in milli q water at ph 7 the screw cap bottle was then kept on a rotary shaker for 24 h for uniform dissolution after which it was filtered using a 0 45 μm nylon membrane filter to remove any coarse particles after which it was kept in refrigerated condition at 4 c for further use jung et al 2014 to check the total organic carbon concentration of the prepared stock solution a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu was employed which showed that the concentration 100 mg l was the same as before after filtration the stock was then serially diluted to achieve the appropriate working concentration 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 2 3 determination of point of zero charge phpzc of nsio2 the point of zero charge phpzc was determined using 0 01 m nacl adjusted to ph 2 4 6 8 and 10 in an aqueous solution of 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh in a screw cap bottle 50 mg l of nsio2 was added in 100 ml of aqueous solution after which they were kept in a rotary shaker for 48 h the ph of the supernatant was then measured using a ph meter after it was decanted the phpzc value of nsio2 was calculated from the plot of initial versus the final ph ph of the supernatant the point at which the final ph intersects the initial ph i e when the initial ph equals the final ph is considered as the point of zero charge rajput et al 2016 2 4 column transport experiments effects of ph ionic strength and nom to confirm that the column setup was functioning well potassium bromide kbr was used as a tracer chemical bromide solution was prepared by dissolving analytical grade kbr in milli q water at ph 7 to obtain a working concentration of 1 mg l even though bromide is a conservative tracer it may interact with nsio2 affecting transportation studies as a result the tracer experiment was conducted separately from the nsio2 transport tests but under the same experimental method and conditions the column effluent was collected periodically and a conductance metre ecotestr was used to assess the bromide ion concentration in terms of electrical conductivity by dipping the probe at a depth of 5 cm masipan et al 2016 fig s1 shows the experimental setup for flow column transport studies transport experiments were performed in a fixed bed glass column reactor internal diameter 1 5 cm and length 30 cm in which quartz sand used as the porous media was loaded using a metal spatula and was gently tapped after each loading to ensure the uniform packing of sand to ensure clean and pristine quality of quartz sand it was washed thoroughly with 0 1 m hcl followed by rinsing with milli q water and was dried completely before each loading a bed height of 5 cm was made and the pore volume and tubing factor were calculated accordingly to stabilize the porous media 5 pore volumes pvs of background

2 6 estimation of attachment efficiency and deposition by cft in order to estimate attachment efficiency and hence deposition rates for colloid transport under favourable deposition conditions the clean bed filtration theory cft was developed schrick et al 2004 the phenomena that affect the transport and retention properties of colloid particles in porous media are the true filtration process which consists of brownian diffusion interception and gravitational sedimentation and the physical filtration process which consists of blocking straining and ripening effects the deposition of nanoparticles on the surface of porous media is assumed to occur in two stages i particle collision with the surface and ii particle adherence to the surface the current work seeks a straightforward relationship for estimating particle attachment efficiency and deposition rate with the collector as a result column attachment efficiency α is introduced which is defined as the ratio of the rate of particle deposition on a collector to the rate of collisions with the same collector α can be represented as a function of the relative effluent concentration c c0 in column studies where c0 is the influent concentration and c is the effluent concentration at time t as stated in eq 5 5 α 2 d c 3 1 θ l η 0 ln c c 0 where dc diameter of the quartz sand grain θ porosity of the porous media l length

nandanwar et al 2015 the ft ir spectral analysis of nsio2 is shown in fig 1b the strong bands at 791 cm 1 and 1073 cm 1 correspond to asymmetric and symmetric si o si stretching vibrations the band at 1631 cm 1 indicates the presence of an oh stretching bond the broad peaks in the range 3000 3400 cm 1 correspond to the presence of the oh group all these functional groups confirm the presence of nsio2 saravanan and dubey 2020 fig 1c represents the transmission electron microscope tem image of nsio2 from the tem image it was observed that the shape of nsio2 is almost spherical with an average size of 47 nm the edax spectrum of nsio2 fig 1d confirms the weight of si 58 69 and o 41 31 which signifies the presence of nsio2 without any impurities thus it is in perfect stoichiometry huseynov et al 2016 the uv visible spectra were recorded at room temperature and the absorbance maxima were obtained at 265 nm for nsio2 suspension as shown in fig s3 the uv vis spectra of nsio2 in presence of humic acid is shown in fig s4 a similar result was reported by verma and bhattacharya 2018 which indicate that the value is in good agreement with the literature 3 2 point of zero charge phpzc mean hydrodynamic diameter mhd and surface zeta potential values of the nsio2 suspension in the column transport studies phpzc is an important parameter that determines the working ph conditions required to prevent the nanoparticle aggregation fiol and villaescusa 2009 from the graph fig s5 it can be inferred that the point of zero charge pzc of nsio2 in milli q water is ph 3 9 this is consistent with previous studies reporting a comparable pzc value of ph 3 0 for colloidal nsio2 vidrich et al 2005 phanichphant et al 2016 table s2 represents the mhd and zeta potential values of nsio2 at various solution chemistry ph ionic strength humic acid and influent particle concentration the polydispersity index pdi for nsio2 was 0 28 0 33 under all the experimental conditions indicating uniform colloidal dispersion nidhin et al 2008 the zeta potential of nsio2 varied between 12 21 mv and 28 52 mv at different ph values 5 7 and 9 indicating a threshold of delicate dispersion the electric double layer edl compression induced considerable particle aggregation decreasing the nsio2 surface charge low zeta potential values 8 33 mv to 9 79 mv correlated well with the increased mhd the addition of ha in the colloidal solution stabilized nsio2 the zeta potentials ranged from 37 83 mv and 49 52 mv a decrease in zeta potential 13 92 mv to 5 93 mv with an increase in the nsio2 concentrations 10 to 100 mg l resulted in instability and aggregation of the particles the zeta potential values of nsio2 in river lake and tap water were 42 42 mv 40 53 mv and 39 21 mv respectively indicating excellent nanoparticle stability in the case of groundwater the presence of more tds probably reduced the zeta potential value to 8 74 mv riddick 1968 3 3 influence of various environmental factors on the transport of nsio2 3 3 1 tracer experiment the breakthrough curve for the conservative bromide tracer in the saturated condition is shown in fig s6 symmetrical breakthrough curves with short tailing suggested a uniform flow of bromide solution from a homogeneously packed column at pv 1 more than 90 of the inlet concentration was measured at the column outlet the btc reached a plateau with an average c c0 value of 0 99 0 18 from the column outlet an excellent recovery rate of 99 40 was obtained for bromide ions yecheskel et al 2016 the tracer tests were repeated several times and the average porosity was found to be 0 41 0 01 3 3 2 influence of ph the btcs of nsio2 suspension in various ph 5 7 and 9 is represented in fig 2 the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 2 for ph 5 and 7 and pv 3 for ph 9 at ph 5 and 9 the breakthrough curve of nsio2 increased quickly and then reached a plateau at pv 6 maximum elution of nsio2 occurred in the case of ph 5 followed by ph 9 whereas elution of nsio2 at ph 7 was relatively less as compared to another ph having a maximum c c0 ratio at pv 5 at ph 5 and 9 transport recoveries of nsio2 were 73 56 and 71 66 respectively indicating high mobility and low retention whereas in the case of ph 7 the transport recovery was 58 34 indicating lesser mobility in contrast to ph 5 and 9 due to the leaching of nsio2 from the porous media a small spike was observed at pv 12 in the btcs for suspension of all ph values 5 7 and 9 maximum for ph 5 this suggested reversible binding of nsio2 with quartz sand the btc increased rapidly for all the values of ph which demonstrated that nsio2 was mobile in the column matrix the observations can be explained in terms of zeta potential and cft the zeta potential values of nsio2 table 1 were 12 21 mv 17 48 mv and 26 75 mv while that of quartz sand table s3 were 27 53 mv 32 21 mv and 34 05 mv at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively it suggested that the nsio2 suspension was moderately stable at ph 9 and had a threshold of delicate dispersion at ph 5 and 7 riddick 1968 due to the presence of strong electrostatic double layer edl repulsion between nsio2 and quartz sand which acted as the critical governing mechanism particles were pushed farther away from one another as a result nsio2 was prevented from adhering to the surface of quartz sand and increased transport was observed under these unfavorable conditions overall the enhanced mobility of nsio2 at all ph values was attributed to the negative surface charges of the nanoparticles and quartz sand bayat et al 2015 from table 1 we observed that the attachment efficiency α was high α 0 20 in the case of ph 7 whereas for ph 5 and 9 a lower value of α 0 09 and 0 11 respectively indicated higher mobility of nsio2 jiang et al 2017 3 3 3 influence of ionic strength the btcs of nsio2 suspended in solutions of various ionic strengths 10 50 and 100 mm at ph 7 are represented in fig 3 we observed that the transport of nsio2 was affected by the ionic strength of the colloidal suspension with an increase in the influent s ionic strength a lesser c c0 ratio was observed in the btcs the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 1 for ionic strength 10 and 50 mm and at pv 2 for ionic strength 100 mm maximum elution of nsio2 occurred at ionic strength 10 mm at pv 5 followed by ionic strength 50 and 100 mm at pv 4 the transport recoveries of nsio2 from the column outlet were 45 66 38 37 and 39 for ionic strength 10 50 and 100 mm respectively indicating high retention and low mobility minimal nsio2 leaching from quartz sand resulted in a small rise in the btcs at pv 12 for suspension of all ionic strengths this indicated the reversible binding of nsio2 with quartz sand nsio2 exhibited lesser mobility in the column matrix with an increase in ionic strength 1 100 mm as per the previous reports an increase in the ionic strength of the background solution compresses the edl of nsio2 making them less negatively charged conway et al 2015 reduction in the electrostatic repulsion results in a decrease in the zeta potential of the nsio2 which further alleviates the mobility of the particles conway et al 2015 domingos et al 2013 han et al 2014 however it was observed that when the ionic strength of the suspension was increased from 50 to 100 mm the btc and retention profiles did not decrease drastically this could be because increasing salt concentration was unable to compress the edl of nsio2 after a certain extent this phenomenon could be explained in the terms of critical coagulation concentration ccc previously the researchers reported that in the natural environment a colloidal suspension with high ccc values will be stable zhou et al 2013 zhou and keller 2010 hence ionic strength of 100 mm was unable to further induce aggregation of nsio2 in the colloidal suspension these observations were well supported by the zeta potential values riddick 1968 and cft model too in the solution of ionic strength of 10 mm the zeta potential value of nsio2 decreased to 9 79 mv lying in the unstable region further increase of ionic strength from 50 to 100 mm resulted in zeta potential values of 8 40 and 8 33 mv respectively the zeta potentials of quartz sand under ionic strengths 10 50 and 100 mm were 30 26 25 29 and 21 11 mv respectively the charge on the surface of nsio2 plays a critical role in their transport across porous media under these conditions dunphy guzman et al 2006 reduced surface charge of nsio2 renders the particles unstable and causes them to aggregate and adhere in the presence of ionic strength due to the substantial charge difference between nsio2 and quartz sand the van der walls force of attraction between them increased allowing the larger aggregates to adhere to the quartz sand surface yecheskel et al 2016 from table 1 we observe that the attachment efficiency α was the highest in the case of the suspension with ionic strength of 50 mm followed by 100 mm corresponding to higher deposition rate kd 3 3 4 influence of humic acid addition to study the influence of nom in the terrestrial environment on the transport of nsio2 ha was selected as the representative of nom nsio2 was suspended in ha solution of different concentrations the adsorption of ha changed the surface characteristics of nsio2 which affected their transport pattern johnson et al 2009 the btcs of nsio2 suspended in a solution with various ha concentrations 0 1 1 and 10 mg l at ph 7 is represented in fig 4 the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 1 for all the ha concentrations in the background solution maximum elution of nsio2 observed for 10 mg l of ha concentration at pv 2 followed by 1 mg l at pv 4 and 0 1 mg l at pv 2 the transport recoveries of nsio2 from the column outlet were 84 17 77 56 and 68 58 for ha concentrations 10 1 and 0 1 mg l respectively ha enhanced the mobility of nsio2 in the column matrix to a great extent and lowered the retention a minor peak was seen for 0 1 and 1 mg l concentrations of ha at pv 12 possibly due to the leaching behavior of nsio2 from porous media in the case of a background solution containing 10 mg l of ha no such spike was observed indicating that nsio2 had irreversibly bound to the quartz sand for ha concentration 10 mg l the btc increased rapidly reached a steady state at pv 2 and achieved an extensive plateau it illustrated that nsio2 was highly stable in this condition and ensured maximum mobility in the column matrix for the background solutions with ha concentrations 1 and 0 1 mg l nsio2 was highly stable but with a relatively smaller plateau than the ha concentration of 10 mg l therefore with increasing ha concentration the mobility of nsio2 increased in the column the adsorption of ha on the surface of nsio2 and quartz sand modified the particle s surface chemistry and increased the steric repulsion between them preventing nsio2 aggregation and deposition zhang et al 2020a the ft ir spectrum analysis fig s7 of the humic acid interacted nsio2 shows peaks at 1580 cm 1 and 1730 cm 1 which corresponds to the co bond stretching and the presence of the cooh group respectively fatema et al 2015 the peak obtained at 2980 cm 1 refers to the ch stretching of the methyl groups of aliphatics alberts and filip 1998 all these functional groups confirm the adsorption of ha on the surface of nsio2 the above observations could be explained by the zeta potential data also in the presence of solutions containing 0 1 1 and 10 mg l of ha a surface charge of 37 83 mv 43 40 mv and 49 52 mv was obtained for nsio2 and 33 38 mv 37 02 mv and 38 62 mv for quartz sand was obtained respectively it signified that the carboxyl group r cooh of humic acid drastically enhanced the colloidal stability of nsio2 by increasing the electrostatic repulsion among the the particles additionally since both nsio2 and quartz sand have incredibly high negative charges on their surfaces they showed strong edl repulsion among them as a result of this repulsive force which is the key mechanism nsio2 had a poor propensity for attaching to the sand grain surfaces thereby enhancing the transport of nsio2 through porous media abe et al 2011 from table 1 we noted that the attachment efficiency α was higher in the case of suspension with 0 1 mg l of ha indicating more retention than 1 and 10 mg l of ha concentrations increased concentrations of ha in the suspension decreased the attachment efficiency α and deposition rate kd riddick 1968 zhang et al 2020a 3 3 5 influence of nanoparticle concentrations the btcs of different influent concentrations of nsio2 10 50 and 100 mg l at ph 7 is represented in fig 5 the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 2 for 10 and 50 mg l whereas no such breakthrough was observed in the case of 100 mg l of influent nsio2 maximum elution of nsio2 occurred for both the nsio2 concentrations 10 and 50 mg l at pv 6 and pv 5 respectively the transport recoveries of nsio2 from the column outlet were 41 73 39 67 and 6 89 for particle concentrations 10 50 and 100 mg l respectively a small peak was observed in the btcs at pv 12 for 10 and 50 mg l of nsio2 concentrations corresponding to the reversible binding of nsio2 with quartz sand zhang et al 2020a no such spike was seen in the case of 100 mg l of nsio2 concentration it suggested very high deposition and irreversible binding of nsio2 with quartz sand for 10 and 50 mg l of nsio2 concentrations a low btc was observed as the high ionic strength 100 mm in the background solution possibly compressed the edl of both nsio2 and quartz sand as per colloidal stability theory compression of edl reduced the magnitude of zeta potential of nsio2 which in turn lowered the electrostatic repulsion among them previous studies have also incorporated nacl final concentration 100 mm while studying the transport behavior of different concentrations of nsio2 through the sand column wang et al 2012 the increase in nsio2 concentration from 10 to 100 mg l played a significant role in particle deposition and retention in this case btc was not observed for 100 mg l of nsio2 as an increase in influent particle concentration increased the brownian motion of nsio2 causing the particle to form large aggregates baalousha 2009 maximova and dahl 2006 the results are well supported by the zeta potential measurements at nsio2 concentrations 10 and 50 mg l the particles were unstable and tend to aggregate which resulted in a surface charge of 13 92 and 8 39 mv at particle concentration 100 mg l the suspension was highly unstable and the surface charge obtained was 5 93 mv at is 100 mm the zeta potential of quartz sand was determined to be 21 11 mv due to the considerable difference in surface charges between the nsio2 and quartz sand an increase in the van der waals force of attraction induced the nsio2 to aggregate and enhanced their affinity to adhere to the quartz sand surface as a result the attachment process is the critical mechanism for nsio2 retention in the quartz sand porous media attachment efficiency α and deposition rate kd was maximum for 100 mg l of nsio2 concentration as a consequence of which deposition of nsio2 increased in the sand column table 1 furthermore a larger hydrodynamic diameter 1200 nm of nsio2 justified the phenomenon since it had a higher possibility of being intercepted by the quartz sand for 10 and 50 mg l of particle concentration the α and kd were less as result mobility of nsio2 improved considerably 3 4 transport behavior of nsio2 in the different environmental water matrix fig 6 represents the observed btcs for the transport of nsio2 suspended in various real water samples to mimic the natural environment table s1 lists the distinct characteristics of tap ground lake and river water the breakthrough point was obtained at pv 1 for all the environmental water samples maximum elution of nsio2 occurred in the case of river water followed by the lake and tap water a significant reduction of btc was observed for nsio2 in the case of groundwater the percentage recovery of nsio2 obtained at the column outlet was 78 51 73 12 71 50 and 25 17 for river lake tap and groundwater respectively leaching of nsio2 from the porous media occurred for tap and groundwater which was indicated by the presence of a small spike at pv 12 in the btc in river and lake water due to the presence of an exorbitant amount of nom irreversible binding of nsio2 occurred with the porous media in the case of river and lake water the btc increased steeply and an extensive plateau was observed which indicated very high mobility and less retention this might be attributed to the very high concentration of nom present in river and lake water lowry et al 2012 several studies have shown that when the concentration of nom increases 30 mg l the stability of the nanoparticles increases greatly and agglomeration is prevented maurer jones et al 2013 the concentration of nom dominates its effect over ionic strength as a result a high c c0 ratio was obtained for river and lake water domingos et al 2013 the zeta potential values for nsio2 suspended in river and lake water was 42 42 and 40 53 mv respectively a rise in the magnitude of zeta potential enhanced the steric repulsion among the nanoparticles and quartz sand increasing the mobility in the case of tap water nsio2 showed high mobility in the column matrix and the btc reached a steady state at pv3 the zeta potential value of nsio2 at ph 7 was 17 48 mv as a consequence a high electrostatic repulsion prevailed among the nanoparticles which greatly enhanced their stability and transport in the porous medium baalousha et al 2012 in the groundwater due to the presence of a high concentration of dissolved salts it limited the transport of nsio2 conway et al 2015 han et al 2014 from table 1 we observed that the α and k d were high in the case of groundwater indicating high deposition and retention in the case of river water followed by the lake and tap water lower value of α and k d indicated less retention and increased transport 3 5 dlvo interaction energy profiles to understand the mechanism s governing the nanoparticle aggregation and deposition in environment dlvo interaction energies were computed between nsio2 and the collector sand the dlvo interaction energy profiles for nsio2 suspended in the solutions with varied background chemistry ph ionic strength humic acid and particle concentration were demonstrated as a function of separation distance fig 7 nsio2 and quartz sand interactions were repulsive under all the investigated circumstances indicating unfavorable deposition conditions the repulsive forces between the nsio2 and quartz sand surfaces resulted in elevated energy barriers and the absence of secondary minima under these conditions table s4 positive interaction energy profiles were obtained when nsio2 was suspended in milli q water with different ph values 5 7 and 9 at ph 9 high electrostatic repulsion was observed between nsio2 and quartz sand at ph 5 and 7 the entire interaction energy was repulsive however the energy barrier dropped steadily with decrease in ph and with increasing distance between the particle and the collector the colloids remained kinetically stable given the substantial values of the maximum energy barriers φmax for ph 5 7 and 9 it was expected that the deposition of nsio2 onto the quartz sand surface would be limited resulting in high mobility as a result the c c0 ratios of nsio2 btcs suspended in background solution of various ph values were significantly increased when nsio2 was suspended in the background solutions of desired ionic strength 10 50 and 100 mm positive interaction energy profiles were obtained the presence of the salts increases the amount of counterions migrating to the nanoparticles solvation layer thereby decreasing the debye length and repulsive electrostatic forces in the light of the low φmax values it was projected that the van der waals force of attraction would significantly increase the primary minimum tended to increase as the ionic strength was increased from 10 to 100 mm due to the decreased repulsion and enhanced attraction of nsio2 with quartz sand the nanoparticle aggregated and retained more in the column matrix therefore lesser c c0 values were obtained in the btcs of nsio2 suspended in background solution of various ionic strengths in case of nsio2 suspended in a background solution containing varying concentrations of humic acid 0 1 1 and 10 mg l the particle and quartz sand displayed strong electrostatic repulsion with increasing humic acid concentration an increase in the height of φmax was noticed which prevented the aggregation and deposition of nsio2 on quartz sand according to the dlvo interaction energy profiles adding humic acid at environmentally relevant concentrations enhanced nsio2 stability and dispersity which corroborated the high c c0 values observed in the btcs when the influent nanoparticle concentration was varied the dlvo interaction energy profiles indicated strong van der waals force of attraction between the particles and the quartz sand the primary minimum for the nsio2 sand interaction increased significantly as the particle concentration was increased from 10 to 100 mg l the calculated total interaction energies resulted in a lower energy barrier φmax as a result increased deposition of nsio2 occurred on the quartz sand surface corroborating the lower c c0 values obtained in the btcs when nsio2 was suspended in the river lake tap and ground water positive interaction energy profiles were noted the height of the maximum energy barrier φmax increased dramatically in the river lake and tap waters this may be attributed to the presence of strong electrostatic repulsion between nsio2 and quartz sand the colloid was highly stable allowing it to flow freely through the sand column as evidenced by the btcs the primary minimum increased and the φmax decreased when nsio2 was suspended in the ground water it indicated that nsio2 was more prone to deposition onto the surface of quartz sand in ground water than other environmental waters 4 conclusion in the present study the transport and retention behavior of nsio2 in the presence of environmentally relevant physicochemical parameters were investigated the presence of natural organic matter and modifying the ph of the nsio2 suspensions promoted their mobility and transport the key findings of this study suggest that nom induced repulsive forces stabilized the nanoparticles resulting in improved transport of nsio2 in the porous media further it can be concluded that salt and particle concentrations were also key determinants that affected the transport of nsio2 at higher ionic strengths and particle concentrations the nsio2 would aggregate in the porous media the btcs of the nsio2 was successfully simulated with the help of cft under various experimental conditions dlvo interaction energy profiles were employed successfully to interpret these effects the real water samples gnerellay containing a high amount of naturally occurring humic substances markedly increased the transport phenomenon water reserves that possess a high concentration of dissolved salts impeded the mobility and transport of nsio2 to gain better insights the transport behavior of nsio2 can be evaluated in complex representative

conducted with the langmuir and freundlich equations the fundaments and hypothesis of these classical models cannot provide a scientific meaning and reliable explanation for the influence of operating parameters as the adsorbate concentration and temperature in the removal mechanism ramadan et al 2021 sharib et al 2021 to obtain a better understanding of the mo and mb removal mechanisms by mil 101

energetic parameters for the analysis and explanation of the adsorption mechanism the interpretation of the physicochemical factors associated to mb and mo adsorption onto mil 101 fe can contribute to

acid benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid bdc merck kgaa germany and n n dimethyl formamide dmf techno pharm chem india were used in this study in the preparation of mil 101 fe adsorbent mo and mb dyes and absolute ethyl alcohol 99 9 were supplied from merck kgaa germany and the two dyes were tested as adsorbates 2 2 synthesis of mil 101 fe mil 101 fe was synthesized by a hydrothermal method following a

4 adsorption experiments of mb and mo dyes stock solutions 1000 mg l of mb and 2000 mg of mo were prepared and the desired initial concentrations of the tested dyes were obtained using dilutions with high purity distilled water to avoid any possible reactions associated to the photo catalytic process all adsorption experiments were conducted in dark glasses in the absence of light after each adsorption experiment the solutions containing mo and mb dyes were separated from mil 101 fe adsorbent using syringe filters the concentrations of the studied dyes in the filtrated solutions were

tested dyes after time t v l is the solution volume and m g is the mass of mil 101 fe adsorbent g to study the mo and mb adsorption onto mil 101 fe and to identify the possible rate controlling step the kinetic results were fitted to the pseudo first order lagergren 1898 the pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 and intra particle diffusion weber and morris 1962 models as given below 2 ln q e q t

2 6 mo and mb adsorption isotherms equilibrium studies related to mo and mb adsorption onto mil 101 fe were performed at the next conditions initial dye concentrations 25 500 mg l for mb and 25 2000 mg l three temperatures 20 40 and 60 c 0 01 g of mil 101 fe and solution ph 4 for mo and 9 5 for mb in all these experiments 10 mg of the tested adsorbent was mixed with 30 ml of each dye solution at 300 rpm using digital orbital shaker sho 2d germany the liquid phases containing mo and mb were separated and the concentrations of these dyes in solutions were determined the equilibrium adsorption quantities of mo and mb dyes q e were calculated using eq 1 assuming that t corresponded to the equilibrium time 2 6 1 classical modeling analysis the experimental data of mb and mo were fitted to the langmuir 1916 and freundlich freundlich 1906 equations to find the suitable classical model that can describe the adsorption of dyes onto mil 101 fe at equilibrium the non linear relations defined the langmuir eq 5 and freundlich eq 6 isotherm models are given below 5 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e langmuir model 6 q e k f c e 1 n freundlich model where q max mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and k l l mg represents the constant of the langmuir model on the other hand k f mg g mg l 1 n signifies the adsorption capacity and n is the heterogeneity factor of the freundlich model 2 6 2 advanced modeling analysis herein three advanced statistical physics models i e single layer double layer and multilayer were employed to investigate the dye mil 101 fe interaction ramadan et al 2021 sharib et al 2021 firstly the single layer model assumes that mo and mb removal by mil 101 fe was in the form of one layer directed by a distinctive adsorption energy δe i e the adsorption of each tested dye molecules via mil 101 fe active sites is nearly governed by a constant energy the mathematical expression of this advanced single layer adsorption model is given by eq 7 sharib et al 2021 7 q e n d m 1 c 1 2 c n where n is the number of mo and mb dye molecules captured by active site of mil 101 fe adsorbent c 1 2 signifies the concentration at half saturation related to the formed adsorbate layer and d m is the density of adsorption sites secondly the double layer model suggests that these adsorption systems are characterized by the formation of two layers of dyes molecules mb or mo with two dissimilar adsorption energies i e δe1 for dye mil 101 fe interaction and δe2 for mb mb or mo mo interaction the mathematical expression of the double layer model is denoted by eq 8 sharib et al 2021 8 q e n d m c c 1 n 2 c c 2 2 n 1 c c 1 n c c 2 2 n where c1 and c2 describe the two concentrations at half saturation attributed to the first and second removed dye layers respectively finally the multilayer model suggests that the mo and mb adsorption onto mil 101 fe results in the formation of an adaptable but limited number of adsorbed dye i e mo or mb layers consequently the total adsorbed layers number 1 n 2 of each tested dye is related to a single layer n 2 0 double layer n 2 1 and multilayer process n 2 1 mohamed et al 2020 similar to the double layer model two energies δe1 and δe2 were associated to this multilayer model i e dye mil 101 fe and dye dye interactions generally the adsorption energy δe1 was related to the interaction between the first adsorbed dye layer unchanging number and equal to unity and mil 101 fe adsorption sites while the other energy δe2 was linked to the dye dye interaction and thus δe1 is found to be greater than δe2 the multilayer adsorption model is given by mohamed et al 2020 li et al 2019b 9 q e n d m f 1 c f 2 c f 3 c f 4 c g c 10 f 1 c 2 c c 1 2 n 1 c c 1 n c c 1 n 1 c c 1 2 n 1 c c 1 n 2 11 f 2 c 2 c c 1 n

regeneration of mil 101 fe adsorbent recycling and utilization of the mil 101 fe adsorbent were investigated via the solvent method using ethanol as an eluent the mil 101 fe loaded with the tested dyes mb and mo was continuously agitated on a rotatory shaker at 200 rpm for 4 h at 25 c to achieve the complete removal of the adsorbed dyes this adsorption desorption test was repeated five times under the same conditions at the end of each desorption round the mil 101 fe was washed several times by distilled water and dried at 65 c for 12 h before the next desorption cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mil 101 fe adsorbent x ray diffraction xrd was carried out to identify the crystallinity and structure of the synthesized mil 101 fe adsorbent different peaks related to the mil 101 fe were observed at 2 thetas 5 3 8 82 9 18 and 18 5 see fig 1a these detected peaks were comparable with the previous studies hu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2018a li et al 2016 fe sem images fig 1b and c display the morphological features of the mil 101 fe surface it was observed that the mil 101 fe had a special octahedral structure with diameters from 0 7 to 2 μm which was consistent to the other reported studies hu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 ftir spectrum fig 1 d shows a strong band at 1574 cm 1 that indicated c o of the carboxylate group hu et al 2019 the broad band detected at 3376 cm 1 corresponded to the hydroxyl group of the adsorbed water molecules li et al 2019a the strong band at 1392 cm 1 was attributed to the vibration of cc in benzene ring however the parent bands at 545 and 748 cm 1 were related to fe oh vibration wang et al 2018 these ftir results also agreed to the earlier studies li et al 2019a hu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 and thus confirmed the preparation of mil 101 fe particles size range of mil 101 fe was obtained using zetasizer measurement and results indicated that it ranged from 470 to 603 nm also the surface charge value of the prepared mil 101 fe was 3 at ph 7 5 tga analysis displayed the presence of two main weight losses within the temperature range of 25 650 c fig 2a the first weight loss about 16 below 400 c could be related to the elimination of water molecules and free terephthalates in the pores of mil 101 fe in addition the significant second weight loss 38 from 400 to 650 c could be due to the decomposition of organic ligands that result in the collapse of mil 101 fe tga result of this study is similar to that of other uio 66 and mil 101 cr metal organic frameworks hu et al 2015 yang and yan 2011 furthermore the dcs result displays the existence of two sharp endothermic peaks fig 2b the first endothermic sharp peak observed at 250 300 c could be attributed to the evaporation of h2o molecules and free terephthalate in pores of the mil 101 fe while the second one at 600 700 c could be associated to the decomposition of mil 101 fe consequently tga and dsc results indicated that mil 101 fe is characterized by high thermal stability up to 650 c 3 2 ph effect on the adsorption of mb and mo onto mil 101 fe adsorption experiments were conducted at a wide range of solution ph i e ph 2 12 to find the optimum value of this parameter for the removal of mb and mo 100 mg l using 0 01 g of mil 101 fe at 20 c fig 3 displays that the removal efficiency for mb increased with improving ph value where the highest efficiency was achieved at ph 9 5 this behavior for mb adsorption was related to the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged mb molecule and negatively charged mil 101 fe surface whose ph at zero point of charge was phpzc 7 1 thus the surface of mil 101 fe was negatively charged at ph 7 1 and it was more effective to attractive and remove the cationic mb dye on the contrary case the maximum percentage of mo adsorption was attained at ph 4 due to the electrostatic attraction force caused by the negatively charged anionic mo dye this indicated that the mil 101 fe was found to be an excellent adsorbent for the tested dyes and thus all adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 9 5 and ph 4 for mb and mo respectively 3 3 contact time effect on mb and mo adsorption using mil 101 fe very rapid adsorption of both mb and mo dyes were observed in the first 15 min with removal percentages of 52 7 and 76 for mo and mb respectively see fig 4a and b it was assumed that the adsorption process of mb and mo molecules was very fast at the beginning due to the availability of numerous active sites on the mil 101 fe surface after that the interaction time between dyes and mil 101 fe started to be slower i e a gentle slope was observed due to the limitation of the available adsorption sites finally the removed amounts of both dyes were nearly constant after contact times of 2 h for mb and 10 h for mo which indicated that equilibrium was achieved after the saturation of active sites of the mil 101 fe surface 3 4 mb and mo adsorption kinetics as indicated the kinetics of dyes adsorption were investigated using different models as the pseudo first order lagergren 1898 pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 and intra particle diffusion models weber and morris 1962 the pseudo first order considers that the adsorption process is strongly depends on the diffusion while the pseudo second order assumes that a chemical adsorption can be involved in the removal process ahmadijokani et al 2020 the experimental data of mo and mb were fitted to these different kinetic models and the best fit model was identified via the r 2 value see fig 4 all the kinetics parameters were calculated and compared with the experimental data as shown in table 1 the values of r 2 for mo adsorption on mil 101 fe indicating that the best fit model was the pseudo second order equation r 2 0 993 in comparison to the pseudo first order equation r 2 0 909 also the best fitted model r 2 1 for mb was the pseudo second order kinetics equation followed by the pseudo first order r 2 0 903 these results indicated that the adsorption kinetics of both mb and mo on mil 101 fe were described by the pseudo second order model and thus the adsorption of mo and mb could be related to chemisorption process the intra particle diffusion analysis attributed to each dye molecule displayed dissimilar linear stages over the whole time range fig 4 the initial sharp stage can be associated to the external mass transfer of mb and mo molecules from the solution to the outer surface of the mil 101 fe adsorbent the second and third linear sections characterized the control of pore diffusion and equilibrium stages respectively consequently the adsorption of mb and mo was mostly directed by the film diffusion during the first stage followed by pore diffusion and equilibrium at subsequent stages 3 5 classical modeling of mb and mo adsorption isotherms modeling of mb and mo adsorption data at equilibrium with the applied traditional models langmuir and freundlich equations are displayed in fig 5 and the corresponding adjusted parameters of these models are listed in tables 2 and 3 langmuir model was the best alternative to fit mb and mo adsorption data where their r 2 values were highest at all tested temperatures therefore the removal of these dyes molecules was related to homogenous adsorption sites of mil 101 fe and the adsorbates adsorbent interaction resulted in the formation of a single dye layer the maximum adsorption capacities q max for mb were 402 391 67 and 352 96 mg g and 1066 96 934 17 and 830 97 mg g for mo at 20 40 and 60 c as given in table 2 the decrease of q max values with the increment of solution temperature suggested that the adsorption of mb and mo molecules by mil 101 fe was exothermic i e the dyes adsorbent interaction was more energetic at low temperature sharib et al 2021 mohamed et al 2020 moreover the adsorption capacities associated to mo molecules were higher than those of mb dye which indicated the selectivity of the as synthesized mil 101 fe active sites for this azo dye this variation in the removal efficiency of mil 101 fe could be related to the chemical structures i e c14h14n3nao3s for mo and c16h18cln3s for mb and the molecular size i e 1 2 nm for mo and 1 38 nm for mb of these dye molecules seliem et al 2020 the molecular characteristics of mo and mb played a relevant role for transfer phenomena in the interface between these dyes and mil 101 fe adsorbent surface furthermore the decrease of k f values from 75 51 to 49 26 for mb and from 67 60 to 45 27 mg g mg l 1 n with temperature also supported the exothermic adsorption of these dyes calculated 1 n values by the freundlich equation were lower than unity thus signifying an effective dye mil 101 fe interaction even at low concentrations of these organic pollutants sharib et al 2021 mohamed et al 2020 the maximum adsorption capacities for mo and mb by the synthetic mil 101 fe and other mofs are listed in table 4 it can be observed that the q max values of mil 101 fe were higher than those reported for different mofs therefore it can be concluded that the mil 101 fe is a promising adsorbent for removal of dyes bearing solutions 3 6 advanced statistical modeling of mb and mo adsorption isotherms the multilayer model fig 6 presented the highest r 2 values compared to the single and double layer models at all solution temperatures i e 20 40 and 60 c therefore the steric e g n d m and q sat and energetic δe parameters of this multilayer adsorption model were deeply analyzed to obtain a better understanding of the adsorption mechanism of mb and mo dyes on mil 101 fe 3 6 1 the n parameter the determination of steric n parameter provides information associated to the removal mechanism of the tested adsorbates mb and mo dyes on mil 101 fe especially in terms of adsorption orientation and molecular aggregation phenomenon in particular the adsorption geometry vertical or horizontal of the removed mb and mo molecules on the adsorbent can be analyzed using this parameter ramadan et al 2021 mohamed et al 2020 barakat et al 2020 based on the value of n parameter two main scenarios can be recognized to describe the geometry and mechanism of dyes adsorption onto mil 101 fe surfaces sharib et al 2021 barakat et al 2020 the first scenario n 1 the adsorption of mo and mb molecules can take place in a vertical position through multi interactions mechanism i e one active site of mil 101 fe can capture several dye molecules the second scenario n 1 mo and mb adsorption occurs in a horizontal location via a multi docking mechanism i e numerous mil 101 fe functional groups can remove one dye molecule fig 7 exhibits the values of n parameter related to mb and mo adsorption on mil 101 fe as a function of solution temperature for mo dye the n parameter values were 0 95 1 02 and 1 33 at 20 40 and 60 c respectively as a result horizontal position and multi docking mechanism could be expected for mo adsorption at 20 c while vertical position and multi interactions mechanism could occur at 40 and 60 c the n values were higher than unity at 40 and 60 c and this result indicated the effect of aggregation phenomenon with increasing temperature on the other hand the n values associated to mb adsorption were 1 17 1 68 and 1 78 and thus vertical orientation and multi interactions mechanism were involved in the removal of this dye by the mil 101 fe active sites at all temperatures consequently the aggregation of mb molecules i e mb mb binding in solution was identified at all tested temperatures and this phenomenon resulted in the existence of the non parallel adsorption geometry and a multi molecular mechanism the high degree of mb and mo aggregations with temperature suggested that these adsorption processes were energetically activated in solutions before the interaction between dyes and mil 101 fe surface li et al 2020 3 6 2 the d m parameter fig 7 displays the number of mil 101 fe active sites i e d m parameter with respect the adsorption temperature from 20 to 60 c the d m parameter decreased from 77 33 to 52 38 mg g for mb and from 149 91 to 107 07 mg g for mo dye the decrease of d m value with temperature displayed a reverse trend as compared to the steric n parameters i e the increment of n parameter caused a reduction of the occupied active sites number of the mil 101 fe surface thus the trend of d m parameter assessed the accumulation of the removed dyes molecules at high temperature moreover the aggregated mo and mb molecules could be more selective to definite functional groups of the as synthesized mil 101 fe mobarak et al 2019 also it can be noticed that the d m values associated to mo dye were higher than those of mb dye at all temperatures which could be considered as an important variable of the enhanced adsorption capacity of mil 101 fe for mo dye 3 6 3 total number of the adsorbed mb and mo layers nt 1 n2 to understand the adsorption mechanism of mb and mo molecules on mil 101 fe the determination of the total layers of adsorbed dyes is necessary barakat et al 2020 the calculated nt values were 3 12 3 08 and 2 49 for mb and 5 36 5 03 and 3 76 for mo at 20 40 and 60 c respectively see fig 7 the reduction of nt value with temperature increments could be related to the influence of thermal agitation which resulted in a disordered movement of the adsorbed mb and mo molecules the disturbed state associated to dye dye interaction caused a decrease of the adsorbed dye layers seliem et al 2020 barakat et al 2020 like the d m parameter the nt values associated to mo dye were higher than those of mb dye at all adsorption temperatures i e the n2 parameter presented a significant impact to improve the mo adsorption capacity 3 6 4 the adsorbed mb and mo quantities at saturation q sat n dm nt to estimate the maximum mil 101 fe performance for the adsorption of mo and mb dyes the calculation of q sat values was done fig 7 exhibits the trend of q sat versus temperature and the values of this parameter were 373 74 348 07 and 325 08 mg g for mb and 908 39 777 01 and 677 92 mg g for mo at 20 40 and 60 c respectively these q sat values confirmed the exothermic interactions associated to mb and mo adsorption on mil 101 fe surface for the investigated dyes it was identified that the dm and nt parameters preserved the same trend of the q sat parameter with respect to improving temperature according to the calculated steric parameters it can be concluded that the removal efficiency of mil 101 fe for mo and mb dyes was controlled by the dm and nt parameters furthermore the high values of the q sat for mo as compared to that of mb confirmed the important roles of dm and nt parameters to determine the preference of mil 101 fe for the adsorption of this azo dye 3 7 energetic parameters to obtain an appropriate interpretation for the interactions between mb and mo molecules and mil 101 fe active sites the adsorption energies were calculated seliem et al 2020 barakat et al 2020 these adsorption energies δe were estimated as follows barakat et al 2020 15 c 1 c s e e 1 rt 16 c 2 c s e e 2 rt where c 1and c 2 are the half saturation concentrations and c s is the solubility of the tested mb and mo adsorbates fig 8 shows the δe values as a function of the adsorption temperature the negative δe values confirmed the exothermic interactions between the dyes molecules and the mil 101 fe adsorbent this performance agreed with the influence of solution temperature to reduce the mo and mb adsorption capacities besides the δe values of mo and mb adsorption were 40 kj mol at 20 40 and 60 c which suggested physical adsorption processes sharib et al 2021 barakat et al 2020 δe1 was associated to mil 101 fe dye mb or mo interaction while δe2 described the dye dye interface therefore δe1 values were higher than δe2 all tested temperatures although the e values associated to mb adsorption were higher than those of mo at all temperature the adsorbed mb dye quantities were low and consequently the selectivity of mil 101 fe was not governed by the e parameter 3 8 selectivity of mil 101 fe for the adsorption of mb and mo dyes in binary systems the adsorption selectivity is an important parameter for studying the behavior of an adsorbent for the removal of water pollutants liu et al 2018b for instance graphene like metal organic framework buc 17 was found to be more selective to anionic dyes from an organic dye mixture li et al 2017 moreover eu based mof buc 88 displayed high selectivity to many pharmaceuticals and personal care products wang et al 2021 in this study the adsorption selectivity of the mil 101 fe for the dye removal was investigated using a mixture of mb and mo dyes at different ph values keeping the other operating parameters constant fig 9 shows that mil 101 fe surface was selective to mo and mb dyes at ph 4 and 9 5 respectively besides the adsorption capacities of the tested dyes were slightly decreased in the binary system as compared to the single component one at optimum ph values due to the competition between mo and mb molecules to interact with mil 101 fe active sites i e weak antagonism interaction at ph 7 both dyes were slightly adsorbed without a significant preference for any dye molecule and the adsorption processes could be associated to the π π stacking effect these results suggested that the mil 101 fe mof could be a more selective adsorbent for anionic and cationic dyes depending on the solution ph value 3 9 reusability study fig 10 shows the removal efficiency of mil 101 fe after five regeneration cycles for both mb and mo dyes it is clear that mil 101 fe presented more than 95 for mb removal and 90 for mo removal after all regeneration rounds for mb dye increment of the removal efficiency in the last cycles i e from cycle 3 to 5 could be attributed to the high surface area of mil 101 fe mb interaction which required frequent washing and drying under vacuum to achieve the complete desorption of the attached mb molecules paiman et al 2020 based on the regeneration results the investigated adsorbent can be reutilized numerous times to remove the tested dyes without a significant loss of its removal efficiency thus suggesting an economic benefit and high stability of this adsorbent in the purification of dyes bearing water 4 conclusions mil 101 fe mof was successfully prepared through a facile solvothermal method which was characterized and employed as an adsorbent for mo and mb at different experimental conditions in single and binary adsorption systems mil 101 fe was more selective to mo dye as compared to mb dye the adsorption of both mo and mb followed the pseudo second order and the langmuir equations a multilayer model from statistical physics theory was utilized to understand the mo and mb adsorption mechanisms at a molecular level mo adsorption was governed by multi docking and multi interactions mechanisms while mb adsorption was controlled only by multi interactions mechanism the density of mil 101 fe active sites and the total adsorbed dye layers formed on mof surface were the main parameters that determined the adsorption capacity of mo dye the adsorption of mb and mo molecules by mil 101 fe was mainly caused by physical interactions at all solution temperatures the reusability study demonstrated that the mil 101 fe can maintain an outstanding performance after four adsorption desorption cycles the current study clearly proved that the mil 101 fe can be utilized as an adsorbent for efficient removal of anionic and cationic dyes from polluted solutions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1312,in the current study iron based metal organic framework mof mil 101 fe was successfully prepared via a facile solvothermal method the as synthesized mil 101 fe was characterized by xrd fe sem ftir tga and zeta potential techniques and then employed as an adsorbent for methyl orange mo and methylene blue mb dyes the adsorbed quantities of mo 1067 to 831 mg g were higher than those of mb 402 to 353 mg g indicating the high selectivity of mil 101 fe towards the anionic dye at all temperatures 20 60 c adsorption processes of mo and mb followed the pseudo second order kinetics and the langmuir equilibrium model the interaction mechanism at a molecular level was analyzed and deeply interpreted via the advanced multilayer adsorption model steric parameters indicated that mo molecular aggregation n was 0 95 1 33 thus signifying the presence of multi docking and multi interactions mechanisms the aggregated number of mb was superior to unity i e n 1 17 1 78 suggesting a vertical adsorption position and a multi interactions mechanism at all operating temperatures the density of mil 101 fe active sites d m 77 33 52 38 mg g for mb and 149 91 107 07 for mo and the total adsorbed dye layers n t 3 12 2 49 for mb and 5 36 3 67 for mo resulted in improving the adsorption capacities of mo dye the adsorption energies ranged from 8 89 to 33 73 kj mol and they displayed that mo and mb uptake processes were exothermic controlled by physical interactions at all temperatures regeneration results indicated that this adsorbent can be reutilized without a significant loss in its removal efficiency after five adsorption desorption cycles overall the adsorption capacity chemical stability and regeneration performance of mil 101 fe support its application as a very promising adsorbent for the removal of organic hazardous pollutants from water keywords mil 101 fe methylene blue methyl orange adsorption mechanism advanced modeling 1 introduction pollution of water bodies due to industrial toxic containing effluents is considered a worldwide problem homaeigohar 2020 commonly significant quantities of dyed wastewater are generated from various industries including textile leather paper printing and dyestuff sectors according to previous studies methylene blue mb and methyl orange mo dyes the studied organic pollutants in this paper are recognized as chemical compounds that can persist for long times in aqueous solutions due to their non biodegradability properties besides the improper management of wastewater containing mo and mb dyes which have carcinogenic and toxic properties causes a major threat for human beings haque et al 2010 consequently different methods as adsorption coagulation biological advanced oxidation or precipitation have been utilized in cleaning the contaminated water based on the benefits and drawbacks associated to each treatment method adsorption is recommended as low cost simple and more effective technique homaeigohar 2020 especially the adsorption processes using nanoparticles based adsorbents that have different active adsorption sites and great surface areas are very promising for water purification

2019 mof 235 haque et al 2011 uio 66 molavi et al 2018 and fe mil 101 konik et al 2019 were used in the adsorption of mb and mo in several adsorption systems the experimental data modeling was conducted with the langmuir and freundlich equations the fundaments and hypothesis of these classical models cannot provide a scientific meaning and reliable explanation for the influence of operating parameters as the adsorbate concentration and temperature in the removal mechanism ramadan et al 2021 sharib et al 2021 to obtain a better understanding of the mo and mb removal mechanisms by mil 101 fe it is mandatory to use the advanced adsorption models based on the statistical physics theory mohamed et al 2020 seliem et al 2020 this theory is appropriate to provide additional steric and energetic parameters for the analysis and explanation of the adsorption mechanism the interpretation of the physicochemical factors associated to mb and mo adsorption onto mil 101 fe can contribute to clarify the adsorption mechanisms at the molecular level ramadan et al 2021 sharib et al 2021 mohamed et al 2020 the main objectives of the current study were to a characterize mil 101 fe metal

into mo and mb adsorption performance and mechanism using mil 101 fe as an adsorbent 2 materials used and methods 2 1 materials ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o alpha chemica india terephthalic acid benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid bdc merck kgaa germany and n n dimethyl formamide dmf techno pharm chem india were used in this study in the preparation of mil 101 fe adsorbent mo and mb dyes and absolute ethyl alcohol 99 9 were supplied from merck kgaa germany and the two dyes were tested as adsorbates 2 2 synthesis of mil 101 fe mil 101 fe was synthesized by a hydrothermal method following a similar procedure reported by hu et al 2019 ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o and benzene 1 4 dicarboxylic acid was dissolved in dmf with 2 1 ratio the suspended solution was sonicated for 20 min until was fully homogenous and then it was transferred into a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 110 c for 20 h the light orange product was separated via centrifugation and purified by washing with dmf for 3 h followed by hot ethanol for 2 h this step was repeated for three times in order to remove the unreacted bdc the purified product was dried at 70 c for 30 min and then activated at 150 c for 10 h before carrying out the dye adsorption studies 2 3 characterization of mil 101 fe mil 101 fe was characterized using different techniques to investigate its physical and chemical properties x ray diffraction xrd pattern of this adsorbent was recorded in the 2θ range from 5 02 79 98 using a panalytical philips diffractometer operated at 40 kv and 35 ma under cu kα

and differential scanning calorimetry dsc were performed to analyze the thermal stability of mil 10 fe in the temperature range of 25 1200 c with a heating rate of 10 c min labsys evo setaram france 2 4 adsorption experiments of mb and mo dyes stock solutions 1000 mg l of mb and 2000 mg of mo were prepared and the desired initial concentrations of the tested dyes were obtained using dilutions with high purity distilled water to avoid any possible reactions associated to the photo catalytic process all adsorption experiments were conducted in dark glasses in the absence of light after each adsorption experiment the solutions containing mo and mb dyes were separated from mil 101 fe adsorbent using syringe filters the concentrations of the studied dyes in the filtrated solutions were quantified using a uv double beam spectrophotometer at 664 and 464 nm for mb and mo dyes respectively all mo and mb removal experiments were performed in triplicates and the results were averaged for data evaluation obtaining standard deviations below 5 2 2 5 mo and mb adsorption kinetics to study the adsorption kinetics the experiments were performed at the following conditions 0 15 g of mil 101 fe mass ph 4 0 for mo and 9 5 for mb initial concentrations of 30 mg l for mb and 100 mg l for mo adsorption temperature of 20 c and different contact times ranging from 15 min to 14 h the adsorbed amounts q t of mb and mo after each time interval were calculated using eq 1 1 q t mg g c 0 c t v m where c 0 mg l is the initial concentrations of mo and mb c t mg l is the final concentration of the tested dyes after time t v l is the solution volume and m g is the mass of mil 101 fe adsorbent g to study the mo and mb adsorption onto mil 101 fe and to identify the possible rate controlling step the kinetic results were fitted to the pseudo first order lagergren 1898 the pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 and intra particle diffusion weber and morris 1962 models as given below 2 ln q e q t

2 6 mo and mb adsorption isotherms equilibrium studies related to mo and mb adsorption onto mil 101 fe were performed at the next conditions initial dye concentrations 25 500 mg l for mb and 25 2000 mg l three temperatures 20 40 and 60 c 0 01 g of mil 101 fe and solution ph 4 for mo and 9 5 for mb in all these experiments 10 mg of the tested adsorbent was mixed with 30 ml of each dye solution at 300 rpm using digital orbital shaker sho 2d germany the liquid phases containing mo and mb were separated and the concentrations of these dyes in solutions were determined the equilibrium adsorption quantities of mo and mb dyes q e were calculated using eq 1 assuming that t corresponded to the equilibrium time 2 6 1 classical modeling analysis the experimental data of mb and mo were fitted to the langmuir 1916 and freundlich freundlich 1906 equations to find the suitable classical model that can describe the adsorption of dyes onto mil 101 fe at equilibrium the non linear relations defined the langmuir eq 5 and freundlich eq 6 isotherm models are given below 5 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e langmuir model 6 q e k f c e 1 n freundlich model where q max mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and k l l mg represents the constant of the langmuir model on the other hand k f mg g mg l 1 n signifies the adsorption capacity and n is the heterogeneity factor of the freundlich model 2 6 2 advanced modeling analysis herein three advanced statistical physics models i e single layer double layer and multilayer were employed to investigate the dye mil 101 fe interaction ramadan et al 2021 sharib et al 2021 firstly the single layer model assumes that mo and mb removal by mil 101 fe was in the form of one layer directed by a distinctive adsorption energy δe i e the adsorption of each tested dye molecules via mil 101 fe active sites is nearly governed by a constant energy the mathematical expression of this advanced single layer adsorption model is given by eq 7 sharib et al 2021 7 q e n d m 1 c 1 2 c n where n is the number of mo and mb dye molecules captured by active site of mil 101 fe adsorbent c 1 2 signifies the concentration at half saturation related to the formed adsorbate layer and d m is the density of adsorption sites secondly the double layer model suggests that these adsorption systems are characterized by the formation of two layers of dyes molecules mb or mo with two dissimilar adsorption energies i e δe1 for dye mil 101 fe interaction and δe2 for mb mb or mo mo interaction the mathematical expression of the double layer model is denoted by eq 8 sharib et al 2021 8 q e n d m c c 1 n 2 c c 2 2 n 1 c c 1 n c c 2 2 n where c1 and c2 describe the two concentrations at half saturation attributed to the first and second removed dye layers respectively finally the multilayer model suggests that the mo and mb adsorption onto mil 101 fe results in the formation of an adaptable but limited number of adsorbed dye i e mo or mb layers consequently the total adsorbed layers number 1 n 2 of each tested dye is related to a single layer n 2 0 double layer n 2 1 and multilayer process n 2 1 mohamed et al 2020 similar to the double layer model two energies δe1 and δe2 were associated to this multilayer model i e dye mil 101 fe and dye dye interactions generally the adsorption energy δe1 was related to the interaction between the first adsorbed dye layer unchanging number and equal to unity and mil 101 fe adsorption sites while the other energy δe2 was linked to the dye dye interaction and thus δe1 is found to be greater than δe2 the multilayer adsorption model is given by mohamed et al 2020 li et al 2019b 9 q e n d m f 1 c f 2 c f 3 c f 4 c g c 10 f 1 c 2 c c 1 2 n 1 c c 1 n c c 1 n 1 c c 1 2 n 1 c c 1 n 2 11 f 2 c 2 c c 1 n

regeneration of mil 101 fe adsorbent recycling and utilization of the mil 101 fe adsorbent were investigated via the solvent method using ethanol as an eluent the mil 101 fe loaded with the tested dyes mb and mo was continuously agitated on a rotatory shaker at 200 rpm for 4 h at 25 c to achieve the complete removal of the adsorbed dyes this adsorption desorption test was repeated five times under the same conditions at the end of each desorption round the mil 101 fe was washed several times by distilled water and dried at 65 c for 12 h before the next desorption cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mil 101 fe adsorbent x ray diffraction xrd was carried out to identify the crystallinity and structure of the synthesized mil 101 fe adsorbent different peaks related to the mil 101 fe were observed at 2 thetas 5 3 8 82 9 18 and 18 5 see fig 1a these detected peaks were comparable with the previous studies hu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 liu et al 2018a li et al 2016 fe sem images fig 1b and c display the morphological features of the mil 101 fe surface it was observed that the mil 101 fe had a special octahedral structure with diameters from 0 7 to 2 μm which was consistent to the other reported studies hu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 ftir spectrum fig 1 d shows a strong band at 1574 cm 1 that indicated c o of the carboxylate group hu et al 2019 the broad band detected at 3376 cm 1 corresponded to the hydroxyl group of the adsorbed water molecules li et al 2019a the strong band at 1392 cm 1 was attributed to the vibration of cc in benzene ring however the parent bands at 545 and 748 cm 1 were related to fe oh vibration wang et al 2018 these ftir results also agreed to the earlier studies li et al 2019a hu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 and thus confirmed the preparation of mil 101 fe particles size range of mil 101 fe was obtained using zetasizer measurement and results indicated that it ranged from 470 to 603 nm also the surface charge value of the prepared mil 101 fe was 3 at ph 7 5 tga analysis displayed the presence of two main weight losses within the temperature range of 25 650 c fig 2a the first weight loss about 16 below 400 c could be related to the elimination of water molecules and free terephthalates in the pores of mil 101 fe in addition the significant second weight loss 38 from 400 to 650 c could be due to the decomposition of organic ligands that result in the collapse of mil 101 fe tga result of this study is similar to that of other uio 66 and mil 101 cr metal organic frameworks hu et al 2015 yang and yan 2011 furthermore the dcs result displays the existence of two sharp endothermic peaks fig 2b the first endothermic sharp peak observed at 250 300 c could be attributed to the evaporation of h2o molecules and free terephthalate in pores of the mil 101 fe while the second one at 600 700 c could be associated to the decomposition of mil 101 fe consequently tga and dsc results indicated that mil 101 fe is characterized by high thermal stability up to 650 c 3 2 ph effect on the adsorption of mb and mo onto mil 101 fe adsorption experiments were conducted at a wide range of solution ph i e ph 2 12 to find the optimum value of this parameter for the removal of mb and mo 100 mg l using 0 01 g of mil 101 fe at 20 c fig 3 displays that the removal efficiency for mb increased with improving ph value where the highest efficiency was achieved at ph 9 5 this behavior for mb adsorption was related to the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged mb molecule and negatively charged mil 101 fe surface whose ph at zero point of charge was phpzc 7 1 thus the surface of mil 101 fe was negatively charged at ph 7 1 and it was more effective to attractive and remove the cationic mb dye on the contrary case the maximum percentage of mo adsorption was attained at ph 4 due to the electrostatic attraction force caused by the negatively charged anionic mo dye this indicated that the mil 101 fe was found to be an excellent adsorbent for the tested dyes and thus all adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 9 5 and ph 4 for mb and mo respectively 3 3 contact time effect on mb and mo adsorption using mil 101 fe very rapid adsorption of both mb and mo dyes were observed in the first 15 min with removal percentages of 52 7 and 76 for mo and mb respectively see fig 4a and b it was assumed that the adsorption process of mb and mo molecules was very fast at the beginning due to the availability of numerous active sites on the mil 101 fe surface after that the interaction time between dyes and mil 101 fe started to be slower i e a gentle slope was observed due to the limitation of the available adsorption sites finally the removed amounts of both dyes were nearly constant after contact times of 2 h for mb and 10 h for mo which indicated that equilibrium was achieved after the saturation of active sites of the mil 101 fe surface 3 4 mb and mo adsorption kinetics as indicated the kinetics of dyes adsorption were investigated using different models as the pseudo first order lagergren 1898 pseudo second order ho and mckay 1999 and intra particle diffusion models weber and morris 1962 the pseudo first order considers that the adsorption process is strongly depends on the diffusion while the pseudo second order assumes that a chemical adsorption can be involved in the removal process ahmadijokani et al 2020 the experimental data of mo and mb were fitted to these different kinetic models and the best fit model was identified via the r 2 value see fig 4 all the kinetics parameters were calculated and compared with the experimental data as shown in table 1 the values of r 2 for mo adsorption on mil 101 fe indicating that the best fit model was the pseudo second order equation r 2 0 993 in comparison to the pseudo first order equation r 2 0 909 also the best fitted model r 2 1 for mb was the pseudo second order kinetics equation followed by the pseudo first order r 2 0 903 these results indicated that the adsorption kinetics of both mb and mo on mil 101 fe were described by the pseudo second order model and thus the adsorption of mo and mb could be related to chemisorption process the intra particle diffusion analysis attributed to each dye molecule displayed dissimilar linear stages over the whole time range fig 4 the initial sharp stage can be associated to the external mass transfer of mb and mo molecules from the solution to the outer surface of the mil 101 fe adsorbent the second and third linear sections characterized the control of pore diffusion and equilibrium stages respectively consequently the adsorption of mb and mo was mostly directed by the film diffusion during the first stage followed by pore diffusion and equilibrium at subsequent stages 3 5 classical modeling of mb and mo adsorption isotherms modeling of mb and mo adsorption data at equilibrium with the applied traditional models langmuir and freundlich equations are displayed in fig 5 and the corresponding adjusted parameters of these models are listed in tables 2 and 3 langmuir model was the best alternative to fit mb and mo adsorption data where their r 2 values were highest at all tested temperatures therefore the removal of these dyes molecules was related to homogenous adsorption sites of mil 101 fe and the adsorbates adsorbent interaction resulted in the formation of a single dye layer the maximum adsorption capacities q max for mb were 402 391 67 and 352 96 mg g and 1066 96 934 17 and 830 97 mg g for mo at 20 40 and 60 c as given in table 2 the decrease of q max values with the increment of solution temperature suggested that the adsorption of mb and mo molecules by mil 101 fe was exothermic i e the dyes adsorbent interaction was more energetic at low temperature sharib et al 2021 mohamed et al 2020 moreover the adsorption capacities associated to mo molecules were higher than those of mb dye which indicated the selectivity of the as synthesized mil 101 fe active sites for this azo dye this variation in the removal efficiency of mil 101 fe could be related to the chemical structures i e c14h14n3nao3s for mo and c16h18cln3s for mb and the molecular size i e 1 2 nm for mo and 1 38 nm for mb of these dye molecules seliem et al 2020 the molecular characteristics of mo and mb played a relevant role for transfer phenomena in the interface between these dyes and mil 101 fe adsorbent surface furthermore the decrease of k f values from 75 51 to 49 26 for mb and from 67 60 to 45 27 mg g mg l 1 n with temperature also supported the exothermic adsorption of these dyes calculated 1 n values by the freundlich equation were lower than unity thus signifying an effective dye mil 101 fe interaction even at low concentrations of these organic pollutants sharib et al 2021 mohamed et al 2020 the maximum adsorption capacities for mo and mb by the synthetic mil 101 fe and other mofs are listed in table 4 it can be observed that the q max values of mil 101 fe were higher than those reported for different mofs therefore it can be concluded that the mil 101 fe is a promising adsorbent for removal of dyes bearing solutions 3 6 advanced statistical modeling of mb and mo adsorption isotherms the multilayer model fig 6 presented the highest r 2 values compared to the single and double layer models at all solution temperatures i e 20 40 and 60 c therefore the steric e g n d m and q sat and energetic δe parameters of this multilayer adsorption model were deeply analyzed to obtain a better understanding of the adsorption mechanism of mb and mo dyes on mil 101 fe 3 6 1 the n parameter the determination of steric n parameter provides information associated to the removal mechanism of the tested adsorbates mb and mo dyes on mil 101 fe especially in terms of adsorption orientation and molecular aggregation phenomenon in particular the adsorption geometry vertical or horizontal of the removed mb and mo molecules on the adsorbent can be analyzed using this parameter ramadan et al 2021 mohamed et al 2020 barakat et al 2020 based on the value of n parameter two main scenarios can be recognized to describe the geometry and mechanism of dyes adsorption onto mil 101 fe surfaces sharib et al 2021 barakat et al 2020 the first scenario n 1 the adsorption of mo and mb molecules can take place in a vertical position through multi interactions mechanism i e one active site of mil 101 fe can capture several dye molecules the second scenario n 1 mo and mb adsorption occurs in a horizontal location via a multi docking mechanism i e numerous mil 101 fe functional groups can remove one dye molecule fig 7 exhibits the values of n parameter related to mb and mo adsorption on mil 101 fe as a function of solution temperature for mo dye the n parameter values were 0 95 1 02 and 1 33 at 20 40 and 60 c respectively as a result horizontal position and multi docking mechanism could be expected for mo adsorption at 20 c while vertical position and multi interactions mechanism could occur at 40 and 60 c the n values were higher than unity at 40 and 60 c and this result indicated the effect of aggregation phenomenon with increasing temperature on the other hand the n values associated to mb adsorption were 1 17 1 68 and 1 78 and thus vertical orientation and multi interactions mechanism were involved in the removal of this dye by the mil 101 fe active sites at all temperatures consequently the aggregation of mb molecules i e mb mb binding in solution was identified at all tested temperatures and this phenomenon resulted in the existence of the non parallel adsorption geometry and a multi molecular mechanism the high degree of mb and mo aggregations with temperature suggested that these adsorption processes were energetically activated in solutions before the interaction between dyes and mil 101 fe surface li et al 2020 3 6 2 the d m parameter fig 7 displays the number of mil 101 fe active sites i e d m parameter with respect the adsorption temperature from 20 to 60 c the d m parameter decreased from 77 33 to 52 38 mg g for mb and from 149 91 to 107 07 mg g for mo dye the decrease of d m value with temperature displayed a reverse trend as compared to the steric n parameters i e the increment of n parameter caused a reduction of the occupied active sites number of the mil 101 fe surface thus the trend of d m parameter assessed the accumulation of the removed dyes molecules at high temperature moreover the aggregated mo and mb molecules could be more selective to definite functional groups of the as synthesized mil 101 fe mobarak et al 2019 also it can be noticed that the d m values associated to mo dye were higher than those of mb dye at all temperatures which could be considered as an important variable of the enhanced adsorption capacity of mil 101 fe for mo dye 3 6 3 total number of the adsorbed mb and mo layers nt 1 n2 to understand the adsorption mechanism of mb and mo molecules on mil 101 fe the determination of the total layers of adsorbed dyes is necessary barakat et al 2020 the calculated nt values were 3 12 3 08 and 2 49 for mb and 5 36 5 03 and 3 76 for mo at 20 40 and 60 c respectively see fig 7 the reduction of nt value with temperature increments could be related to the influence of thermal agitation which resulted in a disordered movement of the adsorbed mb and mo molecules the disturbed state associated to dye dye interaction caused a decrease of the adsorbed dye layers seliem et al 2020 barakat et al 2020 like the d m parameter the nt values associated to mo dye were higher than those of mb dye at all adsorption temperatures i e the n2 parameter presented a significant impact to improve the mo adsorption capacity 3 6 4 the adsorbed mb and mo quantities at saturation q sat n dm nt to estimate the maximum mil 101 fe performance for the adsorption of mo and mb dyes the calculation of q sat values was done fig 7 exhibits the trend of q sat versus temperature and the values of this parameter were 373 74 348 07 and 325 08 mg g for mb and 908 39 777 01 and 677 92 mg g for mo at 20 40 and 60 c respectively these q sat values confirmed the exothermic interactions associated to mb and mo adsorption on mil 101 fe surface for the investigated dyes it was identified that the dm and nt parameters preserved the same trend of the q sat parameter with respect to improving temperature according to the calculated steric parameters it can be concluded that the removal efficiency of mil 101 fe for mo and mb dyes was controlled by the dm and nt parameters furthermore the high values of the q sat for mo as compared to that of mb confirmed the important roles of dm and nt parameters to determine the preference of mil 101 fe for the adsorption of this azo dye 3 7 energetic parameters to obtain an appropriate interpretation for the interactions between mb and mo molecules and mil 101 fe active sites the adsorption energies were calculated seliem et al 2020 barakat et al 2020 these adsorption energies δe were estimated as follows barakat et al 2020 15 c 1 c s e e 1 rt 16 c 2 c s e e 2 rt where c 1and c 2 are the half saturation concentrations and c s is the solubility of the tested mb and mo adsorbates fig 8 shows the δe values as a function of the adsorption temperature the negative δe values confirmed the exothermic interactions between the dyes molecules and the mil 101 fe adsorbent this performance agreed with the influence of solution temperature to reduce the mo and mb adsorption capacities besides the δe values of mo and mb adsorption were 40 kj mol at 20 40 and 60 c which suggested physical adsorption processes sharib et al 2021 barakat et al 2020 δe1 was associated to mil 101 fe dye mb or mo interaction while δe2 described the dye dye interface therefore δe1 values were higher than δe2 all tested temperatures although the e values associated to mb adsorption were higher than those of mo at all temperature the adsorbed mb dye quantities were low and consequently the selectivity of mil 101 fe was not governed by the e parameter 3 8 selectivity of mil 101 fe for the adsorption of mb and mo dyes in binary systems the adsorption selectivity is an important parameter for studying the behavior of an adsorbent for the removal of water pollutants liu et al 2018b for instance graphene like metal organic framework buc 17 was found to be more selective to anionic dyes from an organic dye mixture li et al 2017 moreover eu based mof buc 88 displayed high selectivity to many pharmaceuticals and personal care products wang et al 2021 in this study the adsorption selectivity of the mil 101 fe for the dye removal was investigated using a mixture of mb and mo dyes at different ph values keeping the other operating parameters constant fig 9 shows that mil 101 fe surface was selective to mo and mb dyes at ph 4 and 9 5 respectively besides the adsorption capacities of the tested dyes were slightly decreased in the binary system as compared to the single component one at optimum ph values due to the competition between mo and mb molecules to interact with mil 101 fe active sites i e weak antagonism interaction at ph 7 both dyes were slightly adsorbed without a significant preference for any dye molecule and the adsorption processes could be associated to the π π stacking effect these results suggested that the mil 101 fe mof could be a more selective adsorbent for anionic and cationic dyes depending on the solution ph value 3 9 reusability study fig 10 shows the removal efficiency of mil 101 fe after five regeneration cycles for both mb and mo dyes it is clear that mil 101 fe presented more than 95 for mb removal and 90 for mo removal after all regeneration rounds for mb dye increment of the removal efficiency in the last cycles i e from cycle 3 to 5 could be attributed to the high surface area of mil 101 fe mb interaction which required frequent washing and drying under vacuum to achieve the complete desorption of the attached mb molecules paiman et al 2020 based on the regeneration results the investigated adsorbent can be reutilized numerous times to remove the tested dyes without a significant loss of its removal efficiency thus suggesting an economic benefit and high stability of this adsorbent in the purification of dyes bearing water 4 conclusions mil 101 fe mof was successfully prepared through a facile solvothermal method which was characterized and employed as an adsorbent for mo and mb at different experimental conditions in single and binary adsorption systems mil 101 fe was more selective to mo dye as compared to mb dye the adsorption of both mo and mb followed the pseudo second order and the langmuir equations a multilayer model from statistical physics theory was utilized to understand the mo and mb adsorption mechanisms at a molecular level mo adsorption was governed by multi docking and multi interactions mechanisms while mb adsorption was controlled only by multi interactions mechanism the density of mil 101 fe active sites and the total adsorbed dye layers formed on mof surface were the main parameters that determined the adsorption capacity of mo dye the adsorption of mb and mo molecules by mil 101 fe was mainly caused by physical interactions at all solution temperatures the reusability study demonstrated that the mil 101 fe can maintain an outstanding performance after four adsorption desorption cycles the current study clearly proved that the mil 101 fe can be utilized as an adsorbent for efficient removal of anionic and cationic dyes from polluted solutions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1313,the presence of multicomponent dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl mixtures in porous media can significantly limit the effectiveness of groundwater remediation a series of column transport and flushing experiments were conducted to quantify the impact of various enhanced flushing agents on dissolution and removal of a multicomponent dnapl source within a macroscopically homogeneous porous medium the columns were established with napl saturations consisting of an equal mole mixture of cis 1 2 dichloroethene trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene the solubilization agents used included two complexing sugars hydroxypropyl β cyclodextrin hpcd and methyl β cyclodextrin mcd a surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and a cosolvent ethanol etoh the chemical flushing agents greatly reduced the time needed to remove each dnapl component compared to flushing with water alone initial dnapl component elution concentrations were successfully predicted using raoult s law for mcd hpcd and water flushing indicating that ideal dissolution was initiated by the lower power enhanced solubilization agents etoh was most efficient at removing the contaminants in terms of normalized mass recovery but least efficient based on a mass ratio and mole ratio of contaminant to reagent analysis sds was most efficient for contaminant removal when analyzed based on mass contaminant to mass reagent recovered and mcd was most effective based on a moles contaminant to moles reagent recovered efficiency evaluation however in terms of mass flux reduction analysis i e removal metric sds was least efficient for contaminant removal compared to all other enhanced flushing agents tested especially during the initial stages of dnapl removal results from this study indicate that ideal dissolution was initiated during enhanced solubilization and that several criteria should be used to evaluate the removal effectiveness of flushing agents for multi component napl systems keywords

relationships for multicomponent napl systems during both water and enhanced solubilization flushing conditions e g d affonseca et al 2008 carroll and brusseau 2009 burke 2012 tick et al 2015 padgett et al 2017 mateas et al 2017 the purpose of this research is to evaluate dissolution and removal dynamics of a multicomponent dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl distributed within a homogeneous porous medium during enhanced solubilization flushing i e complexing sugars cosolvents and surfactants to our knowledge this is the first set of column scale experiments to investigate multicomponent napl dissolution and removal processes using four different solubilization enhancing agents specifically contaminant removal effectiveness efficiency was evaluated using several approaches that compare contaminant to solubilization agent removal initial aqueous phase contaminant elution concentrations were evaluated to determine if dissolution processes are occurring ideally equilibrium partitioning using raoult s law during enhanced flushing conditions lastly the mass flux reduction mfr behavior of each target contaminant was examined during flushing to quantify differences in removal efficiency as a function of the specific enhanced flushing agent itself there is currently a lack of research investigating dissolution and removal dynamics of multicomponent napl i e mixed waste systems during enhanced solubilization flushing conditions it is therefore critical to understand the dissolution mass flux reduction and mass removal relationships of multicomponent napl sources under both water flushing i e pump and treat and enhanced remediation scenarios 2 background 2 1 enhanced solubilization agents enhanced solubilization agents are remedial amendments that can be introduced injected into napl contaminated source areas to increase napl phase dissolution or enhance desorption resulting in the increased apparent solubility of contaminant increase in aqueous concentration in the aqueous phase under pumping extraction more contaminant mass per volume of flushing can be removed and treated ex situ compared to traditional pump and treat approaches some commonly used enhanced solubilization agents tested under laboratory and field scenarios include complexing sugars i e cyclodextrins surface active agent surfactants and cosolvents i e alcohols more discussion can be found in tick et al 2015 and tick and rincon 2009 on these specific types of enhanced solubilization agents 2 2 multicomponent napl dissolution behavior 2 2 1 equilibrium dissolution raoult s law analysis raoult s law describes the equilibrium partitioning behavior between the napl mixture and the aqueous phase as described by tick et al 2015 1 s ei x i n s i γ i n where s ei represents the dissolved phase concentration of component i from the napl mixture x i n is the napl phase molar fraction of component i in a mixture s i is the pure phase solubility limit of component i mg l 1 and γ i n is the napl phase activity coefficient of component i of the napl mixture which describes the effects of nonideal partitioning the γ i n term may be larger than unity napl phase non ideal condition when the organic chemical is significantly dissimilar in shape size or polarity from the average characteristics of the bulk napl mixture especially when the napl phase mole fraction of the constituent is small banerjee 1984 burris and macintyre 1985 schwarzenbach and imboden 1993 mccray and brusseau 1998 1999 carroll and brusseau 2009 carroll et al 2009 padgett et al 2017 mateas et al 2017 2 2 2 enhanced solubilization of organic liquid mixtures raoult s law analysis the enhanced solubilization agent s esa enhancement of a single component organic liquid constituent can be defined as e g ji and brusseau 1998 2 e i 0 s e 0 s a 0 where e i o is the solubility enhancement factor for the single component organic liquid in the presence of the esa s a o is the single component s i solubility limit mg l 1 and s e o is the pure component s i enhanced apparent solubility mg l 1 for cyclodextrin solutions the enhanced equilibrium solubility is a function of the cyclodextrin concentration expressed as 3 s e 0 s a 0 1 k cw c cd s a 0 e i 0 where c cd is the aqueous concentration of cyclodextrin mg l 1 and k cw is the partition coefficient of the solute i between cyclodextrin and water l mg 1 alternatively the enhancement factor e i o can be expressed as a function of the cyclodextrin concentration and the solute s partition coefficient between cyclodextrin and water as 4 e i 0 1 k cw c cd for ideal dissolution the value of e i in a multicomponent napl system is the same as that measured for a single component napl system e i o e i e i o since activity napl phase activity coefficients are unity the cyclodextrin i e hcpd mcd enhanced solubility raoult s law expression can be further expressed by substituting eq 1 into the multicomponent version of eqs 2 or 3 for an ideal organic liquid mixture as ji and brusseau 1998 mccray and brusseau 1999 5 s e 0 s a 0 x i n e i 0 similar to that for cyclodextrin enhanced apparent solubilization due to the presence of surfactant solution can be described as ji and brusseau 1998 6 s e 0 s a 0 1 k m c cmc s a 0 e i 0 where k m is the partition coefficient of solute i between the surfactant micelle and water l mg 1 cmc is the critical micelle concentration mg l 1 and c is the concentration of the surfactant mg l 1 when c cmc for ideal dissolution the value of e i in a multicomponent napl system is the same as that measured for a single component napl system e i o and therefore eq 6 reduces to a form identical to eq 5 the solubility of an organic contaminant in the presence of a cosolvent can be expressed as a function of the volume fraction of cosolvent f c in solution and σ represents the cosolvency power of the cosolvent in terms of the slope of the solubilization profile i e log solubility vs f c as ji and brusseau 1998 7 log s e 0 log s a 0 σ f c therefore the enhancement factor e i o of an organic contaminant molecule in the presence of a cosolvent can be rearranged as follows 8 e i 0 10 σ f c the enhanced solubilization due to a cosolvent i e ethanol etoh is also similar to previous derivations and can be described as ji and brusseau 1998 9 s e 0 s a 0 10 σ f c s a 0 e i 0 similar to the previous description the enhanced solubility raoult s law expression can be expressed by substituting eq 1 into the multicomponent version of eqs 2 or 9 for an ideal organic liquid mixture to form the general expression as eq 5 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials stainless steel columns 2 2 cm i d 7 cm length alltech co were used in all

sds were selected based on their relatively widespread use as solubilization agents and relatively high solubilization power mcd and hpcd were used based on their availability at a commercial scale and recent interest as flushing agents 3 2 experimental procedures 3 2 1 conservative tracer tests prior to the dnapl source flushing experiments a series of pfba conservative tracer transport through column tests were conducted to verify that consistent uniform packing methods were employed and that advection was the dominant mechanism of transport for the 20 30 mesh sand column systems the results confirmed that the porous media packing method consistently produced transport conditions dominated by advection i e pe numbers 80 3 2 2 preparation of the multicomponent dnapl source for the series of flushing experiments a uniform immiscible liquid distribution was created employing a mixing technique to minimize elution behavior artifacts due to bypass flow immiscible liquid fingering

within a moist sand was packed into the columns and saturated following the methods described in tick and rincon 2009 to establish an initial dnapl saturation s n targeted at 20 30 3 2 3 flushing experiments for each flushing experiment synthetic groundwater used for the water flush experiment or the respective enhanced solubilization agent was pumped through the column at a flow rate q of 0 59 cm3 min 1 darcy velocity q 0 15 cm min 1 linear pore velocity v p 29 cm hr 1 to represent induced flushing conditions consistent with pump and treat and remediation scenarios fig 1 a 5 wt concentration of mcd hpcd and sds was used for these enhanced flushing experiments and to compare results to prior studies that used these same concentrations boving and brusseau 2000 tick and rincon 2009 tick et al 2015 furthermore the 5 wt concentrations were used to satisfy micellar solubilization removal conditions avoid interfacial effects that could induce dnapl mobilization minimize reagent costs and minimize viscosity effects that may alter flow through the porous medium a 50 wt etoh concentration was used because a 5 wt solution has been shown to have a negligible effect on solubilization boving and brusseau 2000 each flushing experiment was replicated to ensure consistency of the results and overall trends associated with each specific chemical agent all experiments were performed in a temperature controlled laboratory with an average temperature of 20 0 c 1 c variation at the termination of each experiment each respective column was disassembled and the porous medium and remaining solution was transferred to a 20 ml headspace vial and subjected to solvent extraction using methanol certified acs grade fisher scientific co in all cases there was no detectable concentration of dnapl mixture compounds dce tce pce still remaining in the columns indicating that most of the mass was removed during the flushing experiments samples from the column effluent were collected using a gas tight glass syringe and 0 5 5 ml i e based on dilutions were transferred immediately into 20 ml glass borosilicate headspace vials and the total volume in the vial was adjusted to 5 ml depending on desired dilution factor the vials were then immediately crimped with an aluminum cap and airtight septa prior to gas chromatography gc analysis all samples were analyzed using a gc shimadzu gc 17a equipped with an aoc 5000 ctc leap technologies autosampler and a flame ionization detector fid specifically each headspace sample vial was agitated at 80 c for 10 min to effectively transfer the aqueous phase contaminant into the headspace a 1 μl subsample from the headspace was transferred to the gc injection port via a headspace syringe automated subjected to a temperature of 40 c 2 min followed by a linear increase in temperature 10 c min 1 until a maximum temperature was maintained 180 c for 5 min i e temperature program and then the voltage vs retention time signal chromatogram from the fid was recorded and converted to concentrations using standard curves samples analyzed after 48 h were stored at 4 c until being measured on the gc using the same methods as described previously the quantifiable detection limit was 0 01 mg l 1 for the organic compounds dce tce and pce respectively the early time flushing samples were allowed to sit at 4 c for at least 24 h prior to analysis to allow any micro or macro emulsions to stabilize and accumulate on the vial bottom careful visual inspection of each sample was conducted especially during early time flushing first several pore volumes when most mobilization would be expected to occur boving and brusseau 2000 boving et al 2000 duplicate samples were stored visually inspected for dnapl presence and analyzed after the completion of the experiments there was no visual evidence of dnapl mobilization from the inspection of samples after 24 h or more duplicate samples of sit time however this fact does not exclude the occurrence of mobilization as dnapl could be mobilized within the column and not be captured from effluent sampling events evidence indicates that low mcd and hpcd concentrations tend not to produce enough reduction in dnapl water interfacial tension to initiate mobilization boving and brusseau 2000 tick and rincon 2009 however boving and brusseau 2000 observed the mobilization of dnapl during early time sds flushing even though mobilization accounted for a small percentage of the dnapl removal it should be noted that the predominance of napl solubilization compared to napl mobilization is highly dependent upon the napl saturation in the porous media among other interfacial factors the results of the experiments herein and the prior enhanced flushing studies indicate that solubilization was the dominant mechanism of contaminant removal 4 results and discussion 4 1 elution behavior while the general elution behavior is similar for all the contaminants the removal rate displayed for each stage of flushing is unique to each individual flushing agent itself table 2 provides the conditions and basic dnapl removal results for each column flushing experiment 4 1 1 water flushing fig 2 2a and 2b shows the contaminant elution curves dce tce pce for the water flush in comparison to the contaminant elution curves for enhanced flushing agents the water flush provides a baseline for contaminant elution and removal in the absence of a remedial enhanced solubilization agent and represents a pump and treat type flushing scenario dce the highest solubility component attained the greatest concentration 1160 mg l 1 in the shortest flushing time 1 1 pore volumes pvs and then concentrations declined until tailing occurred at about 30 pvs majority of mass was removed and persisted until detection limit was reached 220 pv tce was slightly delayed 27 pvs relative to dce in reaching its peak concentration average 550 mg l 1 consistent with the order of solubility for all three components until tailing behavior was observed after about 120 pvs of flushing pce the lowest solubility component exhibited the most pronounced delay in peak concentration 160 mg l 1 after about 100 pvs of flushing at which point concentration slowly declined until extensive tailing behavior occurred after 300 pvs of water flushing as dce concentrations declined both tce and pce increased due to the relative increase in component mole fractions furthermore as tce became depleted pce continued to increase based on the relative mole fraction increase after approximately 450 pvs of flushing a significant fraction of the component masses dce tce pce were removed from the system 4 1 2 hpcd enhanced flushing the hpcd flush fig 2a produced the least effective minimal solubility enhancement for the three chlorinated contaminant compounds dce tce pce when compared to all other enhanced solubilization agents fig 2 2a and 2b for the purposes of this study the solubility enhancement is defined and calculated by comparing the maximum enhanced effluent concentration of the respective target contaminant during enhanced flushing to the maximum effluent concentration obtained during water flushing the enhancement factor e is defined as follows 10 e c ef max c wf max neither of the target contaminants had reached detection limit until after at least 140 pvs of flushing demonstrating the relative ineffective long term removal under these conditions the maximum observed dce concentration average peak during the hpcd flush was approximately 1000 mg l 1 between 1 and 4 pv showing no enhancement e 0 9 1 compared to water flushing conditions table 3 the dce concentration declined rapidly over the first 15 pvs of flushing but was then followed by a concentration tailing period 15 60 pv and another rapid concentration decline stage 60 pv and finally a period of extensive concentration tailing which persisted until detection limit was reached 240 pv the maximum observed tce concentration average peak was approximately 500 mg l 1 between 1 and 15 pv corresponding to negligible enhancement e 0 9 1 following this stage a steady decline in tce concentration constant rate occurred until about 60 pvs of flushing at which point a more rapid decline of tce concentration occurred until concentration tailing condition began 110 pv and continued until detection limit was attained 340 pv although dce and tce showed no appreciable solubility enhancement during hpcd flushing pce exhibited a slight enhancement the maximum observed pce concentration average peak was approximately 720 mg l 1 at 21 pv corresponding to an enhancement factor of 4 e 4 4 table 3 after peak concentrations were attained pce showed a relatively rapid decrease in concentration 60 pv until tailing occurred 110 pv and continued until detection limit was reached 340 pv overall hpcd did not effectively enhance the removal solubility of the higher solubility components dce tce but showed noticeable removal enhancement for pce the lowest aqueous solubility component this suggests that hpcd s effectiveness for enhanced removal of multicomponent napl systems may be limited thus requiring the consideration of other enhanced solubilization agents such as surfactants cosolvents or complexing sugars such as mcd this study was not designed to determine the specific mechanistic processes between hpcd and contaminants that account for the negligible solubility enhancement e 1 for the higher aqueous solubility components dce tce while enhancing the solubility and removal of pce lowest solubility component however for multicomponent napl systems sources it may be that the interactions between hpcd and napl components result in negligible ineffective removal when their aqueous solubilities are above some critical value wherein the complexation reaction is outcompeted or has a stronger partitioning preference for the substantially lower solubility components in the system under such a condition desirable hpcd enhancement interactions would only be appropriate for low solubility components of a complex napl source mixture the use of hpcd in this case may be viable for only very specific scenarios and goals site specific contaminant specific regulatory specific conditions of the remediation operation 4 1 3 mcd flushing the mcd flush fig 2a resulted in a notable increase in the solubility of the three contaminants dce tce pce compared to the water flush the maximum observed dce concentration average peak was approximately 2000 mg l 1 at 3 pv corresponding to an enhancement factor e of about 2 e 1 7 dce concentrations rapidly declined whereby concentration tailing occurred 25 pv and continued until detection limit was reached after about 60 70 pvs of flushing the maximum observed tce concentration average peak was approximately 5000 mg l 1 at 16 pv corresponding to an e of about 9 e 8 7 table 3 tce concentrations declined at a constant rate until low concentration tailing occurred 70 pv and the detection limit was reached after about 120 pvs of flushing the maximum observed pce concentration average peak was approximately 2400 mg l 1 at 24 28 pv corresponding to an e of approximately 15 e 15 1 table 3 the pce concentration declined at a constant rate until concentration tailing occurred 75 80 pv and persisted until the detection limit was reached after about 160 pvs of flushing tce and pce likely reached the detection limit simultaneously due to the relatively efficient removal of dce allowing the two less soluble components tce and pce to dissolve at more or less similar rates mcd proved to be one of the most effective flushing agents in terms of removal time i e pvs flushed 4 1 4 sds flushing in terms of the 5 wt agents the sds flush resulted in the greatest solubility enhancement for the target contaminant concentrations proving to be one of the most effective agents for removing initial contaminant mass within the least amount of time i e pvs fig 2b however the three target contaminants dce tce pce exhibited notable shouldering effects i e rapid decline followed by a quasi steady state elution period and significant tailing towards the later stages of flushing the maximum observed dce concentration average peak during sds flushing was approximately 4400 mg l 1 between 1 and 2 pv corresponding to an e of about 4 e 3 8 table 3 dce concentrations initially declined relatively rapidly and was followed by one notable elution shouldering step 10 35 pv wherein concentration tailing quasi steady state occurred for a period of time followed by a relatively rapid concentration decline and then a final concentration tailing condition that persisted until detection limit was reached 90 pv until termination of the flushing experiment the maximum observed tce concentration average peak was approximately 9000 mg l 1 at 1 2 pv corresponding to an e equal of about 16 e 15 9 tce concentrations then declined relatively rapidly between 2 and 7 pvs followed by one distinct elution steady state rapid decline phases i e shouldering events similar to that of the dce elution behavior described previously the tce elution shouldering quasi steady state elution event occurred between 12 and 25 pvs followed by a relatively rapid concentration decline 25 35 pvs and subsequent low concentration tailing until detection limit was reached 120 pv the maximum observed pce concentration average peak was approximately 9700 mg l 1 1 2 pv corresponding to an e of 60 e 59 5 table 3 pce concentration declined relatively rapidly until a pronounced elution shouldering step quasi steady state occurred 13 20 pv followed by a sharp concentration decline and low concentration tailing after about 35 pvs until detection limit was reached after about 130 pv of sds flushing the observed elution shouldering behavior may be in part due to the existence of poorly accessible contaminant dce tce pce mass to flushing solution and or a limitation due to the surfactant sds itself it is possible that this higher solubilization power agent acts to quickly remove readily accessible mass i e steady state portions thereby leaving poorly accessible mass rapid concentration declines and eventually low concentration tailing conditions these shouldering events may also be related to composition dependent factors and mole competitive effects whereby as the higher solubility component is removed reduced mole fraction a resulting and simultaneous or subsequent relative mole fraction increase for the other lower solubility components occurs causing them to transiently increase stabilize appearing as steady state for a period of time 4 1 5 etoh flushing the 50 wt ethanol etoh flushing experiments resulted in the greatest overall increase in apparent solubility and enhancement for all three target contaminant compounds dce tce pce which was also observed in other studies boving and brusseau 2000 tick and rincon 2009 all three target contaminants peaked quickly in order of their solubility highest solubility peaked first etc and contaminant elution concentrations then declined rapidly until reaching a steady state rapid decline shouldering stage until low concentration tailing occurred for the remaining flushing period fig 2b the maximum observed dce concentration peak during etoh flushing was about 14 000 mg l 1 at 3 pv corresponding to an e of about 12 e 12 0 table 3 following the peak concentration an immediate dce concentration decline was observed no initial steady state elution period between 3 and 10 pvs a subsequent concentration shouldering stage occurred whereby a quasi steady state elution period and rapid concentration decline period occurred 10 20 pv until a final low concentration tailing condition began 23 pv and persisted until detection limit was reached after about 50 pvs of flushing the maximum observed tce concentration peak was approximately 35 000 mg l 1 at 3 pv corresponding to an e of about 61 e 60 8 tce concentration then declined relatively quickly until a subtle concentration shouldering effect was observed between about 13 20 pvs of flushing during this period tce concentrations exhibited a short quasi steady state condition followed by a concentration decline finally reaching a final low concentration tailing condition 25 50 pv that persisted until detection limit was attained after about 110 pvs of flushing the maximum observed pce concentration peak during flushing was approximately 21 000 mg l 1 at 6 pv corresponding to an e of about 129 e 128 8 table 3 pce concentration then declined relatively quickly then subsequently exhibiting two distinct steady state concentration decline stages i e shouldering effects 15 20 pv 21 30 pv until extensive low concentration tailing occurred 140 pv and the detection limit was reached for the experiment it should be noted that during the 50 wt etoh flush small amounts of pure phase immiscible liquid were collected indicating that the ethanol did cause some minor mobilization of the napl at the end of each enhanced flushing experiment i e hpcd mcd sds and etoh a solvent extraction was conducted on the column sediments to determine whether any remaining napl phase still remained in the system in each case trace amounts of immiscible liquid usually pce were noted indicating that the least soluble chemical had not been completely removed by the flushing agents this is likely due to the lower solubility limits of pce which is an order of magnitude less soluble than tce and dce because tailing behavior was observed in all experiments it is safe to assume that concentration tailing conditions would continue until all remaining mass was removed it is important to note however that this research was not focused on analyzing specific tailing behavior during immiscible liquid dissolution but rather on first order and initial dissolution processes and overall mass removal effectiveness for chlorinated multicomponent dnapl sources using different enhanced solubilization flushing agents the late time tailing behavior observed in almost all the elution curves will be quantified in a future study using the popular time nonlocal transport models zhang et al 2020 4 2 time continuous mass flux reduction time continuous mass flux behavior was examined for all contaminant components using mass flux reduction mfr analysis fig 3 further discussion on mfr analyses can be found in brusseau et al 2008 difilippo and brusseau 2008 tick and rincon 2009 and tick et al 2015 evaluation of the contaminant napl components mfr as a function of contaminant mass removal mr for different enhanced solubilization agents i e etoh sds mcd and hpcd allows for comparison of the particular flushing agent s impact on the contaminant s removal efficiency early mfr of the contaminant prior to significant contaminant mass removal describes an inefficient removal process whereas a condition in which the mass flux of the contaminant is sustained until nearly all of the mass is depleted describes a more efficient removal process based on mfr analysis the impact of the specific enhanced solubilization flushing agents on the contaminant s dce tce pce removal processes shows notable variation in removal efficiency fig 3 overall the majority of flushing agents generally yielded inefficient removal of the contaminant mass most notably for sds and hpcd sds initiated the least efficient contaminant removal under this evaluation metric whereby early mfr progressed relatively rapidly and continuously prior to removing significant mass from the system the hpcd flushing agent initiated inefficient removal behavior but achieved slightly improved mass removal efficiency for dce and tce specifically compared to sds fig 3 however in contrast to sds the hpcd induced relatively efficient removal behavior for the lowest solubility component pce the mcd and etoh enhanced solubilization flushing agents produced relatively efficient contaminant removal compared to that of the sds and hpcd agents although mcd and etoh performed similarly in terms of contaminant component removal efficiency mcd generally yielded greater removal efficiency for all contaminant components dce tce pce whereby contaminant mass flux was sustained least mfr while total fraction of the mass was depleted during the mass removal process i e notable total mass was removed prior to a significant mfr fig 3 interestingly the contaminant removal produced by mcd and etoh showed an overall similar trend to that of hpcd whereby the lowest solubility component pce exhibited the most efficient removal process compared to the higher solubility components dce and tce fig 3 moreover with the exception of the sds flushing agent the removal of the highest solubility component dce generally demonstrated the least efficient removal among the contaminants components when evaluated individually for each respective flushing agent generally the water flush pump and treat scenario will tend to exhibit more efficient removal behavior due to the fact that the quasi maximum mass flux emanating from the napl source will be sustained throughout the mass removal process however the water flush demonstrated significant variability of napl component removal efficiency fig 3 for example similar to the results yielded by hpcd mcd and etoh the order of contaminant removal efficiency during the water flush produced the most efficient removal process for pce and the least efficient for dce in summary the sds flushing agent yielded the least efficient contaminant mass removal behavior in terms of the time continuous mfr analysis exhibiting significant initial mfr during the mass removal flushing process such mass removal inefficiency effects may be related to the associated larger solubilization power of sds compared to the other agents in addition it is plausible that high initial solubilization of readily accessible dnapl occurred decreasing available interfacial area and resulting in early mfr and low rates of mass flux decline also surfactant specific interactions due to micellar complexation may be responsible for this less ideal mass flux behavior the hpcd flushing agent also showed relatively inefficient mass removal behavior for dce but moderate to efficient removal for tce and pce under such conditions hpcd a lower solubilization power agent may preferentially interact and form more ideal stronger complexes with lower solubility components when multicomponent napl mixtures are present in fact studies have indicated that greater solubility enhancement occurs for lower solubility more hydrophobic organic contaminants for cyclodextrin flushing agents such as hpcd mccray and brusseau 1998 mccray and brusseau 1999 tick et al 2015 mcd and etoh flushing agents yielded the most efficient contaminant removal with mcd generally inducing more efficient removal conditions for all contaminant components dce tce pce for the most part a general trend of napl component removal was observed for each respective flushing agent whereby the lowest solubility component pce exhibited the most efficient removal process while the highest solubility component dce exhibited the least efficient removal such effects suggest that the greater solubility enhancement generally occurs for the lower solubility compounds for all the flushing agents tested consistent with that observed for hpcd as described above mccray and brusseau 1999 this further indicates that for multicomponent systems it is expected that the lower solubility components will generally experience more efficient removal processes a potentially critical factor to consider when designing an appropriate remediation strategy for such contaminant source systems 4 3 enhanced flushing contaminant removal effectiveness remediation effectiveness can be evaluated using several different contaminant removal metrics based upon the particular goals of the remediation removal effectiveness can vary depending on assessing contaminant removal time the mass of reagent used i e vol or wt and the mass or moles of contaminant removed per mole of reagent used all of which can have implications on total cost of a specific strategy i e complexing sugar surfactant or cosolvent remediation effectiveness was evaluated by comparing 1 contaminant mass or normalized removal removal per time 2 contaminant mass to reagent mass removed and 3 contaminant moles to reagent moles removed during flushing comparative evaluation of the three metrics discussed herein should be conducted to assess the most efficient removal processes based on the objectives of site specific remediation for instance although contaminant source removal based on a normalized mass recovery metric may generally be most efficient for removing napl component in the order of highest aqueous solubility to least the order of napl component removal efficiency can differ significantly when using contaminant removal metrics that also incorporate the amount of reagent used table 4 fig 4 thus a comparative removal metric approach may be preferred and depend upon whether one contaminant component is more of a concern in more abundance or more persistent to best aid in the selection of a particular enhanced flushing agent for a site specific remediation scenario 4 3 1 normalized mass recovery comparison of normalized contaminant mass recovery is one method to evaluate the removal effectiveness and efficiency for the particular flushing agent i e water hpcd mcd sds and etoh specifically normalized contaminant mass recovery analysis compares the incremental mass per time of the contaminant removed to the total contaminant mass removed over the duration of flushing i e normalizing the mass solubilized per pore volume to the total mass solubilized for these analyses it is assumed that the mass removed from the elution profiles represent the total contaminant mass in the system also confirmed by solvent extractions as described in previous sections table 4 and fig 4a show the results for the normalized contaminant mass recoveries for the various flushing experiments overall a general trend was observed in that the high solubility component dce was removed first followed by tce intermediate solubility component and finally pce lowest solubility component from all flushing experiments although this removal order is generally consistent for the suite of experiments under early time removal there are some minor variations in which tce showed improved removal efficiency over dce during later stages of removal i e etoh and sds additionally tce exhibited more efficient removal compared to dce during all stages of hpcd flushing in terms of overall dnapl component dce tce pce removal performance with respect to enhanced solubilzation agent the etoh flush yielded the most efficient contaminant removal and the hpcd flush yielded the least efficient removal process resulting in the following order agent effectiveness on contaminant component removal efficiency etoh sds mcd hpcd fig 4a the water flush was generally least effective for contaminant mass removal table 4 fig 4a for dce and tce complete normalized mass recovery was achieved in approximately 20 and 60 pvs respectively however pce showed the most significant tailing behavior as it took about 350 pvs to completely remove pce from the system in terms of normalized mass recovery for the hpcd flush insignificant differences in normalized mass recovery were observed for tce and dce compared to those produced from the water flush table 4 fig 4a complete normalized mass recovery was achieved in approximately 20 and 60 pvs respectively for these two components this indicates that at least for the conditions of these flow cell experiments there was no measurable improvement in removal effectiveness for the higher solubility components tce and dce for hpcd compared to water flush therefore the added cost of hpcd material would render it as a less efficient solubilization agent for tce and dce for such a 3 component napl source system however a notable improvement in normalized mass recovery for pce was observed for the hpcd flush compared to water flushing taking less than half the time to completely remove mass from the system i e 110 pvs this suggests that hpcd will provide greater contaminant removal effectiveness efficiency for lower solubility components of multicomponent napl sources the highest rate of mass contaminant mass removal i e steep slopes was observed from sds flushing whereby pce tce and dce were all removed from the system within the first 10 15 pvs table 4 fig 4a based on normalized contaminant mass recovery sds was most effective compared to hpcd under the conditions of these experiments it should be noted that the sds flushing experiment had a slightly lower napl saturation less total mass than that of the hpcd flushing experiment and this may be in part responsible for the lower removal efficiency associated with hpcd based on this contaminant removal approach sds was 5 13 times more efficient at contaminant removal dce tce pce respectively 4 3 2 contaminant mass to reagent mass recovery another way to evaluate the effectiveness of the flushing agents is to calculate the mass removal of the contaminants per unit mass of the flushing agent removed this is important for the evaluation of overall cost of the remediation activity reagent and the total amount of flushing solution that will be needed to effectively remediate a site the normalized mass ratio mass of pce tce and dce removed at each pore volume interval divided by the total mass was divided by the cumulative mass of agent flushed through the flow cell at each pore volume the results of the mass contaminant to mass reagent removal efficiency for the flushing experiments are shown in table 4 and fig 4b although the water flush was least efficient for contaminant removal similar trends for the other flushing agents hpcd and sds were observed whereby pce and tce showed most efficient removal compared to dce removal when evaluated using this approach table 4 fig 4b based on the achievement of maximum contaminant removal efficiency the water flush was approximately 20 900 times less efficient than the hpcd and sds flushing experiments respectively for the removal of dce tce and pce table 4 the sds flush resulted in the greatest efficiency reaching maximum contaminant removal efficiency after nearly one pore volume of flushing as opposed to about 2 8 pvs for the hpcd flush fig 4b the maximum contaminant removal efficiency for the sds flush was maintained for the shortest period of time compared to hpcd sharply declining as contaminant mass is removed and tailing conditions become more pronounced the decrease is most likely due to the reduction of the residual mass dce tce pce in the flow cell whereby maximum solubilization cannot be maintained due to the significant depletion of contaminant mass the maximum contaminant removal dce tce pce efficiency produced from both sds and hpcd flushing was about 50 900 and 20 150 times greater respectively than that during water flushing conditions table 4 fig 4b the sds flushing experiment had a much higher increase in efficiency for pce due to the sds solubilization enhancement factor of pce being almost 59 compared to only 9 for the hpcd flushing experiment as measured from iep overall sds was 3 6 times more efficient at contaminant removal dce tce pce respectively than hpcd based on this mass contaminant vs mass reagent evaluation approach 4 3 3 contaminant moles to reagent moles recovery the results of the flushing experiments were also compared based on the moles of contaminant removed per moles of chemical reagent used these analyses were conducted by calculating the cumulative moles of dce tce and pce removed per cumulative moles of flushing agent removed for each pore volume these analyses provide a quantitative relationship between the molecules of contaminant removed based on each molecule of the flushing agent used removed this is important for the evaluation of overall cost of the remediation activity reagent and the total amount of flushing solution that will be needed to effectively remediate a site the results of the moles contaminant to moles reagent removal efficiency for the flushing experiments are shown in table 4 and fig 4c as expected the water flush was least efficient at contaminant removal compared to the enhanced flushing experiments hpcd and sds when evaluated by this mole removal approach figs 4c based on the achievement of maximum contaminant removal efficiency the water flush was approximately 1400 12 000 times less efficient than the hpcd and sds flushing experiments respectively for the removal of dce tce and pce table 4 in contrast to the mass contaminant vs mass reagent removed approach the hpcd flush resulted in greater maximum efficiency magnitude compared to sds reaching maximum contaminant removal efficiency between 1 and 3 pore volumes of flushing fig 4c the maximum contaminant removal efficiency for the hpcd and sds was maintained for a relatively short period of time and then followed by an efficiency decline as contaminant mass was removed and tailing conditions become more pronounced this decrease is most likely due to the reduction of the residual mass dce tce pce in the flow cell whereby maximum solubilization cannot be maintained due to the significant depletion of contaminant mass the maximum contaminant removal dce tce pce efficiency produced from both hpcd and sds flushing was about 4000 12 000 and 1400 10 500 times greater respectively than that during water flushing conditions table 4 fig 4c overall hpcd was 1 2 3 times more efficient at contaminant removal dce tce pce respectively than sds based on this removal efficiency approach based on this mole contaminant vs mole reagent evaluation approach it may be expected that to some degree hpcd might show improvements over sds flushing since the enhanced contaminant solubilization requires formation of surfactant micelles moiety a relatively larger number of surfactant molecules monomers are needed critical micelle concentration to initiate contaminant removal by solubilization processes for surfactants this effect would tend to reduce the mole contaminant to mole reagent efficiency compared to other reagents in contrast hpcd generally forms a 1 1 inclusion complex to partition one molecule of the organic contaminant into its single molecular interior since the effective concentrations for both sds and hpcd were identical 5 wt during flushing it might be speculated that hpcd would show efficiency improvements over sds when evaluated on a normalized mole removal analysis however for assessing efficiency improvement it is also important to consider how many molecules of contaminant can partition or complex to the molecule or moiety itself the greater number of contaminant molecules able to react with the molecule would have an effect of increasing removal efficiency based on this analysis any reduction in efficiency caused by the increased need of molecules of reagent could be offset by the relative increased number of contaminant molecules able to partition or complex to the reagent since surfactants have the capability of solubilizing partitioning many contaminant molecules within a single micelle moiety in contrast to the 1 1 contaminant reagent complex of hpcd it is also important to be aware and consider such potential effects on removal analysis 4 4 raoult s law and initial dissolution behavior raoult s law was used to predict initial equilibrium aqueous elution concentrations from the dissolution of the organic phase napl phase mixture source for various enhanced solubilization and water flushing experiments tick et al 2015 ji and brusseau 1998 mccray and brusseau 1999 the purpose of this analysis was to evaluate whether dissolution processes under such flushing conditions at least initially are ideal and can be described adequately via raoult s law refer to discussion presented in section 2 2 table 5 in general the higher power enhanced solubilization agents etoh and sds initiated significant enhanced concentrations for all components dce tce pce within an extremely short to non existent initial steady state elution phase the lower power enhanced solubility agents mcd and hpcd yielded relatively short initial steady state dissolution periods but were noticeably longer extended compared to that observed for etoh and sds with hpcd yielding the longest initial steady state elution period and overall lowest solubility enhancement effectiveness over the duration of flushing and contaminant removal generally the lower power enhanced solubilization flushing experiments hpcd mcd and water exhibited relatively ideal initial dissolution elution behavior that could be predicted using raoult s law furthermore the results show that napl phase activity coefficients were close to unity and within accepted ranges γ i n 0 5 2 0 that typically describe ideal initial dissolution elution behavior banerjee 1984 burris and macintyre 1985 schwarzenbach and imboden 1993 padgett et al 2017 mateas et al 2017 table 5 however the higher power enhanced solubilization flushing experiments yielded initial elution concentrations that could not be well predicted via raoult s law and the resulting napl phase activity coefficients γ i n 0 02 0 09 indicated that initial dissolution was relatively nonideal especially for tce and pce the lower aqueous solubility components table 5 the raoult s law analysis conducted herein suggests that the higher power enhanced solubilization agents such as etoh and sds cosolvents and surfactants are expected to initiate nonideal dissolution processes quickly during the flushing contaminant remediation removal process wherein raoult s law may not be applicable for the prediction of contaminant initial elution concentration and mass removal however the results suggest that raoult s law may be able to be successfully applied when using lower power enhanced solubilization agents for predicting initial elution behavior and mass removal understanding such initial dissolution constraints for various types of enhanced solubilization agents and removal processes can be useful when selecting a particular agent and applying these flushing techniques in the field 5 conclusion the presence of multicomponent napl in soil and groundwater can severely complicate the removal process and ability to predict resulting aqueous phase concentrations from such source areas a series of enhanced solubilization column scale experiments were conducted to evaluate contaminant removal effectiveness and initial dissolution processes occurring from a multicomponent dnapl source distributed within a saturated homogeneous sand medium although all four enhanced solubilization agents reduced the time and volume of flushing solution needed to remove the multi component dnapl source etoh cosolvent sds surfactant and mcd methyl complexing sugar were most effective in source removal per time compared to water flushing i e pump and treat hpcd hydroxypropyl complexing sugar was least effective in total source removal per time during flushing but was approximately two times more efficient compared to water flushing the two high power solubilization agents etoh and sds showed significant enhancement of aqueous contaminant concentrations early in the flushing process removing a bulk of source mass within the first 10 30 pvs of flushing although mcd had a notable effect on enhanced solubilization of source contaminant and removal four times more efficient than water flushing the hpcd initiated little to no solubilization enhancement for the source contaminants during flushing the greatest solubility enhancement was observed for the lowest solubility dnapl component pce and solubility enhancement generally decreased with increasing contaminant aqueous solubility as e pce e tce e dce this suggests that such flushing agents will have the greatest relative removal effectiveness for the most persistent lower solubility contaminants in groundwater systems in terms of mass flux reduction mfr analysis most flushing agents yielded inefficient removal for the dnapl contaminant components with sds and hpcd generally initiating the least efficient removal condition etoh and mcd initiated more efficient removal of dnapl source mass generally outperforming all other flushing agents interestingly the lowest solubility component pce exhibited the most efficient removal condition and except for sds the highest solubility component dce demonstrated the least efficient removal condition such findings can be important when selecting an enhanced solubilization agent for a specific site with a range of aqueous solubilities in terms of mass removal effectiveness etoh generally produced the most efficient removal condition when evaluated on a normalized contaminant mass removal basis with sds and mcd producing nearly identical efficiency for source mass removal when evaluated on a contaminant mass to solubilization agent mass removal basis sds yielded the most efficient source removal condition that may be attributed in part to the generally higher solubilization power of sds although slightly less efficient than sds mcd demonstrated notable removal efficiency under this removal basis when evaluated on a contaminant mole to solubilization agent mole removal basis mcd produced the most effective source removal condition with hpcd demonstrating decent but notably reduced efficiency for source mass removal overall it was evident that the complexing sugars generally outperformed the surfactant and alcohol under this removal efficiency evaluation scheme the reduced efficiency for sds under this removal metric may be due in part to relatively larger number of surfactant molecules required to initiate contaminant removal through micellar solubilization processes generally the lower power enhanced solubilization agents water hpcd mcd initiated ideal initial dissolution elution conditions from the multicomponent dnapl source that could be predicted using raoult s law in contrast the higher power enhanced solubilization agents etoh and sds initiated relatively nonideal dissolution elution behavior that could not be predicted using raoult s law relationships understanding such initial dissolution constraints for various types of enhanced solubilization agents and removal processes can be useful when selecting an agent and applying these flushing techniques in the field the findings of this study suggest that the selection of a flushing agent should be evaluated carefully prior to the remediation of complex multicomponent napl sources as the mass flux and removal behavior of each contaminant may vary significantly depending on the contaminant source and flushing agent employed credit authorship contribution statement geoffreyr tick supervision conceptualization methodology formal analysis validation visualization writing

1313,the presence of multicomponent dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl mixtures in porous media can significantly limit the effectiveness of groundwater remediation a series of column transport and flushing experiments were conducted to quantify the impact of various enhanced flushing agents on dissolution and removal of a multicomponent dnapl source within a macroscopically homogeneous porous medium the columns were established with napl saturations consisting of an equal mole mixture of cis 1 2 dichloroethene trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene the solubilization agents used included two complexing sugars hydroxypropyl β cyclodextrin hpcd and methyl β cyclodextrin mcd a surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and a cosolvent ethanol etoh the chemical flushing agents greatly reduced the time needed to remove each dnapl component compared to flushing with water alone initial dnapl component elution concentrations were successfully predicted using raoult s law for mcd hpcd and water flushing indicating that ideal dissolution was initiated by the lower power enhanced solubilization agents etoh was most efficient at removing the contaminants in terms of normalized mass recovery but least efficient based on a mass ratio and mole ratio of contaminant to reagent analysis sds was most efficient for contaminant removal when analyzed based on mass contaminant to mass reagent recovered and mcd was most effective based on a moles contaminant to moles reagent recovered efficiency evaluation however in terms of mass flux reduction analysis i e removal metric sds was least efficient for contaminant removal compared to all other enhanced flushing agents tested especially during the initial stages of dnapl removal results from this study indicate that ideal dissolution was initiated during enhanced solubilization and that several criteria should be used to evaluate the removal effectiveness of flushing agents for multi component napl systems keywords multicomponent dnapl dissolution enhanced solubilization immiscible liquid mass flux raoult s law 1 introduction contamination of soil and groundwater by hazardous organic immiscible liquids pose significant risks to human health and the environment across the u s and worldwide many of these chemicals have been classified as carcinogens or suspect carcinogens and have been shown to cause a variety of human health issues including respiratory problems and birth defects usepa 2011 the presence of immiscible liquid or nonaqueous phase liquids napl in the subsurface is the single most important factor limiting the cleanup of soil and groundwater nrc 1994 1997 1999 2000 2004 2005 itrc 2002 usepa 2003 2007 napl sources are typically characterized by extremely low aqueous solubilities that limit the amount of contaminant mass that can dissolve into the aqueous phase napl trapped as residual saturations or as pools within the subsurface serve as long term sources of groundwater pollution pinder 1982 schwille 1988 baehr 1987 therefore conventional flushing technologies i e pump and treat have been shown to be ineffective at removing such contaminant sources from the subsurface remediation efforts become further complicated and challenging when waste sites contain contaminant mixtures for instance the consensus of research has shown that currently available remedial technologies will be generally ineffective for achieving desired cleanup goals in a reasonable or practical time frame at complex groundwater sites nrc 2013 at many sites napl does not simply exist as a single phase component or chemical but is often comprised of multiple compounds the removal of multicomponent napl can be further limited by nonideal dissolution effects e g burris and

dependent factors such as differences in each compound s molecular structure polarity solubility and mole fraction will control the dissolution rates of each compound and can therefore limit contaminant removal compared to pump and treat methods the use of enhanced flushing can decrease the amount of time needed to remove contaminant mass i e increase mass removal efficiency from the

et al 2017 mateas et al 2017 the purpose of this research is to evaluate dissolution and removal dynamics of a multicomponent dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl distributed within a homogeneous porous medium during enhanced solubilization flushing i e complexing sugars cosolvents and surfactants to our knowledge this is the first set of column scale experiments to investigate multicomponent napl dissolution and removal processes using four different solubilization enhancing agents specifically contaminant removal effectiveness efficiency was evaluated using several approaches that compare contaminant to solubilization agent removal initial aqueous phase contaminant elution concentrations were evaluated to determine if dissolution processes are occurring ideally equilibrium partitioning using raoult s law during enhanced flushing conditions lastly the mass flux reduction mfr behavior of each target contaminant was examined during flushing to quantify differences in removal efficiency as a function of the specific enhanced flushing agent itself there is currently a lack of research investigating dissolution and removal dynamics of multicomponent napl i e mixed waste systems during enhanced solubilization flushing conditions it is therefore critical to understand the dissolution mass flux reduction and mass removal relationships of multicomponent napl sources under both water flushing i e pump and treat and enhanced remediation scenarios 2 background 2 1 enhanced solubilization agents enhanced solubilization agents are remedial amendments that can be introduced injected into napl contaminated source areas to increase napl phase dissolution or enhance desorption resulting in the increased apparent solubility of contaminant increase in aqueous concentration in the aqueous phase under pumping extraction more contaminant mass per volume of flushing can be removed and treated ex situ compared to traditional pump and treat approaches some commonly used enhanced solubilization agents tested under laboratory and field scenarios include complexing sugars i e cyclodextrins surface active agent surfactants and cosolvents i e alcohols more discussion can be found in tick et al 2015 and tick and rincon 2009 on these specific types of enhanced solubilization agents 2 2 multicomponent napl dissolution behavior 2 2 1 equilibrium dissolution raoult s law analysis raoult s law describes the equilibrium partitioning behavior between the napl mixture and the aqueous phase as described by tick et al 2015 1 s ei x i n s i γ i n where s ei represents the dissolved phase concentration of component i from the napl mixture x i n is the napl phase molar fraction of component i in a mixture s i is the pure phase solubility limit of component i mg l 1 and γ i n is the napl phase activity coefficient of component i of the napl mixture which describes the effects of nonideal partitioning the γ i n term may be larger than unity napl phase non ideal condition when the organic chemical is significantly dissimilar in shape size or polarity from the average characteristics of the bulk napl mixture especially when the napl phase mole fraction of the constituent is small banerjee 1984 burris and macintyre 1985 schwarzenbach and imboden 1993 mccray and brusseau 1998 1999 carroll and brusseau 2009 carroll et al 2009 padgett et al 2017 mateas et al 2017 2 2 2 enhanced solubilization of organic liquid mixtures raoult s law analysis the enhanced solubilization agent s esa enhancement of a single component organic liquid constituent can be defined as e g ji and brusseau 1998 2 e i 0 s e 0 s a 0 where e i o is the solubility enhancement factor for the single component organic liquid in the presence of the esa s a o is the single component s i solubility limit mg l 1 and s e o is the pure component s i enhanced apparent solubility mg l 1 for cyclodextrin solutions the enhanced equilibrium solubility is a function of the cyclodextrin concentration expressed as 3 s e 0 s a 0 1 k cw c cd s a 0 e i 0 where c cd is the aqueous concentration of cyclodextrin mg l 1 and k cw is the partition coefficient of the solute i between cyclodextrin and water l mg 1 alternatively the enhancement factor e i o can be expressed as a function of the cyclodextrin concentration and the solute s partition coefficient between cyclodextrin and water as 4 e i 0 1 k cw c cd for ideal dissolution the value of e i in a multicomponent napl system is the same as that measured for a single component napl system e i o e i e i o since activity napl phase activity coefficients are unity the cyclodextrin i e hcpd mcd enhanced solubility raoult s law expression can be further expressed by substituting eq 1 into the multicomponent version of eqs 2 or 3 for an ideal organic liquid mixture as ji and brusseau 1998 mccray and brusseau 1999 5 s e 0 s a 0 x i n e i 0 similar to that for cyclodextrin enhanced apparent solubilization due to the presence of surfactant solution can be described as ji and brusseau 1998 6 s e 0 s a 0 1 k m c cmc s a 0 e i 0 where k m is the partition coefficient of solute i between the surfactant micelle and water l mg 1 cmc is the critical micelle concentration mg l 1 and c is the concentration of the surfactant mg l 1 when c cmc for ideal dissolution the value of e i in a multicomponent napl system is the same as that measured for a single component napl system e i o and therefore eq 6 reduces to a form identical to eq 5 the solubility of an organic contaminant in the presence of a cosolvent can be expressed as a function of the volume fraction of cosolvent f c in solution and σ represents the cosolvency power of the cosolvent in terms of the slope of the solubilization profile i e log solubility vs f c as ji and brusseau 1998 7 log s e 0 log s a 0 σ f c therefore the enhancement factor e i o of an organic contaminant molecule in the presence of a cosolvent can be rearranged as follows 8 e i 0 10 σ f c the enhanced solubilization due to a cosolvent i e ethanol etoh is also similar to previous derivations and can be described as ji and brusseau 1998 9 s e 0 s a 0 10 σ f c s a 0 e i 0 similar to the previous description the enhanced solubility raoult s law expression can be expressed by substituting eq 1 into the multicomponent version of eqs 2 or 9 for an ideal organic liquid mixture to form the general expression as eq 5 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials stainless steel columns 2 2 cm i d 7 cm length alltech co were used in all

sds were selected based on their relatively widespread use as solubilization agents and relatively high solubilization power mcd and hpcd were used based on their availability at a commercial scale and recent interest as flushing agents 3 2 experimental procedures 3 2 1 conservative tracer tests prior to the dnapl source flushing experiments a series of pfba conservative tracer transport through column tests were conducted to verify that consistent uniform packing methods were employed and that advection was the dominant mechanism of transport for the 20 30 mesh sand column systems the results confirmed that the porous media packing method consistently produced transport conditions dominated by advection i e pe numbers 80 3 2 2 preparation of the multicomponent dnapl source for the series of flushing experiments a uniform immiscible liquid distribution was created employing a mixing technique to minimize elution behavior artifacts due to bypass flow immiscible liquid fingering

within a moist sand was packed into the columns and saturated following the methods described in tick and rincon 2009 to establish an initial dnapl saturation s n targeted at 20 30 3 2 3 flushing experiments for each flushing experiment synthetic groundwater used for the water flush experiment or the respective enhanced solubilization agent was pumped through the column at a flow rate q of 0 59 cm3 min 1 darcy velocity q 0 15 cm min 1 linear pore velocity v p 29 cm hr 1 to represent induced flushing conditions consistent with pump and treat and remediation scenarios fig 1 a 5 wt concentration of mcd hpcd and sds was used for these enhanced flushing experiments and to compare results to prior studies that used these same concentrations boving and brusseau 2000 tick and rincon 2009 tick et al 2015 furthermore the 5 wt concentrations were used to satisfy micellar solubilization removal conditions avoid interfacial effects that could induce dnapl mobilization minimize reagent costs and minimize viscosity effects that may alter flow through the porous medium a 50 wt etoh concentration was used because a 5 wt solution has been shown to have a negligible effect on solubilization boving and brusseau 2000 each flushing experiment was replicated to ensure consistency of the results and overall trends associated with each specific chemical agent all experiments were performed in a temperature controlled laboratory with an average temperature of 20 0 c 1 c variation at the termination of each experiment each respective column was disassembled and the porous medium and remaining solution was transferred to a 20 ml headspace vial and subjected to solvent extraction using methanol certified acs grade fisher scientific co in all cases there was no detectable concentration of dnapl mixture compounds dce tce pce still remaining in the columns indicating that most of the mass was removed during the flushing experiments samples from the column effluent were collected using a gas tight glass syringe and 0 5 5 ml i e based on dilutions were transferred immediately into 20 ml glass borosilicate headspace vials and the total volume in the vial was adjusted to 5 ml depending on desired dilution factor the vials were then immediately crimped with an aluminum cap and airtight septa prior to gas chromatography gc analysis all samples were analyzed using a gc shimadzu gc 17a equipped with an aoc 5000 ctc leap technologies autosampler and a flame ionization detector fid specifically each headspace sample vial was agitated at 80 c for 10 min to effectively transfer the aqueous phase contaminant into the headspace a 1 μl subsample from the headspace was transferred to the gc injection port via a headspace syringe automated subjected to a temperature of 40 c 2 min followed by a linear increase in temperature 10 c min 1 until a maximum temperature was maintained 180 c for 5 min i e temperature program and then the voltage vs retention time signal chromatogram from the fid was recorded and converted to concentrations using standard curves samples analyzed after 48 h were stored at 4 c until being measured on the gc using the same methods as described previously the quantifiable detection limit was 0 01 mg l 1 for the organic compounds dce tce and pce respectively the early time flushing samples were allowed to sit at 4 c for at least 24 h prior to analysis to allow any micro or macro emulsions to stabilize and accumulate on the vial bottom careful visual inspection of each sample was conducted especially during early time flushing first several pore volumes when most mobilization would be expected to occur boving and brusseau 2000 boving et al 2000 duplicate samples were stored visually inspected for dnapl presence and analyzed after the completion of the experiments there was no visual evidence of dnapl mobilization from the inspection of samples after 24 h or more duplicate samples of sit time however this fact does not exclude the occurrence of mobilization as dnapl could be mobilized within the column and not be captured from effluent sampling events evidence indicates that low mcd and hpcd concentrations tend not to produce enough reduction in dnapl water interfacial tension to initiate mobilization boving and brusseau 2000 tick and rincon 2009 however boving and brusseau 2000 observed the mobilization of dnapl during early time sds flushing even though mobilization accounted for a small percentage of the dnapl removal it should be noted that the predominance of napl solubilization compared to napl mobilization is highly dependent upon the napl saturation in the porous media among other interfacial factors the results of the experiments herein and the prior enhanced flushing studies indicate that solubilization was the dominant mechanism of contaminant removal 4 results and discussion 4 1 elution behavior while the general elution behavior is similar for all the contaminants the removal rate displayed for each stage of flushing is unique to each individual flushing agent itself table 2 provides the conditions and basic dnapl removal results for each column flushing experiment 4 1 1 water flushing fig 2 2a and 2b shows the contaminant elution curves dce tce pce for the water flush in comparison to the contaminant elution curves for enhanced flushing agents the water flush provides a baseline for contaminant elution and removal in the absence of a remedial enhanced solubilization agent and represents a pump and treat type flushing scenario dce the highest solubility component attained the greatest concentration 1160 mg l 1 in the shortest flushing time 1 1 pore volumes pvs and then concentrations declined until tailing occurred at about 30 pvs majority of mass was removed and persisted until detection limit was reached 220 pv tce was slightly delayed 27 pvs relative to dce in reaching its peak concentration average 550 mg l 1 consistent with the order of solubility for all three components until tailing behavior was observed after about 120 pvs of flushing pce the lowest solubility component exhibited the most pronounced delay in peak concentration 160 mg l 1 after about 100 pvs of flushing at which point concentration slowly declined until extensive tailing behavior occurred after 300 pvs of water flushing as dce concentrations declined both tce and pce increased due to the relative increase in component mole fractions furthermore as tce became depleted pce continued to increase based on the relative mole fraction increase after approximately 450 pvs of flushing a significant fraction of the component masses dce tce pce were removed from the system 4 1 2 hpcd enhanced flushing the hpcd flush fig 2a produced the least effective minimal solubility enhancement for the three chlorinated contaminant compounds dce tce pce when compared to all other enhanced solubilization agents fig 2 2a and 2b for the purposes of this study the solubility enhancement is defined and calculated by comparing the maximum enhanced effluent concentration of the respective target contaminant during enhanced flushing to the maximum effluent concentration obtained during water flushing the enhancement factor e is defined as follows 10 e c ef max c wf max neither of the target contaminants had reached detection limit until after at least 140 pvs of flushing demonstrating the relative ineffective long term removal under these conditions the maximum observed dce concentration average peak during the hpcd flush was approximately 1000 mg l 1 between 1 and 4 pv showing no enhancement e 0 9 1 compared to water flushing conditions table 3 the dce concentration declined rapidly over the first 15 pvs of flushing but was then followed by a concentration tailing period 15 60 pv and another rapid concentration decline stage 60 pv and finally a period of extensive concentration tailing which persisted until detection limit was reached 240 pv the maximum observed tce concentration average peak was approximately 500 mg l 1 between 1 and 15 pv corresponding to negligible enhancement e 0 9 1 following this stage a steady decline in tce concentration constant rate occurred until about 60 pvs of flushing at which point a more rapid decline of tce concentration occurred until concentration tailing condition began 110 pv and continued until detection limit was attained 340 pv although dce and tce showed no appreciable solubility enhancement during hpcd flushing pce exhibited a slight enhancement the maximum observed pce concentration average peak was approximately 720 mg l 1 at 21 pv corresponding to an enhancement factor of 4 e 4 4 table 3 after peak concentrations were attained pce showed a relatively rapid decrease in concentration 60 pv until tailing occurred 110 pv and continued until detection limit was reached 340 pv overall hpcd did not effectively enhance the removal solubility of the higher solubility components dce tce but showed noticeable removal enhancement for pce the lowest aqueous solubility component this suggests that hpcd s effectiveness for enhanced removal of multicomponent napl systems may be limited thus requiring the consideration of other enhanced solubilization agents such as surfactants cosolvents or complexing sugars such as mcd this study was not designed to determine the specific mechanistic processes between hpcd and contaminants that account for the negligible solubility enhancement e 1 for the higher aqueous solubility components dce tce while enhancing the solubility and removal of pce lowest solubility component however for multicomponent napl systems sources it may be that the interactions between hpcd and napl components result in negligible ineffective removal when their aqueous solubilities are above some critical value wherein the complexation reaction is outcompeted or has a stronger partitioning preference for the substantially lower solubility components in the system under such a condition desirable hpcd enhancement interactions would only be appropriate for low solubility components of a complex napl source mixture the use of hpcd in this case may be viable for only very specific scenarios and goals site specific contaminant specific regulatory specific conditions of the remediation operation 4 1 3 mcd flushing the mcd flush fig 2a resulted in a notable increase in the solubility of the three contaminants dce tce pce compared to the water flush the maximum observed dce concentration average peak was approximately 2000 mg l 1 at 3 pv corresponding to an enhancement factor e of about 2 e 1 7 dce concentrations rapidly declined whereby concentration tailing occurred 25 pv and continued until detection limit was reached after about 60 70 pvs of flushing the maximum observed tce concentration average peak was approximately 5000 mg l 1 at 16 pv corresponding to an e of about 9 e 8 7 table 3 tce concentrations declined at a constant rate until low concentration tailing occurred 70 pv and the detection limit was reached after about 120 pvs of flushing the maximum observed pce concentration average peak was approximately 2400 mg l 1 at 24 28 pv corresponding to an e of approximately 15 e 15 1 table 3 the pce concentration declined at a constant rate until concentration tailing occurred 75 80 pv and persisted until the detection limit was reached after about 160 pvs of flushing tce and pce likely reached the detection limit simultaneously due to the relatively efficient removal of dce allowing the two less soluble components tce and pce to dissolve at more or less similar rates mcd proved to be one of the most effective flushing agents in terms of removal time i e pvs flushed 4 1 4 sds flushing in terms of the 5 wt agents the sds flush resulted in the greatest solubility enhancement for the target contaminant concentrations proving to be one of the most effective agents for removing initial contaminant mass within the least amount of time i e pvs fig 2b however the three target contaminants dce tce pce exhibited notable shouldering effects i e rapid decline followed by a quasi steady state elution period and significant tailing towards the later stages of flushing the maximum observed dce concentration average peak during sds flushing was approximately 4400 mg l 1 between 1 and 2 pv corresponding to an e of about 4 e 3 8 table 3 dce concentrations initially declined relatively rapidly and was followed by one notable elution shouldering step 10 35 pv wherein concentration tailing quasi steady state occurred for a period of time followed by a relatively rapid concentration decline and then a final concentration tailing condition that persisted until detection limit was reached 90 pv until termination of the flushing experiment the maximum observed tce concentration average peak was approximately 9000 mg l 1 at 1 2 pv corresponding to an e equal of about 16 e 15 9 tce concentrations then declined relatively rapidly between 2 and 7 pvs followed by one distinct elution steady state rapid decline phases i e shouldering events similar to that of the dce elution behavior described previously the tce elution shouldering quasi steady state elution event occurred between 12 and 25 pvs followed by a relatively rapid concentration decline 25 35 pvs and subsequent low concentration tailing until detection limit was reached 120 pv the maximum observed pce concentration average peak was approximately 9700 mg l 1 1 2 pv corresponding to an e of 60 e 59 5 table 3 pce concentration declined relatively rapidly until a pronounced elution shouldering step quasi steady state occurred 13 20 pv followed by a sharp concentration decline and low concentration tailing after about 35 pvs until detection limit was reached after about 130 pv of sds flushing the observed elution shouldering behavior may be in part due to the existence of poorly accessible contaminant dce tce pce mass to flushing solution and or a limitation due to the surfactant sds itself it is possible that this higher solubilization power agent acts to quickly remove readily accessible mass i e steady state portions thereby leaving poorly accessible mass rapid concentration declines and eventually low concentration tailing conditions these shouldering events may also be related to composition dependent factors and mole competitive effects whereby as the higher solubility component is removed reduced mole fraction a resulting and simultaneous or subsequent relative mole fraction increase for the other lower solubility components occurs causing them to transiently increase stabilize appearing as steady state for a period of time 4 1 5 etoh flushing the 50 wt ethanol etoh flushing experiments resulted in the greatest overall increase in apparent solubility and enhancement for all three target contaminant compounds dce tce pce which was also observed in other studies boving and brusseau 2000 tick and rincon 2009 all three target contaminants peaked quickly in order of their solubility highest solubility peaked first etc and contaminant elution concentrations then declined rapidly until reaching a steady state rapid decline shouldering stage until low concentration tailing occurred for the remaining flushing period fig 2b the maximum observed dce concentration peak during etoh flushing was about 14 000 mg l 1 at 3 pv corresponding to an e of about 12 e 12 0 table 3 following the peak concentration an immediate dce concentration decline was observed no initial steady state elution period between 3 and 10 pvs a subsequent concentration shouldering stage occurred whereby a quasi steady state elution period and rapid concentration decline period occurred 10 20 pv until a final low concentration tailing condition began 23 pv and persisted until detection limit was reached after about 50 pvs of flushing the maximum observed tce concentration peak was approximately 35 000 mg l 1 at 3 pv corresponding to an e of about 61 e 60 8 tce concentration then declined relatively quickly until a subtle concentration shouldering effect was observed between about 13 20 pvs of flushing during this period tce concentrations exhibited a short quasi steady state condition followed by a concentration decline finally reaching a final low concentration tailing condition 25 50 pv that persisted until detection limit was attained after about 110 pvs of flushing the maximum observed pce concentration peak during flushing was approximately 21 000 mg l 1 at 6 pv corresponding to an e of about 129 e 128 8 table 3 pce concentration then declined relatively quickly then subsequently exhibiting two distinct steady state concentration decline stages i e shouldering effects 15 20 pv 21 30 pv until extensive low concentration tailing occurred 140 pv and the detection limit was reached for the experiment it should be noted that during the 50 wt etoh flush small amounts of pure phase immiscible liquid were collected indicating that the ethanol did cause some minor mobilization of the napl at the end of each enhanced flushing experiment i e hpcd mcd sds and etoh a solvent extraction was conducted on the column sediments to determine whether any remaining napl phase still remained in the system in each case trace amounts of immiscible liquid usually pce were noted indicating that the least soluble chemical had not been completely removed by the flushing agents this is likely due to the lower solubility limits of pce which is an order of magnitude less soluble than tce and dce because tailing behavior was observed in all experiments it is safe to assume that concentration tailing conditions would continue until all remaining mass was removed it is important to note however that this research was not focused on analyzing specific tailing behavior during immiscible liquid dissolution but rather on first order and initial dissolution processes and overall mass removal effectiveness for chlorinated multicomponent dnapl sources using different enhanced solubilization flushing agents the late time tailing behavior observed in almost all the elution curves will be quantified in a future study using the popular time nonlocal transport models zhang et al 2020 4 2 time continuous mass flux reduction time continuous mass flux behavior was examined for all contaminant components using mass flux reduction mfr analysis fig 3 further discussion on mfr analyses can be found in brusseau et al 2008 difilippo and brusseau 2008 tick and rincon 2009 and tick et al 2015 evaluation of the contaminant napl components mfr as a function of contaminant mass removal mr for different enhanced solubilization agents i e etoh sds mcd and hpcd allows for comparison of the particular flushing agent s impact on the contaminant s removal efficiency early mfr of the contaminant prior to significant contaminant mass removal describes an inefficient removal process whereas a condition in which the mass flux of the contaminant is sustained until nearly all of the mass is depleted describes a more efficient removal process based on mfr analysis the impact of the specific enhanced solubilization flushing agents on the contaminant s dce tce pce removal processes shows notable variation in removal efficiency fig 3 overall the majority of flushing agents generally yielded inefficient removal of the contaminant mass most notably for sds and hpcd sds initiated the least efficient contaminant removal under this evaluation metric whereby early mfr progressed relatively rapidly and continuously prior to removing significant mass from the system the hpcd flushing agent initiated inefficient removal behavior but achieved slightly improved mass removal efficiency for dce and tce specifically compared to sds fig 3 however in contrast to sds the hpcd induced relatively efficient removal behavior for the lowest solubility component pce the mcd and etoh enhanced solubilization flushing agents produced relatively efficient contaminant removal compared to that of the sds and hpcd agents although mcd and etoh performed similarly in terms of contaminant component removal efficiency mcd generally yielded greater removal efficiency for all contaminant components dce tce pce whereby contaminant mass flux was sustained least mfr while total fraction of the mass was depleted during the mass removal process i e notable total mass was removed prior to a significant mfr fig 3 interestingly the contaminant removal produced by mcd and etoh showed an overall similar trend to that of hpcd whereby the lowest solubility component pce exhibited the most efficient removal process compared to the higher solubility components dce and tce fig 3 moreover with the exception of the sds flushing agent the removal of the highest solubility component dce generally demonstrated the least efficient removal among the contaminants components when evaluated individually for each respective flushing agent generally the water flush pump and treat scenario will tend to exhibit more efficient removal behavior due to the fact that the quasi maximum mass flux emanating from the napl source will be sustained throughout the mass removal process however the water flush demonstrated significant variability of napl component removal efficiency fig 3 for example similar to the results yielded by hpcd mcd and etoh the order of contaminant removal efficiency during the water flush produced the most efficient removal process for pce and the least efficient for dce in summary the sds flushing agent yielded the least efficient contaminant mass removal behavior in terms of the time continuous mfr analysis exhibiting significant initial mfr during the mass removal flushing process such mass removal inefficiency effects may be related to the associated larger solubilization power of sds compared to the other agents in addition it is plausible that high initial solubilization of readily accessible dnapl occurred decreasing available interfacial area and resulting in early mfr and low rates of mass flux decline also surfactant specific interactions due to micellar complexation may be responsible for this less ideal mass flux behavior the hpcd flushing agent also showed relatively inefficient mass removal behavior for dce but moderate to efficient removal for tce and pce under such conditions hpcd a lower solubilization power agent may preferentially interact and form more ideal stronger complexes with lower solubility components when multicomponent napl mixtures are present in fact studies have indicated that greater solubility enhancement occurs for lower solubility more hydrophobic organic contaminants for cyclodextrin flushing agents such as hpcd mccray and brusseau 1998 mccray and brusseau 1999 tick et al 2015 mcd and etoh flushing agents yielded the most efficient contaminant removal with mcd generally inducing more efficient removal conditions for all contaminant components dce tce pce for the most part a general trend of napl component removal was observed for each respective flushing agent whereby the lowest solubility component pce exhibited the most efficient removal process while the highest solubility component dce exhibited the least efficient removal such effects suggest that the greater solubility enhancement generally occurs for the lower solubility compounds for all the flushing agents tested consistent with that observed for hpcd as described above mccray and brusseau 1999 this further indicates that for multicomponent systems it is expected that the lower solubility components will generally experience more efficient removal processes a potentially critical factor to consider when designing an appropriate remediation strategy for such contaminant source systems 4 3 enhanced flushing contaminant removal effectiveness remediation effectiveness can be evaluated using several different contaminant removal metrics based upon the particular goals of the remediation removal effectiveness can vary depending on assessing contaminant removal time the mass of reagent used i e vol or wt and the mass or moles of contaminant removed per mole of reagent used all of which can have implications on total cost of a specific strategy i e complexing sugar surfactant or cosolvent remediation effectiveness was evaluated by comparing 1 contaminant mass or normalized removal removal per time 2 contaminant mass to reagent mass removed and 3 contaminant moles to reagent moles removed during flushing comparative evaluation of the three metrics discussed herein should be conducted to assess the most efficient removal processes based on the objectives of site specific remediation for instance although contaminant source removal based on a normalized mass recovery metric may generally be most efficient for removing napl component in the order of highest aqueous solubility to least the order of napl component removal efficiency can differ significantly when using contaminant removal metrics that also incorporate the amount of reagent used table 4 fig 4 thus a comparative removal metric approach may be preferred and depend upon whether one contaminant component is more of a concern in more abundance or more persistent to best aid in the selection of a particular enhanced flushing agent for a site specific remediation scenario 4 3 1 normalized mass recovery comparison of normalized contaminant mass recovery is one method to evaluate the removal effectiveness and efficiency for the particular flushing agent i e water hpcd mcd sds and etoh specifically normalized contaminant mass recovery analysis compares the incremental mass per time of the contaminant removed to the total contaminant mass removed over the duration of flushing i e normalizing the mass solubilized per pore volume to the total mass solubilized for these analyses it is assumed that the mass removed from the elution profiles represent the total contaminant mass in the system also confirmed by solvent extractions as described in previous sections table 4 and fig 4a show the results for the normalized contaminant mass recoveries for the various flushing experiments overall a general trend was observed in that the high solubility component dce was removed first followed by tce intermediate solubility component and finally pce lowest solubility component from all flushing experiments although this removal order is generally consistent for the suite of experiments under early time removal there are some minor variations in which tce showed improved removal efficiency over dce during later stages of removal i e etoh and sds additionally tce exhibited more efficient removal compared to dce during all stages of hpcd flushing in terms of overall dnapl component dce tce pce removal performance with respect to enhanced solubilzation agent the etoh flush yielded the most efficient contaminant removal and the hpcd flush yielded the least efficient removal process resulting in the following order agent effectiveness on contaminant component removal efficiency etoh sds mcd hpcd fig 4a the water flush was generally least effective for contaminant mass removal table 4 fig 4a for dce and tce complete normalized mass recovery was achieved in approximately 20 and 60 pvs respectively however pce showed the most significant tailing behavior as it took about 350 pvs to completely remove pce from the system in terms of normalized mass recovery for the hpcd flush insignificant differences in normalized mass recovery were observed for tce and dce compared to those produced from the water flush table 4 fig 4a complete normalized mass recovery was achieved in approximately 20 and 60 pvs respectively for these two components this indicates that at least for the conditions of these flow cell experiments there was no measurable improvement in removal effectiveness for the higher solubility components tce and dce for hpcd compared to water flush therefore the added cost of hpcd material would render it as a less efficient solubilization agent for tce and dce for such a 3 component napl source system however a notable improvement in normalized mass recovery for pce was observed for the hpcd flush compared to water flushing taking less than half the time to completely remove mass from the system i e 110 pvs this suggests that hpcd will provide greater contaminant removal effectiveness efficiency for lower solubility components of multicomponent napl sources the highest rate of mass contaminant mass removal i e steep slopes was observed from sds flushing whereby pce tce and dce were all removed from the system within the first 10 15 pvs table 4 fig 4a based on normalized contaminant mass recovery sds was most effective compared to hpcd under the conditions of these experiments it should be noted that the sds flushing experiment had a slightly lower napl saturation less total mass than that of the hpcd flushing experiment and this may be in part responsible for the lower removal efficiency associated with hpcd based on this contaminant removal approach sds was 5 13 times more efficient at contaminant removal dce tce pce respectively 4 3 2 contaminant mass to reagent mass recovery another way to evaluate the effectiveness of the flushing agents is to calculate the mass removal of the contaminants per unit mass of the flushing agent removed this is important for the evaluation of overall cost of the remediation activity reagent and the total amount of flushing solution that will be needed to effectively remediate a site the normalized mass ratio mass of pce tce and dce removed at each pore volume interval divided by the total mass was divided by the cumulative mass of agent flushed through the flow cell at each pore volume the results of the mass contaminant to mass reagent removal efficiency for the flushing experiments are shown in table 4 and fig 4b although the water flush was least efficient for contaminant removal similar trends for the other flushing agents hpcd and sds were observed whereby pce and tce showed most efficient removal compared to dce removal when evaluated using this approach table 4 fig 4b based on the achievement of maximum contaminant removal efficiency the water flush was approximately 20 900 times less efficient than the hpcd and sds flushing experiments respectively for the removal of dce tce and pce table 4 the sds flush resulted in the greatest efficiency reaching maximum contaminant removal efficiency after nearly one pore volume of flushing as opposed to about 2 8 pvs for the hpcd flush fig 4b the maximum contaminant removal efficiency for the sds flush was maintained for the shortest period of time compared to hpcd sharply declining as contaminant mass is removed and tailing conditions become more pronounced the decrease is most likely due to the reduction of the residual mass dce tce pce in the flow cell whereby maximum solubilization cannot be maintained due to the significant depletion of contaminant mass the maximum contaminant removal dce tce pce efficiency produced from both sds and hpcd flushing was about 50 900 and 20 150 times greater respectively than that during water flushing conditions table 4 fig 4b the sds flushing experiment had a much higher increase in efficiency for pce due to the sds solubilization enhancement factor of pce being almost 59 compared to only 9 for the hpcd flushing experiment as measured from iep overall sds was 3 6 times more efficient at contaminant removal dce tce pce respectively than hpcd based on this mass contaminant vs mass reagent evaluation approach 4 3 3 contaminant moles to reagent moles recovery the results of the flushing experiments were also compared based on the moles of contaminant removed per moles of chemical reagent used these analyses were conducted by calculating the cumulative moles of dce tce and pce removed per cumulative moles of flushing agent removed for each pore volume these analyses provide a quantitative relationship between the molecules of contaminant removed based on each molecule of the flushing agent used removed this is important for the evaluation of overall cost of the remediation activity reagent and the total amount of flushing solution that will be needed to effectively remediate a site the results of the moles contaminant to moles reagent removal efficiency for the flushing experiments are shown in table 4 and fig 4c as expected the water flush was least efficient at contaminant removal compared to the enhanced flushing experiments hpcd and sds when evaluated by this mole removal approach figs 4c based on the achievement of maximum contaminant removal efficiency the water flush was approximately 1400 12 000 times less efficient than the hpcd and sds flushing experiments respectively for the removal of dce tce and pce table 4 in contrast to the mass contaminant vs mass reagent removed approach the hpcd flush resulted in greater maximum efficiency magnitude compared to sds reaching maximum contaminant removal efficiency between 1 and 3 pore volumes of flushing fig 4c the maximum contaminant removal efficiency for the hpcd and sds was maintained for a relatively short period of time and then followed by an efficiency decline as contaminant mass was removed and tailing conditions become more pronounced this decrease is most likely due to the reduction of the residual mass dce tce pce in the flow cell whereby maximum solubilization cannot be maintained due to the significant depletion of contaminant mass the maximum contaminant removal dce tce pce efficiency produced from both hpcd and sds flushing was about 4000 12 000 and 1400 10 500 times greater respectively than that during water flushing conditions table 4 fig 4c overall hpcd was 1 2 3 times more efficient at contaminant removal dce tce pce respectively than sds based on this removal efficiency approach based on this mole contaminant vs mole reagent evaluation approach it may be expected that to some degree hpcd might show improvements over sds flushing since the enhanced contaminant solubilization requires formation of surfactant micelles moiety a relatively larger number of surfactant molecules monomers are needed critical micelle concentration to initiate contaminant removal by solubilization processes for surfactants this effect would tend to reduce the mole contaminant to mole reagent efficiency compared to other reagents in contrast hpcd generally forms a 1 1 inclusion complex to partition one molecule of the organic contaminant into its single molecular interior since the effective concentrations for both sds and hpcd were identical 5 wt during flushing it might be speculated that hpcd would show efficiency improvements over sds when evaluated on a normalized mole removal analysis however for assessing efficiency improvement it is also important to consider how many molecules of contaminant can partition or complex to the molecule or moiety itself the greater number of contaminant molecules able to react with the molecule would have an effect of increasing removal efficiency based on this analysis any reduction in efficiency caused by the increased need of molecules of reagent could be offset by the relative increased number of contaminant molecules able to partition or complex to the reagent since surfactants have the capability of solubilizing partitioning many contaminant molecules within a single micelle moiety in contrast to the 1 1 contaminant reagent complex of hpcd it is also important to be aware and consider such potential effects on removal analysis 4 4 raoult s law and initial dissolution behavior raoult s law was used to predict initial equilibrium aqueous elution concentrations from the dissolution of the organic phase napl phase mixture source for various enhanced solubilization and water flushing experiments tick et al 2015 ji and brusseau 1998 mccray and brusseau 1999 the purpose of this analysis was to evaluate whether dissolution processes under such flushing conditions at least initially are ideal and can be described adequately via raoult s law refer to discussion presented in section 2 2 table 5 in general the higher power enhanced solubilization agents etoh and sds initiated significant enhanced concentrations for all components dce tce pce within an extremely short to non existent initial steady state elution phase the lower power enhanced solubility agents mcd and hpcd yielded relatively short initial steady state dissolution periods but were noticeably longer extended compared to that observed for etoh and sds with hpcd yielding the longest initial steady state elution period and overall lowest solubility enhancement effectiveness over the duration of flushing and contaminant removal generally the lower power enhanced solubilization flushing experiments hpcd mcd and water exhibited relatively ideal initial dissolution elution behavior that could be predicted using raoult s law furthermore the results show that napl phase activity coefficients were close to unity and within accepted ranges γ i n 0 5 2 0 that typically describe ideal initial dissolution elution behavior banerjee 1984 burris and macintyre 1985 schwarzenbach and imboden 1993 padgett et al 2017 mateas et al 2017 table 5 however the higher power enhanced solubilization flushing experiments yielded initial elution concentrations that could not be well predicted via raoult s law and the resulting napl phase activity coefficients γ i n 0 02 0 09 indicated that initial dissolution was relatively nonideal especially for tce and pce the lower aqueous solubility components table 5 the raoult s law analysis conducted herein suggests that the higher power enhanced solubilization agents such as etoh and sds cosolvents and surfactants are expected to initiate nonideal dissolution processes quickly during the flushing contaminant remediation removal process wherein raoult s law may not be applicable for the prediction of contaminant initial elution concentration and mass removal however the results suggest that raoult s law may be able to be successfully applied when using lower power enhanced solubilization agents for predicting initial elution behavior and mass removal understanding such initial dissolution constraints for various types of enhanced solubilization agents and removal processes can be useful when selecting a particular agent and applying these flushing techniques in the field 5 conclusion the presence of multicomponent napl in soil and groundwater can severely complicate the removal process and ability to predict resulting aqueous phase concentrations from such source areas a series of enhanced solubilization column scale experiments were conducted to evaluate contaminant removal effectiveness and initial dissolution processes occurring from a multicomponent dnapl source distributed within a saturated homogeneous sand medium although all four enhanced solubilization agents reduced the time and volume of flushing solution needed to remove the multi component dnapl source etoh cosolvent sds surfactant and mcd methyl complexing sugar were most effective in source removal per time compared to water flushing i e pump and treat hpcd hydroxypropyl complexing sugar was least effective in total source removal per time during flushing but was approximately two times more efficient compared to water flushing the two high power solubilization agents etoh and sds showed significant enhancement of aqueous contaminant concentrations early in the flushing process removing a bulk of source mass within the first 10 30 pvs of flushing although mcd had a notable effect on enhanced solubilization of source contaminant and removal four times more efficient than water flushing the hpcd initiated little to no solubilization enhancement for the source contaminants during flushing the greatest solubility enhancement was observed for the lowest solubility dnapl component pce and solubility enhancement generally decreased with increasing contaminant aqueous solubility as e pce e tce e dce this suggests that such flushing agents will have the greatest relative removal effectiveness for the most persistent lower solubility contaminants in groundwater systems in terms of mass flux reduction mfr analysis most flushing agents yielded inefficient removal for the dnapl contaminant components with sds and hpcd generally initiating the least efficient removal condition etoh and mcd initiated more efficient removal of dnapl source mass generally outperforming all other flushing agents interestingly the lowest solubility component pce exhibited the most efficient removal condition and except for sds the highest solubility component dce demonstrated the least efficient removal condition such findings can be important when selecting an enhanced solubilization agent for a specific site with a range of aqueous solubilities in terms of mass removal effectiveness etoh generally produced the most efficient removal condition when evaluated on a normalized contaminant mass removal basis with sds and mcd producing nearly identical efficiency for source mass removal when evaluated on a contaminant mass to solubilization agent mass removal basis sds yielded the most efficient source removal condition that may be attributed in part to the generally higher solubilization power of sds although slightly less efficient than sds mcd demonstrated notable removal efficiency under this removal basis when evaluated on a contaminant mole to solubilization agent mole removal basis mcd produced the most effective source removal condition with hpcd demonstrating decent but notably reduced efficiency for source mass removal overall it was evident that the complexing sugars generally outperformed the surfactant and alcohol under this removal efficiency evaluation scheme the reduced efficiency for sds under this removal metric may be due in part to relatively larger number of surfactant molecules required to initiate contaminant removal through micellar solubilization processes generally the lower power enhanced solubilization agents water hpcd mcd initiated ideal initial dissolution elution conditions from the multicomponent dnapl source that could be predicted using raoult s law in contrast the higher power enhanced solubilization agents etoh and sds initiated relatively nonideal dissolution elution behavior that could not be predicted using raoult s law relationships understanding such initial dissolution constraints for various types of enhanced solubilization agents and removal processes can be useful when selecting an agent and applying these flushing techniques in the field the findings of this study suggest that the selection of a flushing agent should be evaluated carefully prior to the remediation of complex multicomponent napl sources as the mass flux and removal behavior of each contaminant may vary significantly depending on the contaminant source and flushing agent employed credit authorship contribution statement geoffreyr tick supervision conceptualization methodology formal analysis validation visualization writing

worth studying to provide more insight into phosphorus circulation in rivers that freeze in winter the yarlung zangbo river yzr is located on the qinghai tibet plateau and is one of the highest rivers in the world korup and montgomery 2008 hou et al 1970 a previous study by liao liao et al 2019 investigated the effect of daily freezing thawing cycles dftc on phosphorus release from sediment in the middle reaches of the yzr since the geology on both sides of the yzr constitutes a double metamorphic zone the unique geological characteristics make the geology of this entire region relatively fragile and the soil and sediment are vulnerable to external forces amézketa 1999 ftc destroy the sediment microstructure through frost heave forces and change the sediment particle size and specific surface area to promote the release of phosphorus moreover during an ftc different water conditions inflict different degrees of damage on the internal structure of sediment which also affects

some phosphorus combines with om to form organic phosphorus o p an earlier study found that the level of adsorption active o p in sediment in shallow lakes of the yangtze river was positively correlated with the content of om in addition ca p and occluded phosphorus oc p are relatively stable and not easily released the experiments of liao confirmed that the dftc promoted interconversion among phosphorus forms and thus affected phosphorus exchange between water and sediment liao et al 2019 however more research is needed to determine the new patterns of transitions between these different forms of phosphorus when the freezing thawing period extends to seasonal freezing thawing cycles sftc therefore in this study a laboratory experiment was conducted to simulate seasonal freezing thawing processes that commonly occur in the upper reaches of the yzr different freezing times were tested to determine their impact on transformations between different phosphorus forms by

is consistent with the data in fig 2 c showing that the fe p content continued to decrease over days 0 20 and stabilized during days 20 60 there was no significant difference in ca p content in any period which was consistent with the data in fig 2 d oc p content differed significantly only during the initial freezing period but no significant difference was found during the next 40 d this is consistent with the slight fluctuations seen for oc p content in fig 2 e the o p contents always varied significantly which is consistent with the constant variations seen for o p content in fig 2 f 3 2 phosphorus changes with different water contents when the water content was taken as the fixed variable with which to analyze the variations shown in fig 4 the ex p content exhibited behavior significantly different from other conditions when the water content was 28 6 there were significant differences between the al p content seen with 0 water and those seen with other water contents the content of fe p was stable overall and differed from other levels only with 16 3 water content the ca p and oc p contents fluctuated with changes in water content the o p content at the 0 water level was significantly different from those with the other water levels 3 3 morphological analyses of sediments according to the classification of clastic sediments the particle sizes of sampled sediment are divided into fine clastic 0 63 μm folk et al 1970 medium clastic 63 500 μm and coarse clastic 500 μm the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the mass fraction of medium clastic particles is the largest with a maximum value of 53 45 a minimum value of 51 26 and a standard deviation of 3 85 in the sediment the mass fraction of fine particles was the smallest the minimum value was only 12 12 the maximum value was 16 24 and the standard deviation was the smallest at 1 11 the maximum mass fraction of coarse clastics was 25 51 the minimum was 19 37 and the standard deviation was 4 62 the surface sediments in the upper reaches of the yzr are mainly composed of medium clastic and immature sandy sediment which may have a large specific surface area and strong absorbability fig 6 a d shows sem results for sediment samples with 16 7 water content following a sftc the 500 scan showed that the sediment particles were larger and more complete at 0 d while sediment particles with other water contents had debris on the surface as shown in fig 6 e the average values of sediment particle size over the time period 0 d to 60 d were 30 12 μm 22 32 μm 17 59 μm and 16 9 μm respectively the d50 values were 29 09 μm 21 007 μm 17 29 μm and 16 50 μm respectively fig 7 a d show sem results for sediment samples with different water contents before and after freezing the 500 scan showed that the sediment particle sizes with 0 water content were larger at the end of freezing while the sediment particle size for other water contents were clastic on the surface as shown in fig 7 e the average values of sediment particle size over the period 0 d to 60 d were 29 63 μm 17 59 μm 18 44 μm and 20 35 μm respectively the d50 values were 28 26 μm 17 29 μm 18 26 μm and 19 63 μm respectively 3 4 contents of elements and om in sediment table 1 shows the results of elemental analysis of sediment with 16 7 water content the results are for one test and the results representative of the test used in this study after 60 d of sftc the o content decreased by 8 from 61 09 to 53 09 si content remained unchanged overall si o values following sftc were 26 25 20 87 27 03 33 77 respectively fig 8 a shows the changes in sediment particle specific surface areas following sftc the results showed that the specific surface area of the sediment was 1 345 m2 g without freezing the specific surface area was increased by 14 to 1 5332 m2 g following continuous freezing for 60 d with changes in freezing time the om contents were 4 3 g kg 5 4 g kg 6 2 g kg and 4 5 g kg respectively from 0 d to 60 d the om content increased by 14 0 after freezing table 2 shows the variations in element distributions on the surface of sediment with different water contents before and after freezing the results indicated that the content of o in the sediment was greatest and rose from 57 51 to 60 44 after freezing the si content remained unchanged overall the final values of si o were 25 80 27 03 27 12 and 22 90 fig 9 shows that the om contents with different water levels were 4 8 g kg 6 2 g kg 4 5 g kg and 4 1 g kg respectively for water levels ranging from 0 to 28 6 4 discussion the experimental results showed that the specific surface areas of sediments from the upper reaches of the yzr increased by 33 following the sftc this suggests that sftc causes sediment fragmentation with the extension of freezing time the specific surface area of the sediment increased and the ex p content decreased the reason for this phenomenon is related to the frost heave force described by bisal bisal and nielsen 1967 the specific surface areas of sediment particles increased by 14 the results of particle size analyses showed that the particle sizes decreased by 43 89 after freezing from the perspective of the adsorption on the one hand these changes may reduce the extent of sediment accumulation and increase the number of adsorption sites on the surface which would increase the adsorption capacity of the sediment on the other hand sediment fragmentation destroys the binding states on om for fe and al complexes feng et al 2007 leading to the release of fe and al related composite ions from om into the sediment porewater these rereleased ions compete with phosphate for adsorption sites on the particles and even replace the phosphate originally adsorbed on the sediment particles resulting in a reduced sediment adsorption capacity for phosphorus therefore the adsorption capacities of sediment particles may be reduced following sftc some ex p could no longer be retained by sediment but would be transformed into other phosphorus forms and the ex p content would be reduced with extended freezing times the fe and al levels in the sediment gradually increased from 4 51 to 6 76 this is partly because the specific surface area of the sediment increased and more elements covering the sediment could be detected on the other hand this may be because the original fe p and al p contained in the sediment were converted to other phosphorus forms releasing the active fe ions and al ions from the complexes zanini et al 1998 in addition when discussing the forms and transformations of phosphorus in soil xie feng pointed out that participation of oxygen was a feature of violent chemical reactions in soil xie and ying fei 2011 and liao believed that increased oxygen consumption during the release process led to a decrease in the o elemental content liao et al 2019 in a long term freezing environment an anoxic environment gradually formed and levels of elemental o on the sediment surface began to decline following 20d ftc which also indicated that fe p and al p conversion reactions which consume more oxygen may have taken place in the sediment reddy et al 1993 the element ratio of si o in this experiment was between 1 5 and 1 3 which is much smaller than the ratio of si o in general clay minerals approximately 1 3 or 2 5 xu et al 2013 and no other nonmetallic elements except si and o were detected indicating that organic substances in clay minerals exist in a certain number of organic forms the anoxic environment caused by sftc will affect the degradation process of om in sediments and then affect the release and transformation of phosphorus in sediments the effect of om on phosphorus levels in sediments is very complex mach et al 1987 om can enhance or undermine the capacity of sediment for phosphate adsorption through different modes of action studies have shown that om in sediments can be rapidly transformed and degraded in rivers water environmental indicators such as consumption of dissolved oxygen and reductions in ph and redox potential are important factors affecting phosphorus release and transformation chase 2000 d angelo and reddy 1994 the om content and o p content after sftc showed a good correlation a substantial portion of sediment o p comes from metabolic wastes from aquatic animals eventually a different o p form will be precipitated on the sediment so there is a good correlation between om and o p wu 2006 the accumulation of om in sediment plays an important role in the phosphorus budget cycle at present there are different opinions about the effect of om on phosphorus levels in sediment some studies have found that an increase in om content increases the adsorption sites for phosphorus in the sediment and thus increases the phosphorus content while others believe that an increase in om content reduces the adsorption capacity of the sediment for phosphorus and thus reduces the phosphorus content as shown in fig 4 b the release of al p in sediments with different water contents presents a similar pattern except in sediments with 0 water content the particle size of 0 water content sediment after freezing for 40 d was similar to that at 0 d this value was much larger than those seen with other water contents which may be because the sediment was not damaged by frost heave forces without the participation of water fe p al p levels were greatly affected by different water contents after freezing cycles which may be related to the oxygen reduction reaction andrieux loyer and aminot 2001 sediments with high water contents have lower internal oxygen contents when they enter the frozen state it has been widely proven through experiments and field investigations that persistent hypoxia usually enhances phosphorus release and transformation reinhard et al 2017 leading to an increase in phosphate concentration in the corresponding overlying water in general the proportion of fe p in tp is higher in urban rivers affected by human activities however in the agricultural lake basin the content of ca p in the sediment represented a higher proportion of tp the proportion of combined phosphorus in the upper reaches of the yzr is more than 80 indicating that this region is rarely visited and that human activities have little interference caraco et al 1989 5 conclusion the experimental results obtained using sediments from the upper reaches of the yarlung zangbo river show that sftc has a significant effect on phosphorus conversion and release in sediments the release of bioavailable phosphorus ex p al p and fe p increased significantly the contents of ca p and oc p remained stable and the content of o p had a good correlation with om with increasing freezing time the bioavailable phosphorus content in the sediments decreased rapidly from 0 to 40 d that is the release increased rapidly the influence gradually stabilized after 40 d indicating that there is a certain limit to the influence of sftc on bioavailable phosphorus after freezing for 60 d the release of bioavailable phosphorus in the sediments increased by 60 09 86 86 and 31 86 the specific particle size of the sediments decreased by 43 and the surface area increased by 14 these results indicate that sftc significantly changes the morphology and structure of sediments furthermore the fragmentation of particles on the surface of sediments increases the release of ions which compete for adsorption sites on the surface of particles and promote the release of phosphorus in sediments with changing om content the o p content also changed this relationship suggests that om can be degraded by mineralization in the absence of microorganisms the degradation process of om will affect the release of o p and then affect the release of bioavailable phosphorus moreover different degrees of particle fragmentation after freezing result in different bioavailable phosphorus release limits in sediments with different water contents funding this project was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51909176 and 52079083 credit

1314,river ice in the upper yarlung zangbo river is characterized by seasonal freezing thawing cycles sftc it is important to explore the effects of sftc on phosphorus release and transformation from upstream surface sediments to protect the ecosystem of the yarlung zangbo river the process and mechanism of phosphorus release and transformation in sediments following sftc were investigated in a laboratory simulation experiment the results showed that after freezing sediment particles were broken the specific surface area was increased by 14 and the particle size was decreased by 43 which resulted in weakened adsorption of phosphorus by sediments moreover the destruction of organic matter om on the sediment surface will release more ion adsorption sites and promote the release of phosphorus the bioavailabilities of exchangeable phosphorus ex p aluminum phosphorus al p and iron phosphorus fe p increased by 60 09 86 86 and 31 86 respectively after freezing organic phosphorus o p

a shows the changes in sediment particle specific surface areas following sftc the results showed that the specific surface area of the sediment was 1 345 m2 g without freezing the specific surface area was increased by 14 to 1 5332 m2 g following continuous freezing for 60 d with changes in freezing time the om contents were 4 3 g kg 5 4 g kg 6 2 g kg and 4 5 g kg respectively from 0 d to 60 d the om content increased by 14 0 after freezing table 2 shows the variations in element distributions on the surface of sediment with different water contents before and after freezing the results indicated that the content of o in the sediment was greatest and rose from 57 51 to 60 44 after freezing the si content remained unchanged overall the final values of si o were 25 80 27 03 27 12 and 22 90 fig 9 shows that the om contents with different water levels were 4 8 g kg 6 2 g kg 4 5 g kg and 4 1 g kg respectively for water levels ranging from 0 to 28 6 4 discussion the experimental results showed that the specific surface areas of sediments from the upper reaches of the yzr increased by 33 following the sftc this suggests that sftc causes sediment fragmentation with the extension of freezing time the specific surface area of the sediment increased and the ex p content decreased the reason for this phenomenon is related to the frost heave force described by bisal bisal and nielsen 1967 the specific surface areas of sediment particles increased by 14 the results of particle size analyses showed that the particle sizes decreased by 43 89 after freezing from the perspective of the adsorption on the one hand these changes may reduce the extent of sediment accumulation and increase the number of adsorption sites on the surface which would increase the adsorption capacity of the sediment on the other hand sediment fragmentation destroys the binding states on om for fe and al complexes feng et al 2007 leading to the release of fe and al related composite ions from om into the sediment porewater these rereleased ions compete with phosphate for adsorption sites on the particles and even replace the phosphate originally adsorbed on the sediment particles resulting in a reduced sediment adsorption capacity for phosphorus therefore the adsorption capacities of sediment particles may be reduced following sftc some ex p could no longer be retained by sediment but would be transformed into other phosphorus forms and the ex p content would be reduced with extended freezing times the fe and al levels in the sediment gradually increased from 4 51 to 6 76 this is partly because the specific surface area of the sediment increased and more elements covering the sediment could be detected on the other hand this may be because the original fe p and al p contained in the sediment were converted to other phosphorus forms releasing the active fe ions and al ions from the complexes zanini et al 1998 in addition when discussing the forms and transformations of phosphorus in soil xie feng pointed out that participation of oxygen was a feature of violent chemical reactions in soil xie and ying fei 2011 and liao believed that increased oxygen consumption during the release process led to a decrease in the o elemental content liao et al 2019 in a long term freezing environment an anoxic environment gradually formed and levels of elemental o on the sediment surface began to decline following 20d ftc which also indicated that fe p and al p conversion reactions which consume more oxygen may have taken place in the sediment reddy et al 1993 the element ratio of si o in this experiment was between 1 5 and 1 3 which is much smaller than the ratio of si o in general clay minerals approximately 1 3 or 2 5 xu et al 2013 and no other nonmetallic elements except si and o were detected indicating that organic substances in clay minerals exist in a certain number of organic forms the anoxic environment caused by sftc will affect the degradation process of om in sediments and then affect the release and transformation of phosphorus in sediments the effect of om on phosphorus levels in sediments is very complex mach et al 1987 om can enhance or undermine the capacity of sediment for phosphate adsorption through different modes of action studies have shown that om in sediments can be rapidly transformed and degraded in rivers water environmental indicators such as consumption of dissolved oxygen and reductions in ph and redox potential are important factors affecting phosphorus release and transformation chase 2000 d angelo and reddy 1994 the om content and o p content after sftc showed a good correlation a substantial portion of sediment o p comes from metabolic wastes from aquatic animals eventually a different o p form will be precipitated on the sediment so there is a good correlation between om and o p wu 2006 the accumulation of om in sediment plays an important role in the phosphorus budget cycle at present there are different opinions about the effect of om on phosphorus levels in sediment some studies have found that an increase in om content increases the adsorption sites for phosphorus in the sediment and thus increases the phosphorus content while others believe that an increase in om content reduces the adsorption capacity of the sediment for phosphorus and thus reduces the phosphorus content as shown in fig 4 b the release of al p in sediments with different water contents presents a similar pattern except in sediments with 0 water content the particle size of 0 water content sediment after freezing for 40 d was similar to that at 0 d this value was much larger than those seen with other water contents which may be because the sediment was not damaged by frost heave forces without the participation of water fe p al p levels were greatly affected by different water contents after freezing cycles which may be related to the oxygen reduction reaction andrieux loyer and aminot 2001 sediments with high water contents have lower internal oxygen contents when they enter the frozen state it has been widely proven through experiments and field investigations that persistent hypoxia usually enhances phosphorus release and transformation reinhard et al 2017 leading to an increase in phosphate concentration in the corresponding overlying water in general the proportion of fe p in tp is higher in urban rivers affected by human activities however in the agricultural lake basin the content of ca p in the sediment represented a higher proportion of tp the proportion of combined phosphorus in the upper reaches of the yzr is more than 80 indicating that this region is rarely visited and that human activities have little interference caraco et al 1989 5 conclusion the experimental results obtained using sediments from the upper reaches of the yarlung zangbo river show that sftc has a significant effect on phosphorus conversion and release in sediments the release of bioavailable phosphorus ex p al p and fe p increased significantly the contents of ca p and oc p remained stable and the content of o p had a good correlation with om with increasing freezing time the bioavailable phosphorus content in the sediments decreased rapidly from 0 to 40 d that is the release increased rapidly the influence gradually stabilized after 40 d indicating that there is a certain limit to the influence of sftc on bioavailable phosphorus after freezing for 60 d the release of bioavailable phosphorus in the sediments increased by 60 09 86 86 and 31 86 the specific particle size of the sediments decreased by 43 and the surface area increased by 14 these results indicate that sftc significantly changes the morphology and structure of sediments furthermore the fragmentation of particles on the surface of sediments increases the release of ions which compete for adsorption sites on the surface of particles and promote the release of phosphorus in sediments with changing om content the o p content also changed this relationship suggests that om can be degraded by mineralization in the absence of microorganisms the degradation process of om will affect the release of o p and then affect the release of bioavailable phosphorus moreover different degrees of particle fragmentation after freezing result in different bioavailable phosphorus release limits in sediments with different water contents funding this project was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51909176 and 52079083 credit
