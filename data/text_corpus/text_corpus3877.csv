19385,oxygen inhibits anammox a bioconversion executed by anoxic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob nonetheless oxygen is mostly found in the proximity of anaob in nitrogen removal applications being a substrate for nitritation the experiments performed to date were mostly limited to batch activity tests where anaob activity is estimated during oxygen exposure however little attention has been paid to the recovery and reversibility of activity following aerobic conditions of direct relevance for bioreactor operation in this work anoxic and autotrophic reactor cultivation at 20 c yielded an enriched microbial community in anaob consisting for 75 of a member of the genus brocadia high resolution kinetic data were obtained with online ammonium measurements and further processed with a newly developed python data pipeline the experimentally obtained anaob response showed complete inhibition until micro aerobic conditions were reached again 0 02 mg o2 l 1 after oxygen inhibition anaob recovered gradually with recovery times of 5 37 h to reach a steady state activity dependent on the perceived inhibition the recovery immediately after inhibition was lowest when exposed to higher oxygen concentrations range 0 5 8 mg o2 l 1 with long contact times range 9 24 h the experimental data did not fit well with a conventional instant recovery monod type inhibition model yet the fit greatly improved by incorporating a dynamic growth rate formula accurately describing gradual activity recovery with the upgraded model long term kinetic simulations for partial nitritation anammox pn a with intermittent aeration showed a decrease in growth rate compared to the instant recovery mode these results indicate that recovery of anaob after oxygen exposure was previously overlooked it is recommended to account for this effect in the intensification of partial nitritation anammox graphical abstract image 1 keywords monod partial nitritation anammox inhibition

oxygen is mostly found in their cell proximity in biotechnological applications partial nitritation anammox pn a is a most cost effective technology to remove ammonium from wastewater autotrophically i e without organic carbon producing mainly nitrogen gas and some nitrate it is already successfully implemented to treat ammonium rich streams 500 1000 mg n l 1 at higher temperatures 30 35 c as the so called sidestream pn a process treating reject water from digested sewage sludge lackner et al 2014 the so called mainstream application of pn a is in the waterline of a sewage treatment plant following a carbon removal step this approach is less mature yet of high interest as it can enable treatment facilities to become a net producer rather than consumer of electricity verstraete and vlaeminck 2011 specific challenges for mainstream pn a relate to its lower temperatures 8 25 c in central europe lower influent ammonium concentrations 30 50 mg n l 1 and higher levels of organics e g biodegradable cod n around 2 agrawal et al 2018 recently proposed a multi controller approach to manage the complex microbial competition network under these conditions in essence based on controlling the activity on off and retention in out of the main groups of microbes promoting specifically aerobic and anoxic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aeraob and anaob the partial proliferation of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob under mainstream conditions is a typical example imbalancing the aeraob anaob tandem resulting in lower nitrogen removal operational strategies suppressing nob activity included residual ammonium 2 4 mg n l 1 and short floccular residence times 2 7 d combined with intermittent aeration at higher dissolved oxygen do setpoints e g 1 5 mg o2 l 1 for 0 25 0 5 h han et al 2016 malovanyy et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 the potential anaob inhibition by these aeration strategies in i e granular or biofilms on carriers was however not yet addressed it is unclear to which extent oxygen hinders pn a start up or recovery after a collapse in practice but an exploratory modeling effort already revealed that full oxygen penetration can occur in aggregates of 500 μm diameter starting from 1 mg o2 l 1 see figure a 1 c 1 oxygen inhibition of anaob has been described most extensively for marine systems as well as for some laboratory freshwater cultures a wide range of inhibitory values were reported for marine systems with 50 inhibitory concentrations ic50 ranging from 0 03 to 0 36 mg o2 l 1 see figure d 1 babbin et al 2014 dalsgaard et al 2014 jensen et al 2008 kalvelage et al 2011 the same holds for laboratory freshwater cultures of brocadia anammoxidans or kuenenia stuttgartiensis with complete inhibition reported at micro aerobic levels 0 04 0 12 mg o2 l 1 egli et al 2001 oshiki et al 2015 strous et al 1997 in contrast higher ic50 were found for floccular cultures for brocadia sinica 2 mg o2 l 1 and brocadia caroliensis 3 8 mg o2 l 1 carvajal arroyo et al 2013 oshiki et al 2011 this variability in reported do inhibitory levels can be due to inter genera differences oshiki et al 2015 potential adaptation towards oxygen stress protection by oxygen consuming bacteria in small aggregates dalsgaard et al 2014 and testing procedures dalsgaard et al 2014 i e mixing aggregate size etc furthermore most studies done on fresh water cultures tested an one time exposure on anoxically enriched anaob potentially influencing kinetics carvajal arroyo et al 2013 egli et al 2001 lotti et al 2012 oshiki et al 2011 since anaob showed adaptation towards oxygen stress in their transcriptome yan et al 2012 tests with recurring oxygen exposure should be performed with anaob to mimic real operation conditions and obtain closer to application kinetics mathematical models have been widely used to study and optimize the pn a process under different conditions hao et al 2005 ni et al 2014 terada et al 2007 pérez et al 2014 the oxygen stress on anaob was a crucial factor for such modeling efforts influencing reactor performance e g by comparing different aeration patterns corbalá robles et al 2016 in this case oxygen inhibition was modeled by an instant recovery monod inhibition model henze et al 2000 this is in line with the experimental studies so far where almost all focused on activity loss during oxygen exposure which can be described by such model yet only two studies looked at recovery of activity after anoxic conditions were restored lotti et al 2012 strous et al 1997 both lotti et al 2012 and strous et al 1997 reported no loss of activity after exposure as both studies used thick granules with a diameter of 1 1 mm limited oxygen diffusion through the biofilm could have prevented oxygen inhibition on the other hand the low resolution of data i e 6 data points over a period of 2 h in the case of strous et al 1997 could have disguised short term recovery effects in this study the effect of do pulse concentration and length on anaob activity was mapped by dosing oxygen into an autotrophically fed anammox reactor ammonium profiles were measured online and converted to high resolution anaob activities by a newly developed data pipeline representative kinetic data were obtained by minimizing diffusional limitations by using flocs ø4 3 168 μm and by applying recurrent oxygen exposure as the experimental data did not fit the conventionally used instant recovery monod model a new model is proposed based on a more gradual recovery of anaob activity this model was used to assess the long term impact and implications of oxygen exposure in an anaob process model 2 material and methods 2 1 anammox reactor 2 1 1 inoculum for the reactor start up the goal was to obtain an inoculum rich in anaob with minimum diffusion limitations small particle size hereto the cyclone underflow fraction of a sidestream pn a treatment facility was sampled wwtp nieuwveer breda nl then the fraction highest in anaob was further selected by sieving this sludge over a 200 μm sieve assisted by adding tap water to minimize diffusional limitations the recovered sludge from the sieve was then blended 2 min in a kitchen blender and sieved again with reactor medium lacking in n substrate over a 200 μm sieve the blended floccular biomass was retained while unwanted larger in organic particles were removed 2 1 2 reactor set up and sbr operation the biomass was cultured in a 5 5 l anoxic sequencing batch reactor sbr and fed with a synthetic autotrophic medium with ammonium and nitrite as nitrogen sources in a 1 1 3 ratio the medium was made anoxic through n2 gas flushing had a ph of 7 2 and contained per l 0 5 g of nh4 n as nh4cl 0 65 g of no2 n as nano2 0 5 g nahco3 3 9 g hepes 0 1 g cacl2 2h2o 0 2 g mgso4 7h2o 0 06 g na2hpo4 2h2o and 1 ml of trace elements solutions a and b supplemental information e 1 stirring occurred with an ika rw20d ika usa do levels and temperature were measured online by an oxymax cos61d sensor with a response time of 1s endress and hauser ch whereas ph ammonium and potassium were measured by an isemax cas40d sensor with response time 2 min endress and hauser ch the signals were sent to a liquiline cm448 endress and hauser ch which transmitted the signals to daqfactory software azeotech oregon usa this software controlled and monitored the reactor operation and measurements a typical sbr cycle was as follows 1 a new dose of influent 0 23 l over 4 min was given every time nitrite was depleted i e when ammonium was below a certain residual level and when the rate was below 40 mg n l 1 d 1 a residual ammonium level 5 mg n l 1 was chosen to ensure that nitrite was always the limiting substrate 2 similarly 3 additional doses were given raising the volume of the sbr from 4 25 to 5 17 l 3 after nitrite was depleted in the last spike biomass settled for 30 min 4 hereafter the effluent was pumped out over a period of 7 5 min and the cycle recommenced the volumetric ammonium removal activity of the reactor determined the influent flow rate fed to the system resulting in hydraulic retention times varying between 1 7 and 2 5 d over the course of the experiment 2 1 3 reactor conditions the reactor was operated for 120 days and the reactor conditions were chosen to induce stable and optimal operation with the added oxygen spikes as only disturbing factor 1 the reactor was kept anoxic by n2 gas flushing except during an oxygen spike and the change of headspace volume due to sbr cycling was compensated by a gas bag 2 ph was controlled at ph 7 2 by a 0 02 m hcl solution to compensate for the increase in ph from the anaob reaction and stripping when flushing with n2 gas under stable operation the control of ph had a maximum δph 0 05 no limitation for co2 was prevalent because the reactor was buffered well at ph 7 2 no large ph fluctuations 3 the reactor was located in a temperature controlled room at 20 c no thermostat was used the temperature was stable during all experiments avg standard deviation 0 1 c except for the experiment on day 18 t 21 5 0 8 where the measured activity was corrected with a temperature arrhenius coefficient θt 1 10 lotti et al 2014 4 salinity 43 mm nacl ammonium levels 5 40 mg n l 1 nitrite levels 0 35 mg n l 1 and nitrate levels 100 mg n l 1 were all kept well below reported inhibitory levels for the genus brocadia oshiki et al 2015 5 floccular sludge ø4 3 168 24 μm and fast stirring 200 rpm was used to minimize diffusional limitations fast stirring also ensured no biofilm growth on the reactor walls sludge was regularly taken out of the reactor for batch activity tests resulting in a stable biomass concentration of 1 95 0 08 g vss l 1 that showed an activity of 1184 188 mg nh4 g vss 1 d 1 over the course of the experiments 2 2 oxygen response curves in the reactor 2 2 1 experimental procedure two types of oxygen exposure experiments were executed one in presence and one in absence of nitrite during oxygen exposure ammonium was always present during exposure for the experiments in the presence of nitrite the oxygen was applied at the start of an sbr cycle after feeding oxygen was introduced with a syringe that added a certain volume of air in the bulk liquid the oxygen level was adjusted manually to the desired level over a period of 2 h by adding extra air in the headspace of the reactor after the oxygen exposure period the reactor was flushed with n2 gas to restore anoxic conditions and the recovery of anaob activity was monitored the experiments in absence of nitrite were executed in a similar way but n sources were supplied manually ammonium 25 mg nh4 n l 1 was supplemented before the oxygen spike and nitrite 32 5 mg no2 n l 1 was added when the do was below 0 02 mg o2 l 1 during flushing for both sets of experiments different oxygen concentrations c and exposure times t were applied see table 1 2 2 2 data processing from ammonium concentrations to removal rates datasets of the separate experiments were analyzed using python psf oregon usa several functionalities were implemented to obtain a reproducible workflow also conceptually explained in supplemental information figures f 1 and f 2 in short for each substrate doses in the sbr cycle the ammonium profile was monitored these online ammonium measurements were first filtered double ammonium values and measurement errors were removed in a next step a calculation window over which the slopes were calculated was selected manually this was done to remove the peak of substrate dose at the start and to remove the lower slopes due to nitrite limitation at the end within this calculation window a smaller δt value of 10 min was chosen to calculate a higher frequency of slopes from all the calculated slopes a response curve was constructed all code written for the data analysis along with an example jupyter notebook and example datasets are available online https zenodo org account settings github repository ugentbiomath 2017 highresolutionratecalculation 2 2 3 definitions for interpretation of the response curve different parameters were defined the activity lag phase was defined as the time before activity starts after oxygen exposure the initial recovery after oxygen inhibition was defined as the first rate calculated after oxygen was depleted the recovery time was calculated as the time between the initial recovery and the first timepoint when full recovery or steady state was observed i e when the relative change in average activity in the actual substrate spike compared to the previous substrate spike was 1 irreversible inhibition was calculated as the difference between steady state activity and activity prior to oxygen exposure 2 3 mathematical modeling a simple mathematical model was constructed in aquasim 2 1 g reichert 1998 to conceptually represent the gradual recovery phenomena that were observed in the experiments the model only included anaob biomass at a constant concentration x anaob during the simulation runs because the simulations and experiments ran only for 1 2 days no biomass growth was expected and was thus not accounted for influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations were 50 mg n l 1 and 60 mg n l 1 respectively the model was composed of a conventional monod type growth process and a decay process see tables g 1 and h 1 to represent a delayed recovery of the anaob activity the growth rate μ anaob was modeled as a state variable and was allowed to change depending on the specific conditions the differential equation eq 1 that defined the change of μ anaob over time was 1 d μ a n a o b d t k d μ a n a o b s o s o k o α μ m a n a o b μ a n a o b k o k o s o where k d is the deactivation constant of anaob under anoxic conditions used to set the minimum activity and α is an adaptation parameter of anaob to aerobic conditions the effect that is introduced by this equation can be linked to the deactivation of enzymes under aerobic conditions which are critical for anaob k d is representing the deactivation of these enzymes similarly to the model by kornaros et al 2010 and α the ability to adapt to environmental changes kornaros et al 2010 s o is the oxygen concentration imported experimental data and k o the oxygen inhibition concentration for anaob from literature to determine the unknown variables k d and α the parameter estimation function in aquasim was used employing the secant method reichert 1998 fitting the experimentally determined relative anaob activity to the relative activity calculated by the model the adapted gradual recovery monod type model with dynamic μ anaob was compared to the conventional instant recovery monod type model with a constant μ anaob model fits were compared based on χ2 the sum of the squares of the weighted deviations between measurements reichert 1998 and simulated model results eq 2 due to the lack of activity data during the oxygen exposure only the datapoints after the do peak starting with the first activity data point were used to calculate χ2 2 χ 2 p i 1 n y d a t a i y i p σ d a t a i 2 with y data i being the i th measurement σ data i the standard deviation y i p the calculated value of the model variable corresponding to the i th measurement and p p 1 p m the model parameters and n the number of data points to extrapolate the results to a process level the gradual recovery model was used to test intermittent aeration patterns of 30 min on off and 180 min on off at two different do set points of 0 2 and 1 2 mg o2 l 1 over a period of 5 days intermittent aeration until day 4 the parameters α and kd were both set to a value of 2 for this exercise 2 4 oxygen response in batch tests a batch activity test was executed to determine anaob activity after extreme oxygen stress conditions exposure to 8 mg o2 l 1 for 24 h in presence of 40 mg nh4 n l 1 flocs were taken from the reactor at day 114 and placed in a ph 7 2 corrected medium of 3 87 g hepes l 1 0 2 g cacl2x2h2o l 1 0 1 g mgso4x7h2o l 1 0 005 g na2hpo4x2h2o p l 1 0 5 g nahco3 l 1 40 mg nh4cl n l 1 and 1 ml l 1 trace elements solutions a and b table e 1 the schott bottles were put on a stirrer and exposed to the air for 24 h aerobic treatment reaching 8 mg o2 l 1 within the first hour the bottles were then flushed with n2 gas prior to substrate dosing control bottles anoxic control were not exposed to oxygen and flushed at the moment when the aerobic exposure time started 75 mg nh4cl n l 1 and 75 mg nano2 n l 1 were spiked at the beginning of the test concentrations of no2 no3 and nh4 were monitored over time volatile and total suspended solids vss and tss were measured to assess floccular sludge concentration to calculate biomass specific rates as mg n g vss 1 d 1 each test was performed in triplicate 2 5 physicochemical analyses offline nitrite and nitrate were measured with a 761 compact ic metrohm ch and nh4 with the nesslerization method greenberg et al 1992 to follow up biomass levels volatile and total suspended solids vss and tss were measured with standard methods 2540d and e greenberg et al 1992 the

was done with 97 identity corresponding to species level the sequences were then classified based on the taxonomy in the greengenes database 97 confidence threshold version 13 5 may 2013 mcdonald et al 2012 the sequencing data was analyzed in r using ggplot2 v0 9 3 1 to determine the community composition of the biomass in the reactor 3 results 3 1 microbial community enriched in ca brocadia over the experimental period the reactor community was enriched in one anaob otu of the genus ca brocadia from 64 day 38 to 75 day 106 based on 16s rdna amplicon sequencing see fig i 1 for more detailed community analysis as this anaob is commonly encountered in engineered systems it is anticipated that its response behavior to oxygen is applicable to pn a applications oshiki et al 2015 3 2 experimental oxygen response curves anaob responded differently towards tested combinations of oxygen concentrations exposure times and presence or absence of nitrite an overview of the experiments is given in table 1 while fig 1 depicts typical activity curves including modeling efforts the anaob response curve consisted of the following parts which will be described below anaob activity prior and during exposure an eventual activity lag phase initial recovery after exposure and gradual recovery with or without irreversible inhibition 3 2 1 anaob activity in presence of o2 during oxygen exposure no ammonium was consumed and anaob activity was only regained when oxygen concentrations were below micro aerobic conditions 0 02 mg o2 l 1 fig 1 panel c 2 and d 2 indicating a direct and high intolerance to oxygen 3 2 2 anaob activity lag phase after oxygen inhibition after oxygen disappearance anaob reversibly and immediately reinitiated activity to 55 80 of the pre exposure activity depending on the conditions during exposure this drop of initial recovery after oxygen inhibition was not due to substrate ammonium and nitrite starvation during exposure because longer anoxic periods without substrate did not result in activity loss in an ex situ batch test the effect of longer oxygen exposure 24 h at a higher oxygen concentration 8 mg o2 l 1 was tested fig 2 activity could be detected only after a 5 h lag phase and it increased gradually from 10 to 91 of the initial activity after 26 h under anoxic conditions 3 2 3 initial recovery after oxygen inhibition for the in situ reactor tests initial recovery after oxygen inhibition decreased from 81 3 to 74 5 when anaob were exposed to higher compared to lower oxygen concentrations in absence of nitrite on avg 0 47 0 08 vs 0 08 0 04 mg o2 l 1 fig 3 this increased drop in initial recovery could also be due to longer exposure times for the high do setpoint figure j 1 which were on avg 3 7 0 3 h vs 2 8 0 2 h for the low do setpoint a lower initial recovery after oxygen inhibition was also recorded when anaob were exposed to 0 5 0 2 mg o2 l 1 for 8 7 h in the presence of nitrite with a gradual recovery from 58 to full recovery after 37 h day 18 3 2 4 gradual recovery after exposure anaob gradually recovered towards a steady state activity this recovery time until steady state was similar for the low and high do setpoint and in the range of 4 2 6 8 h with on avg 6 3 0 9 h the recovery time also did not show any correlation with the concentration c figure j 1 exposure time t figure j 1 integrated cxt figure j 1 or initial recovery after oxygen inhibition anaob did not always fully recover see fig 2 panel c and fig 1 panel b and c and consistent irreversible loss of activity of about 5 was seen when the biomass was exposed to low oxygen setpoints of on avg 0 06 0 12 mg o2 l 1 in absence of nitrite a short 4 h exposure with a high do setpoint of on avg 1 mg o2 l 1 and in the presence of nitrite also led to more severe irreversible loss of activity of about 9 fig 1 panel c conversely the short term 3 h and long term 8 h exposures at do setpoints in a range of on avg 0 12 0 5 mg o2 l 1 with nitrite as well as the higher do setpoints of on avg 0 35 0 52 mg o2 l 1 in absence of nitrite did not reveal any irreversible inhibition this indicates that the complex interplay of oxidative and nitrosative o2 n species conditions combined with substrate presence might regulate how anaob cope with oxidative and nitrosative stress 3 3 modeling gradual recovery after oxygen inhibition a gradual recovery model was constructed to describe the gradual recovery after oxygen inhibition a comparison with the classical instant recovery model fig 1 and table 1 revealed a considerably improved fit of the gradual recovery model to the data than the instant recovery model evident from the 2 4 fold lower χ2 the newly developed gradual recovery model included a dynamic growth rate to simulate the delay in the recovery of the anaob activity fig 1 the automated fitting produced sometimes large variations and or standard errors for the parameters α and kd one reason is the high fluctuation of the measured activities during one sbr cycle of up to 10 another reason is the lack of data for the anaob activity during oxygen exposure to more accurately determine both parameters more data during initial oxygen exposure and shortly after oxygen depletion is necessary especially kd is highly influenced by the slope of loss and regain of the activity and the data does not allow for a highly accurate parameter estimation also visible from the standard deviations of kd since kd represents the deactivation of the anaob activity due to the oxygen higher kd values are required for bringing down the activity to zero during oxygen exposure the parameter α mainly formed the shape of the activity curve during recovery and with higher α values the recovery became faster table 1 process modeling was further used to estimate the impact of the newly observed oxygen response on a pn a this implied evaluating the impact of longer phases of intermittent aeration on the effluent composition of a continuously operated pn a reactor with simulations run over 5 days employing different aeration patterns see m m fig 4 summarizes the results of these simulations which were evaluated based on the nitrogen species in the effluent exemplarily plotting the ammonium concentration it was evident that the ammonium concentrations in the effluent as predicted by the gradual recovery model were higher than the ones predicted by the instant recovery model from the different conditions tested a less frequent oxygen alteration 180 180 on off rather than a higher oxygen level 1 2 vs 0 2 mg o2 l 1 yielded high peak ammonium concentrations earlier on these effects were caused by the decrease in the growth rate in the gradual recovery model fig 4 left row due to the imposed oxygen peaks this decrease in growth rate is influenced by α and k d which were set to 2 in this example leading to more severe effects for lower α values and ratios of α k d of 1 4 discussion 4 1 anaob inhibition by oxygen 4 1 1 anaob gradual recovery after oxygen inhibition to our knowledge this is the first report showing at high temporal resolution how anaob activity is affected by oxygen exposure anaob were completely inhibited by oxygen and after short exposure resumed activity directly with a gradual recovery until reversible activity was overcome other anoxic anaerobic bioconversions for instance by sulfate reducing bacteria or denitrifying bacteria which similarly to anaob rely on substrates derived from oxidative and reducing conditions at oxic and anoxic anaerobic interfaces responded kinetically similarly after oxygen exposure dolla et al 2006 fareleira et al 2003 kornaros and lyberatos 1998 anaob and other microbes living under recurrent oxygen exposure thus adapted towards these conditions with production of anti oxidative enzymes and recovery of activity after exposure which cannot be explained by growth dalsgaard et al 2014 yan et al 2012 the measured kinetic response is most likely overlooked so far because most studies investigated activity only during exposure in the scarce cases studying also recovery the outcome might have been biased due to lower data resolution after exposure i e 4 6 datapoints over a course of 2 6 h dalsgaard et al 2014 strous et al 1997 or aggregate size lotti et al 2012 strous et al 1997 for example strous et al 1997 reported no influence on biomass specific activity rates when a granular biomass brocadia was repeatedly exposed for 20 days to 2 h aerobic and anoxic conditions similarly lotti et al 2012 reported no loss in activity after an extreme oxygen exposure of 24 h and 5 mg o2 l 1 for granular biomass 1 1 mm in both cases diffusional limitations could have underestimated initial biomass specific activities and consequentially inhibition could be masked by this underestimation 4 1 2 factors impacting initial recovery after oxygen inhibition with the current dataset it was not feasible to deduct whether the oxygen concentration fig 2 or exposure time figure j 1 had a larger influence on the initial recovery as higher oxygen concentrations also had longer exposure times it was hypothesized that concentration times exposure time integrated cxt figure j 1 steered the anaob response but spearman rank correlation analysis did not yield any correlation from the gradual recovery model the exposure time had a higher influence than the concentration while other factors like adaptation and nitrite presence during exposure might differentiate the response and thus fitted kinetic parameters both aspects require further experimental research to elucidate the exact factors determining initial recovery after oxygen inhibition 4 1 3 novel experimental procedure and impact on measured kinetics in this study anaob responded very sensitive towards oxygen with an observed ic100 0 02 mg o2 l 1 or below this showed that diffusional limitations in rather large flocs of 200 μm or oxygen consumption by putative heterotrophs in the anaob satellite community did not shield anaob from oxygen anaob sensitivity towards oxygen was comparable with some freshwater anaob brocadia sp and kuenenia stuttgartiensis which were for 100 inhibited at micro aerobic conditions of 0 04 and 0 12 mg o2 l 1 respectively egli et al 2001 strous et al 1997 in contrast two brocadia enriched floccular sludge types were very tolerant towards oxygen exposure with ic50 values of 2 and 3 8 mg o2 l 1 respectively which cannot be explained when compared to our or other studies see figure d 1 carvajal arroyo et al 2013 oshiki et al 2011 also for marine anaob higher ic100 values between 0 09 and 0 64 mg o2 l 1 were reported babbin et al 2014 dalsgaard et al 2014 jensen et al 2008 kalvelage et al 2011 for the latter the difference between measured sensitivities was hypothesized to come from either different testing conditions i e absence of mixing or presence in aggregates shielding anaob partially from oxygen or from more adapted anaob due to presence in oxygen minimum zones dalsgaard et al 2014 as in our testing conditions anaob were repeatedly exposed to oxygen with low diffusional limitations the obtained data probably resembled intrinsic and more adapted kinetics the newly developed methodology which obtained high resolution data processed by a data pipeline is therefore highly suitable for studying kinetic responses of stressors and inhibitors on anaob 4 2 modeling anaob inhibition by oxygen in mathematical modeling oxygen inhibition of anaob has typically been modeled by an instant recovery monod model with an inhibition constant k o anaob of 0 01 mg l 1 based on strous et al 1998 with this kinetic constant 10 anaob activity is expected at 0 1 mg o2 l 1 which overestimated the expected activity of anaob during oxygen exposure in our experiments see fig 1 further fine tuning of this kinetic constant is thus necessary after oxygen exposure anaob directly resumed activity only in a range of 30 80 of the initial activity this direct recovery of activity was conventionally reported and perceived as reversible activity of anaob without any activity loss dalsgaard et al 2014 egli et al 2001 lotti et al 2012 strous et al 1997 instant recovery models therefore do not account for a delay in recovery to less than 100 while the newly developed gradual recovery model describes this more accurately gradual recovery has been previously modeled for several other nitrogen bio conversions alex et al 2009 and casasús et al 2005 introduced an enzyme as additional state variable and processes for its activation and deactivation to simulate bacterial lag phases for nitrification alex et al 2009 and denitrification casasús et al 2005 identically to our approach the nob lag phase after anoxic phases kornaros et al 2010 was successfully modeled with the growth rate as dynamic variable thus influencing the maximum specific growth rate the latter enabled to exploit these lag phenomena to optimize nob suppression in their reactors these examples show that incorporating additional equations may lead to more accurate models and further insights on how to optimally operate mainstream pn a additional research is needed however due to the limited amount of data especially during oxygen exposure to accurately estimate the newly introduced parameters α and k d independently furthermore other effects like exposure time oxidative stress conditions and adaptation could also impact the modeled parameters and should be taken into account in further modeling exercises 4 3 long term recurrent exposure exploratory simulations from a modeling perspective the exposure time is the critical parameter when looking at the implications on effluent quality fig 4 the simplified model showed that a delay in the recovery of full activity will potentially lead to a decrease of the overall turnover capacity of the system which is reflected in the effluent concentration exemplified by ammonium an instant recovery model where the activity is back to 100 right after oxygen depletion does not capture such a delay and will therefore not account for any impact this had on the reactor performance the model suggested that longer anoxic periods in combination with short intense aeration intervals might be the strategy of choice however the model in its present form does not account for other effects that might influence recovery such as adaptation yan et al 2012 niche differentiation oshiki et al 2015 aggregate morphology or nitrite availability which also seemed relevant from the experimental observations in practice also aerobic processes and mass transfer limitations partially shield anaob in biofilms from oxygen exposure for this reason increased anaob resilience was reported in biofilm systems compared to flocs e g lower nitrite build up was detected when nitrification and thus oxygen shielding failed due to sudden or long term disturbances in temperature drops gilbert et al 2015 wells et al 2017 however completely anoxic conditions might be hard to achieve and will also depend on the height of the oxygen peaks see figure in b 1 anaob recovery from oxygen inhibition will thus always be present in pn a reactors and studies on long term repeated exposure are warranted to achieve the process intensification i e maximize nitrogen removal rates and efficiencies 5 conclusions anaob reside mostly in proximity of oxygen in wastewater treatment processes such as pn a possibly experiencing repeated inhibition nonetheless it was not well understood how anaob activity is affected by oxygen stress a newly developed methodology which combined high temporal resolution measurements with a fit for use data pipeline enabled to study this and corroborate the findings with a newly developed mathematical model 1 anaob showed no activity during exposure 0 02 mg o2 l 1 due to oxygen inhibition anaob lost activity compared to pre exposure rates this initial loss in activity was followed by a gradual partial recovery of activity dependent on the oxidative or nitrosative stress conditions perceived during oxygen exposure 2 the initial recovery after oxygen inhibition was slower when exposed towards higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and contact times 3 exposure to low oxygen concentrations of 0 05 0 2 mg o2 l 1 did not result in full recovery 95 4 a new gradual recovery monod model described the gradual recovery more accurately than the current instant recovery model 5 long term simulated exposure with intermittent aeration and the gradual recovery model led to reduced anaob growth rates compared to an instant recovery model considering oxygen inhibition on anaob can thus be an important factor to optimize

19385,oxygen inhibits anammox a bioconversion executed by anoxic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob nonetheless oxygen is mostly found in the proximity of anaob in nitrogen removal applications being a substrate for nitritation the experiments performed to date were mostly limited to batch activity tests where anaob activity is estimated during oxygen exposure however little attention has been paid to the recovery and reversibility of activity following aerobic conditions of direct relevance for bioreactor operation in this work anoxic and autotrophic reactor cultivation at 20 c yielded an enriched microbial community in anaob consisting for 75 of a member of the genus brocadia high resolution kinetic data were obtained with online ammonium measurements and further processed with a newly developed python data pipeline the experimentally obtained anaob response showed complete inhibition until micro aerobic conditions were reached again 0 02 mg o2 l 1 after oxygen inhibition anaob recovered gradually with recovery times of 5 37 h to reach a steady state activity dependent on the perceived inhibition the recovery immediately after inhibition was lowest when exposed to higher oxygen concentrations range 0 5 8 mg o2 l 1 with long contact times range 9 24 h the experimental data did not fit well with a conventional instant recovery monod type inhibition model yet the fit greatly improved by incorporating a dynamic growth rate formula accurately describing gradual activity recovery with the upgraded model long term kinetic simulations for partial nitritation anammox pn a with intermittent aeration showed a decrease in growth rate compared to the instant recovery mode these results indicate that recovery of anaob after oxygen exposure was previously overlooked it is recommended to account for this effect in the intensification of partial nitritation anammox graphical abstract image 1 keywords monod partial nitritation anammox inhibition

oxygen is mostly found in their cell proximity in biotechnological applications partial nitritation anammox pn a is a most cost effective technology to remove ammonium from wastewater autotrophically i e without organic carbon producing mainly nitrogen gas and some nitrate it is already successfully implemented to treat ammonium rich streams 500 1000 mg n l 1 at higher temperatures 30 35 c as the so called sidestream pn a process treating reject water from digested sewage sludge lackner et al 2014 the so called mainstream application of pn a is in the waterline of a sewage treatment plant following a carbon removal step this approach is less mature yet of high interest as it can enable treatment facilities to become a net producer rather than consumer of electricity verstraete and vlaeminck 2011 specific challenges for mainstream pn a relate to its lower temperatures 8 25 c in central europe lower influent ammonium concentrations 30 50 mg n l 1 and higher levels of organics e g

malovanyy et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 the potential anaob inhibition by these aeration strategies in i e granular or biofilms on carriers was however not yet addressed it is unclear to which extent oxygen hinders pn a start up or recovery after a collapse in practice but an exploratory modeling effort already revealed that full oxygen penetration can occur in aggregates of 500 μm diameter starting from 1 mg o2 l 1 see figure a 1 c 1 oxygen inhibition of anaob has been described most extensively for marine systems as well as for some laboratory freshwater cultures a wide range of inhibitory values were reported for marine systems with 50 inhibitory concentrations ic50 ranging from 0 03 to 0 36 mg o2 l 1 see figure d 1 babbin et al 2014 dalsgaard et al 2014 jensen et al 2008 kalvelage et al 2011 the same holds for laboratory freshwater cultures of brocadia anammoxidans or kuenenia stuttgartiensis with complete inhibition reported at micro aerobic levels 0 04 0 12 mg o2 l

et al 2013 oshiki et al 2011 this variability in reported do inhibitory levels can be due to inter genera differences oshiki et al 2015 potential adaptation towards oxygen stress protection by oxygen consuming bacteria in small aggregates dalsgaard et al 2014 and testing procedures dalsgaard et al 2014 i e mixing aggregate size etc furthermore most studies done on fresh water cultures tested an one time exposure on anoxically enriched anaob potentially influencing kinetics carvajal arroyo et al 2013 egli et al 2001 lotti et al 2012 oshiki et al 2011 since anaob showed adaptation towards oxygen stress in their transcriptome yan et al 2012 tests with recurring oxygen exposure should be performed with anaob to mimic real operation conditions and obtain closer to application kinetics mathematical models have been widely used to study and optimize the pn a process under different conditions hao et al 2005 ni et al 2014 terada et al 2007 pérez et al 2014 the oxygen stress on anaob was a crucial factor for such modeling efforts influencing reactor performance e g by comparing different aeration patterns corbalá robles et al 2016 in this case oxygen inhibition was modeled by an instant recovery monod inhibition model henze et al 2000 this is in line with the experimental studies so far where almost all focused on activity loss during oxygen exposure which can be described by such model yet only two studies looked at recovery of activity after anoxic conditions were restored lotti et al 2012 strous et al 1997 both lotti et al 2012 and strous et al 1997 reported no loss of activity after exposure as both studies used thick granules with a diameter of 1 1 mm limited oxygen diffusion through the biofilm could have prevented oxygen inhibition on the other hand the low resolution of data i e 6 data points over a period of 2 h in the case of strous et al 1997 could have disguised short term recovery effects in this study the effect of do pulse concentration and length on anaob activity was mapped by dosing oxygen into an autotrophically fed anammox reactor ammonium profiles were measured online and converted to high resolution anaob activities by a newly developed data pipeline representative kinetic data were obtained by minimizing diffusional limitations by using flocs ø4 3 168 μm and by applying recurrent oxygen exposure as the experimental data did not fit the conventionally used instant recovery monod model a new model is proposed based on a more gradual recovery of anaob activity this model was used to assess the long term impact and implications of oxygen exposure in an anaob process model 2 material and methods 2 1 anammox reactor 2 1 1 inoculum for the reactor start up the goal was to obtain an inoculum rich in anaob with minimum diffusion limitations small particle size hereto the cyclone underflow fraction of a sidestream pn a treatment facility was sampled wwtp nieuwveer breda nl then the fraction highest in anaob was further selected by sieving this sludge over a 200 μm sieve assisted by adding tap water to minimize diffusional limitations the recovered sludge from the sieve was then blended 2 min in a kitchen blender and sieved again with reactor medium lacking in n substrate over a 200 μm sieve the blended floccular biomass was retained while unwanted larger in organic particles were removed 2 1 2 reactor set up and sbr operation the biomass was cultured in a 5 5 l anoxic sequencing batch reactor sbr and fed with a synthetic autotrophic medium with ammonium and nitrite as nitrogen sources in a 1 1 3 ratio the medium was made anoxic through n2 gas flushing had a ph of 7 2 and contained per l 0 5 g of nh4 n as nh4cl 0 65 g of no2 n as nano2 0 5 g nahco3 3 9 g hepes 0 1 g cacl2 2h2o 0 2 g mgso4 7h2o

cos61d sensor with a response time of 1s endress and hauser ch whereas ph ammonium and potassium were measured by an isemax cas40d sensor with response time 2 min endress and hauser ch the signals were sent to a liquiline cm448 endress and hauser ch which transmitted the signals to daqfactory software azeotech oregon usa this software controlled and monitored the reactor operation and measurements a typical sbr cycle was as follows 1 a new dose of influent 0 23 l over 4 min was given every time nitrite was depleted i e when ammonium was below a certain residual level and when the rate was below 40 mg n l 1 d 1 a residual ammonium level 5 mg n l 1 was chosen to ensure that nitrite was always the limiting substrate 2 similarly 3 additional doses were given raising the volume of the sbr from 4 25 to 5 17 l 3 after nitrite was depleted in the last spike biomass settled for 30 min 4 hereafter the effluent was pumped out over a period of 7 5 min and the cycle recommenced the volumetric ammonium removal activity of the reactor determined the influent flow rate fed to the system resulting in hydraulic retention times varying between 1 7 and 2 5 d over the course of the experiment 2 1 3 reactor conditions the reactor was operated for 120 days and the reactor conditions were chosen to induce stable and optimal operation with the added oxygen spikes as only disturbing factor 1 the reactor was kept anoxic by n2 gas flushing except during an oxygen spike and the change of headspace volume due to sbr cycling was compensated by a gas bag 2 ph was controlled at ph 7 2 by a 0 02 m hcl solution to compensate for the increase in ph from the anaob reaction and stripping when flushing with n2 gas under stable operation the control of ph had a maximum δph 0 05 no limitation for co2 was prevalent because the reactor was buffered well at ph 7 2 no large ph fluctuations 3 the reactor was located in a temperature controlled room at 20 c no thermostat was used the temperature was stable during all experiments avg standard deviation 0 1 c except for the experiment on day 18 t 21 5 0 8 where the measured activity was corrected with a temperature arrhenius coefficient θt 1 10 lotti et al 2014 4 salinity 43 mm nacl ammonium levels 5 40 mg n l 1 nitrite levels 0 35 mg n l 1 and nitrate levels 100 mg n l 1 were all kept well below reported inhibitory levels for the genus brocadia oshiki et al 2015 5 floccular sludge ø4 3 168 24 μm and fast stirring 200 rpm was used to minimize diffusional limitations fast stirring also ensured no biofilm growth on the reactor walls sludge was regularly taken out of the reactor for batch activity tests resulting in a stable biomass concentration of 1 95 0 08 g vss l 1 that showed an activity of 1184 188 mg nh4 g vss 1 d 1 over the course of the experiments 2 2 oxygen response curves in the reactor 2 2 1 experimental procedure two types of oxygen exposure experiments were executed one in presence and one in absence of nitrite during oxygen exposure ammonium was always present during exposure for the experiments in the presence of nitrite the oxygen was applied at the start of an sbr cycle after feeding oxygen was introduced with a syringe that added a certain volume of air in the bulk liquid the oxygen level was adjusted manually to the desired level over a period of 2 h by adding extra air in the headspace of the reactor after the oxygen exposure period the reactor was flushed with n2 gas to restore anoxic conditions and the recovery of anaob activity was monitored the experiments in absence of nitrite were executed in a similar way but n sources were supplied manually ammonium 25 mg nh4 n l 1 was supplemented before the oxygen spike and nitrite 32 5 mg no2 n l 1 was added when the do was below 0 02 mg o2 l 1 during flushing for both sets of experiments different oxygen concentrations c and exposure times t were applied see table 1 2 2 2 data processing from ammonium concentrations to removal rates datasets of the separate experiments were analyzed using python psf oregon usa several functionalities were implemented to obtain a reproducible workflow also conceptually explained in supplemental information figures f 1 and f 2 in short for each substrate doses in the sbr cycle the ammonium profile was monitored these online ammonium measurements were first filtered double ammonium values and measurement errors were removed in a next step a calculation window over which the slopes were calculated was selected manually this was done to remove the peak of substrate dose at the start and to remove the lower slopes due to nitrite limitation at the end within this calculation window a smaller δt value of 10 min was chosen to calculate a higher frequency of slopes from all the calculated slopes a response curve was constructed all code written for the data analysis along with an example jupyter notebook and example datasets are available online https zenodo org account settings github repository ugentbiomath 2017 highresolutionratecalculation 2 2 3 definitions for interpretation of the response curve different parameters were defined the activity lag phase was defined as the time before activity starts after oxygen exposure the initial recovery after oxygen inhibition was defined as the first rate calculated after oxygen was depleted the recovery time was calculated as the time between the initial recovery and the first timepoint when full recovery or steady state was observed i e when the relative change in average activity in the actual substrate spike compared to the previous substrate spike was 1 irreversible inhibition was calculated as the difference between steady state activity and activity prior to oxygen exposure 2 3 mathematical modeling a simple mathematical model was constructed in aquasim 2 1 g reichert 1998 to conceptually represent the gradual recovery phenomena that were observed in the experiments the model only included anaob biomass at a constant concentration x anaob during the simulation runs because the simulations and experiments ran only for 1 2 days no biomass growth was expected and was thus not accounted for influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations were 50 mg n l 1 and 60 mg n l 1 respectively the model was composed of a conventional monod type growth process and a decay process see tables g 1 and h 1 to represent a delayed recovery of the anaob activity the growth rate μ anaob was modeled as a state variable and was allowed to change depending on the specific conditions the differential equation eq 1 that defined the change of μ anaob over time was 1 d μ a n a o b d t k d μ a n a o b s o s o k o α μ m a n a o b μ a n a o b k o k o s o where k d is the deactivation constant of anaob under anoxic conditions used to set the minimum activity and α is an adaptation parameter of anaob to aerobic conditions the effect that is introduced by this equation can be linked to the deactivation of enzymes under aerobic conditions which are critical for anaob k d is representing the deactivation of these enzymes similarly to the model by kornaros et al 2010 and α the ability to adapt to environmental changes kornaros et al 2010 s o is the oxygen concentration imported experimental data and k o the oxygen inhibition concentration for anaob from literature to determine the unknown variables k d and α the parameter estimation function in aquasim was used employing the secant method reichert 1998 fitting the experimentally determined relative anaob activity to the relative activity calculated by the model the adapted gradual recovery monod type model with dynamic μ anaob was compared to the conventional instant recovery monod type model with a constant μ anaob model fits were compared based on χ2 the sum of the squares of the weighted deviations between measurements reichert 1998 and simulated model results eq 2 due to the lack of activity data during the oxygen exposure only the datapoints after the do peak starting with the first activity data point were used to calculate χ2 2 χ 2 p i 1 n y d a t a i y i p σ d a t a i 2 with y data i being the i th measurement σ data i the standard deviation y i p the calculated value of the model variable corresponding to the i th measurement and p p 1 p m the model parameters and n the number of data points to extrapolate the results to a process level the gradual recovery model was used to test intermittent aeration patterns of 30 min on off and 180 min on off at two different do set points of 0 2 and 1 2 mg o2 l 1 over a period of 5 days intermittent aeration until day 4 the parameters α and kd were both set to a value of 2 for this exercise 2 4 oxygen response in batch tests a batch activity test was executed to determine anaob activity after extreme oxygen stress conditions exposure to 8 mg o2 l 1 for 24 h in presence of 40 mg nh4 n l 1 flocs were taken from the reactor at day 114 and placed in a ph 7 2 corrected medium of 3 87 g hepes l 1 0 2 g cacl2x2h2o l 1 0 1 g mgso4x7h2o l 1 0 005 g na2hpo4x2h2o p l 1 0 5 g nahco3 l 1 40 mg nh4cl n l 1 and 1 ml l 1 trace elements solutions a and b table e 1 the schott bottles were put on a stirrer and exposed to the air for 24 h aerobic treatment reaching 8 mg o2 l 1 within the first hour the bottles were then flushed with n2 gas prior to substrate dosing control bottles anoxic control were not exposed to oxygen and flushed at the moment when the aerobic exposure time started 75 mg nh4cl n l 1 and 75 mg nano2 n l 1 were spiked at the beginning of the test concentrations of no2 no3 and nh4 were monitored over time volatile and total suspended solids vss and tss were measured to assess floccular sludge concentration to calculate biomass specific rates as mg n g vss 1 d 1 each test was performed in triplicate 2 5 physicochemical analyses offline nitrite and nitrate were measured with a 761 compact ic metrohm ch and nh4 with the nesslerization method greenberg et al 1992 to follow up biomass levels volatile and total suspended solids vss and tss were measured with standard methods 2540d and e greenberg et al 1992 the

al 2012 the sequencing data was analyzed in r using ggplot2 v0 9 3 1 to determine the community composition of the biomass in the reactor 3 results 3 1 microbial community enriched in ca brocadia over the experimental period the reactor community was enriched in one anaob otu of the genus ca brocadia from 64 day 38 to 75 day 106 based on 16s rdna amplicon sequencing see fig i 1 for more detailed community analysis as this anaob is commonly encountered in engineered systems it is anticipated that its response behavior to oxygen is applicable to pn a applications oshiki et al 2015 3 2 experimental oxygen response curves anaob responded differently towards tested combinations of oxygen concentrations exposure times and presence or absence of nitrite an overview of the experiments is given in table 1 while fig 1 depicts typical activity curves including modeling efforts the anaob response curve consisted of the following parts which will be described below anaob activity prior and during exposure an eventual activity lag phase initial recovery after exposure and gradual recovery with or without irreversible inhibition 3 2 1 anaob activity in presence of o2 during oxygen exposure no ammonium was consumed and anaob activity was only regained when oxygen concentrations were below micro aerobic conditions 0 02 mg o2 l 1 fig 1 panel c 2 and d 2 indicating a direct and high intolerance to oxygen 3 2 2 anaob activity lag phase after oxygen inhibition after oxygen disappearance anaob reversibly and immediately reinitiated activity to 55 80 of the pre exposure activity depending on the conditions during exposure this drop of initial recovery after oxygen inhibition was not due to substrate ammonium and nitrite starvation during exposure because longer anoxic periods without substrate did not result in activity loss in an ex situ batch test the effect of longer oxygen exposure 24 h at a higher oxygen concentration 8 mg o2 l 1 was tested fig 2 activity could be detected only after a 5 h lag phase and it increased gradually from 10 to 91 of the initial activity after 26 h under anoxic conditions 3 2 3 initial recovery after oxygen inhibition for the in situ reactor tests initial recovery after oxygen inhibition decreased from 81 3 to 74 5 when anaob were exposed to higher compared to lower oxygen concentrations in absence of nitrite on avg 0 47 0 08 vs 0 08 0 04 mg o2 l 1 fig 3 this increased drop in initial recovery could also be due to longer exposure times for the high do setpoint figure j 1 which were on avg 3 7 0 3 h vs 2 8 0 2 h for the low do setpoint a lower initial recovery after oxygen inhibition was also recorded when anaob were exposed to 0 5 0 2 mg o2 l 1 for 8 7 h in the presence of nitrite with a gradual recovery from 58 to full recovery after 37 h day 18 3 2 4 gradual recovery after exposure anaob gradually recovered towards a steady state activity this recovery time until steady state was similar for the low and high do setpoint and in the range of 4 2 6 8 h with on avg 6 3 0 9 h the recovery time also did not show any correlation with the concentration c figure j 1 exposure time t figure j 1 integrated cxt figure j 1 or initial recovery after oxygen inhibition anaob did not always fully recover see fig 2 panel c and fig 1 panel b and c and consistent irreversible loss of activity of about 5 was seen when the biomass was exposed to low oxygen setpoints of on avg 0 06 0 12 mg o2 l 1 in absence of nitrite a short 4 h exposure with a high do setpoint of on avg 1 mg o2 l 1 and in the presence of nitrite also led to more severe irreversible loss of activity of about 9 fig 1 panel c conversely the short term 3 h and long term 8 h exposures at do setpoints in a range of on avg 0 12 0 5 mg o2 l 1 with nitrite as well as the higher do setpoints of on avg 0 35 0 52 mg o2 l 1 in absence of nitrite did not reveal any irreversible inhibition this indicates that the complex interplay of oxidative and nitrosative o2 n species conditions combined with substrate presence might regulate how anaob cope with oxidative and nitrosative stress 3 3 modeling gradual recovery after oxygen inhibition a gradual recovery model was constructed to describe the gradual recovery after oxygen inhibition a comparison with the classical instant recovery model fig 1 and table 1 revealed a considerably improved fit of the gradual recovery model to the data than the instant recovery model evident from the 2 4 fold lower χ2 the newly developed gradual recovery model included a dynamic growth rate to simulate the delay in the recovery of the anaob activity fig 1 the automated fitting produced sometimes large variations and or standard errors for the parameters α and kd one reason is the high fluctuation of the measured activities during one sbr cycle of up to 10 another reason is the lack of data for the anaob activity during oxygen exposure to more accurately determine both parameters more data during initial oxygen exposure and shortly after oxygen depletion is necessary especially kd is highly influenced by the slope of loss and regain of the activity and the data does not allow for a highly accurate parameter estimation also visible from the standard deviations of kd since kd represents the deactivation of the anaob activity due to the oxygen higher kd values are required for bringing down the activity to zero during oxygen exposure the parameter α mainly formed the shape of the activity curve during recovery and with higher α values the recovery became faster table 1 process modeling was further used to estimate the impact of the newly observed oxygen response on a pn a this implied evaluating the impact of longer phases of intermittent aeration on the effluent composition of a continuously operated pn a reactor with simulations run over 5 days employing different aeration patterns see m m fig 4 summarizes the results of these simulations which were evaluated based on the nitrogen species in the effluent exemplarily plotting the ammonium concentration it was evident that the ammonium concentrations in the effluent as predicted by the gradual recovery model were higher than the ones predicted by the instant recovery model from the different conditions tested a less frequent oxygen alteration 180 180 on off rather than a higher oxygen level 1 2 vs 0 2 mg o2 l 1 yielded high peak ammonium concentrations earlier on these effects were caused by the decrease in the growth rate in the gradual recovery model fig 4 left row due to the imposed oxygen peaks this decrease in growth rate is influenced by α and k d which were set to 2 in this example leading to more severe effects for lower α values and ratios of α k d of 1 4 discussion 4 1 anaob inhibition by oxygen 4 1 1 anaob gradual recovery after oxygen inhibition to our knowledge this is the first report showing at high temporal resolution how anaob activity is affected by oxygen exposure anaob were completely inhibited by oxygen and after short exposure resumed activity directly with a gradual recovery until reversible activity was overcome other anoxic anaerobic bioconversions for instance by sulfate reducing bacteria or denitrifying bacteria which similarly to anaob rely on substrates derived from oxidative and reducing conditions at oxic and anoxic anaerobic interfaces responded kinetically similarly after oxygen exposure dolla et al 2006 fareleira et al 2003 kornaros and lyberatos 1998 anaob and other microbes living under recurrent oxygen exposure thus adapted towards these conditions with production of anti oxidative enzymes and recovery of activity after exposure which cannot be explained by growth dalsgaard et al 2014 yan et al 2012 the measured kinetic response is most likely overlooked so far because most studies investigated activity only during exposure in the scarce cases studying also recovery the outcome might have been biased due to lower data resolution after exposure i e 4 6 datapoints over a course of 2 6 h dalsgaard et al 2014 strous et al 1997 or aggregate size lotti et al 2012 strous et al 1997 for example strous et al 1997 reported no influence on biomass specific activity rates when a granular biomass brocadia was repeatedly exposed for 20 days to 2 h aerobic and anoxic conditions similarly lotti et al 2012 reported no loss in activity after an extreme oxygen exposure of 24 h and 5 mg o2 l 1 for granular biomass 1 1 mm in both cases diffusional limitations could have underestimated initial biomass specific activities and consequentially inhibition could be masked by this underestimation 4 1 2 factors impacting initial recovery after oxygen inhibition with the current dataset it was not feasible to deduct whether the oxygen concentration fig 2 or exposure time figure j 1 had a larger influence on the initial recovery as higher oxygen concentrations also had longer exposure times it was hypothesized that concentration times exposure time integrated cxt figure j 1 steered the anaob response but spearman rank correlation analysis did not yield any correlation from the gradual recovery model the exposure time had a higher influence than the concentration while other factors like adaptation and nitrite presence during exposure might differentiate the response and thus fitted kinetic parameters both aspects require further experimental research to elucidate the exact factors determining initial recovery after oxygen inhibition 4 1 3 novel experimental procedure and impact on measured kinetics in this study anaob responded very sensitive towards oxygen with an observed ic100 0 02 mg o2 l 1 or below this showed that diffusional limitations in rather large flocs of 200 μm or oxygen consumption by putative heterotrophs in the anaob satellite community did not shield anaob from oxygen anaob sensitivity towards oxygen was comparable with some freshwater anaob brocadia sp and kuenenia stuttgartiensis which were for 100 inhibited at micro aerobic conditions of 0 04 and 0 12 mg o2 l 1 respectively egli et al 2001 strous et al 1997 in contrast two brocadia enriched floccular sludge types were very tolerant towards oxygen exposure with ic50 values of 2 and 3 8 mg o2 l 1 respectively which cannot be explained when compared to our or other studies see figure d 1 carvajal arroyo et al 2013 oshiki et al 2011 also for marine anaob higher ic100 values between 0 09 and 0 64 mg o2 l 1 were reported babbin et al 2014 dalsgaard et al 2014 jensen et al 2008 kalvelage et al 2011 for the latter the difference between measured sensitivities was hypothesized to come from either different testing conditions i e absence of mixing or presence in aggregates shielding anaob partially from oxygen or from more adapted anaob due to presence in oxygen minimum zones dalsgaard et al 2014 as in our testing conditions anaob were repeatedly exposed to oxygen with low diffusional limitations the obtained data probably resembled intrinsic and more adapted kinetics the newly developed methodology which obtained high resolution data processed by a data pipeline is therefore highly suitable for studying kinetic responses of stressors and inhibitors on anaob 4 2 modeling anaob inhibition by oxygen in mathematical modeling oxygen inhibition of anaob has typically been modeled by an instant recovery monod model with an inhibition constant k o anaob of 0 01 mg l 1 based on strous et al 1998 with this kinetic constant 10 anaob activity is expected at 0 1 mg o2 l 1 which overestimated the expected activity of anaob during oxygen exposure in our experiments see fig 1 further fine tuning of this kinetic constant is thus necessary after oxygen exposure anaob directly resumed activity only in a range of 30 80 of the initial activity this direct recovery of activity was conventionally reported and perceived as reversible activity of anaob without any activity loss dalsgaard et al 2014 egli et al 2001 lotti et al 2012 strous et al 1997 instant recovery models therefore do not account for a delay in recovery to less than 100 while the newly developed gradual recovery model describes this more accurately gradual recovery has been previously modeled for several other nitrogen bio conversions alex et al 2009 and casasús et al 2005 introduced an enzyme as additional state variable and processes for its activation and deactivation to simulate bacterial lag phases for nitrification alex et al 2009 and denitrification casasús et al 2005 identically to our approach the nob lag phase after anoxic phases kornaros et al 2010 was successfully modeled with the growth rate as dynamic variable thus influencing the maximum specific growth rate the latter enabled to exploit these lag phenomena to optimize nob suppression in their reactors these examples show that incorporating additional equations may lead to more accurate models and further insights on how to optimally operate mainstream pn a additional research is needed however due to the limited amount of data especially during oxygen exposure to accurately estimate the newly introduced parameters α and k d independently furthermore other effects like exposure time oxidative stress conditions and adaptation could also impact the modeled parameters and should be taken into account in further modeling exercises 4 3 long term recurrent exposure exploratory simulations from a modeling perspective the exposure time is the critical parameter when looking at the implications on effluent quality fig 4 the simplified model showed that a delay in the recovery of full activity will potentially lead to a decrease of the overall turnover capacity of the system which is reflected in the effluent concentration exemplified by ammonium an instant recovery model where the activity is back to 100 right after oxygen depletion does not capture such a delay and will therefore not account for any impact this had on the reactor performance the model suggested that longer anoxic periods in combination with short intense aeration intervals might be the strategy of choice however the model in its present form does not account for other effects that might influence recovery such as adaptation yan et al 2012 niche differentiation oshiki et al 2015 aggregate morphology or nitrite availability which also seemed relevant from the experimental observations in practice also aerobic processes and mass transfer limitations partially shield anaob in biofilms from oxygen exposure for this reason increased anaob resilience was reported in biofilm systems compared to flocs e g lower nitrite build up was detected when nitrification and thus oxygen shielding failed due to sudden or long term disturbances in temperature drops gilbert et al 2015 wells et al 2017 however completely anoxic conditions might be hard to achieve and will also depend on the height of the oxygen peaks see figure in b 1 anaob recovery from oxygen inhibition will thus always be present in pn a reactors and studies on long term repeated exposure are warranted to achieve the process intensification i e maximize nitrogen removal rates and efficiencies 5 conclusions anaob reside mostly in proximity of oxygen in wastewater treatment processes such as pn a possibly experiencing repeated inhibition nonetheless it was not well understood how anaob activity is affected by oxygen stress a newly developed methodology which combined high temporal resolution measurements with a fit for use data pipeline enabled to study this and corroborate the findings with a newly developed mathematical model 1 anaob showed no activity during exposure 0 02 mg o2 l 1 due to oxygen inhibition anaob lost activity compared to pre exposure rates this initial loss in activity was followed by a gradual partial recovery of activity dependent on the oxidative or nitrosative stress conditions perceived during oxygen exposure 2 the initial recovery after oxygen inhibition was slower when exposed towards higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and contact times 3 exposure to low oxygen concentrations of 0 05 0 2 mg o2 l 1 did not result in full recovery 95 4 a new gradual recovery monod model described the gradual recovery more accurately than the current instant recovery model 5 long term simulated exposure with intermittent aeration and the gradual recovery model led to reduced anaob growth rates compared to an instant recovery model considering oxygen inhibition on anaob can thus be an important factor to optimize aeration patterns in single stage pn a reactors allowing to maximize nitrogen removal rates and efficiencies acknowledgements d s was supported by a phd grant from the institute for the promotion of

19386,knowledge of the dynamic changes in molecular size of natural colloidal organic matter com along the aquatic continuum is of vital importance for a better understanding of the environmental fate and ecological role of dissolved organic matter and associated contaminants in aquatic systems we report here the ph and cation dependent size variations of coms with different sources river and lake quantified using flow field flow fractionation fifff fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis parafac attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy and zeta potential analysis increasing ph caused a decline in molecular sizes and an obvious size transformation from the 10 kda to 5 10 kda and further to 1 5 kda size fraction whereas the opposite trend was observed for increasing cation e g ca2 and cu2 abundance compared with lakewater com the riverwater com exhibited a greater ph dependent dispersion but less extent in cation induced aggregation demonstrating that the dispersion and aggregation dynamics were highly dependent on com source and solution chemistry e g ph and cations based on atr ftir analysis the extensive dissolution of c o and c o functional groups resulted in a greater ph dependent dispersion for river com fluorescence titration revealed that despite their similar cation induced aggregation behavior the binding constants of all the parafac derived components for cu2 were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for ca2 logk m 4 54 5 45 vs 3 35 3 70 indicating a heterogeneous nature in cation dom interactions the greater extent of decline in zeta potential for lake com suggested a ca induced charge neutralization and aggregation mechanism however for cu induced aggregation chemical complexation was the predominant pathway for the river com with higher binding constants while charge neutralization and chemical complexation co induced the aggregation of lake com thus natural coms may have different environmental behavior along the aquatic continuum and further affect the fate and transport of contaminants in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords colloidal organic matter

schaumann 2014 kteeba et al 2017 yu et al 2017 as a sub fraction of dom pool the colloidal organic matter com with molecular size ranging from 1 kda to 0 45 μm plays a central role in regulating the biogeochemical processes of contaminants due to its high biological and chemical reactivity santschi et al 2002 alasonati et al 2010 benner and amon 2015 the presence of com can enhance the adsorption of many organic micropollutants kennedy and summers 2015 thus reducing the toxicity of the associated contaminants com also exhibited a higher binding affinity to metals and radionuclides than the low molecular size counterparts quigley et al 2002 chen et al 2013 further highlighting its potential in regulating the fate and transport of contaminants due to the particular environmental and ecological effect environmental com has received increasing attention in both pristine and contaminated aquatic environments as bioactive macromolecular assemblage com is a heterogeneous mixture and

different types of divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 however seemed to exhibit little heterogeneity in enhancing aggregation for natural dom xu et al 2016 however dom molecular sizes in previous studies were analyzed merely via dynamic light scattering and or cryogenic transmission electron microscopy lacking detailed information on continuous changes in size spectra in addition the heterogeneous response to chemical composition and zeta potential of coms with different sources which are of vital importance to the interpretation of molecular size distribution have not been well elucidated flow field flow fractionation fifff is an analytical technique in which colloids are separated based on diffusivity and thus their variations along the size continuum can be examined via the combination of a variety of detection systems alasonati et al 2010 stolpe et al 2010 due to its ability in continuous size analysis fifff has been widely applied to molecular size characterization

and sensitive techniques fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy have been used to track structural and composition changes of organic ligands ishii and boyer 2012 xu et al 2016 nevertheless studies combining these complimentary methods are still few and knowledge of continuous size variations of coms in response to external environmental perturbation remains scarce especially with an emphasis on the role of chemical composition and surface property in this study the fifff technique was used to trace dynamic changes of coms along the size continuum under changing environmental conditions related environmental factors including ph varying from 3 to 10 background cations ca2 0 3 mm and heavy metals cu2 0 100 μm were selected to examine ph and cation dependent aggregation and active size transformation coms from two different aquatic environments including river water and lake water were isolated via ultrafiltration and were used to examine the source related heterogeneity in ph and cation dependent aggregation and active size transformation spectral techniques including eem parafac and atr ftir were applied to reveal changes in structure and composition of different sized dom results reported here should provide new insights into our understanding of the environmental behavior fate and ecological role of coms in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and ultrafiltration the river water was collected in october 2016 from the milwaukee river 43 02 360 n 87 55 500 w which drains a basin area of 2285 km2 and empties into lake michigan the lake water was sampled in november 2016 from an open station 43 02 626 n 87 40 295 w from southwestern lake michigan one of the five laurentian great lakes large volumes of water samples were filtered in situ through a 0 45 μm nuclerpore cartridge filter cai et al 2015 the filtered water samples were then kept in ice inside a cooler and transported to the lab for further ultrafiltration com samples were isolated using a spiral wound 1 kda cartridge amicon s10y1 a teflon diaphragm pump head from cole parmer was equipped with teflon fittings and tubings to decrease sorptive losses and any possible contamination from the apparatus guo et al 2000 before ultrafiltration the cartridge was thoroughly cleaned with 1 2 micro detergent 0 05 m naoh and 0 02 m hcl respectively guo and santschi 1996 cai and guo 2009 about 20 l of river and lake water samples were used for ultrafiltration and the retentate after ultrafiltration was diluted to the initial water volume i e 20 l to obtain the com with an environmental relevant concentration 2 2 flow filed flow fractionation the flfff is an analytical technique that can provide simultaneous size separation and characterization of com when coupled with online detectors our asymmetrical flfff system af2000 postnova was equipped with a 0 3 kda polyether sulfone ultrafiltration membrane zhou and guo 2015 a mixed solution with 10 mm nacl aq and 5 mm h3bo3 aq and ph of 8 adjusted with naoh was used as the carrier solution two online fluorescence detectors rf20a shimadzu with ex em of 275 340 nm and 350 450 nm were used to detect the protein like and humic like dom components respectively the continuous size distributions of com samples were obtained by converting the retention time into diffusion coefficient and equivalent d h stolpe et al 2010 zhou et al 2016a for a mixture of molecules such as natural com the distribution of molecular weights is represented by parameters including weight averaged molecular weight mw number averaged molecular weight mn polydispersity ρ and diffusion coefficient d the signals from detectors were used for calculations using the following equations 1 m w i 1 n h i m i i 1 n h i 2 m n i 1 n h i i 1 n h i m i 3 p mw mn 4 d k t 3 π η d where h i and m i are the signal height and molar mass of corresponding components k is the boltzmann s constant t is absolute temperature and ղ is the viscosity of the carrier liquid 2 3 interactions between ca2 cu2 and com as characterized by eems stock solutions of ca2 and cu2 were prepared by dissolving analytical grade cacl2 and cucl2 in ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane xu et al 2016 titration experiments were carried out using an automatic syringe to examine the interactions between ca2 or cu2 and com by adding the stock solutions to a series of brown sealed vials which contained predetermined amounts of com solution ohno et al 2008 yamashita and jaffe 2008 the final concentrations of ca2 were 0 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 and 3 mm respectively and those of cu2 were 1 5 10 15 20 50 and 75 μm respectively the ph was maintained at 6 0 for cu2 and 7 0 for ca2 during titration under which no precipitate was formed based on the speciation analysis of visual minteq after metal addition all solution samples were shaken for 24 h at room temperature to ensure complexation equilibrium yamashita and jaffe 2008 fluorescence eem spectra were gathered by scanning em spectra from 240 to 600 nm at 2 nm increments by varying the ex wavelength from 220 to 480 nm at 5 nm increments on a spectrofluorometer horiba fluoromax 4 fluorescence indices including fluorescence index fix biological index bix and humification index hix were applied to characterize com optical properties parafac analysis was conducted in matlabr2013a mathworks natick ma using the domfluor toolbox http www models life ku dk detailed description about the parafac and fluorescence indices are described elsewhere stedmon and bro 2008 xu et al 2013a and are given briefly in the supporting information si the modified stern volmer equation was applied to calculate the binding potential between ca2 or cu2 and com 5 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k m c m 1 f where f and f 0 are the measured fluorescence intensity at metal concentration c m and the beginning of titration i e no metal addition respectively the parameters k m and f represents the conditional stability constant and the fraction of the initial spectral intensities which correspond to metal binding 2 4 ph dependent variations in com composition as determined by atr ftir to explore the ph dependent variations in com properties and molecular size solutions 200 ml each with various phs 3 10 were adjusted by adding diluted naoh or hcl and maintained for 24 h samples were then freeze dried to obtain powder samples for further atr ftir analysis the freeze dried samples were placed directly onto an atr crystal and performed on a thermo nicolet is50 ftir with a single bounce diamond smart itr cell xu et al 2013b the standard parameter for data collection was set at 64 scans with 1 cm 1 resolution 2 5 other measurements concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were measured on a shimadzu toc l analyzer equipped with an asi l autosampler uv vis absorption spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer agilent 8453 more detailed information on doc determination and optical parameters such as absorption coefficient a λ and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 can be found in the si zeta potentials of coms under each ph and cation concentration were measured via a malvern zetasizer nano zs uk at 25 1 c each experiment was performed in duplicate and the independent sample t test model was performed to examine the significance of differences between different sample sets 3 results and discussion 3 1 heterogeneity in chemical properties of coms concentrations of doc were 8 69 0 02 and 1 64 0 01 mg c l in the river and lake water samples respectively following ultrafiltration the doc concentration in the 1 kda ultrafiltrate was 3 40 0 11 mg l in the river sample and 0 79 0 03 mg l in the lake sample resulting in an apparent colloidal percentage of 61 1 for the river water and 52 2 for the lake water clearly river waters here in general contained higher com than the oligotrophic open lake water which were in agreement with previous studies lin and guo 2016 xu and guo 2017 the uv vis analysis showed that the intensity of doc normalized absorbance band for river com was generally higher than that for lake com along the whole wavelengths although they both decreased quasi exponentially with increasing wavelength fig 1 a the results indicated that the river com contained more aromatic substances as supported by its high suva254 value 5 94 0 03 l mg c 1 m 1 for river com vs 1 98 0 02 l mg c 1 m 1for lake com table s1 in the si similar to those observed for bulk water and size fractionated samples xu and guo 2017 fluorescence eem spectra fig 1b and c of the river com consisted predominantly of humic like peak a em ex 450 250 nm and fulvic like peak m em ex 430 320 nm substances while both protein like peak t em ex 320 280 nm and humic like peak a substances co existed in the lake com sample coble 1996 ishii and boyer 2012 fluorescence indices including hix and bix were compared to gage the inherent heterogeneity between the two coms table s1 in the si high hix but low bix values were measured for the river com sample indicating high abundance of humified organic substances but low in microbial derived dom osburn et al 2011 consistent with the results obtained by the uv vis analysis in comparison the lake com sample had a higher bix value but lower hix supporting their low terrestrial dom abundance and long water residence time zhou et al 2016b and lower suva values table s1 in the si in lake michigan thus com from the milwaukee river was characterized with higher aromaticity and predominance of highly humified terrestrial organic substances 3 2 ph dependent dynamic transformation in molecular sizes as determined by flow field flow fractionation since fifff separates macromolecules on the basis of diffusivity the molecules eluted from the channel are in the order of increasing size giddings 1993 worms et al 2010 pifer and fairey 2012 here the fifff fractograms showed that both the river and lake coms were characterized with a dominant peak with elution time ranging from 1 1 to 3 5 min and the central peak at 2 0 min fig 2 in addition the fractograms also had a shoulder band with an elution time 3 5 min demonstrating a broad size distribution pattern for the coms zhou et al 2016a as ph increased the intensity of the main peak increased while that of the shoulder band exhibited a slight decrease fig s1 in the si suggesting a decline in the concentration of large sized colloids but an increase in the abundance of small sized colloids with increasing ph another observation was that the peak width was gradually narrowed as ph increased showing a more uniform distribution of molecular sizes at higher ph therefore as the ph increased from acidic to alkaline zone the large sized colloids were disaggregated into the small sized colloids resulting in a more uniform size distribution quantitative calculation on the flfff fractograms showed that the lake com was characterized generally with higher mw and mn values than the river com under the same ph fig s2 and table s2 in the si the molecular size properties reported here for coms were in the same range as those obtained for colloids from other aquatic environments but significantly lower than those for soil coms table s3 in the si baalousha et al 2006 alasonati et al 2010 worms et al 2010 guéguen and cuss 2011 compared with river com the lake com contained more substances that were generally resistant to photochemical microbial transformation giving rise to its larger molecular size both the mw and mn decreased gradually with increasing ph although with different decline rates specifically within similar ph range from 3 0 to 10 2 the molecular size including mw and mn of the river com decreased by 12 17 while that of lake com reduced by 10 14 showing a higher disaggregation potential for river coms in addition a ph dependent decrease in ρ values but increase in d was observed for both com samples again indicating a reduction in molecular size and size distribution heterogeneity baalousha and lead 2007 worms et al 2010 although the ph dependent decrease in molecular size was generally observed fig 2a b more detailed investigation on the size distribution among different size fractions can reveal its dynamic process along the size continuum the coms herein were further fractionated into several size fractions including the 1 5 kda 5 10 kda 10 50 kda 50 100 kda and 100 kda 0 45 μm as shown in fig 3 the river com was characterized with higher percentages of small sized 1 5 kda 67 74 and medium sized 5 10 kda 16 19 colloids than the lake com 47 58 for the 1 5 kda and 11 14 for the 5 10 kda colloids while the opposite distribution pattern was observed for the large sized 10 kda colloids 1 5 for river com vs 14 20 for lake com consistent with the predominance of humic substances and lower abundance of protein like materials in the river water interestingly the overall colloidal abundance in the river water was higher than the lake water sample but the specific molecular size distribution among different colloidal size fractions was different between the two com samples this result is consistent with the difference in com sources between river and lake waters for example river water contained mostly terrestrial humic like dom with a molecular weight 10 kda aiken et al 2011 while the lake water contained less humic like but higher protein like dom components fig 1 thus higher percentages of the small and medium sized com fractions accounted for the relatively low mw and mn values for the river com table s2 in the si the distribution of molecular sizes observed here were similar to those in the wastewater and surface waters ph 6 0 7 5 ca2 0 11 0 52 mm that most of the com was located within the 1 6 kda range worms et al 2010 stolpe et al 2013 zhou et al 2016a or 1 10 kda guo and santschi 1997 while studies on the soil coms ph 7 2 ca2 1 mm showed a different distribution pattern that more than 30 of them was located in the 10 kda fraction marschner and bredow 2002 this suggests that molecular size distributions of com in natural environments are source specific and are regulated by chemical composition and water chemistry e g ph and cations with increasing ph the percentage of the 1 5 kda lower mw fraction increased while the percentage of the 5 10 kda fraction fluctuated but that of the 10 kda 0 7 μm larger sized fraction decreased showing obvious ph dependent dynamic variations among different colloidal size fractions with a shift toward the lower molecular size within the bulk com pool at higher ph when ph increased from acidic to alkaline the 10 kda large size colloids can be transformed disaggregated to the 5 10 kda and further to the 1 5 kda fraction causing a decline in apparent com molecular sizes fig s2 in the si 3 3 dynamic size transformation of coms induced by different metals 3 3 1 ca induced molecular size changes to investigate the influence of different metals on the size distribution ca2 and cu2 were used as model divalent metals unlike the impact of ph on the size distribution as characterized by fifff fractograms the intensities of the main peaks decreased after addition of ca2 fig 2c d indicating a decrease in the abundance of small sized com by comparisons the intensity of the shoulder bands showed a consistent increase with ca2 addition which suggested an increase in the large sized colloidal abundance the results demonstrated an active transformation of coms from the small sized colloidal pool to the large sized counterparts in the presence of ca2 as ca2 concentration increased the apparent molecular sizes including mw and mn values increased for both coms samples fig s2 and table s2 in the si showing evident ca induced colloidal aggregation although with different aggregation extents and the different increase extents of mw and mn between the river and lake coms indicated that the ca induced spatial conformation of coms was also source specific analysis on the variations in size distribution among different fractions showed that with increased ca2 concentration the percentage of the 1 5 kda and 5 10 kda fractions decreased but the percentage of the large size fraction e g 10 kda increased fig 3c d showing ca induced aggregation from small sized colloids to medium sized and further to large sized colloids furthermore the variation rates among these sub fractions were different for example as ca2 increased the percentage of the 1 5 kda fraction decreased gradually in the river com sample while the lake com exhibited an initial rapid decline followed by a slow decrease in the 1 5 kda colloids the difference suggested that the lake com contained nano colloids that are more sensitive to ca2 induced aggregation compared to the river com which would be due to its high percentages of medium and large sized colloids and or the lower background concentration of ca2 in the lake water based on the occurrence of negative estuaries in lake michigan basin lin and guo 2016 xu et al 2018 thus while the bulk d h was useful parameter wang et al 2013 xu et al 2016 our study here provided more detailed information that can be used to track the dynamic dispersion aggregation processes along the size continuum and to reveal the transformation heterogeneities in coms with different sources 3 3 2 influence of cu2 concentration on the size distribution of coms similar to the spectral change induced by ca2 increased cu2 concentration also resulted in an intensity decline in the main peak but increased intensity in the shoulder band fig 2e f indicating again an active transformation from small sized to large sized colloids cu2 as a representative of heavy metals was previously reported to bind with macromolecules via chemical complexation sheng et al 2013 which may not influence the dispersion aggregation of associated organic ligands our results however showed a cu induced colloidal aggregation as depicted by a consistent enhancement of both mw and mn values with increasing cu2 concentration fig s2 and table s2 in the si overall the increase extent of molecular sizes in the lake com 2 1 times in both mw and mn was higher than that in the river com 1 5 times in mw and 1 4 times in mn showing a higher sensitivity to cu2 addition in the lake com sample as also indicated by a higher reduction in d values table s2 in the si however ρ values did not show a clear trend between the two coms results of the colloidal size distribution demonstrated that the percentages of the 1 5 and 5 10 kda fractions decreased while those of large size colloids e g the 10 kda increased fig 3e f also indicating a cu induced aggregation from small to large sized colloids similar to the effect induced by ca2 overall although the cu2 and ca2 induced a similar enhancement in apparent molecular sizes mw and mn for both com samples the variation extent of spatial conformation was less extensive for ca2 addition compared to the effect from increased cu2 concentration 3 4 mechanisms for the heterogeneities in com molecular size changes 3 4 1 evidence from eem parafac and atr ftir results to elucidate cation dependent heterogeneity in molecular size variations eem parafac analysis was used to explore the interaction between ca2 or cu2 and coms since the river and lake coms had different eem contours fig 1 the parafac analysis was run separately for river and lake coms three independent components were identified for each com sample with detailed em ex locations and contours shown in fig s3 and table s4 in the si component 1 for river com rc1 was assigned as humic like component while rc2 and rc3 as fulvic like components ishii and boyer 2012 chen et al 2013 on the other hand the three major components for the lake com lc1 lc2 and lc3 were identified as the fulvic tyrosine and humic like components respectively pifer and fairey 2012 xu and guo 2017 variations in each fluorescent component in response to cu2 and ca2 addition are shown in fig 4 changes in intensity were related to metal types and dom component properties specifically both the ca2 and cu2 addition caused the fluorescent quenching for all river com components whereas compared with the fluorescent quenching for lc1 and lc3 the intensity of lc2 increased indicating different binding mechanisms between cations or metals and the river and lake coms as for the influence of metal types cu2 was characterized with a higher quenching extent compared to ca2 the result here was consistent with previous studies reporting a slight and great influence on the eem spectra of microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps with the addition of ca2 and hg2 sheng et al 2013 quantitative analysis based on the modified stern volmer equation showed that the binding constant logk m for cu2 ranged from 4 54 to 5 45 which were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for ca2 logk m 3 35 3 70 irrespective of difference in com sources table s5 in the si in addition the k m values of cu2 with lake com logk m 5 38 5 45 were about one order of magnitude higher than that with river com logk m 4 54 4 63 which are consistent with the higher cu induced aggregation efficiency the binding constants of cu2 or ca2 with coms obtained here were in the same range as those reported for other organic ligands such as sludge eps sheng et al 2013 algal exudates mcintyre and gueguen 2013 xu et al 2016 and compost and leaf litter extracts hur and lee 2011 he et al 2014 higher logk m values measured for lake com may be related to its high abundance in higher molecular weight com and diverse functional groups that favored the formation of strong metal binding chen et al 2013 compared with the chemical complexation mechanism for cu2 the relatively lower logk m for ca2 may indicate a main contribution of static neutralization binding of ca2 onto com surfaces sheng et al 2013 however despite a higher ca induced aggregation for lake com table s2 in the si the logk m values between the two coms showed no obvious difference e g 3 35 3 70 for river com and 3 47 3 51 for lake com the result indicated that in addition to chemical complexation other mechanisms also could account for the ca induced aggregation which will be discussed in the following section the f values of all parafac derived components ranged from 62 4 to 96 3 for cu2 and from 12 7 to 34 6 for ca2 respectively there were several interesting points on the metal and inter component differences in the f values first the f values of all components with cu2 were always higher than those with ca2 irrespective of differences in com sources indicating more functional sites for cu2 binding in addition to the high complexation potential this also accounted for the observation that the μm level of cu2 can induce the same size enhancement of coms as that from the mm level of ca2 table s2 in the si in addition the lake com was characterized with higher f values than river com for ca2 25 7 34 6 vs 12 7 17 3 while river com exhibited a more efficient participation than lake com for cu2 binding 92 96 vs 62 66 this indicated that compared to the difference in com sources e g river vs lake cation types exhibited a greater impact in regulating the participation of functional sites atr fiir was applied to elucidate ph induced variation heterogeneities in molecular sizes between river and lake coms fig 5 three main absorbance peaks with locations at 1620 1640 cm 1 c o stretching of amide quinone or ketones 1400 1410 cm 1 oh deformation c o stretching of phenolic oh or coo asymmetric stretching and 1040 1120 cm 1 c o stretching of polysaccharide or polysaccharide like substances wang et al 2012 xu et al 2016 respectively were observed for the two aquatic coms with increasing ph the atr fiir spectra exhibited different variations in both intensities and shapes specifically for the river com the intensities of peaks at 1620 1640 and 1040 1120 cm 1 decreased while those of peaks at 1400 1410 cm 1 increased fig s4 in the si indicating a considerable dissociation of amides and polysaccharide like substances meanwhile some new functional groups 1515 cm 1 aromatic c c stretching were gradually formed arising from the destruction of com molecules although the lake com exhibited similar ph dependent variations in peak intensities and patterns fig 5b the variation extent was much smaller compared to the river com more dissociation of organic functional groups c o c o was thus responsible for the greater ph dependent disaggregation efficiency for river com 3 4 2 evidence from zeta potential to further reveal the reason for the heterogeneities in size variations zeta potential was used here as a mater parameter when ca2 concentration increased the zeta potential of the complexes showed an initial decrease followed by stabilization especially for the lake com fig s5a in the si the changes in zeta potential indicated the concentration dependent mechanisms for com aggregation i e charge neutralization and electrical double layer interaction at low ca2 concentration but cation bridging at high concentration a similar zeta potential dependence has also been demonstrated by xu et al 2016 for macromolecule eps with charges exhibiting an initial sharp decrease and then a slight decrease with increasing ca2 concentration the greater extent of decline in zeta potential for the lake com was responsible for its higher ca induced aggregation table s2 in the si as for the cu2 addition the zeta potential of river com remained almost constant whereas those of lake com exhibited an obvious decrease fig s5b in the si such a difference suggested that chemical complexation was the main mechanism for cu induced size variations for river com while charge neutralization was also an important contributor in addition to chemical complexation for lake com aggregation the duple binding mechanism was responsible for the higher aggregation extent of lake com with increasing cu2 due to deprotonation of the ionizable functional groups such as carboxylic groups both the river and lake coms exhibited a continuous decline in zeta potential fig s5c in the si indicating that more negative charges were generated at higher ph values this enhanced the intermolecular repulsion and as a result caused the decline in apparent molecular size for the two coms e g mw and mn fig 2 and table s2 in the si 3 5 implications and significance the spatial conformation and size distribution of coms in natural waters were highly related to solution chemistry such as ph and ionic strength previous studies on the influence of environmental factors on the dispersion aggregation of aquatic colloids were mainly restricted to model standard materials e g suwannee river humic and fulvic acids as the surrogates lead et al 2000 wang et al 2013 this raises a question on the environmental representativeness of such model nom materials latter studies showed that the proportion of colloidal organic carbon increased with increasing ph in boreal surface waters vasyukova et al 2010 2012 but detailed ph and cation dependent variations in com size continuum have not been reported in the present study natural com samples with different sources river vs lake were obtained via ultrafiltration a physical separation technique without chemical modification compared to solid phase extraction or xad column techniques ambient ph 3 10 and ca2 0 3 mm and cu2 0 100 μm concentrations were used to examine the spatial conformation and structural variations with continuous size transformation quantified by fifff moreover the heterogeneities were elucidated based on results of chemical composition functional group and zeta potential to gain a better understanding of the environmental behavior and ecological role of coms in aquatic systems in addition it should be noted that interference of colloidal inorganic matters was no considered in this study due to their much lower mass concentrations as compared to coms our results clearly showed that the molecular sizes of com and its distribution along the size continuum changed consistently with varying ph and cation types concentrations figs 2 and 3 table s2 in the si thus when referring to the molecular size of coms it is important to specify the environmental condition otherwise any comparison between the molecular sizes of coms will lack environmental relevance or significance due to the highly ph and cation dependent molecular size variability in aquatic environments due to the multiple functional groups and binding sites organic ligands in aquatic systems can significantly influence the behavior and fate of heavy metals via ligand complexation aiken et al 2011 hur and lee 2011 chen et al 2013 philippe and schaumann 2014 we found that macromolecules with larger molecular size and diverse functional groups like lake com will exhibit greater potential in metal de toxicity due to their higher logk m with heavy metals e g cu2 the results can thus provide theoretical guidance for contaminant control and lake restoration heavy metals and contaminants in lake waters originate mainly from land lake interactions and river lake interface the most dynamic region where river water mixes with lake waters in addition to the high heavy metal concentration significant changes in the molecular size and chemical structure of com also take place in this region he et al 2016 xu et al 2018 this makes it possible to increase the binding of heavy metals in estuaries by manipulating the molecular sizes and chemical structures of coms addition manipulations such as the addition of microorganisms and or electrolytes which were reported previously hur et al 2009 xu et al 2016 and partially in this study table s2 in the si can also be considered our results also have implications for the explanation of field and experimental observations for example for ca induced aggregation of organic liagnds our results can explain how the percentage of coms increased with decreasing ionic strengths or conductivities xu et al 2018 in addition our results can be used to better characterize the quantity and quality of natural colloids in aquatic ecosystems based on colloidal measurements and environmental variables such as ph and cations 4 conclusions the hydrodynamic behaviors of coms from river and lake ecosystems under environmentally relevant conditions have been investigated using fifff combined with measurements in spectral properties organic functionalities and surface property zeta potential the dispersion aggregation behaviors of aquatic coms were highly related to com source and water chemistry e g ph and types of cations increasing ph resulted in further dispersion of com and size transformation from the 10 kda large colloids to 5 10 kda fraction and further to 1 5 kda small colloids whereas the opposite was true for the ca2 and cu2 induced colloidal size distributions river com exhibited a greater ph dependent dispersion but less cation induced aggregation than the lake com extensive functional group dissolution and negative charge production accounted for the greater ph dependent dispersion for river com the greater extent of decline in zeta potential charge neutralization for the lake com was responsible for its higher ca induced aggregation however as for the cu induced aggregation chemical complexation was the main mechanism for river com while charge neutralization and chemical complexation together induced the aggregation of lake com this study for the first time indicated significant ph and cation dependent variations in molecular sizes and linkage to dom structure and surface properties which can definitely enhance our understanding of the behavior and role of coms and macromolecular organic matter in natural and

19386,knowledge of the dynamic changes in molecular size of natural colloidal organic matter com along the aquatic continuum is of vital importance for a better understanding of the environmental fate and ecological role of dissolved organic matter and associated contaminants in aquatic systems we report here the ph and cation dependent size variations of coms with different sources river and lake quantified using flow field flow fractionation fifff fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis parafac attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy and zeta potential analysis increasing ph caused a decline in molecular sizes and an obvious size transformation from the 10 kda to 5 10 kda and further to 1 5 kda size fraction whereas the opposite trend was observed for increasing cation e g ca2 and cu2 abundance compared with lakewater com the riverwater com exhibited a greater ph dependent dispersion but less extent in cation induced aggregation demonstrating that the dispersion and aggregation dynamics were highly dependent on com source and solution chemistry e g ph and cations based on atr ftir analysis the extensive dissolution of c o and c o functional groups resulted in a greater ph dependent dispersion for river com fluorescence titration revealed that despite their similar cation induced aggregation behavior the binding constants of all the parafac derived components for cu2 were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for ca2 logk m 4 54 5 45 vs 3 35 3 70 indicating a heterogeneous nature in cation dom interactions the greater extent of decline in zeta potential for lake com suggested a ca induced charge neutralization and aggregation mechanism however for cu induced aggregation chemical complexation was the predominant pathway for the river com with higher binding constants while charge neutralization and chemical complexation co induced the aggregation of lake com thus natural coms may have different environmental behavior along the aquatic continuum and further affect the fate and transport of contaminants in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords colloidal organic matter molecular size continuum colloidal dispersion aggregation cations flow field flow fractionation 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom operationally defined as the fraction of organic matter passing through a microfilter with a given pore size e g 0 45 μm can significantly influence the chemical speciation toxicity and bioavailability of many contaminants aiken et al 2011 philippe and schaumann 2014 kteeba et al 2017 yu et al 2017 as a sub fraction of dom pool the colloidal organic matter com with molecular size ranging from 1 kda to 0 45 μm plays a central role in regulating the biogeochemical processes of contaminants due to its high biological and chemical reactivity santschi et al 2002 alasonati et al 2010 benner and amon 2015 the presence of com can enhance the adsorption of many organic micropollutants kennedy and summers 2015 thus reducing the toxicity of the associated contaminants com also exhibited a higher binding affinity to metals and radionuclides than the low molecular size counterparts quigley et al 2002 chen et al 2013 further highlighting its potential in regulating the fate and transport of contaminants due to the particular environmental and ecological effect environmental com has received increasing attention in both pristine and contaminated aquatic environments as bioactive macromolecular assemblage com is a heterogeneous mixture and covers a large range of molecular sizes stolpe et al 2010 guéguen and cuss 2011 the molecular size properties of com can be highly related to its sources e g allochthonous and autochthonous and water quality of the ambient environment e g ph ionic strength and cation recently impact of solution chemistry on the aggregation of organic ligands had been reported baalousha et al 2006 it was found that the hydrodynamic diameters d h of humic acid colloids remained constant in the presence of 60 mm of nacl but substaintially increased with the addition of divalent electrolytes 2 mm wang et al 2013 different types of divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 however seemed to exhibit little heterogeneity in enhancing aggregation for natural dom xu et al 2016 however dom molecular sizes in previous studies were analyzed merely via dynamic light scattering and or cryogenic transmission electron microscopy lacking detailed information on continuous changes in size spectra in addition the heterogeneous response to chemical composition and zeta potential of coms with different sources which are of vital importance to the interpretation of molecular size distribution have not been well elucidated flow field flow fractionation fifff is an analytical technique in which colloids are separated based on diffusivity and thus their variations along the size continuum can be examined via the combination of a variety of detection systems alasonati et al 2010 stolpe et al 2010 due to its ability in continuous size analysis fifff has been widely applied to molecular size characterization of natural organic matter nom in soil suspensions surface waters groundwater and wastewater gimbert et al 2005 alasonati et al 2010 stolpe et al 2010 lapworth et al 2013 zhou et al 2016a as effective and sensitive techniques fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy have been used to track structural and composition changes of organic ligands ishii and boyer 2012 xu et al 2016 nevertheless studies combining these complimentary methods are still few and knowledge of continuous size variations of coms in response to external environmental perturbation remains scarce especially with an emphasis on the role of chemical composition and surface property in this study the fifff technique was used to trace dynamic changes of coms along the size continuum under changing environmental conditions related environmental factors including ph varying from 3 to 10 background cations ca2 0 3 mm and heavy metals cu2 0 100 μm were selected to examine ph and cation dependent aggregation and active size transformation coms from two different aquatic environments including river water and lake water were isolated via ultrafiltration and were used to examine the source related heterogeneity in ph and cation dependent aggregation and active size transformation spectral techniques including eem parafac and atr ftir were applied to reveal changes in structure and composition of different sized dom results reported here should provide new insights into our understanding of the environmental behavior fate and ecological role of coms in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and ultrafiltration the river water was collected in october 2016 from the milwaukee river 43 02 360 n 87 55 500 w which drains a basin area of 2285 km2 and empties into lake michigan the lake water was sampled in november 2016 from an open station 43 02 626 n 87 40 295 w from southwestern lake michigan one of the five laurentian great lakes large volumes of water samples were filtered in situ through a 0 45 μm nuclerpore cartridge filter cai et al 2015 the filtered water samples were then kept in ice inside a cooler and transported to the lab for further ultrafiltration com samples were isolated using a spiral wound 1 kda cartridge amicon s10y1 a teflon diaphragm pump head from cole parmer was equipped with teflon fittings and tubings to decrease sorptive losses and any possible contamination from the apparatus guo et al 2000 before ultrafiltration the cartridge was thoroughly cleaned with 1 2 micro detergent 0 05 m naoh and 0 02 m hcl respectively guo and santschi 1996 cai and guo 2009 about 20 l of river and lake water samples were used for ultrafiltration and the retentate after ultrafiltration was diluted to the initial water volume i e 20 l to obtain the com with an environmental relevant concentration 2 2 flow filed flow fractionation the flfff is an analytical technique that can provide simultaneous size separation and characterization of com when coupled with online detectors our asymmetrical flfff system af2000 postnova was equipped with a 0 3 kda polyether sulfone ultrafiltration membrane zhou and guo 2015 a mixed solution with 10 mm nacl aq and 5 mm h3bo3 aq and ph of 8 adjusted with naoh was used as the carrier solution two online fluorescence detectors rf20a shimadzu with ex em of 275 340 nm and 350 450 nm were used to detect the protein like and humic like dom components respectively the continuous size distributions of com samples were obtained by converting the retention time into diffusion coefficient and equivalent d h stolpe et al 2010 zhou et al 2016a for a mixture of molecules such as natural com the distribution of molecular weights is represented by parameters including weight averaged molecular weight mw number averaged molecular weight mn polydispersity ρ and diffusion coefficient d the signals from detectors were used for calculations using the following equations 1 m w i 1 n h i m i i 1 n h i 2 m n i 1 n h i i 1 n h i m i 3 p mw mn 4 d k t 3 π η d where h i and m i are the signal height and molar mass of corresponding components k is the boltzmann s constant t is absolute temperature and ղ is the viscosity of the carrier liquid 2 3 interactions between ca2 cu2 and com as characterized by eems stock solutions of ca2 and cu2 were prepared by dissolving analytical grade cacl2 and cucl2 in ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane xu et al 2016 titration experiments were carried out using an automatic syringe to examine the interactions between ca2 or cu2 and com by adding the stock solutions to a series of brown sealed vials which contained predetermined amounts of com solution ohno et al 2008 yamashita and jaffe 2008 the final concentrations of ca2 were 0 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 and 3 mm respectively and those of cu2 were 1 5 10 15 20 50 and 75 μm respectively the ph was maintained at 6 0 for cu2 and 7 0 for ca2 during titration under which no precipitate was formed based on the speciation analysis of visual minteq after metal addition all solution samples were shaken for 24 h at room temperature to ensure complexation equilibrium yamashita and jaffe 2008 fluorescence eem spectra were gathered by scanning em spectra from 240 to 600 nm at 2 nm increments by varying the ex wavelength from 220 to 480 nm at 5 nm increments on a spectrofluorometer horiba fluoromax 4 fluorescence indices including fluorescence index fix biological index bix and humification index hix were applied to characterize com optical properties parafac analysis was conducted in matlabr2013a mathworks natick ma using the domfluor toolbox http www models life ku dk detailed description about the parafac and fluorescence indices are described elsewhere stedmon and bro 2008 xu et al 2013a and are given briefly in the supporting information si the modified stern volmer equation was applied to calculate the binding potential between ca2 or cu2 and com 5 f 0 f 0 f 1 f k m c m 1 f where f and f 0 are the measured fluorescence intensity at metal concentration c m and the beginning of titration i e no metal addition respectively the parameters k m and f represents the conditional stability constant and the fraction of the initial spectral intensities which correspond to metal binding 2 4 ph dependent variations in com composition as determined by atr ftir to explore the ph dependent variations in com properties and molecular size solutions 200 ml each with various phs 3 10 were adjusted by adding diluted naoh or hcl and maintained for 24 h samples were then freeze dried to obtain powder samples for further atr ftir analysis the freeze dried samples were placed directly onto an atr crystal and performed on a thermo nicolet is50 ftir with a single bounce diamond smart itr cell xu et al 2013b the standard parameter for data collection was set at 64 scans with 1 cm 1 resolution 2 5 other measurements concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were measured on a shimadzu toc l analyzer equipped with an asi l autosampler uv vis absorption spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer agilent 8453 more detailed information on doc determination and optical parameters such as absorption coefficient a λ and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 can be found in the si zeta potentials of coms under each ph and cation concentration were measured via a malvern zetasizer nano zs uk at 25 1 c each experiment was performed in duplicate and the independent sample t test model was performed to examine the significance of differences between different sample sets 3 results and discussion 3 1 heterogeneity in chemical properties of coms concentrations of doc were 8 69 0 02 and 1 64 0 01 mg c l in the river and lake water samples respectively following ultrafiltration the doc concentration in the 1 kda ultrafiltrate was 3 40 0 11 mg l in the river sample and 0 79 0 03 mg l in the lake sample resulting in an apparent colloidal percentage of 61 1 for the river water and 52 2 for the lake water clearly river waters here in general contained higher com than the oligotrophic open lake water which were in agreement with previous studies lin and guo 2016 xu and guo 2017 the uv vis analysis showed that the intensity of doc normalized absorbance band for river com was generally higher than that for lake com along the whole wavelengths although they both decreased quasi exponentially with increasing wavelength fig 1 a the results indicated that the river com contained more aromatic substances as supported by its high suva254 value 5 94 0 03 l mg c 1 m 1 for river com vs 1 98 0 02 l mg c 1 m 1for lake com table s1 in the si similar to those observed for bulk water and size fractionated samples xu and guo 2017 fluorescence eem spectra fig 1b and c of the river com consisted predominantly of humic like peak a em ex 450 250 nm and fulvic like peak m em ex 430 320 nm substances while both protein like peak t em ex 320 280 nm and humic like peak a substances co existed in the lake com sample coble 1996 ishii and boyer 2012 fluorescence indices including hix and bix were compared to gage the inherent heterogeneity between the two coms table s1 in the si high hix but low bix values were measured for the river com sample indicating high abundance of humified organic substances but low in microbial derived dom osburn et al 2011 consistent with the results obtained by the uv vis analysis in comparison the lake com sample had a higher bix value but lower hix supporting their low terrestrial dom abundance and long water residence time zhou et al 2016b and lower suva values table s1 in the si in lake michigan thus com from the milwaukee river was characterized with higher aromaticity and predominance of highly humified terrestrial organic substances 3 2 ph dependent dynamic transformation in molecular sizes as determined by flow field flow fractionation since fifff separates macromolecules on the basis of diffusivity the molecules eluted from the channel are in the order of increasing size giddings 1993 worms et al 2010 pifer and fairey 2012 here the fifff fractograms showed that both the river and lake coms were characterized with a dominant peak with elution time ranging from 1 1 to 3 5 min and the central peak at 2 0 min fig 2 in addition the fractograms also had a shoulder band with an elution time 3 5 min demonstrating a broad size distribution pattern for the coms zhou et al 2016a as ph increased the intensity of the main peak increased while that of the shoulder band exhibited a slight decrease fig s1 in the si suggesting a decline in the concentration of large sized colloids but an increase in the abundance of small sized colloids with increasing ph another observation was that the peak width was gradually narrowed as ph increased showing a more uniform distribution of molecular sizes at higher ph therefore as the ph increased from acidic to alkaline zone the large sized colloids were disaggregated into the small sized colloids resulting in a more uniform size distribution quantitative calculation on the flfff fractograms showed that the lake com was characterized generally with higher mw and mn values than the river com under the same ph fig s2 and table s2 in the si the molecular size properties reported here for coms were in the same range as those obtained for colloids from other aquatic environments but significantly lower than those for soil coms table s3 in the si baalousha et al 2006 alasonati et al 2010 worms et al 2010 guéguen and cuss 2011 compared with river com the lake com contained more substances that were generally resistant to photochemical microbial transformation giving rise to its larger molecular size both the mw and mn decreased gradually with increasing ph although with different decline rates specifically within similar ph range from 3 0 to 10 2 the molecular size including mw and mn of the river com decreased by 12 17 while that of lake com reduced by 10 14 showing a higher disaggregation potential for river coms in addition a ph dependent decrease in ρ values but increase in d was observed for both com samples again indicating a reduction in molecular size and size distribution heterogeneity baalousha and lead 2007 worms et al 2010 although the ph dependent decrease in molecular size was generally observed fig 2a b more detailed investigation on the size distribution among different size fractions can reveal its dynamic process along the size continuum the coms herein were further fractionated into several size fractions including the 1 5 kda 5 10 kda 10 50 kda 50 100 kda and 100 kda 0 45 μm as shown in fig 3 the river com was characterized with higher percentages of small sized 1 5 kda 67 74 and medium sized 5 10 kda 16 19 colloids than the lake com 47 58 for the 1 5 kda and 11 14 for the 5 10 kda colloids while the opposite distribution pattern was observed for the large sized 10 kda colloids 1 5 for river com vs 14 20 for lake com consistent with the predominance of humic substances and lower abundance of protein like materials in the river water interestingly the overall colloidal abundance in the river water was higher than the lake water sample but the specific molecular size distribution among different colloidal size fractions was different between the two com samples this result is consistent with the difference in com sources between river and lake waters for example river water contained mostly terrestrial humic like dom with a molecular weight 10 kda aiken et al 2011 while the lake water contained less humic like but higher protein like dom components fig 1 thus higher percentages of the small and medium sized com fractions accounted for the relatively low mw and mn values for the river com table s2 in the si the distribution of molecular sizes observed here were similar to those in the wastewater and surface waters ph 6 0 7 5 ca2 0 11 0 52 mm that most of the com was located within the 1 6 kda range worms et al 2010 stolpe et al 2013 zhou et al 2016a or 1 10 kda guo and santschi 1997 while studies on the soil coms ph 7 2 ca2 1 mm showed a different distribution pattern that more than 30 of them was located in the 10 kda fraction marschner and bredow 2002 this suggests that molecular size distributions of com in natural environments are source specific and are regulated by chemical composition and water chemistry e g ph and cations with increasing ph the percentage of the 1 5 kda lower mw fraction increased while the percentage of the 5 10 kda fraction fluctuated but that of the 10 kda 0 7 μm larger sized fraction decreased showing obvious ph dependent dynamic variations among different colloidal size fractions with a shift toward the lower molecular size within the bulk com pool at higher ph when ph increased from acidic to alkaline the 10 kda large size colloids can be transformed disaggregated to the 5 10 kda and further to the 1 5 kda fraction causing a decline in apparent com molecular sizes fig s2 in the si 3 3 dynamic size transformation of coms induced by different metals 3 3 1 ca induced molecular size changes to investigate the influence of different metals on the size distribution ca2 and cu2 were used as model divalent metals unlike the impact of ph on the size distribution as characterized by fifff fractograms the intensities of the main peaks decreased after addition of ca2 fig 2c d indicating a decrease in the abundance of small sized com by comparisons the intensity of the shoulder bands showed a consistent increase with ca2 addition which suggested an increase in the large sized colloidal abundance the results demonstrated an active transformation of coms from the small sized colloidal pool to the large sized counterparts in the presence of ca2 as ca2 concentration increased the apparent molecular sizes including mw and mn values increased for both coms samples fig s2 and table s2 in the si showing evident ca induced colloidal aggregation although with different aggregation extents and the different increase extents of mw and mn between the river and lake coms indicated that the ca induced spatial conformation of coms was also source specific analysis on the variations in size distribution among different fractions showed that with increased ca2 concentration the percentage of the 1 5 kda and 5 10 kda fractions decreased but the percentage of the large size fraction e g 10 kda increased fig 3c d showing ca induced aggregation from small sized colloids to medium sized and further to large sized colloids furthermore the variation rates among these sub fractions were different for example as ca2 increased the percentage of the 1 5 kda fraction decreased gradually in the river com sample while the lake com exhibited an initial rapid decline followed by a slow decrease in the 1 5 kda colloids the difference suggested that the lake com contained nano colloids that are more sensitive to ca2 induced aggregation compared to the river com which would be due to its high percentages of medium and large sized colloids and or the lower background concentration of ca2 in the lake water based on the occurrence of negative estuaries in lake michigan basin lin and guo 2016 xu et al 2018 thus while the bulk d h was useful parameter wang et al 2013 xu et al 2016 our study here provided more detailed information that can be used to track the dynamic dispersion aggregation processes along the size continuum and to reveal the transformation heterogeneities in coms with different sources 3 3 2 influence of cu2 concentration on the size distribution of coms similar to the spectral change induced by ca2 increased cu2 concentration also resulted in an intensity decline in the main peak but increased intensity in the shoulder band fig 2e f indicating again an active transformation from small sized to large sized colloids cu2 as a representative of heavy metals was previously reported to bind with macromolecules via chemical complexation sheng et al 2013 which may not influence the dispersion aggregation of associated organic ligands our results however showed a cu induced colloidal aggregation as depicted by a consistent enhancement of both mw and mn values with increasing cu2 concentration fig s2 and table s2 in the si overall the increase extent of molecular sizes in the lake com 2 1 times in both mw and mn was higher than that in the river com 1 5 times in mw and 1 4 times in mn showing a higher sensitivity to cu2 addition in the lake com sample as also indicated by a higher reduction in d values table s2 in the si however ρ values did not show a clear trend between the two coms results of the colloidal size distribution demonstrated that the percentages of the 1 5 and 5 10 kda fractions decreased while those of large size colloids e g the 10 kda increased fig 3e f also indicating a cu induced aggregation from small to large sized colloids similar to the effect induced by ca2 overall although the cu2 and ca2 induced a similar enhancement in apparent molecular sizes mw and mn for both com samples the variation extent of spatial conformation was less extensive for ca2 addition compared to the effect from increased cu2 concentration 3 4 mechanisms for the heterogeneities in com molecular size changes 3 4 1 evidence from eem parafac and atr ftir results to elucidate cation dependent heterogeneity in molecular size variations eem parafac analysis was used to explore the interaction between ca2 or cu2 and coms since the river and lake coms had different eem contours fig 1 the parafac analysis was run separately for river and lake coms three independent components were identified for each com sample with detailed em ex locations and contours shown in fig s3 and table s4 in the si component 1 for river com rc1 was assigned as humic like component while rc2 and rc3 as fulvic like components ishii and boyer 2012 chen et al 2013 on the other hand the three major components for the lake com lc1 lc2 and lc3 were identified as the fulvic tyrosine and humic like components respectively pifer and fairey 2012 xu and guo 2017 variations in each fluorescent component in response to cu2 and ca2 addition are shown in fig 4 changes in intensity were related to metal types and dom component properties specifically both the ca2 and cu2 addition caused the fluorescent quenching for all river com components whereas compared with the fluorescent quenching for lc1 and lc3 the intensity of lc2 increased indicating different binding mechanisms between cations or metals and the river and lake coms as for the influence of metal types cu2 was characterized with a higher quenching extent compared to ca2 the result here was consistent with previous studies reporting a slight and great influence on the eem spectra of microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps with the addition of ca2 and hg2 sheng et al 2013 quantitative analysis based on the modified stern volmer equation showed that the binding constant logk m for cu2 ranged from 4 54 to 5 45 which were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for ca2 logk m 3 35 3 70 irrespective of difference in com sources table s5 in the si in addition the k m values of cu2 with lake com logk m 5 38 5 45 were about one order of magnitude higher than that with river com logk m 4 54 4 63 which are consistent with the higher cu induced aggregation efficiency the binding constants of cu2 or ca2 with coms obtained here were in the same range as those reported for other organic ligands such as sludge eps sheng et al 2013 algal exudates mcintyre and gueguen 2013 xu et al 2016 and compost and leaf litter extracts hur and lee 2011 he et al 2014 higher logk m values measured for lake com may be related to its high abundance in higher molecular weight com and diverse functional groups that favored the formation of strong metal binding chen et al 2013 compared with the chemical complexation mechanism for cu2 the relatively lower logk m for ca2 may indicate a main contribution of static neutralization binding of ca2 onto com surfaces sheng et al 2013 however despite a higher ca induced aggregation for lake com table s2 in the si the logk m values between the two coms showed no obvious difference e g 3 35 3 70 for river com and 3 47 3 51 for lake com the result indicated that in addition to chemical complexation other mechanisms also could account for the ca induced aggregation which will be discussed in the following section the f values of all parafac derived components ranged from 62 4 to 96 3 for cu2 and from 12 7 to 34 6 for ca2 respectively there were several interesting points on the metal and inter component differences in the f values first the f values of all components with cu2 were always higher than those with ca2 irrespective of differences in com sources indicating more functional sites for cu2 binding in addition to the high complexation potential this also accounted for the observation that the μm level of cu2 can induce the same size enhancement of coms as that from the mm level of ca2 table s2 in the si in addition the lake com was characterized with higher f values than river com for ca2 25 7 34 6 vs 12 7 17 3 while river com exhibited a more efficient participation than lake com for cu2 binding 92 96 vs 62 66 this indicated that compared to the difference in com sources e g river vs lake cation types exhibited a greater impact in regulating the participation of functional sites atr fiir was applied to elucidate ph induced variation heterogeneities in molecular sizes between river and lake coms fig 5 three main absorbance peaks with locations at 1620 1640 cm 1 c o stretching of amide quinone or ketones 1400 1410 cm 1 oh deformation c o stretching of phenolic oh or coo asymmetric stretching and 1040 1120 cm 1 c o stretching of polysaccharide or polysaccharide like substances wang et al 2012 xu et al 2016 respectively were observed for the two aquatic coms with increasing ph the atr fiir spectra exhibited different variations in both intensities and shapes specifically for the river com the intensities of peaks at 1620 1640 and 1040 1120 cm 1 decreased while those of peaks at 1400 1410 cm 1 increased fig s4 in the si indicating a considerable dissociation of amides and polysaccharide like substances meanwhile some new functional groups 1515 cm 1 aromatic c c stretching were gradually formed arising from the destruction of com molecules although the lake com exhibited similar ph dependent variations in peak intensities and patterns fig 5b the variation extent was much smaller compared to the river com more dissociation of organic functional groups c o c o was thus responsible for the greater ph dependent disaggregation efficiency for river com 3 4 2 evidence from zeta potential to further reveal the reason for the heterogeneities in size variations zeta potential was used here as a mater parameter when ca2 concentration increased the zeta potential of the complexes showed an initial decrease followed by stabilization especially for the lake com fig s5a in the si the changes in zeta potential indicated the concentration dependent mechanisms for com aggregation i e charge neutralization and electrical double layer interaction at low ca2 concentration but cation bridging at high concentration a similar zeta potential dependence has also been demonstrated by xu et al 2016 for macromolecule eps with charges exhibiting an initial sharp decrease and then a slight decrease with increasing ca2 concentration the greater extent of decline in zeta potential for the lake com was responsible for its higher ca induced aggregation table s2 in the si as for the cu2 addition the zeta potential of river com remained almost constant whereas those of lake com exhibited an obvious decrease fig s5b in the si such a difference suggested that chemical complexation was the main mechanism for cu induced size variations for river com while charge neutralization was also an important contributor in addition to chemical complexation for lake com aggregation the duple binding mechanism was responsible for the higher aggregation extent of lake com with increasing cu2 due to deprotonation of the ionizable functional groups such as carboxylic groups both the river and lake coms exhibited a continuous decline in zeta potential fig s5c in the si indicating that more negative charges were generated at higher ph values this enhanced the intermolecular repulsion and as a result caused the decline in apparent molecular size for the two coms e g mw and mn fig 2 and table s2 in the si 3 5 implications and significance the spatial conformation and size distribution of coms in natural waters were highly related to solution chemistry such as ph and ionic strength previous studies on the influence of environmental factors on the dispersion aggregation of aquatic colloids were mainly restricted to model standard materials e g suwannee river humic and fulvic acids as the surrogates lead et al 2000 wang et al 2013 this raises a question on the environmental representativeness of such model nom materials latter studies showed that the proportion of colloidal organic carbon increased with increasing ph in boreal surface waters vasyukova et al 2010 2012 but detailed ph and cation dependent variations in com size continuum have not been reported in the present study natural com samples with different sources river vs lake were obtained via ultrafiltration a physical separation technique without chemical modification compared to solid phase extraction or xad column techniques ambient ph 3 10 and ca2 0 3 mm and cu2 0 100 μm concentrations were used to examine the spatial conformation and structural variations with continuous size transformation quantified by fifff moreover the heterogeneities were elucidated based on results of chemical composition functional group and zeta potential to gain a better understanding of the environmental behavior and ecological role of coms in aquatic systems in addition it should be noted that interference of colloidal inorganic matters was no considered in this study due to their much lower mass concentrations as compared to coms our results clearly showed that the molecular sizes of com and its distribution along the size continuum changed consistently with varying ph and cation types concentrations figs 2 and 3 table s2 in the si thus when referring to the molecular size of coms it is important to specify the environmental condition otherwise any comparison between the molecular sizes of coms will lack environmental relevance or significance due to the highly ph and cation dependent molecular size variability in aquatic environments due to the multiple functional groups and binding sites organic ligands in aquatic systems can significantly influence the behavior and fate of heavy metals via ligand complexation aiken et al 2011 hur and lee 2011 chen et al 2013 philippe and schaumann 2014 we found that macromolecules with larger molecular size and diverse functional groups like lake com will exhibit greater potential in metal de toxicity due to their higher logk m with heavy metals e g cu2 the results can thus provide theoretical guidance for contaminant control and lake restoration heavy metals and contaminants in lake waters originate mainly from land lake interactions and river lake interface the most dynamic region where river water mixes with lake waters in addition to the high heavy metal concentration significant changes in the molecular size and chemical structure of com also take place in this region he et al 2016 xu et al 2018 this makes it possible to increase the binding of heavy metals in estuaries by manipulating the molecular sizes and chemical structures of coms addition manipulations such as the addition of microorganisms and or electrolytes which were reported previously hur et al 2009 xu et al 2016 and partially in this study table s2 in the si can also be considered our results also have implications for the explanation of field and experimental observations for example for ca induced aggregation of organic liagnds our results can explain how the percentage of coms increased with decreasing ionic strengths or conductivities xu et al 2018 in addition our results can be used to better characterize the quantity and quality of natural colloids in aquatic ecosystems based on colloidal measurements and environmental variables such as ph and cations 4 conclusions the hydrodynamic behaviors of coms from river and lake ecosystems under environmentally relevant conditions have been investigated using fifff combined with measurements in spectral properties organic functionalities and surface property zeta potential the dispersion aggregation behaviors of aquatic coms were highly related to com source and water chemistry e g ph and types of cations increasing ph resulted in further dispersion of com and size transformation from the 10 kda large colloids to 5 10 kda fraction and further to 1 5 kda small colloids whereas the opposite was true for the ca2 and cu2 induced colloidal size distributions river com exhibited a greater ph dependent dispersion but less cation induced aggregation than the lake com extensive functional group dissolution and negative charge production accounted for the greater ph dependent dispersion for river com the greater extent of decline in zeta potential charge neutralization for the lake com was responsible for its higher ca induced aggregation however as for the cu induced aggregation chemical complexation was the main mechanism for river com while charge neutralization and chemical complexation together induced the aggregation of lake com this study for the first time indicated significant ph and cation dependent variations in molecular sizes and linkage to dom structure and surface properties which can definitely enhance our understanding of the behavior and role of coms and macromolecular organic matter in natural and

achieve complete disinfection of the process liquid and the disinfected liquid retains color and chemical oxygen demand cod in excess of local discharge standards negatively impacting user acceptability granular activated carbon gac efficiently reduces cod in concentrated wastewaters we hypothesized that reduction of cod with gac prior to electrochemical treatment would both improve

to achieve full disinfection with improved energy efficiency and liquid quality more suitable for onsite reuse and or discharge keywords sanitation water reuse activated carbon chemical oxygen demand electrochemical disinfection 1 introduction this study is a part of an ongoing project to address the needs of over a third of the world s population that lack access to improved sanitation inadequate sanitation leads to the spread of diarrheal diseases resulting in the death of over 530 000 children under the age of five every year who 2017 in addition to tremendous economic costs and unrealized economic benefits hutton 2013 typical centralized water and wastewater infrastructures are prohibitively expensive to build and maintain in developing areas dodane et al 2012 therefore novel approaches for affordable and reliable on site treatment of human waste are essential to combat these negative health and economic impacts our team led by the duke university center for water sanitation hygiene and infectious disease wash aid is developing a toilet that converts human waste into burnable fuel stored energy and disinfected water suitable for non potable reuse and or discharge the project s ultimate goal is to operate this unit without piped in water a sewer connection or outside electricity to deliver a system that can meet these goals the liquid must be treated to at least surface discharge standards and must be aesthetically acceptable for the intended reuse purpose our liquid treatment system utilizes a solids separation mechanism and settling tanks to achieve up to 86 removal of total suspended solids tss and an electrochemical process that presently requires 48 93 kj l 13 26 kwh m3 to achieve complete disinfection hawkins et al 2017 2018 sellgren et al 2017 we have hypothesized that the high energy requirement for disinfection is likely attributable to the soluble and suspended chemical oxygen demand cod in the process liquid hawkins et al 2018 in addition the treated liquid maintains sufficient color and odor to require a further polishing step surveys from field testing of a prototype unit at cept university in ahmedabad india confirmed that users were dissatisfied with color and odor of the disinfected liquid recycled for flushing elledge et al unpublished results this paper focuses on the development and testing of a granular activated carbon gac module to integrate into the liquid treatment system with the goal of mitigating both the energy budget and user acceptability issues gac has been widely used in wastewater treatment for removal of organic contaminants pollard et al 1992 tchobanoglous et al 2003 the high surface area to volume ratios of the material facilitate high efficiency removal of organic and inorganic compounds through adsorption packed bed column filters with gac as the media allow oxygenation and promote adsorption of inorganics biological degradation of organic contaminants and have high resource recovery potential forbis stokes et al 2018 huggins et al 2016 here we demonstrate that combining gac packed bed column filters with electrochemical disinfection reduces the overall energy requirements from 70 12 to 20 9 kj l for disinfection and significantly improves water quality parameters critical to achieving user acceptance of the reused liquid in our system 2 materials and methods 2 1 blackwater production and electrochemical treatment blackwater was obtained from a prototype toilet and liquid disinfection system which has been described in detail previously hawkins et al 2017 sellgren et al 2017 procedures for collection of urine and feces from healthy volunteers were approved by the institutional review board at rti international samples were flushed into the prototype toilet initially charged with tap water for flush liquid at rates intended to approximate estimated average per person urine and fecal production rates of 1 5 l and 130 g per day respectively rose et al 2015 total urine volumes σv urine and fecal masses σm feces flushed were therefore used to calculate user day equivalents ude which were used to index data collected to the estimated usage of the system from startup with tap water 1 u d e v u r i n e 1 5 l m f e c e s 130 g 2 under normal operation 30 l batches of blackwater were disinfected by an electrochemical process using a commercially available electrochemical cell hayward salt swim 3c as previously described in detail sellgren et al 2017 hawkins et al 2017 alternatively untreated blackwater was taken from the system for smaller scale pilot experiments with gac see below disinfected blackwater was recycled through the system as flush liquid for subsequent flush cycles and excess processed liquid was discharged 2 2 granular activated carbon aquacarb 830 an 8 30 mesh sized gac derived from bituminous coal evoqua pittsburgh pa was used for all studies described herein the apparatus used for bench scale proof of concept studies consisted of a transparent section of pvc pipe 10 2 cm 4 in in diameter by 1 23 m 4 ft in length fig 1 a a 0 95 cm 3 8 in ball valve was threaded through a 10 2 cm 4 in end cap to serve as an outlet and a 40 mesh was affixed inside the cap to support the filter media the cap with the valve and mesh was then affixed to one end of the pipe with pvc cement the pipe was mounted vertically to a stand with the outlet facing downward and 5 l 2 3 kg of pre washed gac were poured into the column water was flushed through the column until no fines were observed coming out of the outlet prior to beginning blackwater studies for bench scale proof of concept studies 8 l batches of blackwater were taken from the prototype liquid treatment system and placed in a reservoir pumped to the top of the column through a diffuser to distribute flow across the top surface and aerate at approximately 120 ml min a tube was run from the outlet back to the reservoir enabling continuous recirculation the gac empty bed residence time ebrt was 0 69 h under this pumping regimen following at least 24 h gac treatment the blackwater was then electrochemically treated by placing an electrochemical cell the same model used in the prototype system in the reservoir and applying 24 vdc for up to 90 min for control con experiments blackwater was electrochemically treated without being run through the gac filter for studies that integrated gac treatment into the existing liquid treatment system fig 1b two columns were constructed out of the same materials as above and each were filled with 8 l 3 6 kg of gac a manifold recirculation circuit was run between the columns and the pre process tank and the filters were run in the same manner as described above in addition overflow outlets were run from the top of the columns back into the pre process tank for the final set of studies an identical system was also added to the post process holding tank 2 3 water quality measurements conductivity was measured with a myron l 6pfce ultrameter ii myron l company carlsbad ca cod was measured with a hach dr 900 colorimeter using the reactor digestion method hach method 8000 and a hach drb200 reactor hach loveland co turbidity was measured with a hach 2100q is total solids ts were determined by the epa method epa 2001 total suspended solids tss were determined using standard method 2540d color was measured with a hach co 1 test kit 2 4 microbial enumeration disinfection efficacy was determined by using the most probable number mpn method and the energy required to achieve the desired threshold of disinfection mpn 5 ml was determined by interpolating the plot of log mpn versus e n as previously described hawkins et al 2017 2 5 data analysis electrochemical energy per volume of process liquid used at time n e n was calculated by 2 e n v 0 n i t d t v where v is the voltage i is the current through the electrochemical cell measured with a mastech ms2138r ac dc clamp meter and ν is the volume being treated the integral of current with time was estimated by the trapezoid method statistical calculations were performed with graphpad prism v7 04 3 results and discussion 3 1 benchtop study to first understand the performance of the gac filters 8 l batches of blackwater were circulated through a 5 l gac filter for at least 24 h the 8 l batches were subsequently processed with the electrochemical cell to determine disinfection energy required as compared to controls blackwater from the same batches without gac treatment gac treatment reduced cod from 1732 282 to 590 407 mg l and color from 1560 134 to 770 432 pt co units prior to electrochemical treatment fig 2 a and b gac pretreatment also resulted in an increase in the free chlorine production rate from 0 26 0 02 to 0 68 0 05 mg l min fig 2c and a decrease in energy required to achieve a 6 log unit reduction in bacteria from 88 to 43 kj l with the electrochemical process fig 2d as previously discussed hawkins et al 2018 most of the cod present in these tests would be in the soluble or suspended form as most of the particulate cod is removed in settling tanks preceding these tests these data support the hypothesis that reducing the soluble cod can reduce the disinfection energy required for an electrochemical process 3 2 integrated system studies based on these positive initial results the gac filters were integrated into the operational prototype toilet fig 1b this was accomplished by circulating the blackwater from the pre process tank following the settling tanks through a pair of gac filters prior to electrochemical processing which occurs in 30 l net batches these pre treatment gac filters were added to the system after 40 ude to test performance under steady state conditions data from a previous study hawkins et al 2018 conducted in the same system prior to gac installation were used as control data for comparison fig 3 shows that the addition of the pre treatment gac filters had significant impacts on the quality of liquid prior to electrochemical treatment most notably the cod was consistently reduced compared to the previous system run without gac and the color was reduced from 1500 pt co units to an average of 228 pt co units while this meets the targeted discharge standard for color 300 pt co units tamil nadu pollution control board 2013 the cod remained over 1000 mg l which is well over the target surface discharge limit of 250 mg l ministry of environment forests india 1986 in an effort to reach discharge standards an additional pair of gac filters were added to circulate the liquid in the holding tank post electrochemical treatment prior to reuse for flushing fig 1b further we tested the addition of this polishing unit from startup of the system settling tanks and flush cistern initially charged with tap water the results of these tests are highlighted in fig 4 comparisons of all parameters in the process tank during the same window of ude 40 120 among systems without gac with pre process gac only and with pre and post process gac units are shown in table 1 all parameters measured trended downward with the addition of the post process gac unit though the differences were only statistically significant in the cases of conductivity ts color and initial mpn mpn0 3 3 cod removal and disposition cod concentrations were tracked in the supernatant fraction of the settling tanks as well as the pre process and holding tanks throughout the testing of the system with pre and post process gac units over seven weeks of continuous testing fig 5 a cod removal rates were calculated in each component of the system table 2 and the removal rates noted for the gac filters compare favorably with cod removal rates for gac previously reported 0 24 0 01 kgcod mgac 3 d 1 huggins et al 2016 we estimated the cumulative mass of cod flushed into the system based on the average cod we measured in our pooled urine donations 6000 mg l the median daily per capita fecal mass and fecal cod reported by rose 130 g and 71 g respectively and the typical removal of solids from our liquid waste stream by our solid liquid separator 90 of wet weight thus 3 e s t i m a t e d c u m u l a t i v e c o d m g 6000 m g l x v u r i n e 71 000 m g 130 g x m f e c e s x 0 1 using this method we estimated that 1543 g of cod were flushed into the system in total fig 5a cod was not routinely measured in the settled sludge beds because of the need to leave these undisturbed for proper function and difficulty of access for sampling however we know from periodic measurements up to 30 000 mg l cod that a substantial portion of the cod was associated with particles settled in the sludge beds levine et al 1985 reviewed particle size distributions psd of cod in municipal wastewater streams and found that 34 of the cod was in readily settled particles another psd study by hocaoglu and orhon 2013 of blackwater a more similar waste stream to our own reported that 62 of the cod was found in particles larger than 1 2 μm these investigators also looked at the psd within the settled fraction of their blackwater and found that the settled fraction included particles significantly smaller than the generally accepted threshold for settling 100 μm down to 10 μm likely due to aggregation and co precipitation with larger particles thus it is reasonable to estimate that between 30 and 50 of the cod flushed into our system remained in the settled sludge using the removal rates in table 2 we estimated that at least 16 247 g of cod was removed by the gac filters in the pre process tank whereas only 2 could be attributed to the gac filters in the post treatment holding tank given the total amount of gac in the filters on the pre process tank was 7 2 kg this indicates that the adsorption capacity of this material is at least 34 g cod kg gac though it is likely higher given that the filters were still removing cod from the process liquid at the end of the study this is in agreement with the total cod adsorption capacity of coal based gac in wastewater containing 1200 mg l cod similar to peak concentrations in our pre process tank see fig 5a recently reported at 48 g kg huggins et al 2016 an estimated 6 was removed from the supernatant fraction in the settling tanks while 9 remained in the liquid system at the end of testing most impressively only 3 of the cod flushed into the system was discharged during regular operation over a seven week trial period taken together we can account for 36 of the total cod in the liquid fractions and between 30 and 50 in the settled sludge leaving between 14 and 34 not readily accounted for fig 5b note however that the estimated cod removals by each gac system are conservative and do not take into account removal that occurred between measurements while we attempted to cover peak and trough concentrations with the timing of our sampling there were idle periods between batches where a dead volume typically 10 15 l of liquid continued to circulate through the gac filters moreover peak measurements in the pre process tank were not taken until flushing was completed meaning that some of the liquid had already been circulating through the gac by the time the peak measurement was made nonetheless these data point to opportunities for improving the system most notably given that the greatest removal rate appears to occur in the gac filters supplied by the pre process tank scaling up the media volume in this part of the system would likely effect the greatest increase in cod removal capacity at present we do not know what accounts for the consistently differing cod removal rates measured between the pre process and post process holding tank filters however it is possible that most of the fraction of cod readily removed by this media i e the soluble cod is removed in the pre process filter leaving comparatively little to be removed by the unit in the holding tank it is also possible that the chlorination of the process liquid by electrochemical disinfection affects the adsorptive properties of the gac karanfil 2006 or prevents formation of a biofilm on the carbon that would contribute to oxidation of cod future studies will address the question of whether and how biologically activated carbon contributes to contaminant and nutrient removal in each component of this system further work is also required to achieve surface discharge limits for cod and explore nutrient removal efficiency of the system ongoing work is exploring the lifetime of the gac maintenance requirements reuse potential of expended media and the potential of lower cost substitutes for gac such as biochar huggins et al 2016 all of which will be critical to define practical implementation 3 4 impact on energy required for electrochemical disinfection fig 6 shows the energy comparison among all the configurations control pre treatment gac and pre and post treatment gac when compared over the same range of ude the median disinfection energy was reduced from 70 kj l to 32 kj l 54 with the addition of the pre treatment gac filters an additional improvement to 20 kj l was observed with the addition of the post treatment gac filters representing an overall 71 reduction of the energy required for complete electrochemical disinfection of blackwater mpn 5 ml with the integration of gac filters into the system as mentioned above this large improvement in the energy requirement is most likely due to the adsorption of cod by the gac after positive results were observed with the gac filters in the lab field versions of both the pre and post treatment gac filters were installed at our field test site at cept university in ahmedabad india in june 2017 early qualitative results indicated that users were pleased with the visual appearance of the recycled liquid and reported little to no odor elledge et al unpublished results 4 conclusions a hybrid system integrating both the pre and post treatment gac filters with electrochemical treatment resulted in substantial reduction in the steady state concentrations of several contaminants compared to the same system without gac most notably 1 the cod of the process liquid was reduced by 69 and 2 the appearance of the water was greatly improved indicated by the reductions in turbidity and color the energy required for complete disinfection was reduced by 71 to 20 kj l with the addition of both pre and post treatment gac filters this energy reduction is most likely due to the reduction in specifically soluble cod hawkins et al 2018 author contributions statement this study was conceived by tate rogers katelyn sellgren and brian hawkins tess rogers mikayla

from 1732 282 to 590 407 mg l and color from 1560 134 to 770 432 pt co units prior to electrochemical treatment fig 2 a and b gac pretreatment also resulted in an increase in the free chlorine production rate from 0 26 0 02 to 0 68 0 05 mg l min fig 2c and a decrease in energy required to achieve a 6 log unit reduction in bacteria from 88 to 43 kj l with the electrochemical process fig 2d as previously discussed hawkins et al 2018 most of the cod present in these tests would be in the soluble or suspended form as most of the particulate cod is removed in settling tanks preceding these tests these data support the hypothesis that reducing the soluble cod can reduce the disinfection energy required for an electrochemical process 3 2 integrated system studies based on these positive initial results the gac filters were integrated into the operational prototype toilet fig 1b this was accomplished by circulating the blackwater from the pre process tank following the settling tanks through a pair of gac filters prior to electrochemical processing which occurs in 30 l net batches these pre treatment gac filters were added to the system after 40 ude to test performance under steady state conditions data from a previous study hawkins et al 2018 conducted in the same system prior to gac installation were used as control data for comparison fig 3 shows that the addition of the pre treatment gac filters had significant impacts on the quality of liquid prior to electrochemical treatment most notably the cod was consistently reduced compared to the previous system run without gac and the color was reduced from 1500 pt co units to an average of 228 pt co units while this meets the targeted discharge standard for color 300 pt co units tamil nadu pollution control board 2013 the cod remained over 1000 mg l which is well over the target surface discharge limit of 250 mg l ministry of environment forests india 1986 in an effort to reach discharge standards an additional pair of gac filters were added to circulate the liquid in the holding tank post electrochemical treatment prior to reuse for flushing fig 1b further we tested the addition of this polishing unit from startup of the system settling tanks and flush cistern initially charged with tap water the results of these tests are highlighted in fig 4 comparisons of all parameters in the process tank during the same window of ude 40 120 among systems without gac with pre process gac only and with pre and post process gac units are shown in table 1 all parameters measured trended downward with the addition of the post process gac unit though the differences were only statistically significant in the cases of conductivity ts color and initial mpn mpn0 3 3 cod removal and disposition cod concentrations were tracked in the supernatant fraction of the settling tanks as well as the pre process and holding tanks throughout the testing of the system with pre and post process gac units over seven weeks of continuous testing fig 5 a cod removal rates were calculated in each component of the system table 2 and the removal rates noted for the gac filters compare favorably with cod removal rates for gac previously reported 0 24 0 01 kgcod mgac 3 d 1 huggins et al 2016 we estimated the cumulative mass of cod flushed into the system based on the average cod we measured in our pooled urine donations 6000 mg l the median daily per capita fecal mass and fecal cod reported by rose 130 g and 71 g respectively and the typical removal of solids from our liquid waste stream by our solid liquid separator 90 of wet weight thus 3 e s t i m a t e d c u m u l a t i v e c o d m g 6000 m g l x v u r i n e 71 000 m g 130 g x m f e c e s x 0 1 using this method we estimated that 1543 g of cod were flushed into the system in total fig 5a cod was not routinely measured in the settled sludge beds because of the need to leave these undisturbed for proper function and difficulty of access for sampling however we know from periodic measurements up to 30 000 mg l cod that a substantial portion of the cod was associated with particles settled in the sludge beds levine et al 1985 reviewed particle size distributions psd of cod in municipal wastewater streams and found that 34 of the cod was in readily settled particles another psd study by hocaoglu and orhon 2013 of blackwater a more similar waste stream to our own reported that 62 of the cod was found in particles larger than 1 2 μm these investigators also looked at the psd within the settled fraction of their blackwater and found that the settled fraction included particles significantly smaller than the generally accepted threshold for settling 100 μm down to 10 μm likely due to aggregation and co precipitation with larger particles thus it is reasonable to estimate that between 30 and 50 of the cod flushed into our system remained in the settled sludge using the removal rates in table 2 we estimated that at least 16 247 g of cod was removed by the gac filters in the pre process tank whereas only 2 could be attributed to the gac filters in the post treatment holding tank given the total amount of gac in the filters on the pre process tank was 7 2 kg this indicates that the adsorption capacity of this material is at least 34 g cod kg gac though it is likely higher given that the filters were still removing cod from the process liquid at the end of the study this is in agreement with the total cod adsorption capacity of coal based gac in wastewater containing 1200 mg l cod similar to peak concentrations in our pre process tank see fig 5a recently reported at 48 g kg huggins et al 2016 an estimated 6 was removed from the supernatant fraction in the settling tanks while 9 remained in the liquid system at the end of testing most impressively only 3 of the cod flushed into the system was discharged during regular operation over a seven week trial period taken together we can account for 36 of the total cod in the liquid fractions and between 30 and 50 in the settled sludge leaving between 14 and 34 not readily accounted for fig 5b note however that the estimated cod removals by each gac system are conservative and do not take into account removal that occurred between measurements while we attempted to cover peak and trough concentrations with the timing of our sampling there were idle periods between batches where a dead volume typically 10 15 l of liquid continued to circulate through the gac filters moreover peak measurements in the pre process tank were not taken until flushing was completed meaning that some of the liquid had already been circulating through the gac by the time the peak measurement was made nonetheless these data point to opportunities for improving the system most notably given that the greatest removal rate appears to occur in the gac filters supplied by the pre process tank scaling up the media volume in this part of the system would likely effect the greatest increase in cod removal capacity at present we do not know what accounts for the consistently differing cod removal rates measured between the pre process and post process holding tank filters however it is possible that most of the fraction of cod readily removed by this media i e the soluble cod is removed in the pre process filter leaving comparatively little to be removed by the unit in the holding tank it is also possible that the chlorination of the process liquid by electrochemical disinfection affects the adsorptive properties of the gac karanfil 2006 or prevents formation of a biofilm on the carbon that would contribute to oxidation of cod future studies will address the question of whether and how biologically activated carbon contributes to contaminant and nutrient removal in each component of this system further work is also required to achieve surface discharge limits for cod and explore nutrient removal efficiency of the system ongoing work is exploring the lifetime of the gac maintenance requirements reuse potential of expended media and the potential of lower cost substitutes for gac such as biochar huggins et al 2016 all of which will be critical to define practical implementation 3 4 impact on energy required for electrochemical disinfection fig 6 shows the energy comparison among all the configurations control pre treatment gac and pre and post treatment gac when compared over the same range of ude the median disinfection energy was reduced from 70 kj l to 32 kj l 54 with the addition of the pre treatment gac filters an additional improvement to 20 kj l was observed with the addition of the post treatment gac filters representing an overall 71 reduction of the energy required for complete electrochemical disinfection of blackwater mpn 5 ml with the integration of gac filters into the system as mentioned above this large improvement in the energy requirement is most likely due to the adsorption of cod by the gac after positive results were observed with the gac filters in the lab field versions of both the pre and post treatment gac filters were installed at our field test site at cept university in ahmedabad india in june 2017 early qualitative results indicated that users were pleased with the visual appearance of the recycled liquid and reported little to no odor elledge et al unpublished results 4 conclusions a hybrid system integrating both the pre and post treatment gac filters with electrochemical treatment resulted in substantial reduction in the steady state concentrations of several contaminants compared to the same system without gac most notably 1 the cod of the process liquid was reduced by 69 and 2 the appearance of the water was greatly improved indicated by the reductions in turbidity and color the energy required for complete disinfection was reduced by 71 to 20 kj l with the addition of both pre and post treatment gac filters this energy reduction is most likely due to the reduction in specifically soluble cod hawkins et al 2018 author contributions statement this study was conceived by tate rogers katelyn sellgren and brian hawkins tess rogers mikayla

19388,microbial heterotrophic guilds in activated sludge wastewater treatment systems have complex population structures and functions a previously proposed heterotrophic specialist model states that heterotrophs consist of sub guilds specialized in consuming specific classes of compounds either readily degradable substrate rds or slowly degradable substrate sds according to current mathematical modeling practices for wastewater treatment processes it follows from metabolic considerations that the levels of rna and polyhydroxyalkanoate pha are correlated for strains of the same species growing in different environments a conjecture previously tested the proposed classification of heterotrophs into rds or sds consumers predicts that the same correlation would also be found across heterotrophic species in conventional activated sludge systems this prediction was tested in the current study the positive correlation between the rna and pha levels was observed in 9 conventional activated sludge plants in two independent sampling times and it was also found stable over a 6 month regular sampling period at one of these plants together these results imply that the levels of rna and pha can be used to define heterotrophic specialist sub guilds in order to gain insight in the species composition of the defined sub guilds flow cytometry cell sorting was used to further analyze one of the activated sludge samples four sorted sub samples were obtained high rna high pha low rna high pha high rna low pha and low rna low pha and the phylogenetic composition of each was determined using 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing heterotrophic genera were identified across 12 phyla and their representation in each sorted sub sample showed that the high rna high pha and low rna low pha groups were most dissimilar the enriched genera in these sorted sub samples are suggested to represent the composition of heterotrophic specialized sub guilds defined by the kinetics of substrate consumption graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyhydroxyalkanoate rna levels fluorescence activated flow cytometry cell sorting high throughput sequencing microbial community structure wastewater treatment modeling 1 introduction activated sludge is the most common biological wastewater treatment system around the world the conventional process raises a complex microbial community to degrade the various substrates present in wastewaters despite the central role in the activated sludge process of ordinary heterotrophs a term common to activated sludge research to contrast with other heterotrophs such as those accumulating polyphosphate little is known about the diverse ecological functions and interactions within this important guild high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing studies have revealed a very wide phylogenetic diversity within activated sludge microbial communities saunders et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 yet there is no global understanding of the origin of this diversity and the ways that engineers could manipulate it to maximize resource recovery from wastewater many studies have related the high concentrations of specific substrates with the abundance of some bacterial populations such as the link between the concentrations of volatile fatty acids or hydrogen sulfides and the abundance of some filamentous bacterial species thomsen et al 2004 between the concentration of methanol and abundance of specialized methanol consumers ginige et al 2004 or between phenol and specialized phenol degraders manefield et al 2007 one of the difficulties of linking the phylogenetic information and specific functions is that the number of possible substrates in wastewater is too large to test completely inspired by the fundamental niche concept hutchinson 1957 simpkin 1988 a heterotrophic specialist hypothesis was previously proposed to describe the diversity of heterotrophic populations as the result of substrate specialization frigon 2005 frigon et al 2002 according to this hypothesis heterotrophic populations would coexist as specialists utilizing their preferred types of substrates e g volatile fatty acids methanol and amino acids in the consensus activated sludge models asm developed through the international water association gujer et al 1999 influent biodegradable substrates are divided into readily degradable substrates rds and slowly degradable substrates sds considering the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis in conjunction with asm modeling concepts suggests that some bacterial populations are rds consumers while others are sds consumers the asm3 model also introduced for ordinary heterotrophs the concept of intracellular storage compounds including polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen gujer et al 1999 hallin et al 2006 simulations of rds consumers and sds consumers in a plug flow reactor using asm3 suggest that the level of pha increases only in rds consumers because they experience cycles of high and low concentrations of extracellular substrates also called feast famine cycle while sds consumers have more constant level of extracellular substrate throughout the length of the plug flow reactor i e similar to substrate profiles in a continuously stirred tank reactor to extend asm3 a metabolic model of the pathway of transformation from substrate to either biomass or storage compounds was proposed by van loosdrecht van loosdrecht and heijnen 2002 and modified by frigon 2005 the model assumes that microorganisms typically try to maximize their biomass synthesis rate but the feast famine dynamic conditions may limit this rate because of lower levels of rna higher levels of ribosomal rna rrna accounting for 80 90 of total rna are required to produce biomass at faster rates bremer and dennis 2008 neidhardt and magasanik 1960 wagner 2002 westermann et al 2012 analysis of this metabolic model in the context of the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis predicted that under feast famine cycles microorganisms produce storage compounds only when intermediate metabolic compounds e g acetyl coa are in excess due to a high substrate uptake rate and a low biomass production rate i e low rna metabolic model simulations of a plug flow reactor further predicted that rds consumers have higher rna level and produce pha while sds consumers have lower rna level and do not produce pha therefore the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis predicts rds consumers have high rna and pha levels while sds consumers have low rna and pha levels the approach taken to test the prediction was to document the relationship between cellular rna and pha levels in activated sludge microbial communities and identifying heterotrophic populations with different rna and pha levels this was achieved by first developing and validating a flow cytometry method for quantifying cellular levels of rna dna and pha in pure cultures and activated sludge samples flow cytometry is a fast method to measure the level of biomarkers in cells and its coupling with cell sorting provides an effective way to isolate specific microbial populations or guilds for further analyses fluorescence activated flow cytometry cell sorting has been used in environmental microbiology studies based on the physiology biomarker level and staining of phylogenetic groups ben amor et al 2005 czechowska et al 2008 kalyuzhnaya et al 2006b wallner et al 1997 contribution of nitrifiers to the measurement of rna dna and pha was neglected because they account for relatively small proportion in activated sludge cronje et al 2002 tsai and wu 2005 to eliminate the bias between single cells and possible small flocs of multiple cells the rna dna ratio was used to represent cellular rna level previous studies used rna dna ratio or rrna copies rrna gene to indicate the microbial activity in unstable environments baldrian et al 2012 kapoor et al 2015 kearns et al 2016 klein et al 2016 liang et al 2017 mueller et al 2016 vuono et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 although caution should be exercised in interpreting data given the limitations such as differences in rrna levels between taxa differences in increase in rrna with growth rates and differences in rrna gene copy numbers per genome blazewicz et al 2013 stoddard et al 2015 in the context of an activated sludge system operated near steady state however all microorganisms grow at the same average rate which is set by the solids residence time 1 srt rittmann and mccarty 2001 therefore rna dna ratio was used in the current study as an indicator of functional niche of heterotrophic populations rds vs sds consumers instead of a classical activity indicator in nonstationary environments for the current study the fixation technique was first optimized using several pure cultures to maximize the signals for rna rnaselect stain dna 7 aminoactinomycin d stain and pha nile red stain then the flow cytometry technique was validated by comparing measurements of rna and dna obtained for various pure cultures grown in different media with direct nucleic acid concentration measurements for pha measurements nile red staining was not further validated as it is used widely in lab scale and full scale reactors gorenflo et al 1999 muller et al 1995 second the relationship between rna and pha levels for the entire microbial community was tested in nine activated sludge systems over two seasons and it was monitored at one activated sludge system over a period of six months the pha level varied through the test period and the influence from plant operation parameters was assessed last the activated sludge sample was sorted into four sub samples based on rna and pha levels using fluorescence activated flow cytometry cell sorting and the phylogenetic structure was determined by 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and culture conditions five strains were used to test flow cytometric protocol of rna

pha and dna had never been used in mixed bacterial cultures the fixation procedure was tested for a number of pure cultures and for activated sludge mixed liquor samples four fixation methods were evaluated 4 paraformaldehyde pfa for 4 h 75 ethanol for 1 h 4 pfa for 4 h followed by 75 ethanol for 1 h and 4 pfa for 4 h followed by 75 methanol for 1 h pfa methanol fig 1 overall mixed liquor samples resulted in lower fluorescence signals than pure cultures this is expected because of the relatively long solids retention time i e slow growth rate in the activated sludge reactors and the accumulation of non degradable solids for rna staining fig 1a ethanol fixation resulted in significantly lower rnaselect signal than the other methods p 0 05 supplementary table s2 while the pfa methanol fixation resulted in the highest average signals for pha staining fig 1b the differences in nile red fluorescence signals between the fixation methods were not significant but pfa methanol resulted in slightly higher signals for the activated sludge mixed liquor sample for dna staining fig 1c 7 aad fluorescence signals were significantly higher for the ethanol fixation p 0 05 due to the atypical reactions with strain dsm541 and b subtillus while the average signals of the other fixation methods did not differ from each other the pfa methanol again resulted in highest signals for the activated sludge mixed liquor sample based on these results it was judged that the pfa methanol fixation procedure was the optimal procedure 3 2 evaluation of flow cytometric measurements of rna and dna across species in order to ascertain if the rna levels determined by flow cytometry were comparable across species the linear relationship was estimated between the average flow cytometric signals and direct measurements of extracted nucleic acid concentrations per biomass rna dna ratios were used because multiple cells might be aggregated and detected as one unit when passing through the flow cytometer and the dna level correlates well with biomass neidhardt and magasanik 1960 in all the strains a linear regression was observed between the rna dna ratios obtained by flow cytometry and direct nucleic acid extraction the coefficient of determination r2 for each pure culture were 0 60 0 47 0 24 0 98 and 0 99 for cupriavidus necator dsm428 and dsm 541 escherichia coli k 12 bacillus subtilis and rhodococcus jostii rha1 respectively the overall coefficient of determination r2 for the regression across culture conditions and species was 0 8 suggesting the flow cytometry method is valid for comparing rna levels across species in complex microbial communities fig 2 3 3 correlation between rna and pha levels in mixed liquor the dynamics of the rna and pha levels in activated sludge was first examined over the cycle of a 2 l laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor receiving a synthetic wastewater this reactor exhibited a commonly observed feast famine cycle with the feast phase lasting approximately 20 min flow cytometry analysis of fixed mixed liquor samples showed that both rna and pha levels increased during the feast phase approximately 20 min and decreased during the famine phase supplementary fig s2 the synchronized dynamics suggested that the rapid substrate uptake during the feast phase by the heterotrophic population leads to a higher level of rna to maximize the growth rate while the extra carbon is stored as pha the lower level of rna in the famine phase corresponds to the slow growth rate while pha is the carbon and energy source based on this result the full scale plants were samples at a point approximately 20 in the plug flow reactors in full scale activated sludge mixed liquor a positive correlation between rna and pha levels was observed in the microbial population supplementary fig s3a cells in each sample were divided evenly 33 of total cells into three groups representing low medium and high rna levels based on their rnaselect 7 aad fluorescence ratios supplementary fig s3b then the pha content of each group was compared based on the nile red signal a clear increase of nile red fluorescence was observed from low rna group to high rna group supplementary fig s3c mixed liquor samples from nine wastewater treatment plants were analyzed over two seasons table 1 using the plants as replicates the high rna groups always had higher nile red signal than the low rna groups paired student s t test p 0 05 supplementary table s3 in both sample sets wastewater treatment systems vary in terms of configuration and operation parameters leading to differences in growth rate and metabolic activity such metabolic variations may lead to variations in rna and pha per biomass furthermore the relative lipid loading and degradation rates may also vary among systems which changes the level of lipid particles in the flocs since nile red stain all lipids this is an additional source of variation in the base nile red signal the paired student s t test approach controls for these variations of signal among treatment systems as can be seen by considering each system one at a time the high rna groups always contained higher levels of pha despite variations in influent season reactor configuration and operational parameters the temporal stability of the observed rna pha correlation at different activated sludge plants was confirmed by monitoring at a higher frequency the laprairie wastewater treatment plant for a period of six months may october 2011 fig 3 a the pha level was significantly higher in the high rna group than in the low rna group paired student s t test p 0 05 supplementary table s3 influent characteristics and plant operation parameters fig 3b d were tested for their correlation to the levels of pha in all rna level groups and to the differences in pha levels between high rna and low rna groups the reactor temperature positive correlation fig 3d and dissolved oxygen concentration negative correlation fig 3d were the only two parameters tested that showed significant correlations table s4 3 4 taxonomic composition of rna pha sorted sub samples in order to determine the bacterial populations associated with the flow cytometric groups determined previously cells from mixed liquor obtained at laprairie were sorted based on cellular rna and pha levels according to four criteria high rna high pha high rna low pha low rna high pha and low rna low pha the number of sorted cells ranged from 7 6 105 in the low rna high pha to 3 6 106 in the low rna low pha sorted sub sample 1 8 106 were sorted in both the high rna high pha and high rna low pha sub samples cells with medium rna level were not included to increase the sorting stringency identification of the microbial composition of the sorted sub samples and the unsorted sample were achieved using 454 pyrosequencing of 16s rrna genes amplicons the total number of denoised high quality reads and otus of each sample are summarized in supplementary table s5 because of the uncertain variation between different species in the mixed liquor it was important to keep the sorting gates inclusive and strigent for the low and high rna groups the gates were set 33 of total population resulting in the common presence of many otus in the sub samples the otu richness and shannon diversity appeared slightly higher in the high rna both high and low pha sorted sub samples than in the low rna sorted sub samples supplementary table s5 and fig s5 at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in high rna sub samples supplementary fig s6 while chloroflexi was the most abundant phylum in the unsorted and low rna both high and low pha sub samples the other abundant phyla were tm7 in low rna low pha sub sample firmicutes in high rna low pha sub sample and verrucomicrobia bacteroidetes planctomycetes actinobacteria and acidobacteria at the genus level abundant core genera were selected at reads higher than 1 of total reads from a sub sample otus failed to be indentified at the genus level were labelled only at higher taxonomic level f family o order c class this procedure resulted in the identification of 61 genera or higher level taxa fig 4 the sum of these core taxa accounted for 46 74 of total reads the weighted unifrac distance revealed that the high rna high pha and low rna low pha sorted sub samples were most dissimilar fig 4 suggesting that these two sorted sub samples contained different microbial populations the relative abundance of each genus of higher level taxa when genus classification was impossible was compared between high rna high pha and low rna low pha sub samples to determine the association of population to specific cellular markers defining the predicted rds consumers and sds consumers many genera were present with similar abundance however 39 genera were found significantly enriched in the high rna high pha sorted sub sample using the odds ratio test p 0 1 while 22 genera were enriched in the low rna low pha sub samples the significantly enriched otus accounted for 67 of the total reads in high rna high pha and 73 in low rna low pha sub samples some closely related genera showed similar enrichment profiles while some genera in the same family altered in the enrichment groups fig 5 in the high rna high pha sub sample clusters are shown in the following families or orders acidimicrobiales phylum actinobacteria sphingobacteriales bacteroidetes anaerolineae chloroflexi planctomycetia planctomycetes methylophilales betaproteobacteria rhodocyclaceae betaproteobacteria and myxococcales deltaproteobacteria in low rna low pha enrichment clusters are shown in flavobacteriaceae bacteroidetes rhodobacterales and caulobacterales alphaproteobacteria pseudomonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae gammaproteobacteria and tm7 3 tm7 4 discussion the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis for activated sludge microbial communities was first proposed by frigon frigon 2005 frigon et al 2002 considering the complexity of analyzing the degradation profile of each substrate and its target heterotrophic guild two predictions based on the hypothesis could be tested the first prediction is that the abundance of rds consumers change in a diurnal pattern following the typical diurnal substrate loading rates observed in municipal wastewater treatment systems while the abundance of sds consumers remains steady because they would respond much more slowly to changes in substrate concentrations in their environment this prediction was previously tested using quantitative membrane rrna hybridization in a study that revealed the presence of two groups of organisms following the predicted dynamics frigon 2005 frigon et al 2002 the second prediction is that rna dna and pha levels are correlated based on metabolic considerations of substrate consumption and cellular synthesis kinetics this prediction was tested using pure cultures of c necator dsm 428 and dsm 541 a non pha producing mutant of dsm428 frigon et al 2006 the current study further tested the prediction of rna dna and pha correlation across various species growing in the same system nine conventional activated sludge reactors representing a wide range of operational conditions table 1 were tested in two independent runs and one was sampled over a period of six months fig 3 the correlation between rna dna and pha levels was observed in all samples suggesting that it is a general feature of activated sludge microbial communities the rna dna ratio was interpreted here as a marker of the heterotrophic functional niche although rna concentration is not scaling linearly and uniformly with growth rate across taxa the hypothesis is that microorganisms consuming rds will tend to have a higher rna dna ratio than those consuming sds and that more pha i e lipids will be associated with the high ratio cells therefore the observed correlation is good supporting evidence for the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis accordingly these features could help define in the future the various functional niches within the heterotrophic guilds in conventional activated sludge systems the dynamics of the pha pool in activated sludge systems and its proper kinetic modeling have been the topic of great interest among activated sludge mathematical modelers previous studies revealed that the fraction of cells with pha accumulation varied among activated sludge systems hanada et al 2002 karahan et al 2008 the international water association consensus activated sludge model no 3 asm3 is not able to reproduce the variation in pha containing biomass and its potential implications for activated sludge process dynamics thus a first extension to the asm3 was proposed to improve the situation by dividing the ordinary heterotrophic organisms into two sub guilds one with storage accumulation capacity and one without hanada et al 2002 it remained conceptual and was tested indirectly by measuring the difference in the storage rate constant k sto in various operational and environmental conditions without showing modeling simulation results improving on this first model extension another group proposed a parameterization in which substrates were segregated into three types rds converted to storage polymers then used for growth substrates rapidly hydrolyzed then used for growth and substrates slowly hydrolyzed then used for growth karahan et al 2008 this last model extension achieved more accurately simulated oxygen uptake rates than the original asm3 the current study provides increased justification for this kind of modeling approach by linking the pha dynamics and the rna levels where rna levels are in turn linked to the growth dynamics as previously demonstrated rds consumers growing in a plug flow reactor will accumulate higher levels of rna than when growing in a chemostat for the same solids residence time i e average growth rates frigon et al 2006 this is because the feast period fast growth rate and accumulation of pha of the feast famine cycle increases the amount of rna to support the fast biomass synthesis bremer and dennis 2008 frigon et al 2006 altogether the observations reported here and the previously successful mathematical modeling exercises seem to suggest that the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis is a good conceptualization of the structure of ordinary heterotrophic guilds cell sorting was used to identify phylogenetic populations associated with the high rna high pha putative rds consumer and low rna low pha sub guilds the main challenge in this analysis is to disperse the activated sludge flocs to single cells common techniques for dispersion include homogenization sonication and filtration which were all used in this study however small size aggregates may still occur to control for this the signals for rna rnaselect or pha nile red were normalized to the signal for dna 7 aad this is justified because the ratio of cellular dna to biomass is relatively constant neidhardt and magasanik 1960 however the small aggregates are not necessarily composed of a single otu in addition sorting errors may occur therefore the sorted sub samples should not be seen as pure sub guilds however statistical testing of the enrichment of specific populations should identify the main populations associated with each sub guild interpretation of the sub guild composition should also be approached carefully as some species may contain particular cell structures that could be detected as positive signals for example planctomycetes possess extensive internal membranes fuerst and sagulenko 2011 van niftrik and jetten 2012 which increase the fluorescent signal of nile red the phylogenetic composition of heterotrophic sub guild with high rna and pha levels can assist testing our hypothesis genera enriched in the high rna high pha sub sample were reported in literature with rds degradation functions for example zoogloea family rhodocyclaceae consume rds such as soluble sugars and volatile fatty acids and produce pha oshiki et al 2008 it was also the dominant genus in a pha producing feast famine sbr fed with acetate jiang et al 2011 methylophilus and methylotenera are in the family of methylophilaceae a group of methylotrophs known as methanol degraders which is consistent with classification as rds consumers even though the reported growth rate of methylotenera was low kalyuzhnaya et al 2006a candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis is the only member of candidatus accumulibacter which converts short chain fatty acids to pha under anaerobic conditions at the center of sludge flocs he and mcmahon 2011 finally trichococcus family carnobacteriaceae phylum firmicutes were reported to degrade mainly monomeric and dimeric carbon scheff et al 1984 all the information provides support to speculate on the kind of metabolism important for the high rna high pha sub guild according to predictions of the proposed heterotrophic specialist model genera in the low rna low pha sub sample would be sds consumers given the complex nature of sds it is difficult to hypothesize their identity and then link them to their consuming populations for example native potato starch needs to be hydrolized before consumption therefore it should be interpreted as a sds however hydrolysis is so fast that it behaves like a rds and promotes the accumulation of glycogen as a storage compound karahan et al 2006 despite difficulties in conceptualizing the possible identity of sds studies of nitrifying biofilms that received only ammonium could be helpful in identifying heterotrophic genera consuming sds these studies reported a large proportion of the biomass associated with the heterotrophic guild kindaichi et al 2004 since the source of organic substrates in these open bioifilm cultures are either decaying cellular components or substrate slowly leaking out of nitrifiers heterotorophs in these nitrifying biofilms are necessarily sds consumers these nitrifying biofilms harbored operational taxonomic units otus related to the genera flavobacterium family flavobacteriaceae xanthomonas family xanthomonadaceae and hyphomonas brevumdimonas order caulobacterales otus related to these same taxa were found in our low rna low pha sub sample suggesting their sds consumer lifestyle flavobacterium were reported to be slow growing bacteria saunders et al 2016 capable of utilizing various polysaccharides bernardet and bowman 2015 additionally the metaproteomic analysis of marine cyanobacterial blooms attributed most of the peptidases and glycosyl hydrolases to flavobacteria suggesting their function as degraders of cellular debris williams et al 2013 similarly brevumdimonas are considered aquatic bacteria well adapted for an oligotrophic lifestyle abraham et al 2014 and they were associated with the degradation of aggregates and the release of amino acids in fresh water lakes schweitzer et al 2001 the taxon most enriched in the low rna low pha sub sample was the class tm7 3 fig 5 there is limited information on the entire tm7 phylum however a recent metagenomic based reconstruction of genomes from activated sludge systems suggested that tm7 organisms are obligate fermenters with a tolerance for oxygen due to the presence of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase genes albertsen et al 2013 a fermentative lifestyle would be consistent with the low rna low pha classification due to the slow growth rates the high abundance of tm7 3 as fermentative organisms is possible for the laprairie plant because we showed in previous studies that the front end of the plug flow reactor is under aerated and significant denitrification occurs jauffur 2016 the observations about tm7 3 show the diversity of metabolism potentially associated with the low rna low pha sub sample and the care to be taken in the ecophysiological interpretation finally a recent study of the structure of microbial communities over several plants suggested that otus associated with the class anaerolineae co occur with the ones belonging to the phylum tm7 but co exclude with rhodobacterales and xanthomonadaceae ju and zhang 2015 although several mechanisms could be at play it is interesting to observe that in our study tm7 rhodobacterales and xanthomonadaceae were enriched in the low rna low pha sub sample a portion of the class anaerolineae was enriched in the low rna low pha sub sample envops12 while the rest of the class anaerolineae was enriched in the high rna high pha sub samples fig 5 a closer analysis of the metabolism of the related otus could provide specific clues on the mechanisms leading to these seemingly related observations 5 conclusions this study tested the correlation between rna and pha levels in multiple activated sludge systems and over multiple days within one activated sludge system to support the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis in spite of variations in influent temperature reactor configuration and operational parameters a positive correlation was observed in all samples rna and pha were used as classification criteria for microbial guilds in activated sludge the genera enriched in high rna high pha sub sample are likely rds consumers and genera enriched in low rna low pha sub sample are likely sds consumers suggesting the rna pha classification as an effective approach to differentiate the heterotrophic specialist sub guilds using flow cytometry cell sorting in combination with high throughput sequencing the complex microbial community could be separated into groups of interest and identified

19388,microbial heterotrophic guilds in activated sludge wastewater treatment systems have complex population structures and functions a previously proposed heterotrophic specialist model states that heterotrophs consist of sub guilds specialized in consuming specific classes of compounds either readily degradable substrate rds or slowly degradable substrate sds according to current mathematical modeling practices for wastewater treatment processes it follows from metabolic considerations that the levels of rna and polyhydroxyalkanoate pha are correlated for strains of the same species growing in different environments a conjecture previously tested the proposed classification of heterotrophs into rds or sds consumers predicts that the same correlation would also be found across heterotrophic species in conventional activated sludge systems this prediction was tested in the current study the positive correlation between the rna and pha levels was observed in 9 conventional activated sludge plants in two independent sampling times and it was also found stable over a 6 month regular sampling period at one of these plants together these results imply that the levels of rna and pha can be used to define heterotrophic specialist sub guilds in order to gain insight in the species composition of the defined sub guilds flow cytometry cell sorting was used to further analyze one of the activated sludge samples four sorted sub samples were obtained high rna high pha low rna high pha high rna low pha and low rna low pha and the phylogenetic composition of each was determined using 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing heterotrophic genera were identified across 12 phyla and their representation in each sorted sub sample showed that the high rna high pha and low rna low pha groups were most dissimilar the enriched genera in these sorted sub samples are suggested to represent the composition of heterotrophic specialized sub guilds defined by the kinetics of substrate consumption graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyhydroxyalkanoate rna levels fluorescence activated flow cytometry cell sorting high throughput sequencing microbial community structure wastewater treatment modeling 1 introduction activated sludge is the most common biological wastewater treatment system around the world the conventional process raises a complex microbial community to degrade the various substrates present in wastewaters despite the central role in the activated sludge process of ordinary heterotrophs a term common to activated sludge research to contrast with other heterotrophs such as those accumulating polyphosphate little is known about the diverse ecological functions and interactions within this important guild high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing studies have revealed a very wide phylogenetic diversity within activated sludge microbial communities saunders et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 yet there is no global understanding of the origin of this diversity and the ways that engineers could manipulate it to maximize resource recovery from wastewater many studies have related the high concentrations of specific substrates with the abundance of some bacterial populations such as the link between the concentrations of volatile fatty acids or hydrogen sulfides and the abundance of some filamentous bacterial species thomsen et al 2004 between the concentration of methanol and abundance of specialized methanol consumers ginige et al 2004 or between phenol and specialized phenol degraders manefield et al 2007 one of the difficulties of linking the phylogenetic information and specific functions is that the number of possible substrates in wastewater is too large to test completely inspired by the fundamental niche concept hutchinson 1957 simpkin 1988 a heterotrophic specialist hypothesis was previously proposed to describe the diversity of heterotrophic populations as the result of substrate specialization frigon 2005 frigon et al 2002 according to this hypothesis heterotrophic populations would coexist as specialists utilizing their preferred types of substrates e g volatile fatty acids methanol and amino acids in the consensus activated sludge models asm developed through the international water association gujer et al 1999 influent biodegradable substrates are divided into readily degradable substrates rds and slowly degradable substrates sds considering the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis in conjunction with asm modeling concepts suggests that some bacterial populations are rds consumers while others are sds consumers the asm3 model also introduced for ordinary heterotrophs the concept of intracellular storage compounds including polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen gujer et al 1999 hallin et al 2006 simulations of rds consumers and sds consumers in a plug flow reactor using asm3 suggest that the level of pha increases only in rds consumers because they experience cycles of high and low concentrations of extracellular substrates also called feast famine cycle while sds consumers have more constant level of extracellular substrate throughout the length of the plug flow reactor i e similar to substrate profiles in a continuously stirred tank reactor to extend asm3 a metabolic model of the pathway of transformation from substrate to either biomass or storage compounds was proposed by van loosdrecht van loosdrecht and heijnen 2002 and modified by frigon 2005 the model assumes that microorganisms typically try to maximize their biomass synthesis rate but the feast famine dynamic conditions may limit this rate because of lower levels of rna higher levels of ribosomal rna rrna accounting for 80 90 of total rna are required to produce biomass at faster rates bremer and dennis 2008 neidhardt and magasanik 1960 wagner 2002 westermann et al 2012 analysis of this metabolic model in the context of the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis predicted that under feast famine cycles microorganisms produce storage compounds only when intermediate metabolic compounds e g acetyl coa are in excess due to a high substrate uptake rate and a low biomass production rate i e low rna metabolic model simulations of a plug flow reactor further predicted that rds consumers have higher rna level and produce pha while sds consumers have lower rna level and do not produce pha therefore the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis predicts rds consumers have high rna and pha levels while sds consumers have low rna and pha levels the approach taken to test the prediction was to document the relationship between cellular rna and pha levels in activated sludge microbial communities and identifying heterotrophic populations with different rna and pha levels this was achieved by first developing and validating a flow cytometry method for quantifying cellular levels of rna dna and pha in pure cultures and activated sludge samples flow cytometry is a fast method to measure the level of biomarkers in cells and its coupling with cell sorting provides an effective way to isolate specific microbial populations or guilds for further analyses fluorescence activated flow cytometry cell sorting has been used in environmental microbiology studies based on the physiology biomarker level and staining of phylogenetic groups ben amor et al 2005 czechowska et al 2008 kalyuzhnaya et al 2006b wallner et al 1997 contribution of nitrifiers to the measurement of rna dna and pha was neglected because they account for relatively small proportion in activated sludge cronje et al 2002 tsai and wu 2005 to eliminate the bias between single cells and possible small flocs of multiple cells the rna dna ratio was used to represent cellular rna level previous studies used rna dna ratio or rrna copies rrna gene to indicate the microbial activity in unstable environments baldrian et al 2012 kapoor et al 2015 kearns et al 2016 klein et al 2016 liang et al 2017 mueller et al 2016 vuono et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 although caution should be exercised in interpreting data given the limitations such as differences in rrna levels between taxa differences in increase in rrna with growth rates and differences in rrna gene copy numbers per genome blazewicz et al 2013 stoddard et al 2015 in the context of an activated sludge system operated near steady state however all microorganisms grow at the same average rate which is set by the solids residence time 1 srt rittmann and mccarty 2001 therefore rna dna ratio was used in the current study as an indicator of functional niche of heterotrophic populations rds vs sds consumers instead of a classical activity indicator in nonstationary environments for the current study the fixation technique was first optimized using several pure cultures to maximize the signals for rna rnaselect stain dna 7 aminoactinomycin d stain and pha nile red stain then the flow cytometry technique was validated by comparing measurements of rna and dna obtained for various pure cultures grown in different media with direct nucleic acid concentration measurements for pha measurements nile red staining was not further validated as it is used widely in lab scale and full scale reactors gorenflo et al 1999 muller et al 1995 second the relationship between rna and pha levels for the entire microbial community was tested in nine activated sludge systems over two seasons and it was monitored at one activated sludge system over a period of six months the pha level varied through the test period and the influence from plant operation parameters was assessed last the activated sludge sample was sorted into four sub samples based on rna and pha levels using fluorescence activated flow cytometry cell sorting and the phylogenetic structure was determined by 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and culture conditions five strains were used to test flow cytometric protocol of rna

pha and dna had never been used in mixed bacterial cultures the fixation procedure was tested for a number of pure cultures and for activated sludge mixed liquor samples four fixation methods were evaluated 4 paraformaldehyde pfa for 4 h 75 ethanol for 1 h 4 pfa for 4 h followed by 75 ethanol for 1 h and 4 pfa for 4 h followed by 75 methanol for 1 h pfa methanol fig 1 overall mixed liquor samples resulted in lower fluorescence signals than pure cultures this is expected because of the relatively long solids retention time i e slow growth rate in the activated sludge reactors and the accumulation of non degradable solids for rna staining fig 1a ethanol fixation resulted in significantly lower rnaselect signal than the other methods p 0 05 supplementary table s2 while the pfa methanol fixation resulted in the highest average signals for pha staining fig 1b the differences in nile red fluorescence signals between the fixation methods were not significant but pfa methanol resulted in slightly higher signals for the activated sludge mixed liquor sample for dna staining fig 1c 7 aad fluorescence signals were significantly higher for the ethanol fixation p 0 05 due to the atypical reactions with strain dsm541 and b subtillus while the average signals of the other fixation methods did not differ from each other the pfa methanol again resulted in highest signals for the activated sludge mixed liquor sample based on these results it was judged that the pfa methanol fixation procedure was the optimal procedure 3 2 evaluation of flow cytometric measurements of rna and dna across species in order to ascertain if the rna levels determined by flow cytometry were comparable across species the linear relationship was estimated between the average flow cytometric signals and direct measurements of extracted nucleic acid concentrations per biomass rna dna ratios were used because multiple cells might be aggregated and detected as one unit when passing through the flow cytometer and the dna level correlates well with biomass neidhardt and magasanik 1960 in all the strains a linear regression was observed between the rna dna ratios obtained by flow cytometry and direct nucleic acid extraction the coefficient of determination r2 for each pure culture were 0 60 0 47 0 24 0 98 and 0 99 for cupriavidus necator dsm428 and dsm 541 escherichia coli k 12 bacillus subtilis and rhodococcus jostii rha1 respectively the overall coefficient of determination r2 for the regression across culture conditions and species was 0 8 suggesting the flow cytometry method is valid for comparing rna levels across species in complex microbial communities fig 2 3 3 correlation between rna and pha levels in mixed liquor the dynamics of the rna and pha levels in activated sludge was first examined over the cycle of a 2 l laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor receiving a synthetic wastewater this reactor exhibited a commonly observed feast famine cycle with the feast phase lasting approximately 20 min flow cytometry analysis of fixed mixed liquor samples showed that both rna and pha levels increased during the feast phase approximately 20 min and decreased during the famine phase supplementary fig s2 the synchronized dynamics suggested that the rapid substrate uptake during the feast phase by the heterotrophic population leads to a higher level of rna to maximize the growth rate while the extra carbon is stored as pha the lower level of rna in the famine phase corresponds to the slow growth rate while pha is the carbon and energy source based on this result the full scale plants were samples at a point approximately 20 in the plug flow reactors in full scale activated sludge mixed liquor a positive correlation between rna and pha levels was observed in the microbial population supplementary fig s3a cells in each sample were divided evenly 33 of total cells into three groups representing low medium and high rna levels based on their rnaselect 7 aad fluorescence ratios supplementary fig s3b then the pha content of each group was compared based on the nile red signal a clear increase of nile red fluorescence was observed from low rna group to high rna group supplementary fig s3c mixed liquor samples from nine wastewater treatment plants were analyzed over two seasons table 1 using the plants as replicates the high rna groups always had higher nile red signal than the low rna groups paired student s t test p 0 05 supplementary table s3 in both sample sets wastewater treatment systems vary in terms of configuration and operation parameters leading to differences in growth rate and metabolic activity such metabolic variations may lead to variations in rna and pha per biomass furthermore the relative lipid loading and degradation rates may also vary among systems which changes the level of lipid particles in the flocs since nile red stain all lipids this is an additional source of variation in the base nile red signal the paired student s t test approach controls for these variations of signal among treatment systems as can be seen by considering each system one at a time the high rna groups always contained higher levels of pha despite variations in influent season reactor configuration and operational parameters the temporal stability of the observed rna pha correlation at different activated sludge plants was confirmed by monitoring at a higher frequency the laprairie wastewater treatment plant for a period of six months may october 2011 fig 3 a the pha level was significantly higher in the high rna group than in the low rna group paired student s t test p 0 05 supplementary table s3 influent characteristics and plant operation parameters fig 3b d were tested for their correlation to the levels of pha in all rna level groups and to the differences in pha levels between high rna and low rna groups the reactor temperature positive correlation fig 3d and dissolved oxygen concentration negative correlation fig 3d were the only two parameters tested that showed significant correlations table s4 3 4 taxonomic composition of rna pha sorted sub samples in order to determine the bacterial populations associated with the flow cytometric groups determined previously cells from mixed liquor obtained at laprairie were sorted based on cellular rna and pha levels according to four criteria high rna high pha high rna low pha low rna high pha and low rna low pha the number of sorted cells ranged from 7 6 105 in the low rna high pha to 3 6 106 in the low rna low pha sorted sub sample 1 8 106 were sorted in both the high rna high pha and high rna low pha sub samples cells with medium rna level were not included to increase the sorting stringency identification of the microbial composition of the sorted sub samples and the unsorted sample were achieved using 454 pyrosequencing of 16s rrna genes amplicons the total number of denoised high quality reads and otus of each sample are summarized in supplementary table s5 because of the uncertain variation between different species in the mixed liquor it was important to keep the sorting gates inclusive and strigent for the low and high rna groups the gates were set 33 of total population resulting in the common presence of many otus in the sub samples the otu richness and shannon diversity appeared slightly higher in the high rna both high and low pha sorted sub samples than in the low rna sorted sub samples supplementary table s5 and fig s5 at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in high rna sub samples supplementary fig s6 while chloroflexi was the most abundant phylum in the unsorted and low rna both high and low pha sub samples the other abundant phyla were tm7 in low rna low pha sub sample firmicutes in high rna low pha sub sample and verrucomicrobia bacteroidetes planctomycetes actinobacteria and acidobacteria at the genus level abundant core genera were selected at reads higher than 1 of total reads from a sub sample otus failed to be indentified at the genus level were labelled only at higher taxonomic level f family o order c class this procedure resulted in the identification of 61 genera or higher level taxa fig 4 the sum of these core taxa accounted for 46 74 of total reads the weighted unifrac distance revealed that the high rna high pha and low rna low pha sorted sub samples were most dissimilar fig 4 suggesting that these two sorted sub samples contained different microbial populations the relative abundance of each genus of higher level taxa when genus classification was impossible was compared between high rna high pha and low rna low pha sub samples to determine the association of population to specific cellular markers defining the predicted rds consumers and sds consumers many genera were present with similar abundance however 39 genera were found significantly enriched in the high rna high pha sorted sub sample using the odds ratio test p 0 1 while 22 genera were enriched in the low rna low pha sub samples the significantly enriched otus accounted for 67 of the total reads in high rna high pha and 73 in low rna low pha sub samples some closely related genera showed similar enrichment profiles while some genera in the same family altered in the enrichment groups fig 5 in the high rna high pha sub sample clusters are shown in the following families or orders acidimicrobiales phylum actinobacteria sphingobacteriales bacteroidetes anaerolineae chloroflexi planctomycetia planctomycetes methylophilales betaproteobacteria rhodocyclaceae betaproteobacteria and myxococcales deltaproteobacteria in low rna low pha enrichment clusters are shown in flavobacteriaceae bacteroidetes rhodobacterales and caulobacterales alphaproteobacteria pseudomonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae gammaproteobacteria and tm7 3 tm7 4 discussion the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis for activated sludge microbial communities was first proposed by frigon frigon 2005 frigon et al 2002 considering the complexity of analyzing the degradation profile of each substrate and its target heterotrophic guild two predictions based on the hypothesis could be tested the first prediction is that the abundance of rds consumers change in a diurnal pattern following the typical diurnal substrate loading rates observed in municipal wastewater treatment systems while the abundance of sds consumers remains steady because they would respond much more slowly to changes in substrate concentrations in their environment this prediction was previously tested using quantitative membrane rrna hybridization in a study that revealed the presence of two groups of organisms following the predicted dynamics frigon 2005 frigon et al 2002 the second prediction is that rna dna and pha levels are correlated based on metabolic considerations of substrate consumption and cellular synthesis kinetics this prediction was tested using pure cultures of c necator dsm 428 and dsm 541 a non pha producing mutant of dsm428 frigon et al 2006 the current study further tested the prediction of rna dna and pha correlation across various species growing in the same system nine conventional activated sludge reactors representing a wide range of operational conditions table 1 were tested in two independent runs and one was sampled over a period of six months fig 3 the correlation between rna dna and pha levels was observed in all samples suggesting that it is a general feature of activated sludge microbial communities the rna dna ratio was interpreted here as a marker of the heterotrophic functional niche although rna concentration is not scaling linearly and uniformly with growth rate across taxa the hypothesis is that microorganisms consuming rds will tend to have a higher rna dna ratio than those consuming sds and that more pha i e lipids will be associated with the high ratio cells therefore the observed correlation is good supporting evidence for the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis accordingly these features could help define in the future the various functional niches within the heterotrophic guilds in conventional activated sludge systems the dynamics of the pha pool in activated sludge systems and its proper kinetic modeling have been the topic of great interest among activated sludge mathematical modelers previous studies revealed that the fraction of cells with pha accumulation varied among activated sludge systems hanada et al 2002 karahan et al 2008 the international water association consensus activated sludge model no 3 asm3 is not able to reproduce the variation in pha containing biomass and its potential implications for activated sludge process dynamics thus a first extension to the asm3 was proposed to improve the situation by dividing the ordinary heterotrophic organisms into two sub guilds one with storage accumulation capacity and one without hanada et al 2002 it remained conceptual and was tested indirectly by measuring the difference in the storage rate constant k sto in various operational and environmental conditions without showing modeling simulation results improving on this first model extension another group proposed a parameterization in which substrates were segregated into three types rds converted to storage polymers then used for growth substrates rapidly hydrolyzed then used for growth and substrates slowly hydrolyzed then used for growth karahan et al 2008 this last model extension achieved more accurately simulated oxygen uptake rates than the original asm3 the current study provides increased justification for this kind of modeling approach by linking the pha dynamics and the rna levels where rna levels are in turn linked to the growth dynamics as previously demonstrated rds consumers growing in a plug flow reactor will accumulate higher levels of rna than when growing in a chemostat for the same solids residence time i e average growth rates frigon et al 2006 this is because the feast period fast growth rate and accumulation of pha of the feast famine cycle increases the amount of rna to support the fast biomass synthesis bremer and dennis 2008 frigon et al 2006 altogether the observations reported here and the previously successful mathematical modeling exercises seem to suggest that the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis is a good conceptualization of the structure of ordinary heterotrophic guilds cell sorting was used to identify phylogenetic populations associated with the high rna high pha putative rds consumer and low rna low pha sub guilds the main challenge in this analysis is to disperse the activated sludge flocs to single cells common techniques for dispersion include homogenization sonication and filtration which were all used in this study however small size aggregates may still occur to control for this the signals for rna rnaselect or pha nile red were normalized to the signal for dna 7 aad this is justified because the ratio of cellular dna to biomass is relatively constant neidhardt and magasanik 1960 however the small aggregates are not necessarily composed of a single otu in addition sorting errors may occur therefore the sorted sub samples should not be seen as pure sub guilds however statistical testing of the enrichment of specific populations should identify the main populations associated with each sub guild interpretation of the sub guild composition should also be approached carefully as some species may contain particular cell structures that could be detected as positive signals for example planctomycetes possess extensive internal membranes fuerst and sagulenko 2011 van niftrik and jetten 2012 which increase the fluorescent signal of nile red the phylogenetic composition of heterotrophic sub guild with high rna and pha levels can assist testing our hypothesis genera enriched in the high rna high pha sub sample were reported in literature with rds degradation functions for example zoogloea family rhodocyclaceae consume rds such as soluble sugars and volatile fatty acids and produce pha oshiki et al 2008 it was also the dominant genus in a pha producing feast famine sbr fed with acetate jiang et al 2011 methylophilus and methylotenera are in the family of methylophilaceae a group of methylotrophs known as methanol degraders which is consistent with classification as rds consumers even though the reported growth rate of methylotenera was low kalyuzhnaya et al 2006a candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis is the only member of candidatus accumulibacter which converts short chain fatty acids to pha under anaerobic conditions at the center of sludge flocs he and mcmahon 2011 finally trichococcus family carnobacteriaceae phylum firmicutes were reported to degrade mainly monomeric and dimeric carbon scheff et al 1984 all the information provides support to speculate on the kind of metabolism important for the high rna high pha sub guild according to predictions of the proposed heterotrophic specialist model genera in the low rna low pha sub sample would be sds consumers given the complex nature of sds it is difficult to hypothesize their identity and then link them to their consuming populations for example native potato starch needs to be hydrolized before consumption therefore it should be interpreted as a sds however hydrolysis is so fast that it behaves like a rds and promotes the accumulation of glycogen as a storage compound karahan et al 2006 despite difficulties in conceptualizing the possible identity of sds studies of nitrifying biofilms that received only ammonium could be helpful in identifying heterotrophic genera consuming sds these studies reported a large proportion of the biomass associated with the heterotrophic guild kindaichi et al 2004 since the source of organic substrates in these open bioifilm cultures are either decaying cellular components or substrate slowly leaking out of nitrifiers heterotorophs in these nitrifying biofilms are necessarily sds consumers these nitrifying biofilms harbored operational taxonomic units otus related to the genera flavobacterium family flavobacteriaceae xanthomonas family xanthomonadaceae and hyphomonas brevumdimonas order caulobacterales otus related to these same taxa were found in our low rna low pha sub sample suggesting their sds consumer lifestyle flavobacterium were reported to be slow growing bacteria saunders et al 2016 capable of utilizing various polysaccharides bernardet and bowman 2015 additionally the metaproteomic analysis of marine cyanobacterial blooms attributed most of the peptidases and glycosyl hydrolases to flavobacteria suggesting their function as degraders of cellular debris williams et al 2013 similarly brevumdimonas are considered aquatic bacteria well adapted for an oligotrophic lifestyle abraham et al 2014 and they were associated with the degradation of aggregates and the release of amino acids in fresh water lakes schweitzer et al 2001 the taxon most enriched in the low rna low pha sub sample was the class tm7 3 fig 5 there is limited information on the entire tm7 phylum however a recent metagenomic based reconstruction of genomes from activated sludge systems suggested that tm7 organisms are obligate fermenters with a tolerance for oxygen due to the presence of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase genes albertsen et al 2013 a fermentative lifestyle would be consistent with the low rna low pha classification due to the slow growth rates the high abundance of tm7 3 as fermentative organisms is possible for the laprairie plant because we showed in previous studies that the front end of the plug flow reactor is under aerated and significant denitrification occurs jauffur 2016 the observations about tm7 3 show the diversity of metabolism potentially associated with the low rna low pha sub sample and the care to be taken in the ecophysiological interpretation finally a recent study of the structure of microbial communities over several plants suggested that otus associated with the class anaerolineae co occur with the ones belonging to the phylum tm7 but co exclude with rhodobacterales and xanthomonadaceae ju and zhang 2015 although several mechanisms could be at play it is interesting to observe that in our study tm7 rhodobacterales and xanthomonadaceae were enriched in the low rna low pha sub sample a portion of the class anaerolineae was enriched in the low rna low pha sub sample envops12 while the rest of the class anaerolineae was enriched in the high rna high pha sub samples fig 5 a closer analysis of the metabolism of the related otus could provide specific clues on the mechanisms leading to these seemingly related observations 5 conclusions this study tested the correlation between rna and pha levels in multiple activated sludge systems and over multiple days within one activated sludge system to support the heterotrophic specialist hypothesis in spite of variations in influent temperature reactor configuration and operational parameters a positive correlation was observed in all samples rna and pha were used as classification criteria for microbial guilds in activated sludge the genera enriched in high rna high pha sub sample are likely rds consumers and genera enriched in low rna low pha sub sample are likely sds consumers suggesting the rna pha classification as an effective approach to differentiate the heterotrophic specialist sub guilds using flow cytometry cell sorting in combination with high throughput sequencing the complex microbial community could be separated into groups of interest and identified

senasa and over 20 000 tonnes applied annually in the us us epa 2015 2007 due to its significant solubility in water c a 300 mg l 1 and moderate potential of lixiviation in soils it was categorised by the us epa as a highly persistent chemical in aquatic and terrestrial anaerobic environments us epa 2011 the increase in the type and concentration of pollutants in aquatic systems or urban industrial effluents mostly related to anthropogenic activities generated the need for innovative strategies for water remediation such as advanced oxidation process aops in the last few years research efforts have mainly been devoted to overcoming limitations associated with these processes and improving their efficiency in this sense and focusing on fenton and photo fenton pf processes the main drawbacks are i the optimal ph is acidic ii the generation of iron sludge and iii the need for additional reagents h2o2 and iron salts fenton based processes in more environmentally friendly conditions are

concerns about the ecotoxicity and biodegradability of chelators and by products formed after the photochemical event clarizia et al 2017 however the iron concentration considered was not representative of that typically found in surface or groundwater which varies from 0 05 to 0 68 mg l 1 in argentinian rivers avigliano et al 2015 previous studies have shown the successful removal of

2014 only a few studies investigated the process at circumneutral ph for example luna et al 2014 reported the degradation of 2 4 d 700 mg l 1 in saline distilled water by the addition of 379 mg l 1 fe ii and 15 200 mg l 1 h2o2 subjected to sunlight irradiation but although initiated at circumneutral conditions ph dropped to close to 1 as the reaction proceeded leading to the classic pf process similar results were found by barona et al 2015 who studied the degradation of dihydroxybenzene isomers in milli q water by pf process using minute fe iii concentrations 0 7 mg l 1 and h2o2 40 mg l 1 conte et al 2014 evaluated the abatement of 2 4 d 30 mg l 1 by pf treatment at ph 5 0 using iron complexing agents such as citrate and oxalate with 3 mg l 1 fe iii and 131 5 mg l 1 h2o2 upon uv a irradiation results showed that ferric citrate and ferric oxalate complexes led to significant degradation and mineralization of 2 4 d at ph 5 0 however final ph was not reported recently gutierrez zapata et al 2017 reported the abatement of 24 3 mg l 1 2 4 d in groundwater with a natural iron content of 0 3 mg l 1 at ph 7 0 and an addition of 10 mg l 1 h2o2 under simulated solar light this study demonstrated that low amounts of h2o2 can induce an enhancement of photo induced natural abiotic processes and reactive oxygen species ros production however this study did not show evidence of the influence of hydrogen peroxide photolysis hpp on the 2 4 d degradation nor the intermediate compounds generated during the process although uv c absorption is most efficient for oh production by h2o2 photolysis this reaction is also significant under uv b a absorption in wastewater treatment pignatello et al 1999 artificial snow jacobi et al 2004 frozen h2o2 chu and anastasio 2008 nonylphenol

filter was used all photo induced processes at neutral ph were significantly reduced at ph 3 6 and employing uv b a and visible irradiation the pf like process rapidly and completely degraded 2 4 d whereas results from hpp treatment were similar to those at ph 7 0 the experiments performed using 0 6 mg l 1 fe iii without h2o2 led to an increase in 2 4 d degradation with respect to that observed at neutral ph from 17 to 35 the use of uv b filter produced the same detrimental effect observed previously the ph remained constant at 3 6 throughout the test dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured at the end of the treatments at ph 7 0 uv b a visible hpp and pf like trials led to a doc decrease of 4 and 12 whereas at ph 3 6 the reductions were 9 and 77 respectively using the uv b filter the efficiency of the processes diminished it is nevertheless remarkable that a 60 removal of doc was achieved after 1 h of pf process at ph 3 6 fig 2 depicts the evolution of h2o2 consumption pf like trials at an initial ph 7 0 or 3 6 upon the uv b a visible irradiation showed the most important change with 88 of h2o2 removed after 6 h at ph 7 0 and 66 consumed after 1 h of treatment at ph 3 6 3 2 identification of chlorinated aromatic intermediates and degradation mechanism the intermediates identified and categorised by isotope profiling with integration of the metlin are summarized in supplementary data and table 1 intermediates identified and quantified during pf like and hpp processes were 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 2 chlorohydroquinone 2 chq 4 chlorocatechol 4 cc 4 6 dichlororesorcinol 4 6 dcr 3 5 dichlorocatechol 3 5 dcc 4 chlorophenol 4 cp the evolution of intermediate concentrations is depicted in figure s5 and s6 supplementary information for pf like and hpp treatment respectively the most predominant intermediate during the early stage of the breakdown was 2 4 dcp the hydroxyl radical oh attacked the c1 o bond of the aromatic ring leading to the loss of an alkoxy radical to form 2 4 dcp and glycolic acid peller et al 2004 kwan and chu 2004 see table 2 according to kwan and chu 2004 the oh may replace the chlorine atom of 2 4 dcp at two different positions para position to form 2 chlorohydroquinone or ortho position to form 4 chlorocatechol results in this study figures s4 and s5 in supplementary data show that oh radicals prefer to attack chlorophenols at para positions and form 2 chlorohydroquinone as was also reported by bandara et al 2001 and ma et al 2001 the electrophilic hydroxyl radical attacks the electron rich positions at the ortho and para sites however the oh attack at the para position may experience less steric strain than that at the ortho position and the inductive electron withdrawing effect of the chlorine atom might render attachment of the electrophilic hydroxyl radical to the ortho relative to the para position peller et al 2004 consequently para substitution overcomes ortho substitution resulting in a faster oxidation of 2 4 dcp to 2 chq s5 and s6 in supplementary data thus 2 chq may dissociate two hydrogen atoms to give 2 chloro 1 4 benzoquinone upon further hydroxyl radical attacks which proved undetectable in this case 2 4 dcp can be hydroxylated by hydroxyl radicals leading to the formation of 3 5 dichlorocatechol and 4 6 dichlororesorcinol these two by products would then undergo further hydroxylation however the intermediates were not detectable because they could be rapidly dehydrogenated to their corresponding quinone 4 cholorophenol was also detected probably being generated after dechlorinating 2 4 dcp the degradation pathways were proposed accordingly to illustrate a series of steps in the degradation of 2 4 d fig 3 although hydroquinone benzoquinone phenol and some carboxylic acids proposed as compounds generated during last steps of 2 4 d degradation pathway have been not identified it is fair to suggest that 2 4 d degradation could yield these by products specially during experiments carried out at acid ph values where high mineralization is achieved it is well known that chlorophenols such as 4 chlorophenol and 4 chlorocatechol can undergo upon photocatalytic reactions oh radical attack leading to the dechlorination and yielding hydroquinone and benzoquinone as main by products therefore both chemical substances can undergo ring opening producing aliphatic acids butanedioic and acetic acid prior to mineralization mylonas and papaconstantinou 1996 li et al 1999 lapertot et al 2006 3 3 abatement of 2 4 d under sunlight recirculation mode results obtained for the treatment of 10 mg l 1 2 4 d at both ph levels were similar and even slightly better in terms of 2 4 d degradation mineralization and h2o2 evolution than those obtained with the xe lamp data not shown this behaviour could be associated with the different experimental setup and or different irradiation source iron precipitation was detected on the inner walls of the recirculation tubing especially when silicon tubes were used and at neutral ph although the experimental system was carefully cleaned with acid after every trial minute quantities of iron may have remained adsorbed on the tube walls indeed small quantities of iron were found at the end of hpsp experiments performed at initial ph 7 ph dropped to 4 2 after 6 h of treatment and ph 3 6 even though no iron was added the case of hpsp at ph 3 6 was particularly remarkable total 2 4 d degradation and 32 of mineralization were reached after 3 h of treatment t3mw n 170 min but in xe lamp experiments the removal of 2 4 d and doc was only 85 and 9 respectively t3mw n 360 min at the end of this hpsp trial iron concentration was determined to be 0 07 mg l 1 which supports the hypothesis of iron desorption from the tube walls in order to evaluate the effect of this minute amount of fe iii on the pf like process an experiment was conducted under the previous conditions 10 mg l 1 2 4 d 20 mg l 1 h2o2 0 07 mg l 1 fe iii ph 3 6 and xe lamp irradiation uv intensity 3 mw cm 2 the time evolution of 2 4 d 2 4 dcp and h2o2 is shown in fig 4 the results were in agreement with those of the hpsp trial where 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp were totally eliminated after t3mw n 180 min the doc removal was approximately 32 and 35 40 of h2o2 was consumed at the end of the treatment the processes were further investigated at the more environmentally relevant initial concentration of 1 mg l 1 2 4 d in this case doc was not monitored due to analytical limitations in a first approach spf like 0 6 mg l 1 fe iii and hpsp treatments were investigated using initial h2o2 concentrations of 3 6 10 and 20 mg l 1 and initial ph 7 0 and 3 6 fig 5 results showed no significant differences between spf like and hpsp processes at neutral ph for each h2o2 concentration evaluated during 6 h of treatment t3mw n 310 340 min final ph for all the treatments ranged between 5 5 and 6 8 under these conditions iron dissolution can be neglected and hpsp process was likely the main contributor to 2 4 d oxidation faster degradation was observed with increasing initial h2o2 concentration up to 10 mg l 1 similar yields 90 were achieved after 6 h of treatment when 10 or 20 mg l 1 h2o2 was added the addition of 20 mg l 1 h2o2 appeared to display superior degradation kinetics initially however after 120 min of treatment both experiments 10 and 20 mg l 1 h2o2 behaved similarly the lower concentrations 3 and 6 mg l 1 did not reach removal to 2 4 d drinking water standards the concentration of 2 4 dcp and total iron at the end of hpsp trials at neutral ph were below the corresponding loqs for all experiments at neutral ph for most of spf like experiments h2o2 removal was slightly higher than in hpsp treatments except for the case of 20 mg l 1 concentration where this behaviour was only noticed at the beginning of the process approximately 80 50 30 and 20 of h2o2 were consumed during spf like treatments when 3 6 10 and 20 mg l 1 of this reagent was added as an initial concentration and the h2o2 consumed ranged from 2 5 to 3 6 mg l 1 thus no notable differences in total consumption of h2o2 were observed at ph 3 6 3 mg l 1 h2o2 were sufficient to achieve total 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp degradation after t3mw n 25 min of spf like process 0 6 mg l 1 fe iii same outcome was observed at t3mw n 110 min during the hpsp experiment at this ph however total iron at the end of the hpsp experiment was found to be 0 03 mg l 1 indicating that minute amounts of iron previously deposited on the tube walls leached under acidic conditions and was enough to produce the degradation of the pollutant and its by product by spf treatment under acidic conditions the h2o2 consumption was 60 and 35 when 0 6 and 0 03 mg l 1 of iron species were present respectively experiments of 2 4 d degradation in simulated groundwater were conducted with initial concentrations of 10 and 20 mg l 1 h2o2 fig 6 shows the results corresponding to the latter since it displayed the highest efficiency spf like and hpsp processes at neutral ph degraded close to 40 of 2 4 d after 6 h of treatment t3mw 335 min in simulated surface water while ph increased to around 8 acidification was required to achieve complete 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp abatement data for 2 4 dcp evolution not shown after t3mw n 35 min and doc elimination close to 50 the final h2o2 concentration was 15 mg l 1 the hpsp treatment 20 mg l 1 h2o2 at ph 3 6 resulted in 0 05 mg l 1 of total iron leached from the inner tube walls at the end of the test which practically converted it into a spf treatment with minute iron amounts the process achieved elimination of 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp in t3mw n 140 min and 35 mineralization the final h2o2 concentration was 17 5 mg l 1 4 discussion the results obtained when the xe lamp was used demonstrate that degradation of 2 4 d mainly occurs by hpp at neutral ph whereas under acidic conditions pf contributes significantly to the process at ph between 2 5 and 5 0 fe oh 2 is the main ferric hydroxy complex in aqueous solutions pignatello et al 2006 as described by eq 1 1 fe3 aq h2o l fe oh 2 aq h aq k 1 2 7 10 3 m fe oh 2 is a highly photo active ferric aqua complex with two important light absorption maximums at 297 nm ε 2030 m 1 cm 1 and 205 nm ε 4640 m 1 cm 1 pignatello et al 2006 gallard et al 1999 and enables the photo production of hydroxyl radicals by uv b a and visible light absorption following eq 2 2 fe oh 2 aq hν fe2 aq oh aq λ 290 410 nm thus in mildly acidic conditions and subjected to uv b a and visible irradiation these species contribute to 2 4 d abatement as observed in the control experiments performed with 2 4 d and fe iii at ph 3 6 moreover the complex fe oh 2 whose photochemistry is still not fully understood is present at ph values 5 0 and can also participate in the 2 4 d degradation at circumneutral ph as suggested by eq 2 similar h2o2 disappearance levels were achieved when uv b filter was used after 1 h of pf like treatment at ph 3 6 which indicates that uv a visible wavelengths were responsible for the photo induced reactions during this process when iron was dissolved inversely pf like trials performed at neutral ph presented a higher h2o2 consumption when uv b contributed to the process this indicates that uv b light promotes a higher photolysis of feooh 2 complex ε 0 33 using a medium pressure mercury arc lamp that produces ho2 and fe ii via eq 3 pignatello et al 2006 3 feooh 2 aq hν fe2 aq ho2 aq it is also noteworthy that 20 22 of final h2o2 consumption occurred during the hpp treatment at both studied ph values suggesting that ph variations from 3 6 to 7 do not play an important role in the process when the uv b filter was used the h2o2 consumption during the first 30 min was reduced by 50 and to 14 16 in 6 h at both ph values the experiments showed that uv b and uv a can photolyze h2o2 but under uv b h2o2 decomposition and 2 4 d elimination proceed much faster chlorinated phenols such as 3 5 dichlorocatechol 2 chlorohidroquinone and 4 chlorophenol were detected as intermediates during hpp and pf like processes at ph 3 6 and 7 0 there were no marked differences in the nature of by products generated by the processes at either ph value but dissimilarities were observed in the kinetics of by product abatement and their concentrations by products were generated to a lesser extent and they were removed faster during pf like process at low ph than at neutral ph value or during hpp treatment underscoring the improved performance of acidic pf processes for organic removal and suggesting that oh generation and attack was the main mineralization via during both treatments and ph values the results of the study corroborate the hypothesis that spf like process at acidic ph could be performed with minute concentrations of iron 0 07 0 6 mg l 1 found naturally in surface waters to reach efficient 2 4 d 2 4 dcp and doc removals in a milli q water matrix fig 4 and demonstrate the degradation of 1 mg l 1 2 4 d in a milli q or simulated surface water respectively applying spf process under acidic conditions ph 3 6 using minute fe iii concentrations 0 6 mg l 1 figs 5 and 6 for the removal of 1 mg l 1 2 4 d in milli q water only 3 mg l 1 h2o2 and 0 6 mg l 1 fe iii were necessary to reach 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp concentrations below the limit of quantification 2 4 d 0 007 mg l 1 and 2 4 dcp 0 009 mg l 1 in less than 30 min when a simulated surface water matrix was used a h2o2 concentration of 20 mg l 1 was necessary under the same reaction conditions therefore spf like process is able to reduce 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp concentrations to the maximum levels established by who 2003 2 4 d 0 030 mg l 1 and us epa 2015 2 4 dcp 0 010 mg l 1 however irradiation times longer than t3mw n 6 h were required at neutral ph to reach 2 4 d concentrations below 0 1 mg l 1 maximum contaminant level set by argentinean legislation for drinking water código alimentario argentino 2007 the lower herbicide abatement observed in simulated surface water matrix experiments can be associated mainly with the scavenger effect of inorganic anions as well as the competitive effect of the humic acids for ros produced interestingly during the spf like trials with humic acids at neutral ph iron remained in solution due to its coordination with these compounds georgi et al 2007 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 and was available to participate in photo fenton reactions as demonstrated by experiments performed with 1 mg l 1 2 4 d and 5 0 mg l 1 ha at neutral ph in the absence of the dissolved salts data not shown under these conditions the herbicide was completely eliminated after t3mw n 120 min and 180 min when initial h2o2 concentration was 20 and 10 mg l 1 respectively therefore the presence of ha accelerates 2 4 d degradation by keeping iron in solution at neutral ph however the increase in inorganic species concentrations led to a significant reduction on herbicide removal 5 conclusions results showed the feasibility of 2 4 d removal by hpsp which is the dominant mechanism of organic pollutant reduction during the spf like process at neutral ph the addition of h2o2 and direct exposure to solar light produces the removal of 2 4 d from surface water even in the presence of minute iron concentrations such as those found in natural waters spf like process by minute fe iii concentrations acidification may be required to increase the efficiency of the treatment depending on the characteristics of the water matrix acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support of consejo nacional de investigaciones cientificas y tecnicas conicet

19389,the photo fenton like pf like process with minute fe iii concentrations and the hydrogen peroxide photolysis hpp using xe lamp or solar light as sources of irradiation were efficiently applied to eliminate the herbicide 2 4 d from water pf like experiments concerning ferric and h2o2 concentrations of 0 6 mg l 1 and 20 mg l 1 respectively using xenon lamps xe lamps as a source of irradiation and 2 4 d concentrations of 10 mg l 1 at ph 3 6 exhibited complete 2 4 d degradation and 77 dissolved organic carbon doc removal after 30 min and 6 h of irradiation respectively whereas hpp in absence of ferric ions experiments showed a 2 4 d reduction and doc removal of 90 and 7 respectively after 6 h of irradiation at ph 7 0 hpp process achieved a 2 4 d abatement of approximately 75 and a doc removal of 4 after 6 h pf like exhibited slightly improved 2 4 d and doc removals 80 and 12 respectively after the same irradiation time probably due to the low ph reduction from 7 0 to 5 6 several chlorinated aromatic intermediates were identified by hplc ms these by products were efficiently removed by pf at ph 3 6 whereas at neutral pf like and acid or neutral hpp they were not efficiently degraded with natural solar light irradiation 10 and 1 mg l 1 of 2 4 d were abated using minor h2o2 concentrations 3 6 10 and 20 mg l 1 and iron at 0 6 mg l 1 in milli q water similar results to xe lamp experiments were obtained where solar uv b a light h2o2 photolysis hpsp and solar photo fenton like spf like played an important role and even at low h2o2 and ferric concentrations of 3 and 0 6

efficiently removed the herbicide and its main metabolite 2 4 dcp after 30 min of treatment while at neutral ph 40 of herbicide degradation was achieved in the case of very low iron concentrations 0

solar photolysis water treatment 1 introduction the overuse of pesticides poses significant health and environmental risks as these compounds contaminate water sources and create a need for remediation barbosa et al 2016 senasa among pesticides 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d is one of the most widely used around the world 7600 tonnes were commercialized in argentina during 2012 senasa and over 20 000 tonnes applied annually in the us us epa 2015 2007 due to its significant solubility in water c a 300 mg l 1 and moderate potential of lixiviation in soils it was categorised by the us epa as a highly persistent chemical in aquatic and terrestrial anaerobic environments us epa 2011 the increase in the type and concentration of pollutants in aquatic systems or urban industrial effluents mostly related to anthropogenic activities generated the need for innovative strategies for water remediation such as advanced oxidation process aops in the last few years research efforts have mainly been devoted to overcoming limitations associated with these processes and improving their efficiency in this sense and focusing on fenton and photo fenton pf processes the main drawbacks are i the optimal ph is acidic ii the generation of iron sludge and iii the need for additional reagents h2o2 and iron salts fenton based processes in more environmentally friendly conditions are desirable i e neutral or circumneutral ph lower reactant consumption and sunlight as a source of irradiation the degradation of organic pollutants in trace levels in urban effluents by pf process at circumneutral ph and low amounts of iron e g 5 mg l 1 h2o2 e g 40 mg l 1 was reported in several studies klamerth et al 2009 miralles cuevas et al 2014 2015 when iron was kept in solution by complexing agents although successful this strategy presents additional drawbacks such as the extra cost of chelator addition an increase of the total organic carbon content and most importantly concerns about the ecotoxicity and biodegradability of chelators and by products formed after the photochemical event clarizia et al 2017 however the iron concentration considered was not representative of that typically found in surface or groundwater which varies from 0 05 to 0 68 mg l 1 in argentinian rivers avigliano et al 2015 previous studies have shown the successful removal of 2 4 d at initial concentrations ranging from 22 to 100 mg l 1 by pf process at acid ph ph 3 0 in milli q water using relatively high amounts of ferric or ferrous salts 3 340 mg l 1 fe and h2o2 from 50 mg l 1 to 15 266 mg l 1 leading to the generation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp as the main oxidation by product sun and pignatello 1993 paterlini and pupo nogeira 2005 jimenez et al 2011 conte et al 2014 only a few studies investigated the process at circumneutral ph for example luna et al 2014 reported the degradation of 2 4 d 700 mg l 1 in saline distilled water by the addition of 379 mg l 1 fe ii and 15 200 mg l 1 h2o2 subjected to sunlight irradiation but although initiated at circumneutral conditions ph dropped to close to 1 as the reaction proceeded leading to the classic pf process similar results were found by barona et al 2015 who studied the degradation of dihydroxybenzene isomers in milli q water by pf process using minute fe iii concentrations 0 7 mg l 1 and h2o2 40 mg l 1 conte et al 2014 evaluated the abatement of 2 4 d 30 mg l 1 by pf treatment at ph 5 0 using iron complexing agents such as citrate and oxalate with 3 mg l 1 fe iii and 131 5 mg l 1 h2o2 upon uv a irradiation results showed that ferric citrate and ferric oxalate complexes led to significant degradation and mineralization of 2 4 d at ph 5 0 however final ph was not reported recently gutierrez zapata et al 2017 reported the abatement of 24 3 mg l 1 2 4 d in groundwater with a natural iron content of 0 3 mg l 1 at ph 7 0 and an addition of 10 mg l 1 h2o2 under simulated solar light this study demonstrated that low amounts of h2o2 can induce an enhancement of photo induced natural abiotic processes and reactive oxygen species ros production however this study did not show evidence of the influence of hydrogen peroxide photolysis hpp on the 2 4 d degradation nor the intermediate compounds generated during the process although uv c absorption is most efficient for oh production by h2o2 photolysis this reaction is also significant under uv b a absorption in wastewater treatment pignatello et al 1999 artificial snow jacobi et al 2004 frozen h2o2 chu and anastasio 2008 nonylphenol

were similar during the first 5 h for the hpp and pf like treatments at ph 7 this fact indicated that hpp was the dominant process at circumneutral ph although the trials started at neutral conditions the ph dropped to 5 3 0 4 and 5 6 0 6 for pf like and hpp experiments respectively under these conditions the contribution of dissolved iron and therefore the pf process became relevant and a removal improvement was observed after the first 5 h of irradiation when iron was present photolysis of 2 4 d with fe iii in the absence of h2o2 produced 17 degradation after 6 h of irradiation when the uv b filter was used all photo induced processes at neutral ph were significantly reduced at ph 3 6 and employing uv b a and visible irradiation the pf like process rapidly and completely degraded 2 4 d whereas results from hpp treatment were similar to those at ph 7 0 the experiments performed using 0 6 mg l 1 fe iii without h2o2 led to an increase in 2 4 d degradation with respect to that observed at neutral ph from 17 to 35 the use of uv b filter produced the same detrimental effect observed previously the ph remained constant at 3 6 throughout the test dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured at the end of the treatments at ph 7 0 uv b a visible hpp and pf like trials led to a doc decrease of 4 and 12 whereas at ph 3 6 the reductions were 9 and 77 respectively using the uv b filter the efficiency of the processes diminished it is nevertheless remarkable that a 60 removal of doc was achieved after 1 h of pf process at ph 3 6 fig 2 depicts the evolution of h2o2 consumption pf like trials at an initial ph 7 0 or 3 6 upon the uv b a visible irradiation showed the most important change with 88 of h2o2 removed after 6 h at ph 7 0 and 66 consumed after 1 h of treatment at ph 3 6 3 2 identification of chlorinated aromatic intermediates and degradation mechanism the intermediates identified and categorised by isotope profiling with integration of the metlin are summarized in supplementary data and table 1 intermediates identified and quantified during pf like and hpp processes were 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 2 chlorohydroquinone 2 chq 4 chlorocatechol 4 cc 4 6 dichlororesorcinol 4 6 dcr 3 5 dichlorocatechol 3 5 dcc 4 chlorophenol 4 cp the evolution of intermediate concentrations is depicted in figure s5 and s6 supplementary information for pf like and hpp treatment respectively the most predominant intermediate during the early stage of the breakdown was 2 4 dcp the hydroxyl radical oh attacked the c1 o bond of the aromatic ring leading to the loss of an alkoxy radical to form 2 4 dcp and glycolic acid peller et al 2004 kwan and chu 2004 see table 2 according to kwan and chu 2004 the oh may replace the chlorine atom of 2 4 dcp at two different positions para position to form 2 chlorohydroquinone or ortho position to form 4 chlorocatechol results in this study figures s4 and s5 in supplementary data show that oh radicals prefer to attack chlorophenols at para positions and form 2 chlorohydroquinone as was also reported by bandara et al 2001 and ma et al 2001 the electrophilic hydroxyl radical attacks the electron rich positions at the ortho and para sites however the oh attack at the para position may experience less steric strain than that at the ortho position and the inductive electron withdrawing effect of the chlorine atom might render attachment of the electrophilic hydroxyl radical to the ortho relative to the para position peller et al 2004 consequently para substitution overcomes ortho substitution resulting in a faster oxidation of 2 4 dcp to 2 chq s5 and s6 in supplementary data thus 2 chq may dissociate two hydrogen atoms to give 2 chloro 1 4 benzoquinone upon further hydroxyl radical attacks which proved undetectable in this case 2 4 dcp can be hydroxylated by hydroxyl radicals leading to the formation of 3 5 dichlorocatechol and 4 6 dichlororesorcinol these two by products would then undergo further hydroxylation however the intermediates were not detectable because they could be rapidly dehydrogenated to their corresponding quinone 4 cholorophenol was also detected probably being generated after dechlorinating 2 4 dcp the degradation pathways were proposed accordingly to illustrate a series of steps in the degradation of 2 4 d fig 3 although hydroquinone benzoquinone phenol and some carboxylic acids proposed as compounds generated during last steps of 2 4 d degradation pathway have been not identified it is fair to suggest that 2 4 d degradation could yield these by products specially during experiments carried out at acid ph values where high mineralization is achieved it is well known that chlorophenols such as 4 chlorophenol and 4 chlorocatechol can undergo upon photocatalytic reactions oh radical attack leading to the dechlorination and yielding hydroquinone and benzoquinone as main by products therefore both chemical substances can undergo ring opening producing aliphatic acids butanedioic and acetic acid prior to mineralization mylonas and papaconstantinou 1996 li et al 1999 lapertot et al 2006 3 3 abatement of 2 4 d under sunlight recirculation mode results obtained for the treatment of 10 mg l 1 2 4 d at both ph levels were similar and even slightly better in terms of 2 4 d degradation mineralization and h2o2 evolution than those obtained with the xe lamp data not shown this behaviour could be associated with the different experimental setup and or different irradiation source iron precipitation was detected on the inner walls of the recirculation tubing especially when silicon tubes were used and at neutral ph although the experimental system was carefully cleaned with acid after every trial minute quantities of iron may have remained adsorbed on the tube walls indeed small quantities of iron were found at the end of hpsp experiments performed at initial ph 7 ph dropped to 4 2 after 6 h of treatment and ph 3 6 even though no iron was added the case of hpsp at ph 3 6 was particularly remarkable total 2 4 d degradation and 32 of mineralization were reached after 3 h of treatment t3mw n 170 min but in xe lamp experiments the removal of 2 4 d and doc was only 85 and 9 respectively t3mw n 360 min at the end of this hpsp trial iron concentration was determined to be 0 07 mg l 1 which supports the hypothesis of iron desorption from the tube walls in order to evaluate the effect of this minute amount of fe iii on the pf like process an experiment was conducted under the previous conditions 10 mg l 1 2 4 d 20 mg l 1 h2o2 0 07 mg l 1 fe iii ph 3 6 and xe lamp irradiation uv intensity 3 mw cm 2 the time evolution of 2 4 d 2 4 dcp and h2o2 is shown in fig 4 the results were in agreement with those of the hpsp trial where 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp were totally eliminated after t3mw n 180 min the doc removal was approximately 32 and 35 40 of h2o2 was consumed at the end of the treatment the processes were further investigated at the more environmentally relevant initial concentration of 1 mg l 1 2 4 d in this case doc was not monitored due to analytical limitations in a first approach spf like 0 6 mg l 1 fe iii and hpsp treatments were investigated using initial h2o2 concentrations of 3 6 10 and 20 mg l 1 and initial ph 7 0 and 3 6 fig 5 results showed no significant differences between spf like and hpsp processes at neutral ph for each h2o2 concentration evaluated during 6 h of treatment t3mw n 310 340 min final ph for all the treatments ranged between 5 5 and 6 8 under these conditions iron dissolution can be neglected and hpsp process was likely the main contributor to 2 4 d oxidation faster degradation was observed with increasing initial h2o2 concentration up to 10 mg l 1 similar yields 90 were achieved after 6 h of treatment when 10 or 20 mg l 1 h2o2 was added the addition of 20 mg l 1 h2o2 appeared to display superior degradation kinetics initially however after 120 min of treatment both experiments 10 and 20 mg l 1 h2o2 behaved similarly the lower concentrations 3 and 6 mg l 1 did not reach removal to 2 4 d drinking water standards the concentration of 2 4 dcp and total iron at the end of hpsp trials at neutral ph were below the corresponding loqs for all experiments at neutral ph for most of spf like experiments h2o2 removal was slightly higher than in hpsp treatments except for the case of 20 mg l 1 concentration where this behaviour was only noticed at the beginning of the process approximately 80 50 30 and 20 of h2o2 were consumed during spf like treatments when 3 6 10 and 20 mg l 1 of this reagent was added as an initial concentration and the h2o2 consumed ranged from 2 5 to 3 6 mg l 1 thus no notable differences in total consumption of h2o2 were observed at ph 3 6 3 mg l 1 h2o2 were sufficient to achieve total 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp degradation after t3mw n 25 min of spf like process 0 6 mg l 1 fe iii same outcome was observed at t3mw n 110 min during the hpsp experiment at this ph however total iron at the end of the hpsp experiment was found to be 0 03 mg l 1 indicating that minute amounts of iron previously deposited on the tube walls leached under acidic conditions and was enough to produce the degradation of the pollutant and its by product by spf treatment under acidic conditions the h2o2 consumption was 60 and 35 when 0 6 and 0 03 mg l 1 of iron species were present respectively experiments of 2 4 d degradation in simulated groundwater were conducted with initial concentrations of 10 and 20 mg l 1 h2o2 fig 6 shows the results corresponding to the latter since it displayed the highest efficiency spf like and hpsp processes at neutral ph degraded close to 40 of 2 4 d after 6 h of treatment t3mw 335 min in simulated surface water while ph increased to around 8 acidification was required to achieve complete 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp abatement data for 2 4 dcp evolution not shown after t3mw n 35 min and doc elimination close to 50 the final h2o2 concentration was 15 mg l 1 the hpsp treatment 20 mg l 1 h2o2 at ph 3 6 resulted in 0 05 mg l 1 of total iron leached from the inner tube walls at the end of the test which practically converted it into a spf treatment with minute iron amounts the process achieved elimination of 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp in t3mw n 140 min and 35 mineralization the final h2o2 concentration was 17 5 mg l 1 4 discussion the results obtained when the xe lamp was used demonstrate that degradation of 2 4 d mainly occurs by hpp at neutral ph whereas under acidic conditions pf contributes significantly to the process at ph between 2 5 and 5 0 fe oh 2 is the main ferric hydroxy complex in aqueous solutions pignatello et al 2006 as described by eq 1 1 fe3 aq h2o l fe oh 2 aq h aq k 1 2 7 10 3 m fe oh 2 is a highly photo active ferric aqua complex with two important light absorption maximums at 297 nm ε 2030 m 1 cm 1 and 205 nm ε 4640 m 1 cm 1 pignatello et al 2006 gallard et al 1999 and enables the photo production of hydroxyl radicals by uv b a and visible light absorption following eq 2 2 fe oh 2 aq hν fe2 aq oh aq λ 290 410 nm thus in mildly acidic conditions and subjected to uv b a and visible irradiation these species contribute to 2 4 d abatement as observed in the control experiments performed with 2 4 d and fe iii at ph 3 6 moreover the complex fe oh 2 whose photochemistry is still not fully understood is present at ph values 5 0 and can also participate in the 2 4 d degradation at circumneutral ph as suggested by eq 2 similar h2o2 disappearance levels were achieved when uv b filter was used after 1 h of pf like treatment at ph 3 6 which indicates that uv a visible wavelengths were responsible for the photo induced reactions during this process when iron was dissolved inversely pf like trials performed at neutral ph presented a higher h2o2 consumption when uv b contributed to the process this indicates that uv b light promotes a higher photolysis of feooh 2 complex ε 0 33 using a medium pressure mercury arc lamp that produces ho2 and fe ii via eq 3 pignatello et al 2006 3 feooh 2 aq hν fe2 aq ho2 aq it is also noteworthy that 20 22 of final h2o2 consumption occurred during the hpp treatment at both studied ph values suggesting that ph variations from 3 6 to 7 do not play an important role in the process when the uv b filter was used the h2o2 consumption during the first 30 min was reduced by 50 and to 14 16 in 6 h at both ph values the experiments showed that uv b and uv a can photolyze h2o2 but under uv b h2o2 decomposition and 2 4 d elimination proceed much faster chlorinated phenols such as 3 5 dichlorocatechol 2 chlorohidroquinone and 4 chlorophenol were detected as intermediates during hpp and pf like processes at ph 3 6 and 7 0 there were no marked differences in the nature of by products generated by the processes at either ph value but dissimilarities were observed in the kinetics of by product abatement and their concentrations by products were generated to a lesser extent and they were removed faster during pf like process at low ph than at neutral ph value or during hpp treatment underscoring the improved performance of acidic pf processes for organic removal and suggesting that oh generation and attack was the main mineralization via during both treatments and ph values the results of the study corroborate the hypothesis that spf like process at acidic ph could be performed with minute concentrations of iron 0 07 0 6 mg l 1 found naturally in surface waters to reach efficient 2 4 d 2 4 dcp and doc removals in a milli q water matrix fig 4 and demonstrate the degradation of 1 mg l 1 2 4 d in a milli q or simulated surface water respectively applying spf process under acidic conditions ph 3 6 using minute fe iii concentrations 0 6 mg l 1 figs 5 and 6 for the removal of 1 mg l 1 2 4 d in milli q water only 3 mg l 1 h2o2 and 0 6 mg l 1 fe iii were necessary to reach 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp concentrations below the limit of quantification 2 4 d 0 007 mg l 1 and 2 4 dcp 0 009 mg l 1 in less than 30 min when a simulated surface water matrix was used a h2o2 concentration of 20 mg l 1 was necessary under the same reaction conditions therefore spf like process is able to reduce 2 4 d and 2 4 dcp concentrations to the maximum levels established by who 2003 2 4 d 0 030 mg l 1 and us epa 2015 2 4 dcp 0 010 mg l 1 however irradiation times longer than t3mw n 6 h were required at neutral ph to reach 2 4 d concentrations below 0 1 mg l 1 maximum contaminant level set by argentinean legislation for drinking water código alimentario argentino 2007 the lower herbicide abatement observed in simulated surface water matrix experiments can be associated mainly with the scavenger effect of inorganic anions as well as the competitive effect of the humic acids for ros produced interestingly during the spf like trials with humic acids at neutral ph iron remained in solution due to its coordination with these compounds georgi et al 2007 lipczynska kochany and kochany 2008 and was available to participate in photo fenton reactions as demonstrated by experiments performed with 1 mg l 1 2 4 d and 5 0 mg l 1 ha at neutral ph in the absence of the dissolved salts data not shown under these conditions the herbicide was completely eliminated after t3mw n 120 min and 180 min when initial h2o2 concentration was 20 and 10 mg l 1 respectively therefore the presence of ha accelerates 2 4 d degradation by keeping iron in solution at neutral ph however the increase in inorganic species concentrations led to a significant reduction on herbicide removal 5 conclusions results showed the feasibility of 2 4 d removal by hpsp which is the dominant mechanism of organic pollutant reduction during the spf like process at neutral ph the addition of h2o2 and direct exposure to solar light produces the removal of 2 4 d from surface water even in the presence of minute iron concentrations such as those found in natural waters spf like process by minute fe iii concentrations acidification may be required to increase the efficiency of the treatment depending on the characteristics of the water matrix acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support of consejo nacional de investigaciones cientificas y tecnicas conicet
