8380,study region this study focuses on the headwaters of the upper rio grande basin the pajarito plateau northern new mexico usa study focus our work examines 2050s water balance changes using the infil hydrologic model run under different downscaled earth system model esm projections to simulate impacts on runoff infiltration and overall water regime shifts new hydrological insights for the region climate change is shifting the water balance in the high desert of the us southwest across the pajarito plateau increases in temperature and changing precipitation form and delivery result in increased rain during winter spring and fall and decreased snow during winter 47 less snow is projected to fall esm projections of summer rainfall vary with increases and decreases possible high elevation recharge zones exhibit increased runoff and infiltration but across the region aridity also increases due to warmer temperatures this dichotomy illustrates the complexities in regional responses that occur across time and space and require a firm understanding to mitigate impacts on the region s ability to sustainably manage water resources within the next 30 years keywords water resources climate impacts southwest us high desert infiltration runoff 1 introduction water is an important commodity in northern new mexico and the amount timing and form of water received as precipitation i e snow to rain are rapidly changing in the face of climate variability and change garfin et al 2014 water resources are fundamental to a plethora of ecological municipal industrial agricultural recreational and societal needs across the region in particular the water resources on the pajarito plateau sustain the communities of los alamos and the operations of los alamos national laboratory lanl the region s largest employer the water from the headwaters of the pajarito plateau in the jemez mountains eventually finds its way into the rio grande which supplies water to santa fe and albuquerque then continues downstream to supply water to the state of texas and eventually mexico understanding changing water supplies in this region is fundamental to understanding future water usage and demand in addition to the impacts of changes on the quality and sustainability of water resources for the lanl property and its neighbors in nearby communities the rio grande is widely known as one of the most water stressed regions of the world munia et al 2016 qin et al 2019 unep dhi and unep 2016 in fact a number of studies place the rio grande known as the rio brava in mexico in the top 18 of globally water stressed rivers gassert et al 2013 water resources in the rio grande are rated to be at very high risk on a scale across multiple indicators including environmental human and agricultural water quantity stress and drought exposure these issues are projected to continue into the future unep dhi and unep 2016 with the potential for water conflicts for transboundary and downstream users munia et al 2016 because groundwater is believed to be sustained by very deep aquifers it is used in the region to meet water demand including the los alamos county and lanl kwicklis et al 2005 on the other hand groundwater resources are being used as water banks in some parts of new mexico where counties and cities rely instead upon surface water resources and store the groundwater for later usage sandoval solis et al 2010 surface water is also brought across the continental divide between the colorado river and the rio grande via the san juan chama project that delivers water for use by irrigators and the cities of santa fe and albuquerque bennett et al 2019 the water use and risk profile of the rio grande rajagopalan et al 2009 hence distinguishes it from other southwestern us regions such as the colorado river basin necessitating a focus on its water balance llewellyn and vaddey 2013 tidwell et al 2004 due to the climate in northern new mexico and large elevational gradients across the landscape the magnitude and timing of water fluxes are driven by both snow dominant winters and monsoon driven rain dominant summer weather patterns historically in the upper rio grande most of the surface water flow for the basin has been driven by high elevation snow packs that begin accumulating in october and november and melt out by june rango 2006 monsoonal rains begin in june and last until september providing more than half of the incoming precipitation to the region these rainfall events are short lived and much of the water is intercepted or evapotranspired due to high energy demands brandes and wilcox 2000 while also producing appreciable amounts of infiltration excess overland flow atchley et al 2018 wilcox et al 1997 appreciable infiltration of water that contributes to lateral subsurface flow on the plateau is governed by winter precipitation events these often fall as snow and melt out slowly permitting water to infiltrate directly rather than runoff liu et al 2008 although infiltration is a key process in this environment it is elusive to capture with accuracy therefore relatively few studies have focused on changes to infiltration in the upper rio grande basin under climate impacts elias et al 2015 llewellyn and vaddey 2013 historical trends in climate illustrate that the southwest has generally been in a drought state from the mid 1990s through 2016 with temperatures increasing dramatically by about 2 c higher than historic averages garfin et al 2014 trends also show minimum temperatures changing more than maximum temperatures indicating that nighttime temperatures have warmed much more than daytime temperatures kunkel et al 2013 historical precipitation changes for the southwest have been reported to be flat decreasing or increasing although trends for the state of new mexico indicate declining precipitation since the mid 1990s garfin et al 2014 groisman et al 2004 streamflow totals were found to be 23 lower between 2001 and 2010 than the 20th century average flows in the rio grande even though overall precipitation in the basin was 3 above normal hoerling et al 2013 this is indicative of overall decreasing trends in streamflow in the southwest united states this has largely been attributed to the increased evaporative demand linked to higher temperatures overwhelming the effects of increasing precipitation signals andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 udall and overpeck 2017 thus whether precipitation is increasing or decreasing may be irrelevant in the face of increasing temperatures and associated increasing evaporative demands future projections of climate and streamflow for the region indicate large shifts in water balances all climate models project warming for the region ranging from about 2 0 c 4 0 c by the 2050s garfin et al 2014 with the greatest warming projected for the summer projections of precipitation in contrast are uncertain and are dominated by inter model regional and seasonal variability while most climate model projections indicate decreasing precipitation in spring during summer fall and winter both increases and decreases are projected on average annual precipitation is projected to increase by 20 the largest increases and decreases are projected for spring and summer garfin et al 2014 changes in streamflow and snowpack indicate a reduction of late winter and spring snowpack and subsequent related reductions in runoff and soil moisture cayan et al 2010 the colorado river is projected to show streamflow reductions associated with climate change from 5 to 20 by mid century das et al 2011 reclamation 2011 vano et al 2012 additionally projections in streamflow show a marked reduction in spring snow accumulation in mountain watersheds across the southwestern us that becomes more pronounced over the decades of the 21st century seager and vecchi 2010 future streamflow projections for the rio grande basin indicate that the river volume will increase 7 or decrease 18 under wetter or drier scenarios however compared to historical conditions all future scenarios project earlier spring peak flow significantly different spring and summer monthly streamflow volume and large decreases in summer flows elias et al 2015 streamflow intermittency is projected to increase with impacts to ecology and fish in particular jaeger et al 2014 however these works do not focus on more elusive components of water balances such as infiltration processes in high mountain deserts where evapotranspiration processes are paramount and where snowpack plays a fundamental role the complex interplay between changing climate and the nature of how water translates into water balance in the landscape on the pajarito plateau requires modeling to capture the relationships between temperature precipitation form infiltration into the ground and runoff from the land infiltration is a particularly important and complex component of the water balance infiltration is also a concern for lanl due to the presence and required management of several legacy waste sites on and near the lanl property additionally in the recent past since 2000 large and devastating forest fires have occurred in the vicinity of the lanl site leading to strong disturbance responses across the landscape including shifts in sediment transport and erosion energy balance changes to albedo and transmissivity of the soils and subsequently forest cover recovery and replacement bennett et al 2018 vivoni et al 2008 wilcox et al 2003 the totality of fire and post fire processes may result in increased runoff and erosion reduced infiltration and reduced water quality atchley et al 2018 dahm et al 2015 martin and moody 2001 moody et al 2008 reale et al 2015 the changing north american monsoon nam plays an important role for summer time precipitation studies focused on the relationships between the nam vegetation and topography point to the influence of the nam on runoff generation and increased soil moisture mahmood and vivoni 2011 with possible weakened responses in this region over several decades prior to 2000 based on research from se arizona singer and michaelides 2017 thus understanding how these changes have altered the amount and rate of runoff and infiltration along with water quality is fundamental for current and future sustainable lanl operations with implications for broader impacts to the rio grande and water resources for the southwestern us this paper focuses on addressing how water resources are changing through the application of a simple infiltration model run under different scenarios of future temperature and precipitation on the pajarito plateau we describe the study site model and its implementation including model inputs and climate drivers used to validate the model and develop simulations we then describe the results of the validation and the modeled water balance resulting under historical and future climate conditions finally we discuss the major drivers of change and what these changes mean for the region including lanl operations we conclude with future research directions and outstanding questions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in the high desert region of northern new mexico on the slopes of the jemez mountains of the pajarito plateau which consists of a series of finger like mesas separated by deep canyons within the headwaters of the rio grande basin the study area elevation ranges from approximately 1889 m 2377 m above sea level birdsell et al 2005 dewart et al 2017 this creates a highly complex terrain and variable climate around the plateau soils consist of well drained materials that are variable in depth based on topographic position with deeper more developed soils found on north facing slopes and in canyon bottoms and shallower or non existent soils on south facing slopes and on mesa tops surficial bedrock in the region includes fractured rocks such as welded tuffs basalts and silicic lavas major fault zones also exist in the region for a more detailed description of the geology and fault zones of the region see kwicklis et al 2005 the city of los alamos pop 12 000 is located on the pajarito plateau approximately 40 km northwest of santa fe and 97 km north northeast of albuquerque lanl is situated adjacent to the town of los alamos the lanl property spans a large area of approximately 90 km2 for this work we analyzed a region of approximately 663 km2 around los alamos and lanl which encompasses the pajarito plateau region fig 1 bounded by the santa clara basin in the north the rio grande in the east the frijoles basin in the south and the jemez mountains and valles caldera in the west temperatures in and around the region are highly variable due to its dry climate resulting in winter daytime temperatures varying from 1 6 10 c and summer daytime temperatures from 23 8 29 4 c dewart et al 2017 the region receives an average of about 416 mm of precipitation annually about 173 mm are due to midlatitude westerly storms during the spring fall and winter seasons dewart et al 2017 while about 243 mm approximately 60 of total precipitation falls during the summer due to a seasonal shift in pressure and wind patterns known as the nam adams and comrie 1997 bowen 1996 vegetation in the region consists of aspen populus tremuloides and ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa in the higher elevations changing to piñon pinus edulis and juniper juniperus monosperma woodlands in the mid to low elevations and sagebrush shrublands at the lowest elevations large wildfires in the areas of the upper frijoles canyon cerro grande 2000 and the santa clara watershed 2011 caused extensive damage to property led to shifts in vegetation cover and resulted in changes to surface water hydrology in the years immediately following the fires koch et al 2001 2 2 infil model infil is a united states geological survey usgs grid based deterministic water balance model that estimates the spatial and temporal distribution of net infiltration in a watershed u s geological survey 2008 net infiltration is defined as the groundwater flux below the rooting depth which is estimated as the maximum depth below the ground surface affected by evapotranspiration u s geological survey 2008 an important advantage of infil is that it uses physical characteristics of the study basin to provide a deterministic representation of the effects of climate and root zone hydrological processes on infiltration in infil the pajarito plateau study domain is discretized into 60 m by 60 m grid cells each cell has a soil type with associated soil properties a soil depth and an underlying bedrock type with associated geologic properties depending on the soil depth for each cell the study domain is vertically discretized into a maximum of five root zone layers to account for differences in root density and root zone water content as a function of depth fig 2 the water balance for each cell is calculated with a daily time step in which water enters the cell through rainfall snowmelt and run on and exits the cell through evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff i e δ s t o r a g e r a i n s n o w m e l t r u n o n e t i n f i l t r a t i o n r u n o f f snowmelt occurs when the maximum daily air temperature is above 0 c and is determined based on an empirical temperature index model gray and prowse 1993 which is a function of the maximum daily temperature and an empirical snowmelt rate parameter that corresponds to the early or late spring snowmelt period daily potential evapotranspiration is calculated with the priestley taylor equation which uses an hourly solar radiation model to simulate daily net radiation daily evapotranspiration is estimated using an empirical function of the root zone water content and potential evapotranspiration under saturated conditions infiltration through root zone layers is determined by the maximum infiltration capacity which is calculated using the saturated hydraulic conductivity modified by the duration of rain or snowmelt under unsaturated conditions infiltration is determined with a modified form of an empirical drainage model that approximates water contents and the depth of the wetting front jury et al 1991 pp 144 150 any water entering a cell that is in excess of the infiltration capacity and that does not drain to the underlying layer is used in subsequent calculations to calculate runoff and the final distribution of water content after uptake by evapotranspiration run on to each cell is defined as runoff from the upstream cells infil makes several assumptions in modeling the root zone hydrological processes in each grid cell water is assumed to move vertically downward into the bedrock so lateral subsurface flow is not accounted for in the model all of the simulated runoff is assumed to discharge from the drainage basin or infiltrate into the root zone in the daily time step so the model assumes a short lag time between runoff generation and surface water runoff which is a reasonable assumption for this high desert study area with steep elevation gradients infil simplifies the physics of the rain on snow process so that rain infiltrates as if there was no snowpack present in addition infil assumes recharge occurs as gravity drainage under a unit gradient infil does not include interception of rainfall by vegetation nor does it include the effect of capillary forces on unsaturated flow a full description of the model is given in u s geological survey 2008 2 3 model inputs model inputs to infil include elevation soils data geology and vegetation we use the national elevation dataset ned gesch et al 2009 digital elevation model dem fig 3 a which was pre processed in arcgis to produce aspect flow accumulation and flow directions not shown soils data were obtained from the digital general soil map of the united states statsgo2 soil database from the united states department of agriculture usda figure 3b c we chose the lower resolution statsgo2 soil data over the higher resolution ssurgo soil data to maintain consistency across the study domain infil requires five soil hydraulic properties as inputs for each grid cell porosity saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity a soil drainage function coefficient field capacity and wilting point soil depth figure 3b c was determined based on an empirical equation that depends on slope elevation and flow accumulation derived from the distributed soil and vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 calculations for these soil properties are included in the supplemental information si surficial geology fig 3d was obtained from the new mexico geologic survey nmgs infil requires three hydraulic properties as inputs to represent geology in each grid cell porosity saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity and unsaturated vertical hydraulic conductivity these properties were estimated by mapping the nmgs geology to categories used in hevesi et al 2003 which contains detailed geologic information for rock types for the pajarito plateau geospatial vegetation data fig 3e were extracted from the multi agency landfire program rollins 2009 we set up infil with landfire vegetation data from 2014 which were collected after the vegetation disturbances caused by large forest fires namely the cerro grande fire in 2000 and the las conchas fire in 2011 the landfire data are freely available for download in a 30 m by 30 m grid format we resampled the data to 60 m by 60 m in arcgis vegetation classes in landfire were re mapped to vegetation classes used in an infiltration model developed for the death valley region hevesi et al 2003 which contains information for vegetation parameters including rooting depths rooting depths into bedrock when rooting depth is greater than total soil depth and rooting densities for six different soil horizons table 5 in hevesi et al 2003 vegetation density or cover not shown originated from the landfire program as well rollins 2009 landfire lists ranges of vegetation cover whereas infil requires a single number thus we assigned the mean value for each vegetation cover class e g 15 for the range 10 20 for developed areas such as roads and buildings we assume 0 cover the percent vegetation cover is used to estimate the root density in the root zone for example a vegetation density of 30 typically corresponds to a root density of 30 in the shallowest soil zone a vegetation density of 40 corresponds to a root density of 40 etc more detailed information on parameters and initial conditions used in the infil model implementation is provided in the si 2 4 historical and future climate data infil requires three daily climate inputs precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature our historical climatic data came from eight climate stations inside and nearby our study area table 1 and from a suite of downscaled earth system models esms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 livneh et al 2015 taylor et al 2012 six of the historical climate stations are global historical climate network ghcn stations while the remaining two are lanl stations the lanl stations had 15 minute observations that were aggregated into daily observations and the ghcn stations had only daily observations for all of the stations we omitted outliers based on our analysis of maximum precipitation and temperature ranges we excluded any records of daily precipitation recordings that exceeded 90 mm since the maximum recorded daily precipitation at the los alamos station is 89 4 mm dewart et al 2017 we also omitted maximum temperature recordings that exceeded 45 6 c or 10 c above the maximum recorded temperature at the los alamos station and minimum temperatures that fell below 37 8 c or 10 c below the minimum recorded temperature at the los alamos station dewart et al 2017 a suite of 20 esms and global climate models gcms downscaled using the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs data set maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 was utilized in this work the maca data are available online and can be downloaded for a regional area http maca northwestknowledge net we used representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 simulations from the maca database see van vuuren et al 2011 for details on rcps used in cmip5 we focus on rcp 8 5 because it is the concentration pathway trajectory we are currently following le quéré et al 2015 the gcm esm realizations and scenario are collectively referred to as scenarios based on the range of responses in the larger suite of data four esms were selected to represent the range of precipitation and temperature changes present across the region inmcm4 noresm1 m miroc esm and miroc esm chem one additional esm was added to support the budyko analysis hadgem2 cc365 the esms were selected to represent scenarios of change in precipitation such as wetter and hotter or drier and warmer changes two of the esms noresm1 m miroc esm chem were within one standard deviation of the ensemble mean while the inmcm4 model was slightly outside one standard deviation however miroc esm which was selected to represent a wetter precipitation scenario was beyond one standard deviation projected climates scenarios were then used as inputs for infil to simulate future infiltration and runoff the historical period spanned a 30 year range from 1970 to 1999 1980s while the future period spanned the same range 70 years later 2040 2069 2050s approximately 30 years into the future from the time the study was implemented 2 5 model validation model validation was carried out using two approaches infiltration observations compiled by kwicklis et al 2005 and used in the development of an infiltration map for the pajarito plateau were compared to infil infiltration estimates from this study the kwicklis et al 2005 observations are shown in table 2 along with the infil estimated infiltration these infiltration observations are compiled from peer reviewed journal articles and internal lanl reports birdsell et al 2005 newman et al 1997a newman 1996 newman et al 1997b robinson et al 2000 rogers et al 1996a b vold 1997 and based on several methods including chloride mass balance methods direct application of the richard s equation using observed moisture content and model comparisons to observed borehole moisture content profiles in locations where infiltration observations changed with depth a range is presented in table 2 the maximum infiltration observation is used in the comparative statistics see results our second method of validation was to compare daily infil estimated runoff with observed streamflow gages as many of the systems in the pajarito plateau are ephemeral these systems respond mainly to summer time rainfall events that are short lived and are dry during other times of the year thus we focused on comparing observed streamflow with modeled runoff from three wet canyons water canyon los alamos canyon and frijoles canyon for the historical period january 1st 1997 2010 and 1997 until 2019 respectively average january baseflow values were subtracted from the streamflow observations we examined the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 r2 values and root mean squared error rmse daily statistics for these three systems to evaluate infil s performance 2 6 budyko analysis to represent how changes in climate impact the amount of water available for surface processes we present our results in a budyko framework budyko et al 1974 relating the aridity index to the water availability ratio et p the aridity index is a hydro climatic indicator that measures the ratio of potential evapotranspiration pet to precipitation p which in turn is related to the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation et p or water availability ratio in a given system li et al 2019 yang et al 2008 pet is defined as the theoretical maximum of et given an assumed condition of no water deficit and is based on solar radiation wind speed and humidity it should also be noted that the water availability ratio is inversely related to the water available p et for surface processes like runoff or groundwater infiltration the budyko framework allows us to understand how changes in precipitation et and pet jointly impact the hydrology of the region further we can use our results to fit a curve for this relationship using the choudhury yang equation yang et al 2008 as formulated f ϕ 1 1 ϕ n 1 n where φ is the aridity index n is a dimensionless constant specific to basin characteristics and f φ is the et p ratio thus by linearly fitting the change in aridity and change in precipitation and fitting the choudhury yang equation we can estimate the change in water availability ratio et and the total amount of water available for runoff p et for the remaining gcm suite 3 results 3 1 infil validation the average observed infiltration estimates from the pajarito plateau was 14 9 mm yr with a standard deviation of 45 7 mm yr table 2 kwicklis et al 2005 many of the observations are tightly clustered around specific sites at lanl but show extremely variable estimates of infiltration due to the concentrated natured of the sites we grouped the estimates into five regions canada del buey mortandad canyon mesita del buey technical area 16 ta 16 and frijoles mesa fig 4 we then compared the average infiltration estimate against the average infil estimate for those regions r2 0 46 rmse 19 2 mm yr kwicklis et al 2005 estimated an average infiltration rate for the entire pajarito plateau region of 20 2 mm yr while infil results in an infiltration rate of 25 4 mm yr with the largest differences in infiltration occurring in the upper basin where little observed data is available observed daily streamflow data at three sites water canyon los alamos canyon and frijoles canyon showed coherence with infil runoff estimates 0 72 0 64 0 60 r2 and 0 70 0 41 and 0 54 m3 s rmse respectively fig 5 kge statistics were not as robust as r2 or rmse values owing to the difficult nature of capturing precipitation data across the region which led to lower values due to a lack of peak matching ability in our model 0 37 0 42 and 1 47 respectively improved observations of infiltration are being developed for the site and will be available for future work as we discuss in the conclusion 3 2 climate the average monthly climatology 1970 1999 for the average of the eight historical climate stations and all 4 gcm esms are compared in fig 6 a and b similarities reflect both the use of these climate stations in the gridded data formulation and also the bias correction applied in the maca data processing abatzoglou and brown 2012 livneh et al 2015 the envelope illustrating the range of responses around the esms is consistent for minimum and maximum monthly daily temperature monthly precipitation averages are more variable for winter and summer months fig 6b for each of the four selected esms the future climate 2040 2069 was then examined to assess future changes in monthly minimum and maximum temperature and monthly average precipitation fig 6c f all esms showed significant future warming for the pajarito plateau region ranging from an annual increase in average temperature of 2 5 3 5 c with a mean projected annual average temperature increase of 3 1 c and differences across the scenarios occurring mostly in winter and spring fig 6c f the multi gcm esm ensemble projected little change in average annual precipitation 0 5 mm yr however the individual gcm esm responses ranged from 43 0 mm yr to 44 0 mm yr with a standard deviation of 41 2 mm yr confirming that projections of future precipitation are more uncertain than those of temperature bennett et al 2012 trenberth 2011 both wetter i e miroc esm chem fig 6c and drier i e inmcm4 and noresm1 m fig 6e future conditions compared to historical climate are projected for the pajarito plateau see above a bulk of this variability is due to uncertainty in summer precipitation see fig 6c f with standard deviations for future precipitation projections across esms during summer months june july august 8 7 mm month much higher than winter months december january february 2 5 mm month 3 3 future projections of water balances spatial changes in temperature precipitation runoff and infiltration between historical and projected future climate model simulations for each esm are shown in figs 7 and 8 temperature increases are widespread and consistent across the pajarito plateau with inmcm4 fig 7a1 projecting the lowest increase in temperature 2 1 c and miroc esm chem fig 8a1 projecting the highest 4 4 c both inmcm4 42 5 mm yr and noresm1 m 23 8 mm yr exhibit precipitation decreases while miroc esm chem 25 4 mm yr figure 8b2 and miroc esm 41 3 mm yr fig 7b1 show increases in annual precipitation in all esms the largest changes in precipitation occur in the high elevation regions of the domain fig 7 8 similarly although more pronounced changes in runoff are much larger at high elevations across the esms fig 7 fig 8c three of the esms show an average annual increase in runoff only inmcm4 which projects the largest decrease in precipitation and the smallest increase in temperature exhibits a decrease in annual runoff 11 1 mm yr for the region infiltration shows a similar pattern to runoff increasing on average according to the same three esms fig 7 fig 8d again inmcm4 shows the only average annual decrease in infiltration 8 7 mm yr spatial patterns in the changes of runoff and infiltration were consistent across esms annual runoff and infiltration increase at the high elevations in three of the four esms and generally decrease at lower elevations in all four esms both noresm1 m and miroc esm chem exhibit this spatial pattern despite divergent changes in annual precipitation the spatial pattern of infiltration at high elevations across the pajarito plateau varies dependent on aspect soil type and vegetation cover fig 9 shows monthly fluxes of rainfall snowmelt runoff and infiltration for the four esms as well as the multi model mean during the winter spring and fall the largest water balance changes are due to increased rainfall and decreased snowmelt snowmelt decreases by 47 on average across the esms green and turquoise lines in fig 9 respectively rainfall during summer months varies dependent on the esm with increases 17 mm month miroc esm chem and decreases 19 mm month inmcm4 projected during the monsoon season runoff largely follows rainfall if rainfall increases so does runoff infiltration increases slightly during winter spring and fall 1 9 0 7 and 2 4 mm increases in multi model mean respectively but does not increase in response 2 1 mm month to summer rainfall changes when evapotranspiration or runoff processes instead act to remove this water from the system fig 9 during winter spring and fall infiltration responds to frontal rains that fall over longer periods of time and are able to make their way into the soils as opposed to summer rain that falls intensely over shorter durations of hours or even minutes fig 10 shows the aridity index pet p and water availability ratio plotted for future and historical esm projections under the budyko framework a common means of relating these variables the difference between the future and historical scenarios shows large 0 01 to 0 51 in the aridity index with relatively smaller changes 02 to 02 in the water availability ratio four of the five esms show increasing aridity 0 12 to 0 51 while miroc esm the wettest model considered here shows only a slight decrease in aridity 0 01 the future scenarios in fig 10 are shaded according to the average change in precipitation from future to historical both hadgem2 cc365 and miroc esm chem show increasing aridity in the future despite an increase in annual precipitation demonstrating the effect of changes in temperature on aridity and pet changes in the water availability ratio are not solely attributed to the changes in climate projected by the esms as three of the five esms show a decrease in the et p ratio an increase in available water despite two of these models increasing in aridity fig 10 this suggests that there may be important changes in the pathways of precipitation such that increases in pet are not met with a proportional increase in actual et the infil results show that changes in precipitation form from snow to rain cause an increase in infiltration which would negatively influence the et p ratio e g fig 9 furthermore seasonal differences in the projected precipitation of the four esm s could influence how much of the annual precipitation is evaporated projected changes in annual precipitation are highly correlated with changes in aridity index r2 1 0 and can be reasonably linearly fit rmse 0 95 mm precipitation thus we can estimate the change in aridity for each of the 20 cmip5 gcm esm models based solely on the projected change in precipitation as listed in table 3 the simple linear fit illustrates that despite many models projecting an increase in precipitation only canesm2 projects a decrease in aridity when considering all gcm esms the mean projected aridity change is 0 25 using these results we can then estimate the et p ratio using the choudhury yang equation yang et al 2008 using the modeled results from infil we estimate n 1 91 based on the historical mean of aridity index 2 50 and et p 0 90 across the gcm esms we have used table 4 then using the projected change in aridity based on our linear fit of precipitation changes and the historic aridity index we estimate the future water availability ratio to increase water availability to decrease a difference that translates to a 15 reduction in the total available water p et based on the average projected change in precipitation and the projected change in et p table 4 4 discussion climate models project that temperatures over the pajarito plateau indicate will increase up to 4 c by the 2050s assuming that current emissions will continue unabated as projected under scenario rcp8 5 model projections of precipitation are variable with both increases or decreases possible average monthly difference of 3 6 to 3 5 mm month with a standard deviation of 5 5 mm month scenario selection for the infil model was based on a suite of downscaled climate models therefore wet and dry esm scenarios were chosen to understand how water balances across the region respond the bulk of disagreement between esms is observed during the summer monthly average standard deviation 8 7 mm month in june july august when precipitation is dominated by convective rains occurring as part of nam which are poorly represented in esms kendon et al 2017 prein et al 2015 singer and michaelides 2017 during the winter however differences between the models are smaller monthly average standard deviation of 2 5 in december january february with projected increases in rainfall and decreases in snowmelt for the pajarito plateau increasing infiltration and runoff occur in the regions of the watershed believed to be recharge zones i e high elevation regions of the pajarito plateau to deeper aquifer systems on the plateau birdsell et al 2005 kwicklis et al 2005 limitations of infil include a lack of lateral groundwater flow components and or complex perched aquifer systems which are common in this region this means we cannot compare to the groundwater responses to the simulated infiltration as we may be missing components of the surface groundwater connections streamflow responses can be challenging to validate because infil is not designed to capture single cell response i e runoff of 60 by 60 m cell was compared to flow through a stream gauge that covered much less than 60 m and because runoff is assumed to be routed through the entire domain in one day which may not reflect observed streamflow other issues that are not addressed in our approach include the inability to model a major fault system present in the region that could impact runoff in addition there are numerous springs downstream of the fault system and elsewhere in the domain that feed into streams and runoff so not all measured streamflow can be directly accounted for by incoming precipitation events lastly the dominant patterns of intermittent and low flow conditions exhibited at most of the streams in the region are difficult to capture with accuracy even with process based simulation approaches one important note is that infil was not specifically calibrated owing to the issues discussed above calibration to poor quality observations may lead to tuning the model inaccurately beven 2005 gupta et al 2012 infil validation was achieved through two approaches through comparison with previous studies of infiltration on the pajarito plateau and also through comparison with streamflow observations at several wet canyons infil infiltration estimates for the historical period have similar spatial distribution and magnitude of infiltration rates r2 0 46 rmse 19 2 mm yr as previous spatial estimates of infiltration kwicklis et al 2005 the kwicklis et al 2005 infiltration map was developed with estimates of infiltration based on the richard s equation the chloride mass balance method and numerical modeling and extrapolated to cover uncharacterized areas with spatial algorithms that use environmental variables such as topography vegetation cover and geology streamflow validation at several wet canyons showed that infil runoff estimates are similar r2 0 7 rmse 0 55 m3 s therefore despite infil s limitations the uncalibrated infil represents the spatial and temporal variations in runoff and infiltration present across the study region the trend toward increasing future aridity demonstrated in the budyko analysis can be attributed to increases in evaporative demand due to increasing future temperatures fu and feng 2014 sherwood and fu 2014 the results show that despite a range of projected precipitation in both sign and magnitude aridity is projected to increase due to increasing pet driven by changes in projected temperature however the budyko analysis also indicates that although pet is likely to increase it may not be met with a proportional increase in actual et strong correlations between the change in water availability ratio with winter precipitation and infiltration suggest that changes in the distribution of precipitation throughout the year are partially responsible for the unexpected decrease in the et p ratio the results suggest that et p is more sensitive to changes in winter precipitation than summer as water is less likely to evaporate in winter due to cooler temperatures and more likely to infiltrate thus the amount of available water is also sensitive to changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation that may not be reflected in the aridity index it should be noted that changes to seasonal distribution of precipitation or changes in water pathways are not considered in the choudhury yang generated estimate of et p while these factors are important projected changes in the distribution and magnitude of annual precipitation are highly uncertain while changes driven by temperature are much more consistent across gcm esms the positive shift in pet and aridity is nearly unanimous across all gcm esms as projected changes in temperature increase for all models given the positive correlation between aridity and the water availability ratio it is likely that a larger fraction of the precipitation in the pajarito plateau area will be evaporated resulting in a reduction in the water available for vegetation good et al 2017 and human use this seasonal distribution of precipitation is largely reflected in a reduction in snow and a conversion of snow to rain a reduction in snow is supported by other research that shows snow water equivalent swe is in decline across the western united states clow 2010 pierce et al 2008 changes in swe especially at low elevations within the pajarito plateau are largely attributed to temperature increase rather than changes in precipitation hamlet et al 2005 mote et al 2005 highlighting the importance of temperature increases in shifts in water regimes because snowmelt tends to infiltrate or sublimate in the semi arid environments near the pajarito plateau liu et al 2008 reductions in snow may have a larger impact on infiltration compared to changes in summer precipitation signals however for the esms exhibiting small overall precipitation changes the flux between increased winter spring and fall rain and decreased snow leads to an overall slight increase in runoff and infiltration which is interesting despite the shift towards decreased precipitation annually on the other hand models which project precipitation either strongly decreasing inmcm4 42 9 mm yr or increasing miroc esm 26 2 mm yr miroc esm chem 43 9 mm yr show decreases and increases in overall runoff and infiltration respectively while esms that decrease less moderately noresm2 25 3 mm yr in terms of precipitation also increase in runoff and infiltration the lack of coherence between infiltration runoff and precipitation shifts highlight the importance in modeling these interactions to understand their nuances and points to the fact that the delivery in terms of the form and rate of precipitation is as important if not more important that the overall amount we also observe that the location of changes in infiltration patterns is potentially more important than the changes in overall average increase or decrease in precipitation since increases in recharge zones will be of greater importance to overall amounts and quality of water moving through the system 5 conclusion changes in infiltration and runoff have strong implications for water quality and quantity at lanl and in the region as a whole water resources in the region are paramount our major findings indicate that the amount of available water for processes such as infiltration and runoff is sensitive to changes in the season distribution of precipitation that may not be reflected in the aridity index we also find that the delivery in terms of the form and rate of precipitation is as important if not more important than the overall amount of precipitation which emphasizes the need for improved understanding of how future precipitation form will change in the region and particularly the amount and timing of those changes in snow and rain across the region changes in snow rain and aridity across the region will affect cities operations and resources that rely on a consistent high quality and sustainable water resource major facilities like lanl are beginning to realize the importance of understanding the threats that higher aridity will bring to such expansion including increased chances of more frequent and larger forest fires higher demand for cooling and increased concerns around heat exposure finally if increased infiltration and runoff occur during winter fall and spring this may lead to higher instances of erosion for the region this enhanced water cycle may influence movement and transport of sediments including surficial materials and soils across the pajarito plateau future work will include incorporating the impacts of changing vegetation for the region investigating different statistical and dynamical approaches to downscaling singer and michaelides 2017 singer et al 2018 zobel et al 2018 and employing higher resolution models to uncover the impacts of shifting climate and changing land cover on the processes of runoff and infiltration at specific locations on the lanl property and across the pajarito plateau region we also will incorporate collection of in situ field data of soils properties and infiltration estimates across the pajarito plateau future work may

8380,study region this study focuses on the headwaters of the upper rio grande basin the pajarito plateau northern new mexico usa study focus our work examines 2050s water balance changes using the infil hydrologic model run under different downscaled earth system model esm projections to simulate impacts on runoff infiltration and overall water regime shifts new hydrological insights for the region climate change is shifting the water balance in the high desert of the us southwest across the pajarito plateau increases in temperature and changing precipitation form and delivery result in increased rain during winter spring and fall and decreased snow during winter 47 less snow is projected to fall esm projections of summer rainfall vary with increases and decreases possible high elevation recharge zones exhibit increased runoff and infiltration but across the region aridity also increases due to warmer temperatures this dichotomy illustrates the complexities in regional responses that occur across time and space and require a firm understanding to mitigate impacts on the region s ability to sustainably manage water resources within the next 30 years keywords water resources climate impacts southwest us high desert infiltration runoff 1 introduction water is an important commodity in northern new mexico and the amount timing and form of water received as precipitation i e snow to rain are rapidly changing in the face of climate variability and change garfin et al 2014 water resources are fundamental to a plethora of ecological municipal industrial agricultural recreational and societal needs across the region in particular the water resources on the pajarito plateau sustain the communities of los alamos and the operations of los alamos national laboratory lanl the region s largest employer the water from the headwaters of the pajarito plateau in the jemez mountains eventually finds its way into the rio grande which supplies water to santa fe and albuquerque then continues downstream to supply water to the state of texas and eventually mexico understanding changing water supplies in this region is fundamental to understanding future water usage and demand in addition to the impacts of changes on the quality and sustainability of water resources for the lanl property and its neighbors in nearby communities the rio grande is widely known as one of the most water stressed regions of the world munia et al 2016 qin et al 2019 unep dhi and unep 2016 in fact a number of studies place the rio grande known as the rio brava in mexico in the top 18 of globally water stressed rivers gassert et al 2013 water resources in the rio grande are rated to be at very high risk on a scale across multiple indicators including environmental human and agricultural water quantity stress and drought exposure these issues are projected to continue into the future unep dhi and unep 2016 with the potential for water conflicts for transboundary and downstream users munia et al 2016 because groundwater is believed to be sustained by very deep aquifers it is used in the region to meet water demand including the los alamos county and lanl kwicklis et al 2005 on the other hand groundwater resources are being used as water banks in some parts of new mexico where counties and cities rely instead upon surface water resources and store the groundwater for later usage sandoval solis et al 2010 surface water is also brought across the continental divide between the colorado river and the rio grande via the san juan chama project that delivers water for use by irrigators and the cities of santa fe and albuquerque bennett et al 2019 the water use and risk profile of the rio grande rajagopalan et al 2009 hence distinguishes it from other southwestern us regions such as the colorado river basin necessitating a focus on its water balance llewellyn and vaddey 2013 tidwell et al 2004 due to the climate in northern new mexico and large elevational gradients across the landscape the magnitude and timing of water fluxes are driven by both snow dominant winters and monsoon driven rain dominant summer weather patterns historically in the upper rio grande most of the surface water flow for the basin has been driven by high elevation snow packs that begin accumulating in october and november and melt out by june rango 2006 monsoonal rains begin in june and last until september providing more than half of the incoming precipitation to the region these rainfall events are short lived and much of the water is intercepted or evapotranspired due to high energy demands brandes and wilcox 2000 while also producing appreciable amounts of infiltration excess overland flow atchley et al 2018 wilcox et al 1997 appreciable infiltration of water that contributes to lateral subsurface flow on the plateau is governed by winter precipitation events these often fall as snow and melt out slowly permitting water to infiltrate directly rather than runoff liu et al 2008 although infiltration is a key process in this environment it is elusive to capture with accuracy therefore relatively few studies have focused on changes to infiltration in the upper rio grande basin under climate impacts elias et al 2015 llewellyn and vaddey 2013 historical trends in climate illustrate that the southwest has generally been in a drought state from the mid 1990s through 2016 with temperatures increasing dramatically by about 2 c higher than historic averages garfin et al 2014 trends also show minimum temperatures changing more than maximum temperatures indicating that nighttime temperatures have warmed much more than daytime temperatures kunkel et al 2013 historical precipitation changes for the southwest have been reported to be flat decreasing or increasing although trends for the state of new mexico indicate declining precipitation since the mid 1990s garfin et al 2014 groisman et al 2004 streamflow totals were found to be 23 lower between 2001 and 2010 than the 20th century average flows in the rio grande even though overall precipitation in the basin was 3 above normal hoerling et al 2013 this is indicative of overall decreasing trends in streamflow in the southwest united states this has largely been attributed to the increased evaporative demand linked to higher temperatures overwhelming the effects of increasing precipitation signals andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 udall and overpeck 2017 thus whether precipitation is increasing or decreasing may be irrelevant in the face of increasing temperatures and associated increasing evaporative demands future projections of climate and streamflow for the region indicate large shifts in water balances all climate models project warming for the region ranging from about 2 0 c 4 0 c by the 2050s garfin et al 2014 with the greatest warming projected for the summer projections of precipitation in contrast are uncertain and are dominated by inter model regional and seasonal variability while most climate model projections indicate decreasing precipitation in spring during summer fall and winter both increases and decreases are projected on average annual precipitation is projected to increase by 20 the largest increases and decreases are projected for spring and summer garfin et al 2014 changes in streamflow and snowpack indicate a reduction of late winter and spring snowpack and subsequent related reductions in runoff and soil moisture cayan et al 2010 the colorado river is projected to show streamflow reductions associated with climate change from 5 to 20 by mid century das et al 2011 reclamation 2011 vano et al 2012 additionally projections in streamflow show a marked reduction in spring snow accumulation in mountain watersheds across the southwestern us that becomes more pronounced over the decades of the 21st century seager and vecchi 2010 future streamflow projections for the rio grande basin indicate that the river volume will increase 7 or decrease 18 under wetter or drier scenarios however compared to historical conditions all future scenarios project earlier spring peak flow significantly different spring and summer monthly streamflow volume and large decreases in summer flows elias et al 2015 streamflow intermittency is projected to increase with impacts to ecology and fish in particular jaeger et al 2014 however these works do not focus on more elusive components of water balances such as infiltration processes in high mountain deserts where evapotranspiration processes are paramount and where snowpack plays a fundamental role the complex interplay between changing climate and the nature of how water translates into water balance in the landscape on the pajarito plateau requires modeling to capture the relationships between temperature precipitation form infiltration into the ground and runoff from the land infiltration is a particularly important and complex component of the water balance infiltration is also a concern for lanl due to the presence and required management of several legacy waste sites on and near the lanl property additionally in the recent past since 2000 large and devastating forest fires have occurred in the vicinity of the lanl site leading to strong disturbance responses across the landscape including shifts in sediment transport and erosion energy balance changes to albedo and transmissivity of the soils and subsequently forest cover recovery and replacement bennett et al 2018 vivoni et al 2008 wilcox et al 2003 the totality of fire and post fire processes may result in increased runoff and erosion reduced infiltration and reduced water quality atchley et al 2018 dahm et al 2015 martin and moody 2001 moody et al 2008 reale et al 2015 the changing north american monsoon nam plays an important role for summer time precipitation studies focused on the relationships between the nam vegetation and topography point to the influence of the nam on runoff generation and increased soil moisture mahmood and vivoni 2011 with possible weakened responses in this region over several decades prior to 2000 based on research from se arizona singer and michaelides 2017 thus understanding how these changes have altered the amount and rate of runoff and infiltration along with water quality is fundamental for current and future sustainable lanl operations with implications for broader impacts to the rio grande and water resources for the southwestern us this paper focuses on addressing how water resources are changing through the application of a simple infiltration model run under different scenarios of future temperature and precipitation on the pajarito plateau we describe the study site model and its implementation including model inputs and climate drivers used to validate the model and develop simulations we then describe the results of the validation and the modeled water balance resulting under historical and future climate conditions finally we discuss the major drivers of change and what these changes mean for the region including lanl operations we conclude with future research directions and outstanding questions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in the high desert region of northern new mexico on the slopes of the jemez mountains of the pajarito plateau which consists of a series of finger like mesas separated by deep canyons within the headwaters of the rio grande basin the study area elevation ranges from approximately 1889 m 2377 m above sea level birdsell et al 2005 dewart et al 2017 this creates a highly complex terrain and variable climate around the plateau soils consist of well drained materials that are variable in depth based on topographic position with deeper more developed soils found on north facing slopes and in canyon bottoms and shallower or non existent soils on south facing slopes and on mesa tops surficial bedrock in the region includes fractured rocks such as welded tuffs basalts and silicic lavas major fault zones also exist in the region for a more detailed description of the geology and fault zones of the region see kwicklis et al 2005 the city of los alamos pop 12 000 is located on the pajarito plateau approximately 40 km northwest of santa fe and 97 km north northeast of albuquerque lanl is situated adjacent to the town of los alamos the lanl property spans a large area of approximately 90 km2 for this work we analyzed a region of approximately 663 km2 around los alamos and lanl which encompasses the pajarito plateau region fig 1 bounded by the santa clara basin in the north the rio grande in the east the frijoles basin in the south and the jemez mountains and valles caldera in the west temperatures in and around the region are highly variable due to its dry climate resulting in winter daytime temperatures varying from 1 6 10 c and summer daytime temperatures from 23 8 29 4 c dewart et al 2017 the region receives an average of about 416 mm of precipitation annually about 173 mm are due to midlatitude westerly storms during the spring fall and winter seasons dewart et al 2017 while about 243 mm approximately 60 of total precipitation falls during the summer due to a seasonal shift in pressure and wind patterns known as the nam adams and comrie 1997 bowen 1996 vegetation in the region consists of aspen populus tremuloides and ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa in the higher elevations changing to piñon pinus edulis and juniper juniperus monosperma woodlands in the mid to low elevations and sagebrush shrublands at the lowest elevations large wildfires in the areas of the upper frijoles canyon cerro grande 2000 and the santa clara watershed 2011 caused extensive damage to property led to shifts in vegetation cover and resulted in changes to surface water hydrology in the years immediately following the fires koch et al 2001 2 2 infil model infil is a united states geological survey usgs grid based deterministic water balance model that estimates the spatial and temporal distribution of net infiltration in a watershed u s geological survey 2008 net infiltration is defined as the groundwater flux below the rooting depth which is estimated as the maximum depth below the ground surface affected by evapotranspiration u s geological survey 2008 an important advantage of infil is that it uses physical characteristics of the study basin to provide a deterministic representation of the effects of climate and root zone hydrological processes on infiltration in infil the pajarito plateau study domain is discretized into 60 m by 60 m grid cells each cell has a soil type with associated soil properties a soil depth and an underlying bedrock type with associated geologic properties depending on the soil depth for each cell the study domain is vertically discretized into a maximum of five root zone layers to account for differences in root density and root zone water content as a function of depth fig 2 the water balance for each cell is calculated with a daily time step in which water enters the cell through rainfall snowmelt and run on and exits the cell through evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff i e δ s t o r a g e r a i n s n o w m e l t r u n o n e t i n f i l t r a t i o n r u n o f f snowmelt occurs when the maximum daily air temperature is above 0 c and is determined based on an empirical temperature index model gray and prowse 1993 which is a function of the maximum daily temperature and an empirical snowmelt rate parameter that corresponds to the early or late spring snowmelt period daily potential evapotranspiration is calculated with the priestley taylor equation which uses an hourly solar radiation model to simulate daily net radiation daily evapotranspiration is estimated using an empirical function of the root zone water content and potential evapotranspiration under saturated conditions infiltration through root zone layers is determined by the maximum infiltration capacity which is calculated using the saturated hydraulic conductivity modified by the duration of rain or snowmelt under unsaturated conditions infiltration is determined with a modified form of an empirical drainage model that approximates water contents and the depth of the wetting front jury et al 1991 pp 144 150 any water entering a cell that is in excess of the infiltration capacity and that does not drain to the underlying layer is used in subsequent calculations to calculate runoff and the final distribution of water content after uptake by evapotranspiration run on to each cell is defined as runoff from the upstream cells infil makes several assumptions in modeling the root zone hydrological processes in each grid cell water is assumed to move vertically downward into the bedrock so lateral subsurface flow is not accounted for in the model all of the simulated runoff is assumed to discharge from the drainage basin or infiltrate into the root zone in the daily time step so the model assumes a short lag time between runoff generation and surface water runoff which is a reasonable assumption for this high desert study area with steep elevation gradients infil simplifies the physics of the rain on snow process so that rain infiltrates as if there was no snowpack present in addition infil assumes recharge occurs as gravity drainage under a unit gradient infil does not include interception of rainfall by vegetation nor does it include the effect of capillary forces on unsaturated flow a full description of the model is given in u s geological survey 2008 2 3 model inputs model inputs to infil include elevation soils data geology and vegetation we use the national elevation dataset ned gesch et al 2009 digital elevation model dem fig 3 a which was pre processed in arcgis to produce aspect flow accumulation and flow directions not shown soils data were obtained from the digital general soil map of the united states statsgo2 soil database from the united states department of agriculture usda figure 3b c we chose the lower resolution statsgo2 soil data over the higher resolution ssurgo soil data to maintain consistency across the study domain infil requires five soil hydraulic properties as inputs for each grid cell porosity saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity a soil drainage function coefficient field capacity and wilting point soil depth figure 3b c was determined based on an empirical equation that depends on slope elevation and flow accumulation derived from the distributed soil and vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 calculations for these soil properties are included in the supplemental information si surficial geology fig 3d was obtained from the new mexico geologic survey nmgs infil requires three hydraulic properties as inputs to represent geology in each grid cell porosity saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity and unsaturated vertical hydraulic conductivity these properties were estimated by mapping the nmgs geology to categories used in hevesi et al 2003 which contains detailed geologic information for rock types for the pajarito plateau geospatial vegetation data fig 3e were extracted from the multi agency landfire program rollins 2009 we set up infil with landfire vegetation data from 2014 which were collected after the vegetation disturbances caused by large forest fires namely the cerro grande fire in 2000 and the las conchas fire in 2011 the landfire data are freely available for download in a 30 m by 30 m grid format we resampled the data to 60 m by 60 m in arcgis vegetation classes in landfire were re mapped to vegetation classes used in an infiltration model developed for the death valley region hevesi et al 2003 which contains information for vegetation parameters including rooting depths rooting depths into bedrock when rooting depth is greater than total soil depth and rooting densities for six different soil horizons table 5 in hevesi et al 2003 vegetation density or cover not shown originated from the landfire program as well rollins 2009 landfire lists ranges of vegetation cover whereas infil requires a single number thus we assigned the mean value for each vegetation cover class e g 15 for the range 10 20 for developed areas such as roads and buildings we assume 0 cover the percent vegetation cover is used to estimate the root density in the root zone for example a vegetation density of 30 typically corresponds to a root density of 30 in the shallowest soil zone a vegetation density of 40 corresponds to a root density of 40 etc more detailed information on parameters and initial conditions used in the infil model implementation is provided in the si 2 4 historical and future climate data infil requires three daily climate inputs precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature our historical climatic data came from eight climate stations inside and nearby our study area table 1 and from a suite of downscaled earth system models esms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 livneh et al 2015 taylor et al 2012 six of the historical climate stations are global historical climate network ghcn stations while the remaining two are lanl stations the lanl stations had 15 minute observations that were aggregated into daily observations and the ghcn stations had only daily observations for all of the stations we omitted outliers based on our analysis of maximum precipitation and temperature ranges we excluded any records of daily precipitation recordings that exceeded 90 mm since the maximum recorded daily precipitation at the los alamos station is 89 4 mm dewart et al 2017 we also omitted maximum temperature recordings that exceeded 45 6 c or 10 c above the maximum recorded temperature at the los alamos station and minimum temperatures that fell below 37 8 c or 10 c below the minimum recorded temperature at the los alamos station dewart et al 2017 a suite of 20 esms and global climate models gcms downscaled using the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs data set maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 was utilized in this work the maca data are available online and can be downloaded for a regional area http maca northwestknowledge net we used representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 simulations from the maca database see van vuuren et al 2011 for details on rcps used in cmip5 we focus on rcp 8 5 because it is the concentration pathway trajectory we are currently following le quéré et al 2015 the gcm esm realizations and scenario are collectively referred to as scenarios based on the range of responses in the larger suite of data four esms were selected to represent the range of precipitation and temperature changes present across the region inmcm4 noresm1 m miroc esm and miroc esm chem one additional esm was added to support the budyko analysis hadgem2 cc365 the esms were selected to represent scenarios of change in precipitation such as wetter and hotter or drier and warmer changes two of the esms noresm1 m miroc esm chem were within one standard deviation of the ensemble mean while the inmcm4 model was slightly outside one standard deviation however miroc esm which was selected to represent a wetter precipitation scenario was beyond one standard deviation projected climates scenarios were then used as inputs for infil to simulate future infiltration and runoff the historical period spanned a 30 year range from 1970 to 1999 1980s while the future period spanned the same range 70 years later 2040 2069 2050s approximately 30 years into the future from the time the study was implemented 2 5 model validation model validation was carried out using two approaches infiltration observations compiled by kwicklis et al 2005 and used in the development of an infiltration map for the pajarito plateau were compared to infil infiltration estimates from this study the kwicklis et al 2005 observations are shown in table 2 along with the infil estimated infiltration these infiltration observations are compiled from peer reviewed journal articles and internal lanl reports birdsell et al 2005 newman et al 1997a newman 1996 newman et al 1997b robinson et al 2000 rogers et al 1996a b vold 1997 and based on several methods including chloride mass balance methods direct application of the richard s equation using observed moisture content and model comparisons to observed borehole moisture content profiles in locations where infiltration observations changed with depth a range is presented in table 2 the maximum infiltration observation is used in the comparative statistics see results our second method of validation was to compare daily infil estimated runoff with observed streamflow gages as many of the systems in the pajarito plateau are ephemeral these systems respond mainly to summer time rainfall events that are short lived and are dry during other times of the year thus we focused on comparing observed streamflow with modeled runoff from three wet canyons water canyon los alamos canyon and frijoles canyon for the historical period january 1st 1997 2010 and 1997 until 2019 respectively average january baseflow values were subtracted from the streamflow observations we examined the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 r2 values and root mean squared error rmse daily statistics for these three systems to evaluate infil s performance 2 6 budyko analysis to represent how changes in climate impact the amount of water available for surface processes we present our results in a budyko framework budyko et al 1974 relating the aridity index to the water availability ratio et p the aridity index is a hydro climatic indicator that measures the ratio of potential evapotranspiration pet to precipitation p which in turn is related to the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation et p or water availability ratio in a given system li et al 2019 yang et al 2008 pet is defined as the theoretical maximum of et given an assumed condition of no water deficit and is based on solar radiation wind speed and humidity it should also be noted that the water availability ratio is inversely related to the water available p et for surface processes like runoff or groundwater infiltration the budyko framework allows us to understand how changes in precipitation et and pet jointly impact the hydrology of the region further we can use our results to fit a curve for this relationship using the choudhury yang equation yang et al 2008 as formulated f ϕ 1 1 ϕ n 1 n where φ is the aridity index n is a dimensionless constant specific to basin characteristics and f φ is the et p ratio thus by linearly fitting the change in aridity and change in precipitation and fitting the choudhury yang equation we can estimate the change in water availability ratio et and the total amount of water available for runoff p et for the remaining gcm suite 3 results 3 1 infil validation the average observed infiltration estimates from the pajarito plateau was 14 9 mm yr with a standard deviation of 45 7 mm yr table 2 kwicklis et al 2005 many of the observations are tightly clustered around specific sites at lanl but show extremely variable estimates of infiltration due to the concentrated natured of the sites we grouped the estimates into five regions canada del buey mortandad canyon mesita del buey technical area 16 ta 16 and frijoles mesa fig 4 we then compared the average infiltration estimate against the average infil estimate for those regions r2 0 46 rmse 19 2 mm yr kwicklis et al 2005 estimated an average infiltration rate for the entire pajarito plateau region of 20 2 mm yr while infil results in an infiltration rate of 25 4 mm yr with the largest differences in infiltration occurring in the upper basin where little observed data is available observed daily streamflow data at three sites water canyon los alamos canyon and frijoles canyon showed coherence with infil runoff estimates 0 72 0 64 0 60 r2 and 0 70 0 41 and 0 54 m3 s rmse respectively fig 5 kge statistics were not as robust as r2 or rmse values owing to the difficult nature of capturing precipitation data across the region which led to lower values due to a lack of peak matching ability in our model 0 37 0 42 and 1 47 respectively improved observations of infiltration are being developed for the site and will be available for future work as we discuss in the conclusion 3 2 climate the average monthly climatology 1970 1999 for the average of the eight historical climate stations and all 4 gcm esms are compared in fig 6 a and b similarities reflect both the use of these climate stations in the gridded data formulation and also the bias correction applied in the maca data processing abatzoglou and brown 2012 livneh et al 2015 the envelope illustrating the range of responses around the esms is consistent for minimum and maximum monthly daily temperature monthly precipitation averages are more variable for winter and summer months fig 6b for each of the four selected esms the future climate 2040 2069 was then examined to assess future changes in monthly minimum and maximum temperature and monthly average precipitation fig 6c f all esms showed significant future warming for the pajarito plateau region ranging from an annual increase in average temperature of 2 5 3 5 c with a mean projected annual average temperature increase of 3 1 c and differences across the scenarios occurring mostly in winter and spring fig 6c f the multi gcm esm ensemble projected little change in average annual precipitation 0 5 mm yr however the individual gcm esm responses ranged from 43 0 mm yr to 44 0 mm yr with a standard deviation of 41 2 mm yr confirming that projections of future precipitation are more uncertain than those of temperature bennett et al 2012 trenberth 2011 both wetter i e miroc esm chem fig 6c and drier i e inmcm4 and noresm1 m fig 6e future conditions compared to historical climate are projected for the pajarito plateau see above a bulk of this variability is due to uncertainty in summer precipitation see fig 6c f with standard deviations for future precipitation projections across esms during summer months june july august 8 7 mm month much higher than winter months december january february 2 5 mm month 3 3 future projections of water balances spatial changes in temperature precipitation runoff and infiltration between historical and projected future climate model simulations for each esm are shown in figs 7 and 8 temperature increases are widespread and consistent across the pajarito plateau with inmcm4 fig 7a1 projecting the lowest increase in temperature 2 1 c and miroc esm chem fig 8a1 projecting the highest 4 4 c both inmcm4 42 5 mm yr and noresm1 m 23 8 mm yr exhibit precipitation decreases while miroc esm chem 25 4 mm yr figure 8b2 and miroc esm 41 3 mm yr fig 7b1 show increases in annual precipitation in all esms the largest changes in precipitation occur in the high elevation regions of the domain fig 7 8 similarly although more pronounced changes in runoff are much larger at high elevations across the esms fig 7 fig 8c three of the esms show an average annual increase in runoff only inmcm4 which projects the largest decrease in precipitation and the smallest increase in temperature exhibits a decrease in annual runoff 11 1 mm yr for the region infiltration shows a similar pattern to runoff increasing on average according to the same three esms fig 7 fig 8d again inmcm4 shows the only average annual decrease in infiltration 8 7 mm yr spatial patterns in the changes of runoff and infiltration were consistent across esms annual runoff and infiltration increase at the high elevations in three of the four esms and generally decrease at lower elevations in all four esms both noresm1 m and miroc esm chem exhibit this spatial pattern despite divergent changes in annual precipitation the spatial pattern of infiltration at high elevations across the pajarito plateau varies dependent on aspect soil type and vegetation cover fig 9 shows monthly fluxes of rainfall snowmelt runoff and infiltration for the four esms as well as the multi model mean during the winter spring and fall the largest water balance changes are due to increased rainfall and decreased snowmelt snowmelt decreases by 47 on average across the esms green and turquoise lines in fig 9 respectively rainfall during summer months varies dependent on the esm with increases 17 mm month miroc esm chem and decreases 19 mm month inmcm4 projected during the monsoon season runoff largely follows rainfall if rainfall increases so does runoff infiltration increases slightly during winter spring and fall 1 9 0 7 and 2 4 mm increases in multi model mean respectively but does not increase in response 2 1 mm month to summer rainfall changes when evapotranspiration or runoff processes instead act to remove this water from the system fig 9 during winter spring and fall infiltration responds to frontal rains that fall over longer periods of time and are able to make their way into the soils as opposed to summer rain that falls intensely over shorter durations of hours or even minutes fig 10 shows the aridity index pet p and water availability ratio plotted for future and historical esm projections under the budyko framework a common means of relating these variables the difference between the future and historical scenarios shows large 0 01 to 0 51 in the aridity index with relatively smaller changes 02 to 02 in the water availability ratio four of the five esms show increasing aridity 0 12 to 0 51 while miroc esm the wettest model considered here shows only a slight decrease in aridity 0 01 the future scenarios in fig 10 are shaded according to the average change in precipitation from future to historical both hadgem2 cc365 and miroc esm chem show increasing aridity in the future despite an increase in annual precipitation demonstrating the effect of changes in temperature on aridity and pet changes in the water availability ratio are not solely attributed to the changes in climate projected by the esms as three of the five esms show a decrease in the et p ratio an increase in available water despite two of these models increasing in aridity fig 10 this suggests that there may be important changes in the pathways of precipitation such that increases in pet are not met with a proportional increase in actual et the infil results show that changes in precipitation form from snow to rain cause an increase in infiltration which would negatively influence the et p ratio e g fig 9 furthermore seasonal differences in the projected precipitation of the four esm s could influence how much of the annual precipitation is evaporated projected changes in annual precipitation are highly correlated with changes in aridity index r2 1 0 and can be reasonably linearly fit rmse 0 95 mm precipitation thus we can estimate the change in aridity for each of the 20 cmip5 gcm esm models based solely on the projected change in precipitation as listed in table 3 the simple linear fit illustrates that despite many models projecting an increase in precipitation only canesm2 projects a decrease in aridity when considering all gcm esms the mean projected aridity change is 0 25 using these results we can then estimate the et p ratio using the choudhury yang equation yang et al 2008 using the modeled results from infil we estimate n 1 91 based on the historical mean of aridity index 2 50 and et p 0 90 across the gcm esms we have used table 4 then using the projected change in aridity based on our linear fit of precipitation changes and the historic aridity index we estimate the future water availability ratio to increase water availability to decrease a difference that translates to a 15 reduction in the total available water p et based on the average projected change in precipitation and the projected change in et p table 4 4 discussion climate models project that temperatures over the pajarito plateau indicate will increase up to 4 c by the 2050s assuming that current emissions will continue unabated as projected under scenario rcp8 5 model projections of precipitation are variable with both increases or decreases possible average monthly difference of 3 6 to 3 5 mm month with a standard deviation of 5 5 mm month scenario selection for the infil model was based on a suite of downscaled climate models therefore wet and dry esm scenarios were chosen to understand how water balances across the region respond the bulk of disagreement between esms is observed during the summer monthly average standard deviation 8 7 mm month in june july august when precipitation is dominated by convective rains occurring as part of nam which are poorly represented in esms kendon et al 2017 prein et al 2015 singer and michaelides 2017 during the winter however differences between the models are smaller monthly average standard deviation of 2 5 in december january february with projected increases in rainfall and decreases in snowmelt for the pajarito plateau increasing infiltration and runoff occur in the regions of the watershed believed to be recharge zones i e high elevation regions of the pajarito plateau to deeper aquifer systems on the plateau birdsell et al 2005 kwicklis et al 2005 limitations of infil include a lack of lateral groundwater flow components and or complex perched aquifer systems which are common in this region this means we cannot compare to the groundwater responses to the simulated infiltration as we may be missing components of the surface groundwater connections streamflow responses can be challenging to validate because infil is not designed to capture single cell response i e runoff of 60 by 60 m cell was compared to flow through a stream gauge that covered much less than 60 m and because runoff is assumed to be routed through the entire domain in one day which may not reflect observed streamflow other issues that are not addressed in our approach include the inability to model a major fault system present in the region that could impact runoff in addition there are numerous springs downstream of the fault system and elsewhere in the domain that feed into streams and runoff so not all measured streamflow can be directly accounted for by incoming precipitation events lastly the dominant patterns of intermittent and low flow conditions exhibited at most of the streams in the region are difficult to capture with accuracy even with process based simulation approaches one important note is that infil was not specifically calibrated owing to the issues discussed above calibration to poor quality observations may lead to tuning the model inaccurately beven 2005 gupta et al 2012 infil validation was achieved through two approaches through comparison with previous studies of infiltration on the pajarito plateau and also through comparison with streamflow observations at several wet canyons infil infiltration estimates for the historical period have similar spatial distribution and magnitude of infiltration rates r2 0 46 rmse 19 2 mm yr as previous spatial estimates of infiltration kwicklis et al 2005 the kwicklis et al 2005 infiltration map was developed with estimates of infiltration based on the richard s equation the chloride mass balance method and numerical modeling and extrapolated to cover uncharacterized areas with spatial algorithms that use environmental variables such as topography vegetation cover and geology streamflow validation at several wet canyons showed that infil runoff estimates are similar r2 0 7 rmse 0 55 m3 s therefore despite infil s limitations the uncalibrated infil represents the spatial and temporal variations in runoff and infiltration present across the study region the trend toward increasing future aridity demonstrated in the budyko analysis can be attributed to increases in evaporative demand due to increasing future temperatures fu and feng 2014 sherwood and fu 2014 the results show that despite a range of projected precipitation in both sign and magnitude aridity is projected to increase due to increasing pet driven by changes in projected temperature however the budyko analysis also indicates that although pet is likely to increase it may not be met with a proportional increase in actual et strong correlations between the change in water availability ratio with winter precipitation and infiltration suggest that changes in the distribution of precipitation throughout the year are partially responsible for the unexpected decrease in the et p ratio the results suggest that et p is more sensitive to changes in winter precipitation than summer as water is less likely to evaporate in winter due to cooler temperatures and more likely to infiltrate thus the amount of available water is also sensitive to changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation that may not be reflected in the aridity index it should be noted that changes to seasonal distribution of precipitation or changes in water pathways are not considered in the choudhury yang generated estimate of et p while these factors are important projected changes in the distribution and magnitude of annual precipitation are highly uncertain while changes driven by temperature are much more consistent across gcm esms the positive shift in pet and aridity is nearly unanimous across all gcm esms as projected changes in temperature increase for all models given the positive correlation between aridity and the water availability ratio it is likely that a larger fraction of the precipitation in the pajarito plateau area will be evaporated resulting in a reduction in the water available for vegetation good et al 2017 and human use this seasonal distribution of precipitation is largely reflected in a reduction in snow and a conversion of snow to rain a reduction in snow is supported by other research that shows snow water equivalent swe is in decline across the western united states clow 2010 pierce et al 2008 changes in swe especially at low elevations within the pajarito plateau are largely attributed to temperature increase rather than changes in precipitation hamlet et al 2005 mote et al 2005 highlighting the importance of temperature increases in shifts in water regimes because snowmelt tends to infiltrate or sublimate in the semi arid environments near the pajarito plateau liu et al 2008 reductions in snow may have a larger impact on infiltration compared to changes in summer precipitation signals however for the esms exhibiting small overall precipitation changes the flux between increased winter spring and fall rain and decreased snow leads to an overall slight increase in runoff and infiltration which is interesting despite the shift towards decreased precipitation annually on the other hand models which project precipitation either strongly decreasing inmcm4 42 9 mm yr or increasing miroc esm 26 2 mm yr miroc esm chem 43 9 mm yr show decreases and increases in overall runoff and infiltration respectively while esms that decrease less moderately noresm2 25 3 mm yr in terms of precipitation also increase in runoff and infiltration the lack of coherence between infiltration runoff and precipitation shifts highlight the importance in modeling these interactions to understand their nuances and points to the fact that the delivery in terms of the form and rate of precipitation is as important if not more important that the overall amount we also observe that the location of changes in infiltration patterns is potentially more important than the changes in overall average increase or decrease in precipitation since increases in recharge zones will be of greater importance to overall amounts and quality of water moving through the system 5 conclusion changes in infiltration and runoff have strong implications for water quality and quantity at lanl and in the region as a whole water resources in the region are paramount our major findings indicate that the amount of available water for processes such as infiltration and runoff is sensitive to changes in the season distribution of precipitation that may not be reflected in the aridity index we also find that the delivery in terms of the form and rate of precipitation is as important if not more important than the overall amount of precipitation which emphasizes the need for improved understanding of how future precipitation form will change in the region and particularly the amount and timing of those changes in snow and rain across the region changes in snow rain and aridity across the region will affect cities operations and resources that rely on a consistent high quality and sustainable water resource major facilities like lanl are beginning to realize the importance of understanding the threats that higher aridity will bring to such expansion including increased chances of more frequent and larger forest fires higher demand for cooling and increased concerns around heat exposure finally if increased infiltration and runoff occur during winter fall and spring this may lead to higher instances of erosion for the region this enhanced water cycle may influence movement and transport of sediments including surficial materials and soils across the pajarito plateau future work will include incorporating the impacts of changing vegetation for the region investigating different statistical and dynamical approaches to downscaling singer and michaelides 2017 singer et al 2018 zobel et al 2018 and employing higher resolution models to uncover the impacts of shifting climate and changing land cover on the processes of runoff and infiltration at specific locations on the lanl property and across the pajarito plateau region we also will incorporate collection of in situ field data of soils properties and infiltration estimates across the pajarito plateau future work may

8381,study region lake ashinoko in the hakone caldera is located about 100 km southwest of tokyo the capital of japan hakone is a world famous resort that more than 20 million tourists visit every year to enjoy various kinds of hot springs and spectacular landscapes of the caldera study focus monthly water budget of lake ashinoko was investigated based on the correlation between monthly potential inflow of water to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake potential inflow consists of rainfall on the lake and catchment area and monthly out flow is the change in water of the lake plus evaporation and intake from fukara gate for irrigation new hydrological insights for the region we found that only about a quarter of the rainfall during a prior few months flows into the lake besides that there is stationary inflow about 45 of the rainfall on the catchment area infiltrates into the ground many observational facts and analytical results indicate that rainfall on the central cones penetrates into the volcanic edifice and does not flow into the lake it is proposed that the water stored in the volcanic edifice and heated by a reservoir of magma that is thought to exist at a depth of about 10 km is a major source of hakone thermal water keywords lake ashinoko hakone caldera monthly water budget correction analysis central cones hakone thermal water 1 introduction the hakone volcano located about 100 km southwest of tokyo the capital of japan is a world famous resort where more than 20 million tourists visit every year to enjoy various kinds of hot springs and spectacular landscapes of the caldera mt fuji when observed over lake ashinoko is the most popular picturesque scene lake ashinoko is situated in the southwestern part of the hakone caldera on the western side of the central cones fig 1 the lake whose area and reserved water are 6 9 km3 and 180 million m3 respectively was formed about 3000 years ago when the hayakawa river was dammed by a flow of debris that came down from kamiyama one of the central cones during the latest magmatic eruption of the hakone volcano currently there is no river that flows into the lake a water gate has been set up at kojiri the topographic exit point on the northern shore of the lake which corresponds to the head of the hayakawa river usually no water flows through the gate except when it rains heavily and water level exceeds 725 m above sea level which is 50 cm higher than the average level of the lake ohyama 2018 on the other hand a considerable amount of water is taken from fukara gate on the western shore every day the drained waters are led to rice fields and a water power station through a tunnel under the western rim of the hakone caldera which was dug in the edo era it is supposed that the water level of lake ashinoko has not changed much since construction of the fukara gate the western rim of hakone caldera constitutes the boundary between kanagawa and shizuoka prefectures and lake ashinoko exists inside of the caldera however the water rights are considered to belong to shizuoka prefecture since the tunnel for irrigation was dug by shizuoka prefecture this has been a long term issue between kanagawa and shizuoka prefectures however heightened interest in the water budget of lake ahinoko in recent years is not related to this issue rather it is because oki and hirano 1970 in their classic paper about the origin and zoning of hakone thermal waters proposed that zone ii waters which well out in spas along branches of the hayakawa river and are characterized by high concentrations of bicarbonate and sulfate ions are originally ground waters that come from the lake s side flowing through the edifice of the volcano s central cones since the classic paper by oki and hirano 1970 the water budget of lake ashinoko has been studied in relation to the origin of hakone thermal waters examining the annual water budget of the hayakawa river the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 estimated that among the 63 million m3 of rainfall on the catchment area 27 million m3 flow into lake ashinoko 21 million m3 evaporate and 15 million m3 of residual water become zone ii thermal waters in the oki and hirano model on the other hand matsuo et al 1979 solved six simultaneous equations about the lake s water rainfall on the lake and on the catchment area the isotopes and chloride content in the lake s water and in the ground water of the catchment area based on the assumption that they are all in a steady state on an annual value basis they found that 42 of the water input into the lake is rainfall while the remaining 58 is ground water from the catchment area and that surface drainage and evaporation account for 87 and 13 of the output respectively a noticeable feature of their model is that ground water flowing to the outside of the catchment area which was implicitly considered to become thermal water was estimated to be 2 5 million m3 only one sixth of the estimate by the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 this is because a large amount of water was attributed to evapotranspiration from the catchment area corresponding to 1 7 times the evaporation from the lake per unit area more recently itadera 2006 estimated the inflow of ground water to the lake at 26 million m3 on the basis of annual values of rainfall on the lake intake at fukara gate and evaporation from the lake that was obtained by the makkink equation makkink 1957 which is a simplified penman like equation where only data of temperature and sunshine hours are needed besides two parameters that characterize regional climatic features if evapotranspiration per unit area is assumed to be 70 of evaporation according to an empirical law kayane 1980 then the amount of outflow from the catchment area not flowing into the lake becomes 30 million m3 the value is larger than that suggested by the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 this result is partly because precipitation at the amedas station of the japan meteorological agency was used to estimate the average amount of annual precipitation in the catchment area it should be noted here that in all previous studies the water budget of lake ashinoko was studied on the basis of annual mean values for precipitation drainage evaporation and evapotranspiration and on the assumption that the lake s water is in a steady state in this paper having obtained detailed data about the intake at fukara gate by fortunate chance we conducted a correlation analysis between monthly potential inflow of water to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake plus a change in storage water the monthly potential inflow consists of rainfall on the lake and on the catchment area each month while monthly outflow of water from the lake consists of drainage from fukara gate and evaporation usually the water budget of a lake might be expressed by the following equation direct precipitation surface and underground inflows to the lake change in storage water evaporation surface outflow groundwater outflow where surface and underground inflows precipitation on the catchment area evapotranspiration infiltration into the ground from the correlation analysis between monthly potential inflow to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake plus the change in storage water monthly surface and underground influx to the lake from the catchment area can be estimated then the sum of infiltration into the ground and evapotranspiration are obtained by subtracting the amount of influx to the lake from precipitation on the catchment area to obtain the amount of infiltration therefore it is necessary to evaluate evapotranspiration in some way this matter is discussed in later sections we did not consider groundwater outflow from the lake in the analysis but some studies about outflow are referred to in the section of the discussion where implications of the results of the correlation analysis are detailed 2 data regarding the rainfall on lake ashinoko we used data of hakone en station on the eastern shore of the lake which is operated by the land development bureau of the kanagawa prefectural government kpg for rainfall on the catchment area data from the hakone ashinoyu amedas station of the japan meteorological agency near the summit of the central cones were used locations of those observation stations as well as that of the kojiri and fukara water gates are shown in fig 1 where the range of the catchment area which we maintained as in previous studies is shown by a thick broken line in fig 2 a monthly rainfall at hakone en is compared with that at the hakone ashinoyu amedas station it is obvious that monthly variations are very similar even though rainfall at the amedas station appears to be larger from the correlation shown in fig 2b monthly rainfall at the amedas station was estimated to be on average about 1 1 times higher than that at hakone en after discovering that an outlier seen in fig 2b was due to false data at the amedas station on may 2009 we corrected the data as follows first we obtained a linear regression in which the outlier was removed beforehand then we replaced the false data at the amedas station by a value on the regression line corresponding to the data at hakone en on may 2009 in the following analysis the corrected data was used the water level was observed at a point on the upper side of kojiri gate the data was recorded every second and one minute averages were automatically registered to a database of the hot spring research institute in fig 3 the change in the one minute average of the first minute in each hour is plotted the monthly quantity of drainage from fukara gate was calculated using the monthly mean average of the flux per second which was supplied by the ashinoko water utilization association of shizuoka prefecture the monthly value of evaporation from the lake was estimated by the makkink equation makkink 1957 following itadera 2005 in the estimation based on this equation we used monthly mean sunshine duration data issued by the japan meteorological agency and air temperature observed by the hot springs research institute in the sengokubara region on the north shore of lake ashinoko respectively fig 4 shows the change in water level of lake ashinoko i e one minute averages at 0 00 am on the first day of each month monthly intake at the fukara gate and monthly values of evaporation in the correlation analysis between monthly potential inflow to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake plus change in storage water we used values shown in fig 4 for monthly amounts of intake and evaporation monthly changes in storage water of the lake were calculated by multiplying the difference between the one minute averages at 0 00 am on the first day of each month and that of the previous month and the area of the lake in this case we did not take into account the possibility that the area of the lake would change with a rise or lowering of the water level since the variation in water level was not so large that it might have affected the results of the analysis the clear variations in seasonal values which in summer are larger than in winter can be seen in the intake at fukara gate and evaporation 3 water budget analysis 3 1 methods we investigated the water budget of lake ashinoko on the basis of a correlation between monthly potential inflow of water to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake plus the change in storage water the similarity in variation of the inflow and outflow plus change in storage water is obvious in the graph of fig 5 where the sum of monthly rainfall on the lake r and on the catchment area rc are shown by white bars on the top side while the sum of the increase of storage water δw evaporation ϕe and drainage from fukara gate ϕd are shown by black bars on the bottom side it can also be seen that the former quantity is much larger than the latter in the correlation analysis we used data from january 2009 to march 2013 when data of drainage flux from fukara gate was available in performing the correlation analysis we assumed that all of the rainfall on the catchment area flows into the lake this assumption is actually not correct for some part of rainfall that infiltrates underground would not flow into the lake but flow outside of the catchment area and some would be lost by evapotranspiration the reason we made this assumption is that we were most interested in elucidating the ratio of rainfall on the catchment area which flows into the lake the ratio can be obtained by the correlation analysis as described next note that groundwater outflow from the lake was not taken into account in the correlation analysis some comments about the outflow are made in the discussion 3 2 correlation analysis fig 6 shows a scatter plot of the sum of the increase of storage water δw evaporation ϕe and drainage from fukara gate ϕd in the last month against potential inflow of water to the lake i e sum of rainfall on the lake r 1 and the catchment area rc 1 where index 1 shows that the values are those during the previous month from fig 6 it is clearly seen that both quantities are well correlated provided that the amount of the sum of rainfall is less than about 10 million m3 per month as was described in section 1 a water gate is set at kojiri the location corresponds to the head of the hayakawa river usually water of the lake does not flow through the gate but is discharged when it rains heavily and water level rises 50 cm higher than the average level so that the overflowing flood water does not damage lower residential areas ohyama 2018 this is why the plotted points in fig 6 reach a ceiling for the sum of rainfall exceeding about 10 million m3 next we investigated the correlation for the range of values in the abscissa less than 10 million m3 fig 7 shows the plot of the sum of δw ϕe and ϕd against the sum of rainfall on the lake r 1 and the catchment area rc 1 in the previous month for the range of the abscissa less than 10 million m3 the coefficient of determination r2 whose value represents the strength of the correlation is 0 672 here it should be noted that the ground water that flows into the lake from the catchment area may include rain that fell several months prior and not only in the previous month in this study we evaluated how much rain that fell in one two three four and additional months before is included in the ground water that flows into the lake each month by searching for a combination of coefficients for rainfall of each of the prior months which would give the strongest correlation first we defined y and x as y δw ϕd ϕe x r 1 f rc 1 g rc 2 h rc 3 i rc 4 j rc 5 where rc 2 rc 3 rc 4 and rc 5 in the equation for x represent precipitation of two three four and five prior months respectively then we searched the value of the coefficients f g h i and j that gave the best correlation between y and x and two parameters of the linear regression line for each of the following five situations 1 f 1 g h i j 0 2 f g 1 h i j 0 3 f g h 1 i j 0 4 f g h i 1 j 0 5 f g h i j 1 the above five situations correspond to the correlation when rainfall in only the previous month or in the past two three four and five months respectively were included we set the sum of coefficients to 1 for all situations which indicates that we assumed that all of the rainfall in the catchment area flows into the lake even if this may take a few or more months it turned out that this assumption was incorrect after conducting the correlation analysis in section 3 3 we examined what ratio of rainfall on the catchment area actually flows into the lake the y versus x plot in situation 1 is shown in fig 7 in the following situations we adopted a practical method to search for the most appropriate combinations of coefficients for which the correlation would become the strongest for example in situation 2 we varied the value of f at an interval of 0 001 with the condition that g 1 f and obtained 0 776 and 0 224 for f and g respectively as the most appropriate combination of the coefficients in situation 3 we searched for the most appropriate combination of the values of f g h as follows first we set the value of f as 0 001 and varied the value of g at an interval of one hundredth of 1 0 001 in which h 1 0 001 g then we set the value of f as 0 002 and varied the value of g at an interval of one hundredth of 1 0 002 with the condition that h 1 0 002 g by continuing this process we examined altogether 1000 100 cases of the combination of these coefficients and found that the most appropriate combination of coefficients f g and h that gave the strongest correlation is 0 732 0 1876 and 0 0804 respectively in situation 4 we fixed the value of f as 0 732 according to the result obtained in situation 3 then examined the most appropriate combination of g h and i as follows first we set the value of g as one thousandth of 0 268 1 0 732 i e 0 000268 and varied the value of h at an interval of one hundredth of 0 267732 0 268 0 000268 with the condition that i 0 267732 h then we set the value of g as two thousandths of 0 268 i e 0 000536 and varied the value of h at an interval of one hundredth of 0 267464 0 268 0 000536 with the condition that i 0 26264 h we repeated the correlation analysis for altogether 1000 100 cases of the combination of the coefficients g h and i similarly to situation 3 and found that the most appropriate combination of the coefficients f g h and i was 0 732 0 1876 0 0796 and 0 0008 respectively in situation 5 we first fixed the values of f and g as 0 732 and 0 188 respectively according to the result obtained in situations 3 and 4 then searched for the most appropriate values of h i and j repeating a similar calculation performed in previous situations that is we varied the value of h at an interval of one thousandth of 0 080 1 0 732 0 188 and for each value of h varied the value of i at an interval of one hundredth of 0 080 h with the condition that j 0 080 h i the most appropriate combination of the coefficients f g h i and j was thus 0 732 0 1876 0 0788 0 0016 and 0 000 respectively the r2 value for situations 1 2 3 4 and 5 is 0 672 0 802 0 819 0 820 and 0 821 respectively fig 8 note that the r2 value when rainfall of the prior two months was taken into account is considerably larger than when rainfall of only the previous month was considered however the strength of the correlation did not become significantly larger if rainfall four or more months prior was taken into account this is consistent with the result that h and i the coefficient for the term of rainfall four and five month prior is 0 for the combination of coefficients that gave the strongest correlation in situations 4 and 5 this suggests that ground water that flows into the lake consists mostly of rain that fell in the prior two months and that rain of three months prior is somewhat included whereas the contribution of rain that fell four or more months prior is negligible supplementary fig 1 shows the change in the value of r2 when the value of coefficient f was varied from 0 0 1 0 in situation 3 r2 assumed a maximum for f at 0 732 and declined for both larger and smaller values of f r2 when f 1 0 is clearly smaller than its maximum value this demonstrates that water flowing into the lake from the catchment area in each month includes rain that fell at least two month prior in fig 9 the sum of the increase of storage water δw 1 evaporation ϕe 1 and drainage from fukara gate ϕd 1 in the previous month is plotted against water inflow when rainfall in the prior three months on the catchment area was taken into account where f g and h are 0 732 0 188 and 0 080 respectively as can be seen the correlation is fairly strong but we note that the linear regression line crosses the y axis at the point of a positive value this seems unreasonable because it indicates that the sum of the increase of storage water evaporation and drainage from fukara gate is positive even if the sum of precipitation on the lake and the catchment area in the prior three months is 0 a possible explanation is to consider whether this is due to incorrectness of the estimation of evaporation however as is shown in supplementary figs 2 a and b the linear regression line cut the axis of the ordinate at a positive value even if evaporation was removed this indicates that the reason why the regression line did not cross the origin is not due to the incorrectness of the estimation of evaporation another possible cause for the regression line not to cross the origin may be the omission of evapotranspiration if evapotranspiration is large in those months when precipitation was large and vice versa for little evapotranspiration the slope of the weakest regression line might increase slightly and pass through a point nearer to the origin however we believe that this possibility is very unlikely because the correlation between the precipitation on lake ashinoko and evaporation from the lake for which evapotranspiration is supposed to be proportional e g kayane 1980 is weak as shown in fig 10 here we would like to note that the points at which the linear regression line crosses the y and x axes gradually approach the origin when rainfall in the prior two three and four months was taken into account this feature is also recognizable when evaporation was not included in the ordinate as is seen in supplementary figs 2 a and b this suggests that a possible cause for the intersection of the linear regression line with the y axis at the point of a positive value is that there exists a small amount of rainfall that fell far earlier than the months we took into account this amount is included in the ground water that flows into the lake each month the results obtained above show that water flowing into the lake each month consists mostly of rainfall that fell during the preceding three months indicating that previous studies about the water budget of lake ashinoko which were based on average annual precipitation drainage and evaporation were clearly inappropriate as already noted we assumed in the correlation analysis that all rainfall on the catchment area flows into the lake although this process might take a few or more months to achieve in our analysis to reflect this we set the sum of the coefficients of the terms on the right hand side of x as 1 however the value of the slope of the linear regression line 0 43 is much smaller than 1 which indicates that only a portion of rainfall on the catchment area flows into the lake the proportion cannot be obtained directly from the value of the slope since the abscissa of fig 9 incorporates the sum of rainfall on the lake and on the catchment area combined in the next section we examine what percentage of rainfall on the catchment area flows into the lake 3 3 amount of water flowing into the lake from the catchment area in order to estimate the percentage of rainfall on the catchment area that flows into the lake we searched for the value of α that would make the slope of the linear regression line 45 when all the terms on the right hand side of x except for r were multiplied by α we found that the value is about 0 26 fig 11 this indicates that only about a quarter of rain that fell in the prior few months on the catchment area flows into the lake the estimated value of 0 26 for α should be taken as a lower limit because as noted in section 3 1 we did not take into account groundwater outflow from the lake another possible cause for obtaining a small value for α might be that we took data from the hakone ashinoyu amedas station near the summit of a central cone to evaluate the amount of rainfall on the catchment area however that effect was not considered to be significant since the average precipitation at the amedas station is only about 1 1 fold more than at hakone en see fig 2 we would like to note here that the linear regression line in fig 11 does not pass through the origin but crosses the ordinate at a positive point 0 076 this shows that the value of the ordinate of each point is 0 076 107 m3 larger than the value of the abscissa on average the implication of this is discussed in the next section 3 4 estimation of the amount of water infiltrating under the ground of the catchment area we found that about a quarter of rain that fell in the prior three months on the catchment area flows into lake ashinoko this does not mean however that all of the residual part of the rainfall infiltrates into the ground under the catchment area as some water is lost through evapotranspiration the monthly amount of water that infiltrates under the ground can be estimated by the following equation x y ϕet ϕf where x r 1 f rc 1 g rc 2 h rc 3 and y δw ϕd ϕe as defined in section 3 2 ϕet and ϕf represent evapotranspiration and the water discharged from kojiri gate at the time of heavy rainfall respectively as was described in section 1 matsuo et al 1979 solved six simultaneous equations to find that evapotranspiration is as large as 1 7 fold higher than the evaporation from the lake per unit area yet such a large value is thought to be unnatural a simple way to estimate the amount of evapotranspiration may be to set its value per unit area at about 70 of evaporation following kayane 1980 regarding the estimation of the amount of water discharged from kojiri gate it is important to note that the y value reaches a ceiling when the x value exceeds about 10 million m3 see fig 6 if we consider that this feature reflects discharge of the lake s water from kojri gate at the time of heavy rainfall then the amount of discharged water may be evaluated by summing the difference between the value of the y axis and the value of the least regression line for the points whose value of the x axis exceeds 10 million m3 fig 12 shows an estimated monthly amount of water that infiltrates under the ground of the catchment area the average annual amount of infiltration is about 33 million m3 this is nearly the same as the amount inferred from the result by itadera 2006 who evaluated influx to the lake and two fold larger than the value estimated by the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 see section 1 as shown in supplementary fig 3 the ratio of rainfall which infiltrates under the ground of the catchment area is about 45 on average there is another method to estimate the amount of water that infiltrates under the ground of the catchment area in the previous section we noted that the linear regression line in fig 11 crosses the ordinate at a point 0 076 we suppose this implies the existence of a stationary inflow of 0 76 million m3 per month besides a short term inflow which is 25 7 of rainfall during the prior few months the excess inflow amounts to 0 76 12 9 12 million m3 in a year if this stationary inflow is taken into account the amount of water that infiltrates under the ground of the catchment area can be estimated by the following equation 1 0 0 257 average annual precipitation stationary inflow evapotranspiration by inserting the values 75 26 9 12 and 13 68 for mean annual precipitation stationary inflow and evapotranspiration respectively estimated by assuming that it is 70 of evaporation per unit area we obtained 33 1 million m3 this value is exactly the same as that estimated by the equation r 1 f rc 1 g rc 2 h rc 3 δw ϕd ϕe tϕ ϕf the coincidence of the estimate of the amount of infiltration by the two methods indicates that our hypothesis that crossing the linear regression line at a point of a positive value in fig 12 indicates the existence of a stationary inflow we consider this stationary influx to consist of rain that fell far earlier than the past several months and was stocked in a reservoir under the catchment area the above estimated amount of water that infiltrates under the catchment area should be taken as the upper limit because outflow from the lake was not incorporated in the analysis nevertheless the result is remarkable how is it possible that about 45 of the rainfall on the catchment area infiltrates underground and does not flow into the lake we discuss this problem in the next section where we show that the central cones of hakone volcano are a prospective site of infiltration then propose that the infiltrated water becomes a major source of hakone thermal waters 4 major source of thermal waters in hakone in a study on the underground water around kojiri ogino et al 1971 showed that there exists a stationary flow from lake ashinoko to the sengokuhara plain beneath volcanic debris where the kojiri gate was constructed the amount of underground flow was estimated at about 0 3 million m3 per month oyama 2013 this value is not so large so the result we obtained is not changed significantly we note here that it is probable that some portion of the rainfall on the flank of the southern rim of the hakone caldera which corresponds to the headwater of the sukumo river flows into the river because the rim is deeply eroded by gullies another possible route for the outflow might be the tan na fault whose northern end is considered to extend to the southern coast of lake ashinoko research group for active faults in japan 1991 although seismicity around the tan na fault is generally low moderate earthquakes often occur in the northern part yukutake et al 2013 the relatively high seismicity in the northern part of the fault where it crosses the southern rim of the hakone caldera suggests a possibility that some ground water in the hakone caldera flows into a fracture zone of the tan na fault however the outflow from the southern part of the watershed of lake ashinoko is not considered to be large enough to influence the result of the correlation analysis where does a larger part of the rainfall on the catchment area then go the catchment area is delineated by the rim of the hakone caldera on the west and south by volcanic debris on the north and by the central cones of the hakone volcano on the east within the watershed a western slope of the central cones occupies nearly half of the entire catchment area see fig 1 therefore if rainfall on the central cones does not flow into lake ashinoko but instead penetrates into the volcanic edifice the query about the whereabouts of a substantial part of the rainfall on the catchment area disappears actually there are many observations that support the idea that rainfall on the central cones penetrates into the volcanic edifice nw se trending fissures were observed on the surface kobayashi 2008 mannen 2008 many cracks and fractures were estimated to exist in the edifice daita et al 2009 yukutake et al 2010 2011 honda et al 2014 doke et al 2018 steam spouting from fumaroles in oowaku dani and the so unzan area is thought to arise from a shallow hot water layer mannen et al 2013 itadera et al 2018 furthermore investigating seismic velocity structure under the hakone caldera yukutake et al 2015 showed that fluids are abundant at around a depth of several km beneath the central cones these observational facts and results of analytical studies support the idea that rainfall on the area of the central cones penetrates into the edifice and that abundant water is stocked at a depth ranging from the surface to several km deep we propose here that this stocked water which is heated by underlying magma is the major source of thermal water that feeds the spas in the eastern flank of the central cones in the classic paper on the origin of hakone thermal waters and zoning of spas oki and hirano 1970 divided the occurrence of thermal waters into four zones in their model carbon in hco3 dissolved in zone ii waters was considered to be organic in origin however recent studies showed that carbon dioxide in hco3 dissolved in the thermal water is supplied by volcanic gases when they pass through reservoirs of water beneath the central cones daita et al 2011 suzuki 2011 these studies support our proposition that spring water in hakone which wells out on the eastern flank of the central cones originates mainly from rain stocked within the volcanic edifice and heated by underlying magma fig 13 shows a schematic diagram of our model about the formation of hakone thermal waters the essence of our model which is different from the model proposed in the classic paper by oki and hirano 1970 is that the so called zone ii thermal water which was attributed to ground water flowing from the lake side is considered to consist mainly of rain that has fallen on the central cones in an examination of the water budget of the hayakawa river the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 figured that even if an estimated 15 million m3 exiting the catchment area were added to the river water 10 million m3 would still be lacking noting that the amount of this deficit is almost the same as the volume of thermal waters drawn annually at hakone spas the research group considered that the water budget of the hayakawa river is balanced by the upwelling of hot springs and worried that excessive drawing of water might lower the head of the ground water level and result in an exhaustion of thermal waters in hakone spas in the future however if rain penetrates into the volcanic edifice of the central cones if the water reserved in the edifice is heated by underlying magma and if the heated waters continuously well out at spas on the eastern flank then this concern disappears in fact the annual amount of infiltration into the edifice of the central cones estimated at about 33 million m3 is enough to cover the volume of all thermal waters drawn annually at hakone spas and the water flux of the hayakawa river recent monitoring surveys showed no long term tendency of a fall in temperature dilution of ion concentrations or lowering of the head of the ground waters of the wells itadera et al 2013 kikugawa et al 2014 if there is still a lingering concern about the long term sustainability of thermal water that may be a problem related to the heat source is the amount of magma enough to warm sufficient water which originates from rain in the volcanic edifice for a long period of time earthquake swarm activities have occurred frequently in the hakone caldera since 2001 e g harada et al 2013b and accompanying these activities dilatation of the hakone volcano has been observed by gnss harada et al 2013a a notable feature of this dilatation is that it did not return to the state before the occurrence of activities each time i e dilatation has been accumulating if the mogi model mogi 1958 is applied the rate of increase of magma volume in the reservoir which is estimated to exist at a depth of about 10 km beneath komagatake daita et al 2009 is evaluated at around 1 2 107 m3 year private communication by a kobayashi this rate of magma supply to the reservoir is sufficient to heat infiltrating water of 33 million m3 to more than 100 c per year when temperature specific heat and specific density of andesite magma are about 900 c 0 2 cal g c and 2 5 respectively therefore if the supply rate of magma in the past 20 years will continue then the heat source required to produce thermal waters is assured even if the rate of supply is actually not so large in the long term it was estimated that 10 000 years would be required for the magma under the hakone volcano to cool down yuhara 1968 consequently it seems there is no concern that thermal waters in hakone spas will be depleted in the near future 5 conclusion we investigated the water budget of lake ashinoko based on a correlation between monthly potential inflow of water to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake where potential inflow consists of rainfall on the lake and the catchment area and monthly out flow is an increase decrease of the water of the lake plus intake from fukara gate and evaporation after performing this correlation analysis we found that about a quarter of the rainfall during a few preceding months flows into the lake besides that there is a stationary influx supposed to consist of rains that fell far earlier than the past several months it was estimated that about 45 of rainfall on the catchment area infiltrates under the ground of this area we proposed that rainfall on the central cones does not enter the lake but instead penetrates into the volcanic edifice there exist a number of observational facts and analytical results that support this idea furthermore we proposed a hypothesis in which the abundance of water in the edifice of the central cones that is heated by underlying magma is a major source of thermal waters that well out at spas on the eastern flank along the hayakawa river as well as steam spouting from fumaroles in owaku dani and so unzan the quantity of magma that has been supplied to the reservoir in recent years is sufficient to heat ground water reserved in the edifice of the central cones continuously therefore it is thought that the thermal water in hakone spas will not dry up or cool down in the near future declaration of competing interest none

8381,study region lake ashinoko in the hakone caldera is located about 100 km southwest of tokyo the capital of japan hakone is a world famous resort that more than 20 million tourists visit every year to enjoy various kinds of hot springs and spectacular landscapes of the caldera study focus monthly water budget of lake ashinoko was investigated based on the correlation between monthly potential inflow of water to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake potential inflow consists of rainfall on the lake and catchment area and monthly out flow is the change in water of the lake plus evaporation and intake from fukara gate for irrigation new hydrological insights for the region we found that only about a quarter of the rainfall during a prior few months flows into the lake besides that there is stationary inflow about 45 of the rainfall on the catchment area infiltrates into the ground many observational facts and analytical results indicate that rainfall on the central cones penetrates into the volcanic edifice and does not flow into the lake it is proposed that the water stored in the volcanic edifice and heated by a reservoir of magma that is thought to exist at a depth of about 10 km is a major source of hakone thermal water keywords lake ashinoko hakone caldera monthly water budget correction analysis central cones hakone thermal water 1 introduction the hakone volcano located about 100 km southwest of tokyo the capital of japan is a world famous resort where more than 20 million tourists visit every year to enjoy various kinds of hot springs and spectacular landscapes of the caldera mt fuji when observed over lake ashinoko is the most popular picturesque scene lake ashinoko is situated in the southwestern part of the hakone caldera on the western side of the central cones fig 1 the lake whose area and reserved water are 6 9 km3 and 180 million m3 respectively was formed about 3000 years ago when the hayakawa river was dammed by a flow of debris that came down from kamiyama one of the central cones during the latest magmatic eruption of the hakone volcano currently there is no river that flows into the lake a water gate has been set up at kojiri the topographic exit point on the northern shore of the lake which corresponds to the head of the hayakawa river usually no water flows through the gate except when it rains heavily and water level exceeds 725 m above sea level which is 50 cm higher than the average level of the lake ohyama 2018 on the other hand a considerable amount of water is taken from fukara gate on the western shore every day the drained waters are led to rice fields and a water power station through a tunnel under the western rim of the hakone caldera which was dug in the edo era it is supposed that the water level of lake ashinoko has not changed much since construction of the fukara gate the western rim of hakone caldera constitutes the boundary between kanagawa and shizuoka prefectures and lake ashinoko exists inside of the caldera however the water rights are considered to belong to shizuoka prefecture since the tunnel for irrigation was dug by shizuoka prefecture this has been a long term issue between kanagawa and shizuoka prefectures however heightened interest in the water budget of lake ahinoko in recent years is not related to this issue rather it is because oki and hirano 1970 in their classic paper about the origin and zoning of hakone thermal waters proposed that zone ii waters which well out in spas along branches of the hayakawa river and are characterized by high concentrations of bicarbonate and sulfate ions are originally ground waters that come from the lake s side flowing through the edifice of the volcano s central cones since the classic paper by oki and hirano 1970 the water budget of lake ashinoko has been studied in relation to the origin of hakone thermal waters examining the annual water budget of the hayakawa river the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 estimated that among the 63 million m3 of rainfall on the catchment area 27 million m3 flow into lake ashinoko 21 million m3 evaporate and 15 million m3 of residual water become zone ii thermal waters in the oki and hirano model on the other hand matsuo et al 1979 solved six simultaneous equations about the lake s water rainfall on the lake and on the catchment area the isotopes and chloride content in the lake s water and in the ground water of the catchment area based on the assumption that they are all in a steady state on an annual value basis they found that 42 of the water input into the lake is rainfall while the remaining 58 is ground water from the catchment area and that surface drainage and evaporation account for 87 and 13 of the output respectively a noticeable feature of their model is that ground water flowing to the outside of the catchment area which was implicitly considered to become thermal water was estimated to be 2 5 million m3 only one sixth of the estimate by the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 this is because a large amount of water was attributed to evapotranspiration from the catchment area corresponding to 1 7 times the evaporation from the lake per unit area more recently itadera 2006 estimated the inflow of ground water to the lake at 26 million m3 on the basis of annual values of rainfall on the lake intake at fukara gate and evaporation from the lake that was obtained by the makkink equation makkink 1957 which is a simplified penman like equation where only data of temperature and sunshine hours are needed besides two parameters that characterize regional climatic features if evapotranspiration per unit area is assumed to be 70 of evaporation according to an empirical law kayane 1980 then the amount of outflow from the catchment area not flowing into the lake becomes 30 million m3 the value is larger than that suggested by the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 this result is partly because precipitation at the amedas station of the japan meteorological agency was used to estimate the average amount of annual precipitation in the catchment area it should be noted here that in all previous studies the water budget of lake ashinoko was studied on the basis of annual mean values for precipitation drainage evaporation and evapotranspiration and on the assumption that the lake s water is in a steady state in this paper having obtained detailed data about the intake at fukara gate by fortunate chance we conducted a correlation analysis between monthly potential inflow of water to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake plus a change in storage water the monthly potential inflow consists of rainfall on the lake and on the catchment area each month while monthly outflow of water from the lake consists of drainage from fukara gate and evaporation usually the water budget of a lake might be expressed by the following equation direct precipitation surface and underground inflows to the lake change in storage water evaporation surface outflow groundwater outflow where surface and underground inflows precipitation on the catchment area evapotranspiration infiltration into the ground from the correlation analysis between monthly potential inflow to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake plus the change in storage water monthly surface and underground influx to the lake from the catchment area can be estimated then the sum of infiltration into the ground and evapotranspiration are obtained by subtracting the amount of influx to the lake from precipitation on the catchment area to obtain the amount of infiltration therefore it is necessary to evaluate evapotranspiration in some way this matter is discussed in later sections we did not consider groundwater outflow from the lake in the analysis but some studies about outflow are referred to in the section of the discussion where implications of the results of the correlation analysis are detailed 2 data regarding the rainfall on lake ashinoko we used data of hakone en station on the eastern shore of the lake which is operated by the land development bureau of the kanagawa prefectural government kpg for rainfall on the catchment area data from the hakone ashinoyu amedas station of the japan meteorological agency near the summit of the central cones were used locations of those observation stations as well as that of the kojiri and fukara water gates are shown in fig 1 where the range of the catchment area which we maintained as in previous studies is shown by a thick broken line in fig 2 a monthly rainfall at hakone en is compared with that at the hakone ashinoyu amedas station it is obvious that monthly variations are very similar even though rainfall at the amedas station appears to be larger from the correlation shown in fig 2b monthly rainfall at the amedas station was estimated to be on average about 1 1 times higher than that at hakone en after discovering that an outlier seen in fig 2b was due to false data at the amedas station on may 2009 we corrected the data as follows first we obtained a linear regression in which the outlier was removed beforehand then we replaced the false data at the amedas station by a value on the regression line corresponding to the data at hakone en on may 2009 in the following analysis the corrected data was used the water level was observed at a point on the upper side of kojiri gate the data was recorded every second and one minute averages were automatically registered to a database of the hot spring research institute in fig 3 the change in the one minute average of the first minute in each hour is plotted the monthly quantity of drainage from fukara gate was calculated using the monthly mean average of the flux per second which was supplied by the ashinoko water utilization association of shizuoka prefecture the monthly value of evaporation from the lake was estimated by the makkink equation makkink 1957 following itadera 2005 in the estimation based on this equation we used monthly mean sunshine duration data issued by the japan meteorological agency and air temperature observed by the hot springs research institute in the sengokubara region on the north shore of lake ashinoko respectively fig 4 shows the change in water level of lake ashinoko i e one minute averages at 0 00 am on the first day of each month monthly intake at the fukara gate and monthly values of evaporation in the correlation analysis between monthly potential inflow to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake plus change in storage water we used values shown in fig 4 for monthly amounts of intake and evaporation monthly changes in storage water of the lake were calculated by multiplying the difference between the one minute averages at 0 00 am on the first day of each month and that of the previous month and the area of the lake in this case we did not take into account the possibility that the area of the lake would change with a rise or lowering of the water level since the variation in water level was not so large that it might have affected the results of the analysis the clear variations in seasonal values which in summer are larger than in winter can be seen in the intake at fukara gate and evaporation 3 water budget analysis 3 1 methods we investigated the water budget of lake ashinoko on the basis of a correlation between monthly potential inflow of water to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake plus the change in storage water the similarity in variation of the inflow and outflow plus change in storage water is obvious in the graph of fig 5 where the sum of monthly rainfall on the lake r and on the catchment area rc are shown by white bars on the top side while the sum of the increase of storage water δw evaporation ϕe and drainage from fukara gate ϕd are shown by black bars on the bottom side it can also be seen that the former quantity is much larger than the latter in the correlation analysis we used data from january 2009 to march 2013 when data of drainage flux from fukara gate was available in performing the correlation analysis we assumed that all of the rainfall on the catchment area flows into the lake this assumption is actually not correct for some part of rainfall that infiltrates underground would not flow into the lake but flow outside of the catchment area and some would be lost by evapotranspiration the reason we made this assumption is that we were most interested in elucidating the ratio of rainfall on the catchment area which flows into the lake the ratio can be obtained by the correlation analysis as described next note that groundwater outflow from the lake was not taken into account in the correlation analysis some comments about the outflow are made in the discussion 3 2 correlation analysis fig 6 shows a scatter plot of the sum of the increase of storage water δw evaporation ϕe and drainage from fukara gate ϕd in the last month against potential inflow of water to the lake i e sum of rainfall on the lake r 1 and the catchment area rc 1 where index 1 shows that the values are those during the previous month from fig 6 it is clearly seen that both quantities are well correlated provided that the amount of the sum of rainfall is less than about 10 million m3 per month as was described in section 1 a water gate is set at kojiri the location corresponds to the head of the hayakawa river usually water of the lake does not flow through the gate but is discharged when it rains heavily and water level rises 50 cm higher than the average level so that the overflowing flood water does not damage lower residential areas ohyama 2018 this is why the plotted points in fig 6 reach a ceiling for the sum of rainfall exceeding about 10 million m3 next we investigated the correlation for the range of values in the abscissa less than 10 million m3 fig 7 shows the plot of the sum of δw ϕe and ϕd against the sum of rainfall on the lake r 1 and the catchment area rc 1 in the previous month for the range of the abscissa less than 10 million m3 the coefficient of determination r2 whose value represents the strength of the correlation is 0 672 here it should be noted that the ground water that flows into the lake from the catchment area may include rain that fell several months prior and not only in the previous month in this study we evaluated how much rain that fell in one two three four and additional months before is included in the ground water that flows into the lake each month by searching for a combination of coefficients for rainfall of each of the prior months which would give the strongest correlation first we defined y and x as y δw ϕd ϕe x r 1 f rc 1 g rc 2 h rc 3 i rc 4 j rc 5 where rc 2 rc 3 rc 4 and rc 5 in the equation for x represent precipitation of two three four and five prior months respectively then we searched the value of the coefficients f g h i and j that gave the best correlation between y and x and two parameters of the linear regression line for each of the following five situations 1 f 1 g h i j 0 2 f g 1 h i j 0 3 f g h 1 i j 0 4 f g h i 1 j 0 5 f g h i j 1 the above five situations correspond to the correlation when rainfall in only the previous month or in the past two three four and five months respectively were included we set the sum of coefficients to 1 for all situations which indicates that we assumed that all of the rainfall in the catchment area flows into the lake even if this may take a few or more months it turned out that this assumption was incorrect after conducting the correlation analysis in section 3 3 we examined what ratio of rainfall on the catchment area actually flows into the lake the y versus x plot in situation 1 is shown in fig 7 in the following situations we adopted a practical method to search for the most appropriate combinations of coefficients for which the correlation would become the strongest for example in situation 2 we varied the value of f at an interval of 0 001 with the condition that g 1 f and obtained 0 776 and 0 224 for f and g respectively as the most appropriate combination of the coefficients in situation 3 we searched for the most appropriate combination of the values of f g h as follows first we set the value of f as 0 001 and varied the value of g at an interval of one hundredth of 1 0 001 in which h 1 0 001 g then we set the value of f as 0 002 and varied the value of g at an interval of one hundredth of 1 0 002 with the condition that h 1 0 002 g by continuing this process we examined altogether 1000 100 cases of the combination of these coefficients and found that the most appropriate combination of coefficients f g and h that gave the strongest correlation is 0 732 0 1876 and 0 0804 respectively in situation 4 we fixed the value of f as 0 732 according to the result obtained in situation 3 then examined the most appropriate combination of g h and i as follows first we set the value of g as one thousandth of 0 268 1 0 732 i e 0 000268 and varied the value of h at an interval of one hundredth of 0 267732 0 268 0 000268 with the condition that i 0 267732 h then we set the value of g as two thousandths of 0 268 i e 0 000536 and varied the value of h at an interval of one hundredth of 0 267464 0 268 0 000536 with the condition that i 0 26264 h we repeated the correlation analysis for altogether 1000 100 cases of the combination of the coefficients g h and i similarly to situation 3 and found that the most appropriate combination of the coefficients f g h and i was 0 732 0 1876 0 0796 and 0 0008 respectively in situation 5 we first fixed the values of f and g as 0 732 and 0 188 respectively according to the result obtained in situations 3 and 4 then searched for the most appropriate values of h i and j repeating a similar calculation performed in previous situations that is we varied the value of h at an interval of one thousandth of 0 080 1 0 732 0 188 and for each value of h varied the value of i at an interval of one hundredth of 0 080 h with the condition that j 0 080 h i the most appropriate combination of the coefficients f g h i and j was thus 0 732 0 1876 0 0788 0 0016 and 0 000 respectively the r2 value for situations 1 2 3 4 and 5 is 0 672 0 802 0 819 0 820 and 0 821 respectively fig 8 note that the r2 value when rainfall of the prior two months was taken into account is considerably larger than when rainfall of only the previous month was considered however the strength of the correlation did not become significantly larger if rainfall four or more months prior was taken into account this is consistent with the result that h and i the coefficient for the term of rainfall four and five month prior is 0 for the combination of coefficients that gave the strongest correlation in situations 4 and 5 this suggests that ground water that flows into the lake consists mostly of rain that fell in the prior two months and that rain of three months prior is somewhat included whereas the contribution of rain that fell four or more months prior is negligible supplementary fig 1 shows the change in the value of r2 when the value of coefficient f was varied from 0 0 1 0 in situation 3 r2 assumed a maximum for f at 0 732 and declined for both larger and smaller values of f r2 when f 1 0 is clearly smaller than its maximum value this demonstrates that water flowing into the lake from the catchment area in each month includes rain that fell at least two month prior in fig 9 the sum of the increase of storage water δw 1 evaporation ϕe 1 and drainage from fukara gate ϕd 1 in the previous month is plotted against water inflow when rainfall in the prior three months on the catchment area was taken into account where f g and h are 0 732 0 188 and 0 080 respectively as can be seen the correlation is fairly strong but we note that the linear regression line crosses the y axis at the point of a positive value this seems unreasonable because it indicates that the sum of the increase of storage water evaporation and drainage from fukara gate is positive even if the sum of precipitation on the lake and the catchment area in the prior three months is 0 a possible explanation is to consider whether this is due to incorrectness of the estimation of evaporation however as is shown in supplementary figs 2 a and b the linear regression line cut the axis of the ordinate at a positive value even if evaporation was removed this indicates that the reason why the regression line did not cross the origin is not due to the incorrectness of the estimation of evaporation another possible cause for the regression line not to cross the origin may be the omission of evapotranspiration if evapotranspiration is large in those months when precipitation was large and vice versa for little evapotranspiration the slope of the weakest regression line might increase slightly and pass through a point nearer to the origin however we believe that this possibility is very unlikely because the correlation between the precipitation on lake ashinoko and evaporation from the lake for which evapotranspiration is supposed to be proportional e g kayane 1980 is weak as shown in fig 10 here we would like to note that the points at which the linear regression line crosses the y and x axes gradually approach the origin when rainfall in the prior two three and four months was taken into account this feature is also recognizable when evaporation was not included in the ordinate as is seen in supplementary figs 2 a and b this suggests that a possible cause for the intersection of the linear regression line with the y axis at the point of a positive value is that there exists a small amount of rainfall that fell far earlier than the months we took into account this amount is included in the ground water that flows into the lake each month the results obtained above show that water flowing into the lake each month consists mostly of rainfall that fell during the preceding three months indicating that previous studies about the water budget of lake ashinoko which were based on average annual precipitation drainage and evaporation were clearly inappropriate as already noted we assumed in the correlation analysis that all rainfall on the catchment area flows into the lake although this process might take a few or more months to achieve in our analysis to reflect this we set the sum of the coefficients of the terms on the right hand side of x as 1 however the value of the slope of the linear regression line 0 43 is much smaller than 1 which indicates that only a portion of rainfall on the catchment area flows into the lake the proportion cannot be obtained directly from the value of the slope since the abscissa of fig 9 incorporates the sum of rainfall on the lake and on the catchment area combined in the next section we examine what percentage of rainfall on the catchment area flows into the lake 3 3 amount of water flowing into the lake from the catchment area in order to estimate the percentage of rainfall on the catchment area that flows into the lake we searched for the value of α that would make the slope of the linear regression line 45 when all the terms on the right hand side of x except for r were multiplied by α we found that the value is about 0 26 fig 11 this indicates that only about a quarter of rain that fell in the prior few months on the catchment area flows into the lake the estimated value of 0 26 for α should be taken as a lower limit because as noted in section 3 1 we did not take into account groundwater outflow from the lake another possible cause for obtaining a small value for α might be that we took data from the hakone ashinoyu amedas station near the summit of a central cone to evaluate the amount of rainfall on the catchment area however that effect was not considered to be significant since the average precipitation at the amedas station is only about 1 1 fold more than at hakone en see fig 2 we would like to note here that the linear regression line in fig 11 does not pass through the origin but crosses the ordinate at a positive point 0 076 this shows that the value of the ordinate of each point is 0 076 107 m3 larger than the value of the abscissa on average the implication of this is discussed in the next section 3 4 estimation of the amount of water infiltrating under the ground of the catchment area we found that about a quarter of rain that fell in the prior three months on the catchment area flows into lake ashinoko this does not mean however that all of the residual part of the rainfall infiltrates into the ground under the catchment area as some water is lost through evapotranspiration the monthly amount of water that infiltrates under the ground can be estimated by the following equation x y ϕet ϕf where x r 1 f rc 1 g rc 2 h rc 3 and y δw ϕd ϕe as defined in section 3 2 ϕet and ϕf represent evapotranspiration and the water discharged from kojiri gate at the time of heavy rainfall respectively as was described in section 1 matsuo et al 1979 solved six simultaneous equations to find that evapotranspiration is as large as 1 7 fold higher than the evaporation from the lake per unit area yet such a large value is thought to be unnatural a simple way to estimate the amount of evapotranspiration may be to set its value per unit area at about 70 of evaporation following kayane 1980 regarding the estimation of the amount of water discharged from kojiri gate it is important to note that the y value reaches a ceiling when the x value exceeds about 10 million m3 see fig 6 if we consider that this feature reflects discharge of the lake s water from kojri gate at the time of heavy rainfall then the amount of discharged water may be evaluated by summing the difference between the value of the y axis and the value of the least regression line for the points whose value of the x axis exceeds 10 million m3 fig 12 shows an estimated monthly amount of water that infiltrates under the ground of the catchment area the average annual amount of infiltration is about 33 million m3 this is nearly the same as the amount inferred from the result by itadera 2006 who evaluated influx to the lake and two fold larger than the value estimated by the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 see section 1 as shown in supplementary fig 3 the ratio of rainfall which infiltrates under the ground of the catchment area is about 45 on average there is another method to estimate the amount of water that infiltrates under the ground of the catchment area in the previous section we noted that the linear regression line in fig 11 crosses the ordinate at a point 0 076 we suppose this implies the existence of a stationary inflow of 0 76 million m3 per month besides a short term inflow which is 25 7 of rainfall during the prior few months the excess inflow amounts to 0 76 12 9 12 million m3 in a year if this stationary inflow is taken into account the amount of water that infiltrates under the ground of the catchment area can be estimated by the following equation 1 0 0 257 average annual precipitation stationary inflow evapotranspiration by inserting the values 75 26 9 12 and 13 68 for mean annual precipitation stationary inflow and evapotranspiration respectively estimated by assuming that it is 70 of evaporation per unit area we obtained 33 1 million m3 this value is exactly the same as that estimated by the equation r 1 f rc 1 g rc 2 h rc 3 δw ϕd ϕe tϕ ϕf the coincidence of the estimate of the amount of infiltration by the two methods indicates that our hypothesis that crossing the linear regression line at a point of a positive value in fig 12 indicates the existence of a stationary inflow we consider this stationary influx to consist of rain that fell far earlier than the past several months and was stocked in a reservoir under the catchment area the above estimated amount of water that infiltrates under the catchment area should be taken as the upper limit because outflow from the lake was not incorporated in the analysis nevertheless the result is remarkable how is it possible that about 45 of the rainfall on the catchment area infiltrates underground and does not flow into the lake we discuss this problem in the next section where we show that the central cones of hakone volcano are a prospective site of infiltration then propose that the infiltrated water becomes a major source of hakone thermal waters 4 major source of thermal waters in hakone in a study on the underground water around kojiri ogino et al 1971 showed that there exists a stationary flow from lake ashinoko to the sengokuhara plain beneath volcanic debris where the kojiri gate was constructed the amount of underground flow was estimated at about 0 3 million m3 per month oyama 2013 this value is not so large so the result we obtained is not changed significantly we note here that it is probable that some portion of the rainfall on the flank of the southern rim of the hakone caldera which corresponds to the headwater of the sukumo river flows into the river because the rim is deeply eroded by gullies another possible route for the outflow might be the tan na fault whose northern end is considered to extend to the southern coast of lake ashinoko research group for active faults in japan 1991 although seismicity around the tan na fault is generally low moderate earthquakes often occur in the northern part yukutake et al 2013 the relatively high seismicity in the northern part of the fault where it crosses the southern rim of the hakone caldera suggests a possibility that some ground water in the hakone caldera flows into a fracture zone of the tan na fault however the outflow from the southern part of the watershed of lake ashinoko is not considered to be large enough to influence the result of the correlation analysis where does a larger part of the rainfall on the catchment area then go the catchment area is delineated by the rim of the hakone caldera on the west and south by volcanic debris on the north and by the central cones of the hakone volcano on the east within the watershed a western slope of the central cones occupies nearly half of the entire catchment area see fig 1 therefore if rainfall on the central cones does not flow into lake ashinoko but instead penetrates into the volcanic edifice the query about the whereabouts of a substantial part of the rainfall on the catchment area disappears actually there are many observations that support the idea that rainfall on the central cones penetrates into the volcanic edifice nw se trending fissures were observed on the surface kobayashi 2008 mannen 2008 many cracks and fractures were estimated to exist in the edifice daita et al 2009 yukutake et al 2010 2011 honda et al 2014 doke et al 2018 steam spouting from fumaroles in oowaku dani and the so unzan area is thought to arise from a shallow hot water layer mannen et al 2013 itadera et al 2018 furthermore investigating seismic velocity structure under the hakone caldera yukutake et al 2015 showed that fluids are abundant at around a depth of several km beneath the central cones these observational facts and results of analytical studies support the idea that rainfall on the area of the central cones penetrates into the edifice and that abundant water is stocked at a depth ranging from the surface to several km deep we propose here that this stocked water which is heated by underlying magma is the major source of thermal water that feeds the spas in the eastern flank of the central cones in the classic paper on the origin of hakone thermal waters and zoning of spas oki and hirano 1970 divided the occurrence of thermal waters into four zones in their model carbon in hco3 dissolved in zone ii waters was considered to be organic in origin however recent studies showed that carbon dioxide in hco3 dissolved in the thermal water is supplied by volcanic gases when they pass through reservoirs of water beneath the central cones daita et al 2011 suzuki 2011 these studies support our proposition that spring water in hakone which wells out on the eastern flank of the central cones originates mainly from rain stocked within the volcanic edifice and heated by underlying magma fig 13 shows a schematic diagram of our model about the formation of hakone thermal waters the essence of our model which is different from the model proposed in the classic paper by oki and hirano 1970 is that the so called zone ii thermal water which was attributed to ground water flowing from the lake side is considered to consist mainly of rain that has fallen on the central cones in an examination of the water budget of the hayakawa river the water pollution research group of hakone 1975 figured that even if an estimated 15 million m3 exiting the catchment area were added to the river water 10 million m3 would still be lacking noting that the amount of this deficit is almost the same as the volume of thermal waters drawn annually at hakone spas the research group considered that the water budget of the hayakawa river is balanced by the upwelling of hot springs and worried that excessive drawing of water might lower the head of the ground water level and result in an exhaustion of thermal waters in hakone spas in the future however if rain penetrates into the volcanic edifice of the central cones if the water reserved in the edifice is heated by underlying magma and if the heated waters continuously well out at spas on the eastern flank then this concern disappears in fact the annual amount of infiltration into the edifice of the central cones estimated at about 33 million m3 is enough to cover the volume of all thermal waters drawn annually at hakone spas and the water flux of the hayakawa river recent monitoring surveys showed no long term tendency of a fall in temperature dilution of ion concentrations or lowering of the head of the ground waters of the wells itadera et al 2013 kikugawa et al 2014 if there is still a lingering concern about the long term sustainability of thermal water that may be a problem related to the heat source is the amount of magma enough to warm sufficient water which originates from rain in the volcanic edifice for a long period of time earthquake swarm activities have occurred frequently in the hakone caldera since 2001 e g harada et al 2013b and accompanying these activities dilatation of the hakone volcano has been observed by gnss harada et al 2013a a notable feature of this dilatation is that it did not return to the state before the occurrence of activities each time i e dilatation has been accumulating if the mogi model mogi 1958 is applied the rate of increase of magma volume in the reservoir which is estimated to exist at a depth of about 10 km beneath komagatake daita et al 2009 is evaluated at around 1 2 107 m3 year private communication by a kobayashi this rate of magma supply to the reservoir is sufficient to heat infiltrating water of 33 million m3 to more than 100 c per year when temperature specific heat and specific density of andesite magma are about 900 c 0 2 cal g c and 2 5 respectively therefore if the supply rate of magma in the past 20 years will continue then the heat source required to produce thermal waters is assured even if the rate of supply is actually not so large in the long term it was estimated that 10 000 years would be required for the magma under the hakone volcano to cool down yuhara 1968 consequently it seems there is no concern that thermal waters in hakone spas will be depleted in the near future 5 conclusion we investigated the water budget of lake ashinoko based on a correlation between monthly potential inflow of water to the lake and monthly outflow of water from the lake where potential inflow consists of rainfall on the lake and the catchment area and monthly out flow is an increase decrease of the water of the lake plus intake from fukara gate and evaporation after performing this correlation analysis we found that about a quarter of the rainfall during a few preceding months flows into the lake besides that there is a stationary influx supposed to consist of rains that fell far earlier than the past several months it was estimated that about 45 of rainfall on the catchment area infiltrates under the ground of this area we proposed that rainfall on the central cones does not enter the lake but instead penetrates into the volcanic edifice there exist a number of observational facts and analytical results that support this idea furthermore we proposed a hypothesis in which the abundance of water in the edifice of the central cones that is heated by underlying magma is a major source of thermal waters that well out at spas on the eastern flank along the hayakawa river as well as steam spouting from fumaroles in owaku dani and so unzan the quantity of magma that has been supplied to the reservoir in recent years is sufficient to heat ground water reserved in the edifice of the central cones continuously therefore it is thought that the thermal water in hakone spas will not dry up or cool down in the near future declaration of competing interest none

8382,study region the study region is great britain gb a small non continental island landmass in north west europe study focus data for total dissolved solids tds from groundwater samples can be used to characterise regional scale variations in the quality of deep groundwater systems combined with information about typical well depths tds data can be used to identify the presence of currently undeveloped fresh or brackish groundwater at depth that may require protection this study considers the distribution of tds with depth relative to sea level in the main gb aquifers and selected other key hydrogeological units and demonstrates how useful insights can be obtained from data led analyses of depth variations in groundwater chemistry if the regional context of hydrogeological systems is taken into account new hydrogeological insights in gb tds varies over about five orders of magnitude up to about 330 000 mg l with a general increase in mineralisation with depth overall there is a transition from fresh 1625 mg l to brackish 10 000 mg l groundwater at about 500 m below surface and from brackish to saline 10 000 mg l groundwater at about 700 m given that the 95 tile depth of water wells is about 200 m it is evident that there is currently undeveloped fresh groundwater at depth across large parts of the study area that may require protection although it is inferred that tds is not the only factor limiting exploitation and use of these deeper resources as in this study previous data led analyses of fresh groundwater at depth have typically analysed tds as depth below surface however if tds data is analysed relative to sea level and in the context of regional hydrogeological information or models additional insights can be gained on the distribution and controls on fresh groundwater at depth projecting tds data into a 3d hydrogeological model of the study area shows that fresh groundwater at depth exhibits spatial coherence and is generally associated with relatively deep sedimentary basins overlying older less permeable basement keywords groundwater total dissolved solids tds gb 1 introduction globally groundwater provides of the order of one third of all freshwater supplies doll et al 2012 2014 two and a half billion people are estimated to depend solely on groundwater for basic daily water needs un 2015 and it sustains the health of many important groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems gleeson et al 2012 koirala et al 2017 fan et al 2013 have estimated that about one third of the global land surface area has a water table depth or capillary fringe within 3 m of the ground surface and much of the groundwater that is abstracted is from relatively shallow unconfined groundwater systems of only a few 10 s of metres in depth however due to pressure on groundwater resources wada et al 2010 macdonald et al 2016 as well as the growing use of the subsurface for other activities there is an increasing focus on deep groundwater systems for potable water as well as for agricultural irrigation and industrial purposes for example across large parts of africa the need for water security in relation to growing populations and the need to develop resilience to the effects of climate change has led to continental scale assessments of deep groundwater systems macdonald et al 2012 throughout many of the major deltas of the world there is a trend towards ever deeper exploitation of groundwater systems for irrigation and to address natural water quality issues lapworth et al 2018 in the usa the drive to find groundwater to augment supplies for irrigation and potable use has resulted in an interest in deep groundwater including brackish groundwater kang and jackson 2016 stanton et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 perrone and jasschko 2019 there are many challenges associated with the development and management of deep groundwater systems there is the need to consider governance of and access to deep groundwater hoogesteger and wester 2015 to assess costs of appropriate technologies and implementation of water resource management systems harou and lund 2008 and to avoid overexploitation of deep aquifers wada et al 2010 scanlon et al 2012 in addition in regions where other activities are undertaken in the deep subsurface there is also a need to understand the distribution of deep groundwater systems to provide protection of currently unexploited groundwater resources for future use for example there is a requirement to understand the vulnerability of deep groundwater systems to activities such as conventional and unconventional onshore hydrocarbon development jackson et al 2013 cai and ofterdinger 2014 vengosh et al 2014 loveless et al 2018 2019 mcintosh and ferguson 2019 underground nuclear waste storage stanfors et al 1999 and co2 sequestration newmark et al 2010 notwithstanding these challenges practical constraints on the development and use of deep groundwater are primarily related to an ability to obtain adequate yields of suitable quality water from depth the aim of the current study is to characterise and better understand regional scale variations in the quality of deep groundwater systems based on a large set of observational data for total dissolved solids tds note the concept of deep groundwater and deep groundwater systems are here used in a relative not absolute sense and refer to an interval below the current normal depth of active groundwater exploitation as investigated and described by this study the concept can also refer to a depth interval relative to a datum such sea level across a given region also investigated and described by this study a few recent data led regional to continental scale studies have identified low salinity fresh or brackish groundwater at depth in the usa using measurements of tds and have attempted to estimate volumes of currently undeveloped fresh or brackish groundwater and their susceptibility to pollution from unconventional hydrocarbon development and other potentially polluting sub surface activates analysing the tds of groundwater samples in california usa kang and jackson 2016 estimated that useable groundwater volumes could be increased by up to fourfold if groundwater 3000 ppm tds was exploited down to a depth of 3 km but also noted that some of these deep groundwater resources would be vulnerable to conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon extraction similarly kang et al 2019 analysed tds from 17 basins across the southwestern united states and found that in seven of the basins there was useable water defined as 10 000 ppm tds in the deep groundwater defined in their study as depths 150 m stanton et al 2017 undertook an analysis of brackish groundwater in the usa defined as a tds of 1 000 10 000 mg l and estimated that almost a third of the subsurface down to a depth of about 900 m contained brackish groundwater ferguson et al 2018a used tds data to investigate the depth at which groundwater transitioned from fresh to brackish to saline groundwater defined as fresh 3000 and brackish 10 000 mg l respectively and compared these depth intervals with the depth of hydrocarbon exploitation activities in 28 sedimentary basins across the usa they noted that in basins where relatively deep fresh and brackish water is present groundwater is potentially vulnerable due to the proximity to hydrocarbon development and to waste injection wells this study builds on the earlier work to identify the depth of the fresh to brackish groundwater transition for great britain gb relates this transition to current groundwater resource management and protection depth thresholds and considers the implications with respect to vulnerability to potential unconventional hydrocarbon development in gb it assesses if the transition depth in gb is consistent with those identified in previous studies kang and jackson 2016 stanton et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 in addition it provides additional evidence to test the assertion of ferguson et al 2018a that globally there may be less fresh groundwater than estimated previously by gleeson et al 2016 who assumed that only 6 of water in the upper 2 km was young less than 50 years old finally the earlier data led studies of tds either implicitly or in the case of ferguson et al 2018a explicitly did not address depth variations in tds within individual hydrogeological units and they did not consider the effects of hydrogeochemical evolution associated with regional groundwater flow or the effects of basin structure on observed tds depth distributions this study considers the distribution of tds with depth relative to sea level in the main gb aquifers and selected other key hydrogeological units and demonstrates how useful insights can be obtained from data led rather than process driven e g hanor 1994a 1994b smedley et al 2018 analyses of depth variations in groundwater chemistry if the regional context of hydrogeological systems is taken into account following an overview of regulatory limits and definitions of tds related to groundwater the hydrogeology of the study area england wales and scotland great britain and tds dataset is briefly introduced and described then the depth below surface distribution of tds is characterised and compared with depths of water wells and with water quality thresholds for fresh and brackish groundwater for the study area and as a function of eight distinct hydrogeological units the distribution of tds data is then described spatially and in 3d relative to sea level in order to investigate the spatial coherence of water quality data at depth as a function of the regional geological and hydrogeological setting finally the results are discussed in relation to previous data led analyses of large tds datasets and the implications for future systematic analysis of water quality observations from deep groundwater systems are considered 2 tds limits of fresh and brackish groundwater total dissolved solids tds a measure of inorganic salts and organic substances in solution in a liquid world health organisation 2011 is a widely reported parameter related to groundwater quality because it provides an indication of the overall degree of mineralisation and hence potability of groundwater it is usually expressed as mg l or g l weight by volume but sometimes as ppm or weight per weight tds is either determined from the weight of dry residue remaining after evaporation of the volatile portion of a sample or can be calculated from the sum of the major ions although often the method used to estimate tds is unreported or not described note that many studies tend to quote electrical conductance ec or specific electrical conductance sec defined at 25 c in preference to tds to describe the degree of mineralisation of groundwater e g kim et al 2008 salinity and overall degree of mineralisation typically expressed as tds tend to increase along groundwater flow paths and with depth freeze and cherry 1979 and the flow and hydrogeochemical processes effecting the evolution of groundwater mineralisation and quality in sedimentary basins and fractured basement terrains are well understood kreitler 1989 palmer and cherry 1984 hanor 1994a 1994b ferguson et al 2018b variations in groundwater quality including tds arise from a dynamic interplay between depositional and basin evolution processes and the development of basin scale to local scale groundwater flow systems toth 1963 1999 however it is only recently that the distribution of tds data with depth has been the subject of systematic data led analysis with the specific aim of understanding the location of groundwater quality limits or thresholds with depth kang and jackson 2016 stanton et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 no limits are set for tds on health grounds globally however there are a variety of regulatory limits and advisory recommendations for potable groundwater supply based on tds in addition tds can be used as a guide to protection of groundwater resources for example there is a desirable limit for tds of potable groundwater in india of 500 mg l with up to 2000 mg l permissible in absence of an alternate source bureau of indian standards 2012 in california the california state water resources control board 2016 recommended limit for tds in public groundwater supply is also 500 mg l with a short term limit of 1500 mg l even where no limit is recommended or set salinities above a certain value are described as unpalatable for example the world health organisation stating that water with a tds of less than 600 mg l is good quality and that over 1000 mg l it becomes increasingly unpalatable world health organisation 2011 in australia the national health and medical research council nhmrc 2011 has set aesthetic guidelines with a groundwater tds content of less than 600 mg l regarded as good quality drinking water 600 900 mg l fair quality 900 to 1200 mg l as poor quality and over 1200 mg l unacceptable the epa epa 2019 states an unenforceable guideline maximum value national secondary drinking water regulations of 500 mg l for potable groundwater in the usa and also defines underground sources of drinking water that should be protected as sources with a tds of 10 000 mg l similarly there is little consistency in how brackish and saline groundwater is defined for example even though the national groundwater association ngwa defines groundwater with a tds of less than 1000 mg l as fresh 1 000 3 000 mg l as slightly saline and 3000 to 10 000 mg l as moderately saline ngwa 2017 in an assessment of brackish water in the contemporaneous usa stanton et al 2017 defined brackish groundwater as having a tds range of 1 000 10 000 mg l digiulio et al 2018 identified widely differing criteria between 17 states in the usa related to the protection of brackish groundwater in the context of unconventional oil and gas development with regard to regulatory limits for potable groundwater supply in the united kingdom uk the council of the european union directed that the maximum electrical conductance ec or conductivity at 20 c for potable groundwater should be 2500 μs cm european commission 2000 2006 this limit has been embodied in the water supply regulations for the uk that specify the maximum admissible concentrations and values for parameters in drinking water for both public supply and private water supplies for human consumption the uk technical advisory group uktag on the water framework directive define water in groundwater bodies as groundwater that is part of an aquifer and is a long term resource that can be exploited for human activities and by implication is of good potable quality uktag 2012 uktag note that there is a lower depth at which groundwater loses value as a potable resource and for consolidated aquifers the uktag guideline for maximum groundwater body thickness is 400 m in the absence of any other information table 2 in uktag 2012 by inference this means that the effective maximum depth of potable groundwater is taken to be 400 m in the absence of any other information notwithstanding this environmental regulators in the uk operate a precautionary principal and seek to protect all groundwater regardless of whether it is designated as a groundwater body or not unless groundwater can be denoted as permanently unsuitable for use as a resource for the purposes of the present study fresh groundwater is defined as having a tds of 1625 mg l approximately equivalent to 2500 μs cm consistent with groundwater legislation in uk and the european community in addition like previous studies van weert 2012 ferguson et al 2018a the common convention of freeze and cherry 1979 is followed where the maximum tds for brackish water is defined as 10 000 mg l tds of saline water is taken to be in the range 10 000 100 000 mg l with sea water at about 35 000 mg l and brine is defined by a tds in excess of 100 000 mg l freeze and cherry 1979 3 study area the gb study area fig 1 consists of a small non continental island landmass it is characterised by relatively short but slow groundwater flow paths resulting in saline water occurring in aquifers at relatively small distances down gradient of outcrop and an absence of extensive confined aquifers containing fresh water downing et al 1987 deep regional groundwater flow is predominantly through sedimentary basins located above a low permeability basement where flow is currently controlled by upland divides and lowland coastal or submarine groundwater sinks downing et al 1987 observed that most groundwaters in gb have increasing mineralisation with depth and that their composition lies along the isotope composition δ180 δ2h ratio meteoric water line they interpreted these observations in terms of a geochemical evolution of groundwater along basinal scale flow lines note that groundwater conditions in gb have evolved over a long period of geological time since at least the beginning of the cenozoic some 65 million years before present when the landmass emerged from a lengthy phase of marine submergence during the late cretaceous bath et al 2006 however current basin scale groundwater flow systems reflect the present marine boundary of the british isles a relatively recent product of the holocene transgression following the last glacial maximum at around 15 000 years before the present day when large parts of the uk continental shelf were subaerially exposed downing et al 1987 of the tds observations described below the majority come from eight named regionally significant geological hydrostratigraphic units across the study area the majority are from the two principal aquifers in gb the cretaceous chalk ck and the permo triassic sandstones of the sherwood sandstone group ssg allen et al 1997 fig 1 in addition there are observations of tds from the cretaceous lower greensand lgs permian zechstein z deposits carboniferous age coal measures cm millstone grit mg and carboniferous limestone cl and the ordovician

information on pumping tests performed on the boreholes summary statistics for depths of all wells and boreholes in wellmaster are given in table 1 when the database was accessed in february 2019 the database contained records of the location and depth of 8640 water wells and boreholes for which tds data was available table 1 spatial coverage of the wells is focussed on the major aquifers across the region with data for the two most important aquifers the cretaceous chalk and the permo triassic sherwood sandstone group accounting for over half the observations in the database i e 3631 and 1430 observations respectively table 1 the depths in table 1 are taken broadly to be indicative of representative intervals of groundwater exploitation across the study area and of differences between the main hydrogeological units described in this study three sources of tds data have been used for this study tds data has been obtained i from the uk geothermal catalogue burley et al 1984 rollin 1987 ii from an investigation by nirex at sellafield northwest england in the context of developing a deep sub surface nuclear waste repository facility bath et al 1996 and iii from bgs wellmaster database bgs 2018 table 2 summaries the number of tds observations from each of these three sources the first two sources generally consist of relatively deep observations of tds whereas the wellmaster database generally consists of relatively shallow observations of tds associated with water wells however the wellmaster database contains significantly more tds data than the other two sources of tds data combined the uk geothermal catalogue burley et al 1984 rollin 1987 is a summary of temperature heat flow and geochemical data for the uk associated with an extensive characterisation and assessment of geothermal potential in the uk undertaken in the 1980s it comprises information on well and sample depth geological formation and chemical analyses tds samples reported in the catalogue were obtained from a range of earlier studies and sources including springs and thermal springs artesian discharges borehole or well samples depth samples pumped samples and drill stem test samples the catalogue also includes data from samples obtained from underground mine drainage primarily from the carboniferous coal measures however all samples flagged as underground mine drainage have been excluded from the analysis as it could not be ascertained if those data points represented in situ observations of tds the nirex study was a major regional investigation of the potential suitability for deep storage of radioactive waste and tds observations were made on samples obtained as part of environmental pressure tests discrete extraction tests and single packer flow tests on a series of deep boreholes in the sellafield area sutton 1996 the wellmaster database contains groundwater quality data primarily from relatively shallow boreholes in areas of active groundwater exploitation bgs 2018 8640 sites or 7 2 of the 119 475 springs wells and boreholes recorded in wellmaster database with known completion depths and named formations have tds data however the manner in which the water sample was obtained is typically unknown quality control qc on groundwater tds data can be undertaken where information on major ion concentrations is available along with tds qc was applied to the tds data from the geothermal catalogue the mean difference between the sum of six major ions mg l and tds mg l for this datasets is 1 0 of the recorded tds at the time of analysis nirex major ions were checked to ensure that they were within 15 of measured tds and the ionic charge balance was reported to typically be within 5 richards and bath 1997 the wellmaster database does not hold systematic information related to major ions and no qc was applied to this data source there are 9195 tds observations across the three data sources with 39 6 of those coming from the chalk and 16 7 from the permo triassic sandstones with the majority of these coming from the wellmaster database table 2 the wellmaster database provides 94 of the tds observations however because those observations are from relatively shallow depths compared with those in the other two datasets the mean sample depth in the wellmaster samples is 81 m compared with 878 m from the geothermal catalogue and 751 m for the nirex observations there is a systematic bias in the combined dataset towards tds data from shallow settings 4 2 methods a basic description of the tds data has been undertaken and tds values have been plotted as a function of depth below ground level to enable the depth distribution of tds values to be visualised in the context of characteristic depths of water well and water quality thresholds the approach of ferguson et al 2018a has been followed where tds data was binned into 100 m depth intervals and plotted it as box plots to characterise changes in tds with depth despite the bias towards more shallow observations in order to understand the spatial and 3d distribution of tds the tds data has also been analysed relative to sea level in the uk sea level is defined by a datum the ordnance datum od bradshaw et al 2015 taken to be the long term average of sea levels recorded at the newlyn tide gauge to assess the nature of any spatial correlation in fresh and brackish groundwater at depth tds observations below the 95 tile depth relative to sea level have been mapped and the location of fresh brackish and saline groundwater samples highlighted in addition the tds data has also been visualised as 2d sections through a 3d hydrogeological model of the study area newell 2019 to qualitatively investigate the influence of geological hydrogeological setting on the presence of fresh and brackish groundwater at depth the hydrogeological model is based on a simplified hydrostratigraphic sequence for the study area and the relationship between this and the eight named hydrogeological units for which there is tds data is shown in fig 1 tds data is projected into two representative sections through the 3d hydrogeological model of the study area to enhance the visualisation of tds data in the 2d sections a lateral clipping domain of 50 km on each side of the cross sections has been applied tds values lying within this clipping plane were projected onto the hydrogeological cross sections while this projection process increases the density of data shown on the cross sections the hydrostratigraphic context of the tds points might undergo some migration depending on the direction of projection relative to the structural dip 5 results tds varies over about five orders of magnitude table 3 fig 2 a at depths down to 100 m tds varies over about three orders of magnitude from about 10 to 10 000 mg l while at a depth of 1 km it varies from about 1000 to 100 000 mg l fig 2a there is a general increase in mineralisation of groundwater with depth defined by a general increase in the minimum value of tds for a given depth interval the maximum observed tds at just over 330 000 mg l is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of seawater and is for a sample from the zechstein unit from about 1 8 km depth although samples with a similar order of magnitude tds are found from depths of a few hundred metres to over 2 km 5 1 depth distribution of tds related to interval of active groundwater exploitation the mean depth of all water wells with data is 81 m and the 95 tile is 202 m table 1 with systematic differences in the depth of water wells between the two main aquifers for example the mean depth of water wells in the chalk is 75 m compared with 120 m for the permo triassic sandstones and the equivalent 95 tiles are 153 m and 305 m the 95 tile of all water wells is indicated on figs 2a by the dark blue interval even though most tds observations of fresh groundwater are within the zone of active groundwater exploitation there are many tds observations where fresh or brackish groundwater water is present below 202 m fig 2a table 4 summarises the number and percentage of observations where tds data indicate fresh or brackish conditions below the current intervals of exploitation there are 917 tds observations 10 0 of all the tds observations below the 95 tile depth of water wells of these observations 454 4 9 of all the tds samples are of fresh groundwater with about another 1 1 being brackish groundwater it is inferred from these observations that current groundwater exploitation in gb is not necessarily limited just by tds changes with depth other limiting factorsmay include specific water quality issues kinniburgh et al 1994 relatively low groundwater yields abesser and lewis 2015 and the relative cost of development of deep groundwater sources johns and özdemiroğlu 2007 charalambous 2019 5 2 depth of fresh to brackish groundwater transition in their analysis of the depth of transition between fresh and brackish groundwater across the contiguous usa ferguson et al 2018a plotted tds against depth as box plots in successive 100 m depth intervals so that the tds data could be readily compared with depth intervals of interest while accounting for a systematic bias towards shallow samples fig 2b is such a plot for tds data for the current study area with the mean tds in each 100 m depth interval indicated by the central line in each box and whisker plot again as in figs 2a in fig 2b the 95 tile of all water wells is indicated by the dark blue interval and the uktag groundwater deepest advisable limit down to 400 m is indicated by the base of the pale blue interval for each 100 m depth interval down to 500 m the mean tds of the binned data is less than the maximum admissible concentration for potable groundwater supplies in england 1625 mg l i e the intervals down to 500 m represent predominantly fresh groundwater fig 2b from 500 m down to a depth of 700 m tds is consistent with predominantly brackish groundwater conditions below 700 m the tds data indicates groundwater is saline and that it becomes progressively more saline with depth so that below 1 km the mean tds of the binned data exceeds that of seawater 35 000 mg l most water wells and boreholes recorded in the wellmaster database are within the 400 m depth interval defined by uktag 2012 as the maximum base of groundwater bodies this indicates some consistency between current depths of groundwater exploitation and the current uktag definition of the effective base of groundwater bodies however there are a small number of observations where tds values indicate that there is fresh and brackish groundwater below 400 m fig 2 table 4 there are 55 observations 0 6 of all tds samples below 400 m depth that indicate fresh groundwater conditions and 78 tds observations 0 8 of all tds samples that indicate brackish groundwater conditions below 400 m given these albeit limited observations and the distribution of binned tds data in fig 2b it is inferred that if a precautionary approach is taken to the definition of the effective base to groundwater bodies in the uk then this threshold might be more appropriately set at 500 m rather than at the current 400 m uktag 2012 5 3 tds as a function of hydrostratigraphy and hydrogeological setting fig 3 shows the depth distribution of tds as a function of the eight named hydrostratigraphic units very high values of tds appear to occur broadly independent of depth and are found in all named units with the exception of the lower greensand that like the chalk hasn t been sampled at depths greater than a few hundred metres fig 3 however in all units except the borrowdale volcanic group high values of tds are unusual and the majority of the tds observations are below the tds of seawater table 3 there are differences in the tds distributions between the different hydrogeological units fig 3 table 3 for example the mean tds of measurements from the chalk 676 mg l and lower greensand 375 mg l are about two orders of magnitude less than the mean tds of samples from the zechstein 75 515 mg l and the borrowdale volcanic group 40 156 mg l this reflects systematic differences in the depth of occurrence and sampling of the units loveless et al 2018 fig 3a differences in the hydrogeological setting where the units are found as well as differences in the characteristic hydrogeochemistry of the units although all units have observations of brackish groundwater below the uktag groundwater deepest advisable limit at 400 m there are no records of fresh groundwater below this depth in the zechstein coal measures and borrowdale volcanic units fig 3 table 4 in continental sedimentary basins deep groundwater circulation is controlled by the elevation of the major outflow points from the basins relative to the location and elevation of the recharge areas toth 1963 however for sedimentary basins in non continental island landmasses such as the uk groundwater discharge to the coast is an important control on deep groundwater circulation downing et al 1987 have previously described this phenomenon for the uk consequently plotting the tds data relative to sea level is important because it enables assessments to be made of the extent to which current sea level acts as a major base level control on current regional groundwater circulation in the uk however this means that in the following description of the tds data it is necessary to modify the definition of deep groundwater previously deep groundwater was defined as groundwater occupying an interval below the current normal depth of active groundwater exploitation for example below the 95 tile of well depths for a given aquifer across a given region however for the purposes of considering tds data in the context of regional hydrogeological flow to the coast deep groundwater is defined as groundwater below the 95 tile of all sample depths relative to sea level the reference level for the model the tds data for gb has been plotted as a function of sea level fig 4 the distribution of deep relative to sea level fresh brackish and saline tds has been mapped to investigate spatial coherence in the data fig 5 it has been projected into sections through the 3d hydrostratigraphical model of the study area fig 6 and is described in the context of regionally important structural features shown in figs 5 and 6 and described in table 5 fig 4 shows the depth distribution of tds data relative to sea level with the boundaries between fresh and brackish groundwater indicated by vertical dotted and dashed lines respectively as expected most fresh groundwater is found above sea level solid horizontal line in fig 4 however there are many deep fresh groundwater observations below the 95 tile of all depths relative to sea level i e 157 6 m below sea level as indicated by the long dashed horizontal line although some brackish groundwater is present above sea level in contrast to the fresh groundwater observations most brackish groundwater observations are between sea level and the 95 tile of depth relative to sea level with the exception of two samples all saline groundwater and brines are found below sea level and the overwhelming majority of these are found below the 95 tile of depth relative to sea level this distribution of groundwater quality with depth is consistent with the observation that in the study area the majority of fresh groundwater is associated with contemporary groundwater recharge and circulation associated with current base levels downing et al 1987 edmunds and smedley 2000 smedley et al 2018 and controlled by groundwater flow and discharge to rivers toth 1963 or to the sea edmunds et al 2001a 2001b to investigate the regional distribution of tds below the 95 tile of all sample depths relative to sea level but unrelated to specific aquifers observations of fresh blue brackish green and saline to brine red groundwater highlighted in fig 4 have been mapped spatially in fig 5 where deep fresh groundwater is present it is generally spatially coherent and is characteristically associated with relatively deep sedimentary basins fig 5 and table 5 for example there are clusters of observations of fresh groundwater present at depth in the chalk and lower greensand aquifer of the wessex basin in southern england in the permo triassic sandstones of the worcester and cheshire basins in central and nw england and in the permo triassic sandstones of the gainsborough trough basin scale hydrogeological controls on the distribution of deep brackish groundwater are less evident and there does not appear to be a systematic spatial coincidence between fresh and brackish water at depth for example there is no apparent systematic coincidence between fresh and brackish groundwater in the chalk of the wessex basin or the sherwood sandstone group of the worcester basin although there does appear to be both fresh and brackish groundwater at depth in the sherwood sandstone group of the cheshire basin and the gainsborough trough similarly observations of deep saline groundwater and brines appear to be most spatially coherent within the cleveland basin the gainsborough trough and at the western end of the wessex basin previous work indicates that groundwater in gb is primarily meteoric downing 1987 noted that throughout gb formation waters have probably been replaced by fresh groundwater recharge several times and that current day changes in groundwater down hydraulic gradient in most of the aquifer systems are a response to the evolution of water along flow lines downing et al 1987 noted only one example of a residual connate sensu stricto water had been found to date in the chalk of e anglia edmunds 1986 younger et al 2015 in summary fresh groundwater is present below the 95 tile depth relative to sea level in all the basins with the exception of the cleveland basin brackish groundwater is present in the cheshire basin and the gainsborough trough and saline groundwater and brines are present within the cleveland basin cheshire basin the gainsborough trough and the wessex basin consequently it is inferred that differences in the details of the regional hydrogeological setting and evolution of meteoric water in the respective basins are important controls on the spatial distribution of tds with depth this inference is supported by consideration of 2d sections through the 3d hydrogeological model fig 6 illustrates two sections one running ssw from the coast of eastern england across the gainsborough trough and then turning wnw through the northern end of the cheshire basin to the coast in nw england fig 6a the second section that runs sw from the north eastern end of the wessex basin across the western end of the weald anticline through the centre of the wessex basin and out to the south coast of england fig 6b the sections show large scale basin structures associated with the hydrostratigraphy as well as the locations of tds samples colour coded according to tds and the depth of the 95 tile of observations relative to sea level in the northern section fresh and brackish groundwater is present below the 95 tile of observations relative to sea level in the cheshire basin to the west and in the gainsborough trough to the east of the derbyshire dome a regional topographic high fig 6a the relatively fresh groundwater in the gainsborough trough in both the sherwood sandstone group and other units appears to be associated with previously documented relatively deep groundwater circulation gainsborough trough and inferred to be driven by elevated hydraulic heads across the neighbouring topographic high downing et al 1987 within the fault bounded cheshire basin a continuous sequence of sandstones to depths of in excess of 1 km have enabled groundwater circulation to develop again inferred to be driven by heads in the topographic highs at the margins of the basin plant et al 1999 in contrast at the nne end of the same section fig 6a fresh groundwater is effectively absent at depth here the chalk dark green unit in fig 6a aquifer is present and is relatively thin compared with the sherwood sandstone group aquifer at the wnw end of the section this combined with an absence of significant relief and consequently low regional head gradients gale and rutter 2006 is inferred to contribute to an absence of fresh groundwater below the 95 tile of observations relative to sea level in the cleveland basin in the southern section the chalk and lower greensand aquifer is at its thickest and deepest throughout the central part of the section across the wessex basin loveless et al 2018 fig 6b here fresh and brackish groundwater is present at or below the 95 tile of observations relative to sea level and is inferred to be driven by elevated heads at local topographic highs at the margins of the basin allen and crane 2017 whereas at the far southern end of the section fig 6b fresh groundwater is generally absent at depth where the chalk is thinner and the potential for groundwater circulation has been limited by the presence of older less permeable units such as the oxford clay and lias dark grey and pale blue respectively in fig 6b near the surface allen and crane 2017 6 discussion 6 1 some implications for uk groundwater resources and protection as noted above given the presence of albeit limited fresh groundwater in gb s two major aquifers below the current advisory base of groundwater bodies in the uk uktag 2012 fig 2b the base of groundwater bodies in the uk might be more appropriately taken to be at 500 m an implication of this is that under current legislation groundwater down to this depth would need to be both protected and restored to good status under the implementation guidance associated with the european water framework directive european commission 2000 and the daughter groundwater directive european commission 2006 the environmental objectives of preventing deterioration of and protecting enhancing and restoring good groundwater status would apply to all bodies of groundwater down to this depth interval an additional implication of a deepened advisory base of groundwater bodies is that it would reduce the separation between the base of potential future groundwater bodies and the depth of interest for future development of unconventional hydrocarbons ferguson et al 2018a used their analysis of tds to not only analyse the relationship between water well depths and salinity transitions in the usa but also to quantify the separation between the interval of fresh groundwater resources and the depth of onshore hydrocarbon development and other potentially polluting sub surface activities although the latter is not a focus of the present study the results here can be related to the concept of 3d groundwater vulnerability loveless et al 2019 and the concept of safe separation between fresh groundwater requiring protection and onshore hydrocarbon development below aquifers including potential shale gas development in the uk loveless et al 2018 currently high pressure high volume fracking for shale gas is banned above 1 km depth 1 2 km under designated protected land such as national parks in england this is equivalent to a minimum 600 m separation with the current default base of groundwater bodies a separation of about 800 m between the 95 tile depth of water wells in the wellmaster database and a separation of just over 900 m with mean water well depths there is still a lack of consensus as to what constitutes a safe separation between groundwater requiring protection and an interval of shale gas development below a body of groundwater loveless et al 2018 in a study of the separation of the base of aquifers and the top of underlying shale units in england and wales loveless et al 2018 assessed the implications of safe separation intervals for different aquifer shale pairs in the uk they analysed safe separation distances of 600 m and 1000 m representative of the maximum height of induced hydraulic fractures and of natural hydraulic fractures davies et al 2012 in the context of the current study assuming the same safe separation intervals as loveless et al 2018 a slightly deepened depth to base of groundwater bodies of 500 m would mean that there would be no unambiguously safe separation for shale gas development at depths down to 1 1 km based on the maximum height of induced hydraulic fractures similarly there would be no safe separation for shale gas development at depths down to 1 5 km based on the maximum height of natural hydraulic fractures davies et al 2012 loveless et al 2018 6 2 comparison with previous studies the depth distribution of tds data across the study area is broadly consistent with that described in previous data led analyses of tds data from the usa kang and jackson 2016 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 in all cases there is a general increase in mineralisation of groundwater with depth associated with a general increase in the minimum value of tds for a given depth interval and variability in tds is greatest at relatively shallow levels and decreases with depth there is a common upper bound to tds for the different study areas irrespective of depth at about 330 000 mg l these very high values of tds well above that of seawater are consistent with groundwater that is supersaturated with respect to halite hanor 1994a 1994b ferguson et al 2018b it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the depth of transitions between fresh and brackish groundwater in the present study and the findings of the previous studies from the usa kang and jackson 2016 stanton et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 as the studies differ slightly in their respective definitions of groundwater quality however the inferred average transition from fresh to brackish groundwater is broadly consistent with those of the previous studies in particular the average depth of the transition at about 500 m for the present study fig 2b is very similar to the equivalent average transition depth of 550 m across large parts of the usa found by ferguson et al 2018a this is significant in that it provides new additional confirmation of the observation of ferguson et al 2018a that their transition depth was relatively shallow compared with previous global estimates of the average transition depth gleeson et al 2016 ferguson et al 2018a asserted that if their observations could be extrapolated globally it would suggested that there may be considerably less fresh groundwater available than estimated by gleeson et al 2016 the findings of this case study appear to support that assertion 6 3 role of data led studies in understanding deep regional groundwater quality our observation that deep fresh groundwater is present in relatively deep sedimentary basins is consistent with the concept of groundwater as a geologic agent toth 1999 specifically that local to national scale variations in tds result from the long term interaction between local to national scale chemical processes and groundwater flow processes driven by head differences associated with topographic relief in a global study of the relationship between the age and depth of groundwater jasechko et al 2017 have shown that fossil waters water recharged at least 12 000 years ago prior to the holocene comprise a significant proportion of groundwater stored in the top 1 km of the crust and the majority of groundwater abstracted from wells deeper than 250 m however based on measurements of tritium they also noted that much younger post 1953 recharge waters were also present in half of the wells that were dominated by fossil groundwater although there is no comparable systematic set of data on groundwater ages for deep samples from the gb study area deep groundwater flow is known to have been influenced by quaternary history evolving relationships between basins and coastlines and by geological structure for example bath et al 2006 explained the relatively uniform salinity depth profile down to about 1700 m in the low permeability basement of nw england as due to repeated cycles of quaternary recharge black and barker 2016 subsequently supported this interpretation when they estimated lower recharge temperatures and described relict high hydraulic heads to a depth of 1100 m across the same region the long coastline of the study area is a major influence on groundwater systems black and brightman 1996 with groundwater being significantly impacted by changing sea levels sea levels have probably been lower than present for the last 100 000 years reaching their minimum of about 125 m below current levels during the last glacial maximum although the lowest groundwater base levels during this period controlled by palaeo topography have been estimated to be about 65 below current sea level edmunds et al 2001b these lowered sea levels caused freshwater recharge of saline aquifers at the coastline black and barker 2016 edmunds et al 2001a 2001b with groundwater in higher permeability units coming into equilibrium with the changing boundary conditions more quickly than in lower permeability units black and brightman 1996 clearly data led analyses of tds such as presented here do not provide information about groundwater ages or direct insights into the origins of freshwater at depth however when combined with conceptual or numerical models of regional scale hydrogeology they can provide useful information for water resource management agencies and policymakes to make more informed decisions related to groundwater resource development plans and the protection of deep groundwater resources the approaches to tds data exploration and analysis described here analysis of tds with respect to depth of current groundwater exploitation and with respect to sea level in the context of regional hydrogeological models are applicable regardless of hydrogeological setting and could be applied equally effectively wherever there are depth changes in groundwater tds including for example coastal delta systems for large continental sedimentary basins data led analysis of depth variations in tds in the context of a consistent hydrostratigraphy of a given basin may improve the interpretation of the tds data in such settings analysis of tds relative to a basin specific base level such as the level of the lowest flow gauge in the basin would be more appropriate than using sea level as a reference more generally analysis of tds as a function of regional groundwater base levels in addition to depth below ground level may provide additional insights in to the possible controls on tds in addition studies from other regions and hydrogeological environments are encouraged in order to add new evidence for establishing representative depths for the transition from fresh to brackish groundwater and hence contribute to a more refined global estimate of the availability of fresh groundwater 7 conclusions in the study area tds varies over about five orders of magnitude with a general increase in mineralisation with depth the interval of active groundwater exploitation in gb is typically down to about 200 m and most groundwater in this interval is fresh or brackish however there is evidence for fresh and brackish groundwater water below this interval almost 5 of all the tds samples indicate fresh groundwater below about 200 m with about another 1 being brackish groundwater it is inferred from these observations that current groundwater exploitation in gb is not necessarily limited just by tds at depth but may also be limited by other factors such as relatively low groundwater yields other water quality considerations e g potability limits for specific determinands and the relative cost of development and pumping from deep groundwater sources based on averaged tds values for 100 m depth intervals there is a transition from fresh to brackish groundwater at 500 m and from brackish to saline groundwater at 700 m below 700 m groundwater becomes progressively saline with depth so that below 1 km mean tds exceeds that of seawater 35 000 mg l this depth distribution of tds data across the gb study area is consistent with previous data led analyses from the usa the average depth of transition from fresh to brackish groundwater is consistent with that found by ferguson et al 2018a for the usa and supports their assertion that globally there may be considerably less fresh groundwater available than previously estimated by gleeson et al 2016 based on assumptions of groundwater age in the uk a maximum effective base to groundwater bodies has been defined in the absence of any other information at 400 m uktag 2012 however there are a small number of tds observations of fresh and brackish groundwater below 400 m given these observations it is inferred that if a precautionary approach is taken then this threshold might be more appropriately set at 500 m there are differences in the tds distributions between the hydrogeological units in gb for example the mean tds of measurements from the chalk 676 mg l and lower greensand 375 mg l are about two orders of magnitude less than the mean tds of samples from the zechstein 75 515 mg l and the borrowdale volcanic group 41 544 mg l this reflects systematic differences in the depth of occurrence and samples in the units differences in the hydrogeological settings where the units are found and differences in the characteristic hydrogeochemistry of the units when the tds data for gb is analysed relative to sea level and the deep tds observations are mapped fresh and brackish groundwater exhibits some spatial coherence as a function of regional geological and hydrogeological setting spatially coherent fresh and brackish groundwater at depth tends to be associated with relatively deep sedimentary basins overlying older less permeable basement it is inferred from this observation that differences in the regional hydrogeological setting and hydrogeological evolution of the respective basins are important controls on the distribution of fresh and groundwater at depth credit authorship contribution statement j p bloomfield conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft writing review

8382,study region the study region is great britain gb a small non continental island landmass in north west europe study focus data for total dissolved solids tds from groundwater samples can be used to characterise regional scale variations in the quality of deep groundwater systems combined with information about typical well depths tds data can be used to identify the presence of currently undeveloped fresh or brackish groundwater at depth that may require protection this study considers the distribution of tds with depth relative to sea level in the main gb aquifers and selected other key hydrogeological units and demonstrates how useful insights can be obtained from data led analyses of depth variations in groundwater chemistry if the regional context of hydrogeological systems is taken into account new hydrogeological insights in gb tds varies over about five orders of magnitude up to about 330 000 mg l with a general increase in mineralisation with depth overall there is a transition from fresh 1625 mg l to brackish 10 000 mg l groundwater at about 500 m below surface and from brackish to saline 10 000 mg l groundwater at about 700 m given that the 95 tile depth of water wells is about 200 m it is evident that there is currently undeveloped fresh groundwater at depth across large parts of the study area that may require protection although it is inferred that tds is not the only factor limiting exploitation and use of these deeper resources as in this study previous data led analyses of fresh groundwater at depth have typically analysed tds as depth below surface however if tds data is analysed relative to sea level and in the context of regional hydrogeological information or models additional insights can be gained on the distribution and controls on fresh groundwater at depth projecting tds data into a 3d hydrogeological model of the study area shows that fresh groundwater at depth exhibits spatial coherence and is generally associated with relatively deep sedimentary basins overlying older less permeable basement keywords groundwater total dissolved solids tds gb 1 introduction globally groundwater provides of the order of one third of all freshwater supplies doll et al 2012 2014 two and a half billion people are estimated to depend solely on groundwater for basic daily water needs un 2015 and it sustains the health of many important groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems gleeson et al 2012 koirala et al 2017 fan et al 2013 have estimated that about one third of the global land surface area has a water table depth or capillary fringe within 3 m of the ground surface and much of the groundwater that is abstracted is from relatively shallow unconfined groundwater systems of only a few 10 s of metres in depth however due to pressure on groundwater resources wada et al 2010 macdonald et al 2016 as well as the growing use of the subsurface for other activities there is an increasing focus on deep groundwater systems for potable water as well as for agricultural irrigation and industrial purposes for example across large parts of africa the need for water security in relation to growing populations and the need to develop resilience to the effects of climate change has led to continental scale assessments of deep groundwater systems macdonald et al 2012 throughout many of the major deltas of the world there is a trend towards ever deeper exploitation of groundwater systems for irrigation and to address natural water quality issues lapworth et al 2018 in the usa the drive to find groundwater to augment supplies for irrigation and potable use has resulted in an interest in deep groundwater including brackish groundwater kang and jackson 2016 stanton et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 perrone and jasschko 2019 there are many challenges associated with the development and management of deep groundwater systems there is the need to consider governance of and access to deep groundwater hoogesteger and wester 2015 to assess costs of appropriate technologies and implementation of water resource management systems harou and lund 2008 and to avoid overexploitation of deep aquifers wada et al 2010 scanlon et al 2012 in addition in regions where other activities are undertaken in the deep subsurface there is also a need to understand the distribution of deep groundwater systems to provide protection of currently unexploited groundwater resources for future use for example there is a requirement to understand the vulnerability of deep groundwater systems to activities such as conventional and unconventional onshore hydrocarbon development jackson et al 2013 cai and ofterdinger 2014 vengosh et al 2014 loveless et al 2018 2019 mcintosh and ferguson 2019 underground nuclear waste storage stanfors et al 1999 and co2 sequestration newmark et al 2010 notwithstanding these challenges practical constraints on the development and use of deep groundwater are primarily related to an ability to obtain adequate yields of suitable quality water from depth the aim of the current study is to characterise and better understand regional scale variations in the quality of deep groundwater systems based on a large set of observational data for total dissolved solids tds note the concept of deep groundwater and deep groundwater systems are here used in a relative not absolute sense and refer to an interval below the current normal depth of active groundwater exploitation as investigated and described by this study the concept can also refer to a depth interval relative to a datum such sea level across a given region also investigated and described by this study a few recent data led regional to continental scale studies have identified low salinity fresh or brackish groundwater at depth in the usa using measurements of tds and have attempted to estimate volumes of currently undeveloped fresh or brackish groundwater and their susceptibility to pollution from unconventional hydrocarbon development and other potentially polluting sub surface activates analysing the tds of groundwater samples in california usa kang and jackson 2016 estimated that useable groundwater volumes could be increased by up to fourfold if groundwater 3000 ppm tds was exploited down to a depth of 3 km but also noted that some of these deep groundwater resources would be vulnerable to conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon extraction similarly kang et al 2019 analysed tds from 17 basins across the southwestern united states and found that in seven of the basins there was useable water defined as 10 000 ppm tds in the deep groundwater defined in their study as depths 150 m stanton et al 2017 undertook an analysis of brackish groundwater in the usa defined as a tds of 1 000 10 000 mg l and estimated that almost a third of the subsurface down to a depth of about 900 m contained brackish groundwater ferguson et al 2018a used tds data to investigate the depth at which groundwater transitioned from fresh to brackish to saline groundwater defined as fresh 3000 and brackish 10 000 mg l respectively and compared these depth intervals with the depth of hydrocarbon exploitation activities in 28 sedimentary basins across the usa they noted that in basins where relatively deep fresh and brackish water is present groundwater is potentially vulnerable due to the proximity to hydrocarbon development and to waste injection wells this study builds on the earlier work to identify the depth of the fresh to brackish groundwater transition for great britain gb relates this transition to current groundwater resource management and protection depth thresholds and considers the implications with respect to vulnerability to potential unconventional hydrocarbon development in gb it assesses if the transition depth in gb is consistent with those identified in previous studies kang and jackson 2016 stanton et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 in addition it provides additional evidence to test the assertion of ferguson et al 2018a that globally there may be less fresh groundwater than estimated previously by gleeson et al 2016 who assumed that only 6 of water in the upper 2 km was young less than 50 years old finally the earlier data led studies of tds either implicitly or in the case of ferguson et al 2018a explicitly did not address depth variations in tds within individual hydrogeological units and they did not consider the effects of hydrogeochemical evolution associated with regional groundwater flow or the effects of basin structure on observed tds depth distributions this study considers the distribution of tds with depth relative to sea level in the main gb aquifers and selected other key hydrogeological units and demonstrates how useful insights can be obtained from data led rather than process driven e g hanor 1994a 1994b smedley et al 2018 analyses of depth variations in groundwater chemistry if the regional context of hydrogeological systems is taken into account following an overview of regulatory limits and definitions of tds related to groundwater the hydrogeology of the study area england wales and scotland great britain and tds dataset is briefly introduced and described then the depth below surface distribution of tds is characterised and compared with depths of water wells and with water quality thresholds for fresh and brackish groundwater for the study area and as a function of eight distinct hydrogeological units the distribution of tds data is then described spatially and in 3d relative to sea level in order to investigate the spatial coherence of water quality data at depth as a function of the regional geological and hydrogeological setting finally the results are discussed in relation to previous data led analyses of large tds datasets and the implications for future systematic analysis of water quality observations from deep groundwater systems are considered 2 tds limits of fresh and brackish groundwater total dissolved solids tds a measure of inorganic salts and organic substances in solution in a liquid world health organisation 2011 is a widely reported parameter related to groundwater quality because it provides an indication of the overall degree of mineralisation and hence potability of groundwater it is usually expressed as mg l or g l weight by volume but sometimes as ppm or weight per weight tds is either determined from the weight of dry residue remaining after evaporation of the volatile portion of a sample or can be calculated from the sum of the major ions although often the method used to estimate tds is unreported or not described note that many studies tend to quote electrical conductance ec or specific electrical conductance sec defined at 25 c in preference to tds to describe the degree of mineralisation of groundwater e g kim et al 2008 salinity and overall degree of mineralisation typically expressed as tds tend to increase along groundwater flow paths and with depth freeze and cherry 1979 and the flow and hydrogeochemical processes effecting the evolution of groundwater mineralisation and quality in sedimentary basins and fractured basement terrains are well understood kreitler 1989 palmer and cherry 1984 hanor 1994a 1994b ferguson et al 2018b variations in groundwater quality including tds arise from a dynamic interplay between depositional and basin evolution processes and the development of basin scale to local scale groundwater flow systems toth 1963 1999 however it is only recently that the distribution of tds data with depth has been the subject of systematic data led analysis with the specific aim of understanding the location of groundwater quality limits or thresholds with depth kang and jackson 2016 stanton et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 no limits are set for tds on health grounds globally however there are a variety of regulatory limits and advisory recommendations for potable groundwater supply based on tds in addition tds can be used as a guide to protection of groundwater resources for example there is a desirable limit for tds of potable groundwater in india of 500 mg l with up to 2000 mg l permissible in absence of an alternate source bureau of indian standards 2012 in california the california state water resources control board 2016 recommended limit for tds in public groundwater supply is also 500 mg l with a short term limit of 1500 mg l even where no limit is recommended or set salinities above a certain value are described as unpalatable for example the world health organisation stating that water with a tds of less than 600 mg l is good quality and that over 1000 mg l it becomes increasingly unpalatable world health organisation 2011 in australia the national health and medical research council nhmrc 2011 has set aesthetic guidelines with a groundwater tds content of less than 600 mg l regarded as good quality drinking water 600 900 mg l fair quality 900 to 1200 mg l as poor quality and over 1200 mg l unacceptable the epa epa 2019 states an unenforceable guideline maximum value national secondary drinking water regulations of 500 mg l for potable groundwater in the usa and also defines underground sources of drinking water that should be protected as sources with a tds of 10 000 mg l similarly there is little consistency in how brackish and saline groundwater is defined for example even though the national groundwater association ngwa defines groundwater with a tds of less than 1000 mg l as fresh 1 000 3 000 mg l as slightly saline and 3000 to 10 000 mg l as moderately saline ngwa 2017 in an assessment of brackish water in the contemporaneous usa stanton et al 2017 defined brackish groundwater as having a tds range of 1 000 10 000 mg l digiulio et al 2018 identified widely differing criteria between 17 states in the usa related to the protection of brackish groundwater in the context of unconventional oil and gas development with regard to regulatory limits for potable groundwater supply in the united kingdom uk the council of the european union directed that the maximum electrical conductance ec or conductivity at 20 c for potable groundwater should be 2500 μs cm european commission 2000 2006 this limit has been embodied in the water supply regulations for the uk that specify the maximum admissible concentrations and values for parameters in drinking water for both public supply and private water supplies for human consumption the uk technical advisory group uktag on the water framework directive define water in groundwater bodies as groundwater that is part of an aquifer and is a long term resource that can be exploited for human activities and by implication is of good potable quality uktag 2012 uktag note that there is a lower depth at which groundwater loses value as a potable resource and for consolidated aquifers the uktag guideline for maximum groundwater body thickness is 400 m in the absence of any other information table 2 in uktag 2012 by inference this means that the effective maximum depth of potable groundwater is taken to be 400 m in the absence of any other information notwithstanding this environmental regulators in the uk operate a precautionary principal and seek to protect all groundwater regardless of whether it is designated as a groundwater body or not unless groundwater can be denoted as permanently unsuitable for use as a resource for the purposes of the present study fresh groundwater is defined as having a tds of 1625 mg l approximately equivalent to 2500 μs cm consistent with groundwater legislation in uk and the european community in addition like previous studies van weert 2012 ferguson et al 2018a the common convention of freeze and cherry 1979 is followed where the maximum tds for brackish water is defined as 10 000 mg l tds of saline water is taken to be in the range 10 000 100 000 mg l with sea water at about 35 000 mg l and brine is defined by a tds in excess of 100 000 mg l freeze and cherry 1979 3 study area the gb study area fig 1 consists of a small non continental island landmass it is characterised by relatively short but slow groundwater flow paths resulting in saline water occurring in aquifers at relatively small distances down gradient of outcrop and an absence of extensive confined aquifers containing fresh water downing et al 1987 deep regional groundwater flow is predominantly through sedimentary basins located above a low permeability basement where flow is currently controlled by upland divides and lowland coastal or submarine groundwater sinks downing et al 1987 observed that most groundwaters in gb have increasing mineralisation with depth and that their composition lies along the isotope composition δ180 δ2h ratio meteoric water line they interpreted these observations in terms of a geochemical evolution of groundwater along basinal scale flow lines note that groundwater conditions in gb have evolved over a long period of geological time since at least the beginning of the cenozoic some 65 million years before present when the landmass emerged from a lengthy phase of marine submergence during the late cretaceous bath et al 2006 however current basin scale groundwater flow systems reflect the present marine boundary of the british isles a relatively recent product of the holocene transgression following the last glacial maximum at around 15 000 years before the present day when large parts of the uk continental shelf were subaerially exposed downing et al 1987 of the tds observations described below the majority come from eight named regionally significant geological hydrostratigraphic units across the study area the majority are from the two principal aquifers in gb the cretaceous chalk ck and the permo triassic sandstones of the sherwood sandstone group ssg allen et al 1997 fig 1 in addition there are observations of tds from the cretaceous lower greensand lgs permian zechstein z deposits carboniferous age coal measures cm millstone grit mg and carboniferous limestone cl and the ordovician borrowdale volcanic group bvg fig 1 is a map of the units and their location in a hydrostratigraphic sequence this hydrostratigraphic sequence is also used in the 3d hydrogeological model described in the methods section below 4 data and methods 4 1 data two types of data are used in the study water well depths table 1 and tds values table 2 water well depths have been obtained from the wellmaster database as described below and tds data has been obtained from three sources namely the wellmaster database the uk geothermal catalogue and from a nirex study also described here water well depths are from the british geological survey bgs wellmaster hydrogeological database part of the national well record archive for england wales and scotland bgs 2018 the wellmaster database holds information on the hydro lithostratigraphy that wells and boreholes intersect construction details of wells and boreholes such as casing and screen diameters and depths water quality information and information on pumping tests performed on the boreholes summary statistics for depths of all wells and boreholes in wellmaster are given in table 1 when the database was accessed in february 2019 the database contained records of the location and depth of 8640 water wells and boreholes for which tds data was available table 1 spatial coverage of the wells is focussed on the major aquifers across the region with data for the two most important aquifers the cretaceous chalk and the permo triassic sherwood sandstone group accounting for over half the observations in the database i e 3631 and 1430 observations respectively table 1 the depths in table 1 are taken broadly to be indicative of representative intervals of groundwater exploitation across the study area and of differences between the main hydrogeological units described in this study three sources of tds data have been used for this study tds data has been obtained i from the uk geothermal catalogue burley et al 1984 rollin 1987 ii from an investigation by nirex at sellafield northwest england in the context of developing a deep sub surface nuclear waste repository facility bath et al 1996 and iii from bgs wellmaster database bgs 2018 table 2 summaries the number of tds observations from each of these three sources the first two sources generally consist of relatively deep observations of tds whereas the wellmaster database generally consists of relatively shallow observations of tds associated with water wells however the wellmaster database contains significantly more tds data than the other two sources of tds data combined the uk geothermal catalogue burley et al 1984 rollin 1987 is a summary of temperature heat flow and geochemical data for the uk associated with an extensive characterisation and assessment of geothermal potential in the uk undertaken in the 1980s it comprises information on well and sample depth geological formation and chemical analyses tds samples reported in the catalogue were obtained from a range of earlier studies and sources including springs and thermal springs artesian discharges borehole or well samples depth samples pumped samples and drill stem test samples the catalogue also includes data from samples obtained from underground mine drainage primarily from the carboniferous coal measures however all samples flagged as underground mine drainage have been excluded from the analysis as it could not be ascertained if those data points represented in situ observations of tds the nirex study was a major regional investigation of the potential suitability for deep storage of radioactive waste and tds observations were made on samples obtained as part of environmental pressure tests discrete extraction tests and single packer flow tests on a series of deep boreholes in the sellafield area sutton 1996 the wellmaster database contains groundwater quality data primarily from relatively shallow boreholes in areas of active groundwater exploitation bgs 2018 8640 sites or 7 2 of the 119 475 springs wells and boreholes recorded in wellmaster database with known completion depths and named formations have tds data however the manner in which the water sample was obtained is typically unknown quality control qc on groundwater tds data can be undertaken where information on major ion concentrations is available along with tds qc was applied to the tds data from the geothermal catalogue the mean difference between the sum of six major ions mg l and tds mg l for this datasets is 1 0 of the recorded tds at the time of analysis nirex major ions were checked to ensure that they were within 15 of measured tds and the ionic charge balance was reported to typically be within 5 richards and bath 1997 the wellmaster database does not hold systematic information related to major ions and no qc was applied to this data source there are 9195 tds observations across the three data sources with 39 6 of those coming from the chalk and 16 7 from the permo triassic sandstones with the majority of these coming from the wellmaster database table 2 the wellmaster database provides 94 of the tds observations however because those observations are from relatively shallow depths compared with those in the other two datasets the mean sample depth in the wellmaster samples is 81 m compared with 878 m from the geothermal catalogue and 751 m for the nirex observations there is a systematic bias in the combined dataset towards tds data from shallow settings 4 2 methods a basic description of the tds data has been undertaken and tds values have been plotted as a function of depth below ground level to enable the depth distribution of tds values to be visualised in the context of characteristic depths of water well and water quality thresholds the approach of ferguson et al 2018a has been followed where tds data was binned into 100 m depth intervals and plotted it as box plots to characterise changes in tds with depth despite the bias towards more shallow observations in order to understand the spatial and 3d distribution of tds the tds data has also been analysed relative to sea level in the uk sea level is defined by a datum the ordnance datum od bradshaw et al 2015 taken to be the long term average of sea levels recorded at the newlyn tide gauge to assess the nature of any spatial correlation in fresh and brackish groundwater at depth tds observations below the 95 tile depth relative to sea level have been mapped and the location of fresh brackish and saline groundwater samples highlighted in addition the tds data has also been visualised as 2d sections through a 3d hydrogeological model of the study area newell 2019 to qualitatively investigate the influence of geological hydrogeological setting on the presence of fresh and brackish groundwater at depth the hydrogeological model is based on a simplified hydrostratigraphic sequence for the study area and the relationship between this and the eight named hydrogeological units for which there is tds data is shown in fig 1 tds data is projected into two representative sections through the 3d hydrogeological model of the study area to enhance the visualisation of tds data in the 2d sections a lateral clipping domain of 50 km on each side of the cross sections has been applied tds values lying within this clipping plane were projected onto the hydrogeological cross sections while this projection process increases the density of data shown on the cross sections the hydrostratigraphic context of the tds points might undergo some migration depending on the direction of projection relative to the structural dip 5 results tds varies over about five orders of magnitude table 3 fig 2 a at depths down to 100 m tds varies over about three orders of magnitude from about 10 to 10 000 mg l while at a depth of 1 km it varies from about 1000 to 100 000 mg l fig 2a there is a general increase in mineralisation of groundwater with depth defined by a general increase in the minimum value of tds for a given depth interval the maximum observed tds at just over 330 000 mg l is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of seawater and is for a sample from the zechstein unit from about 1 8 km depth although samples with a similar order of magnitude tds are found from depths of a few hundred metres to over 2 km 5 1 depth distribution of tds related to interval of active groundwater exploitation the mean depth of all water wells with data is 81 m and the 95 tile is 202 m table 1 with systematic differences in the depth of water wells between the two main aquifers for example the mean depth of water wells in the chalk is 75 m compared with 120 m for the permo triassic sandstones and the equivalent 95 tiles are 153 m and 305 m the 95 tile of all water wells is indicated on figs 2a by the dark blue interval even though most tds observations of fresh groundwater are within the zone of active groundwater exploitation there are many tds observations where fresh or brackish groundwater water is present below 202 m fig 2a table 4 summarises the number and percentage of observations where tds data indicate fresh or brackish conditions below the current intervals of exploitation there are 917 tds observations 10 0 of all the tds observations below the 95 tile depth of water wells of these observations 454 4 9 of all the tds samples are of fresh groundwater with about another 1 1 being brackish groundwater it is inferred from these observations that current groundwater exploitation in gb is not necessarily limited just by tds changes with depth other limiting factorsmay include specific water quality issues kinniburgh et al 1994 relatively low groundwater yields abesser and lewis 2015 and the relative cost of development of deep groundwater sources johns and özdemiroğlu 2007 charalambous 2019 5 2 depth of fresh to brackish groundwater transition in their analysis of the depth of transition between fresh and brackish groundwater across the contiguous usa ferguson et al 2018a plotted tds against depth as box plots in successive 100 m depth intervals so that the tds data could be readily compared with depth intervals of interest while accounting for a systematic bias towards shallow samples fig 2b is such a plot for tds data for the current study area with the mean tds in each 100 m depth interval indicated by the central line in each box and whisker plot again as in figs 2a in fig 2b the 95 tile of all water wells is indicated by the dark blue interval and the uktag groundwater deepest advisable limit down to 400 m is indicated by the base of the pale blue interval for each 100 m depth interval down to 500 m the mean tds of the binned data is less than the maximum admissible concentration for potable groundwater supplies in england 1625 mg l i e the intervals down to 500 m represent predominantly fresh groundwater fig 2b from 500 m down to a depth of 700 m tds is consistent with predominantly brackish groundwater conditions below 700 m the tds data indicates groundwater is saline and that it becomes progressively more saline with depth so that below 1 km the mean tds of the binned data exceeds that of seawater 35 000 mg l most water wells and boreholes recorded in the wellmaster database are within the 400 m depth interval defined by uktag 2012 as the maximum base of groundwater bodies this indicates some consistency between current depths of groundwater exploitation and the current uktag definition of the effective base of groundwater bodies however there are a small number of observations where tds values indicate that there is fresh and brackish groundwater below 400 m fig 2 table 4 there are 55 observations 0 6 of all tds samples below 400 m depth that indicate fresh groundwater conditions and 78 tds observations 0 8 of all tds samples that indicate brackish groundwater conditions below 400 m given these albeit limited observations and the distribution of binned tds data in fig 2b it is inferred that if a precautionary approach is taken to the definition of the effective base to groundwater bodies in the uk then this threshold might be more appropriately set at 500 m rather than at the current 400 m uktag 2012 5 3 tds as a function of hydrostratigraphy and hydrogeological setting fig 3 shows the depth distribution of tds as a function of the eight named hydrostratigraphic units very high values of tds appear to occur broadly independent of depth and are found in all named units with the exception of the lower greensand that like the chalk hasn t been sampled at depths greater than a few hundred metres fig 3 however in all units except the borrowdale volcanic group high values of tds are unusual and the majority of the tds observations are below the tds of seawater table 3 there are differences in the tds distributions between the different hydrogeological units fig 3 table 3 for example the mean tds of measurements from the chalk 676 mg l and lower greensand 375 mg l are about two orders of magnitude less than the mean tds of samples from the zechstein 75 515 mg l and the borrowdale volcanic group 40 156 mg l this reflects systematic differences in the depth of occurrence and sampling of the units loveless et al 2018 fig 3a differences in the hydrogeological setting where the units are found as well as differences in the characteristic hydrogeochemistry of the units although all units have observations of brackish groundwater below the uktag groundwater deepest advisable limit at 400 m there are no records of fresh groundwater below this depth in the zechstein coal measures and borrowdale volcanic units fig 3 table 4 in continental sedimentary basins deep groundwater circulation is controlled by the elevation of the major outflow points from the basins relative to the location and elevation of the recharge areas toth 1963 however for sedimentary basins in non continental island landmasses such as the uk groundwater discharge to the coast is an important control on deep groundwater circulation downing et al 1987 have previously described this phenomenon for the uk consequently plotting the tds data relative to sea level is important because it enables assessments to be made of the extent to which current sea level acts as a major base level control on current regional groundwater circulation in the uk however this means that in the following description of the tds data it is necessary to modify the definition of deep groundwater previously deep groundwater was defined as groundwater occupying an interval below the current normal depth of active groundwater exploitation for example below the 95 tile of well depths for a given aquifer across a given region however for the purposes of considering tds data in the context of regional hydrogeological flow to the coast deep groundwater is defined as groundwater below the 95 tile of all sample depths relative to sea level the reference level for the model the tds data for gb has been plotted as a function of sea level fig 4 the distribution of deep relative to sea level fresh brackish and saline tds has been mapped to investigate spatial coherence in the data fig 5 it has been projected into sections through the 3d hydrostratigraphical model of the study area fig 6 and is described in the context of regionally important structural features shown in figs 5 and 6 and described in table 5 fig 4 shows the depth distribution of tds data relative to sea level with the boundaries between fresh and brackish groundwater indicated by vertical dotted and dashed lines respectively as expected most fresh groundwater is found above sea level solid horizontal line in fig 4 however there are many deep fresh groundwater observations below the 95 tile of all depths relative to sea level i e 157 6 m below sea level as indicated by the long dashed horizontal line although some brackish groundwater is present above sea level in contrast to the fresh groundwater observations most brackish groundwater observations are between sea level and the 95 tile of depth relative to sea level with the exception of two samples all saline groundwater and brines are found below sea level and the overwhelming majority of these are found below the 95 tile of depth relative to sea level this distribution of groundwater quality with depth is consistent with the observation that in the study area the majority of fresh groundwater is associated with contemporary groundwater recharge and circulation associated with current base levels downing et al 1987 edmunds and smedley 2000 smedley et al 2018 and controlled by groundwater flow and discharge to rivers toth 1963 or to the sea edmunds et al 2001a 2001b to investigate the regional distribution of tds below the 95 tile of all sample depths relative to sea level but unrelated to specific aquifers observations of fresh blue brackish green and saline to brine red groundwater highlighted in fig 4 have been mapped spatially in fig 5 where deep fresh groundwater is present it is generally spatially coherent and is characteristically associated with relatively deep sedimentary basins fig 5 and table 5 for example there are clusters of observations of fresh groundwater present at depth in the chalk and lower greensand aquifer of the wessex basin in southern england in the permo triassic sandstones of the worcester and cheshire basins in central and nw england and in the permo triassic sandstones of the gainsborough trough basin scale hydrogeological controls on the distribution of deep brackish groundwater are less evident and there does not appear to be a systematic spatial coincidence between fresh and brackish water at depth for example there is no apparent systematic coincidence between fresh and brackish groundwater in the chalk of the wessex basin or the sherwood sandstone group of the worcester basin although there does appear to be both fresh and brackish groundwater at depth in the sherwood sandstone group of the cheshire basin and the gainsborough trough similarly observations of deep saline groundwater and brines appear to be most spatially coherent within the cleveland basin the gainsborough trough and at the western end of the wessex basin previous work indicates that groundwater in gb is primarily meteoric downing 1987 noted that throughout gb formation waters have probably been replaced by fresh groundwater recharge several times and that current day changes in groundwater down hydraulic gradient in most of the aquifer systems are a response to the evolution of water along flow lines downing et al 1987 noted only one example of a residual connate sensu stricto water had been found to date in the chalk of e anglia edmunds 1986 younger et al 2015 in summary fresh groundwater is present below the 95 tile depth relative to sea level in all the basins with the exception of the cleveland basin brackish groundwater is present in the cheshire basin and the gainsborough trough and saline groundwater and brines are present within the cleveland basin cheshire basin the gainsborough trough and the wessex basin consequently it is inferred that differences in the details of the regional hydrogeological setting and evolution of meteoric water in the respective basins are important controls on the spatial distribution of tds with depth this inference is supported by consideration of 2d sections through the 3d hydrogeological model fig 6 illustrates two sections one running ssw from the coast of eastern england across the gainsborough trough and then turning wnw through the northern end of the cheshire basin to the coast in nw england fig 6a the second section that runs sw from the north eastern end of the wessex basin across the western end of the weald anticline through the centre of the wessex basin and out to the south coast of england fig 6b the sections show large scale basin structures associated with the hydrostratigraphy as well as the locations of tds samples colour coded according to tds and the depth of the 95 tile of observations relative to sea level in the northern section fresh and brackish groundwater is present below the 95 tile of observations relative to sea level in the cheshire basin to the west and in the gainsborough trough to the east of the derbyshire dome a regional topographic high fig 6a the relatively fresh groundwater in the gainsborough trough in both the sherwood sandstone group and other units appears to be associated with previously documented relatively deep groundwater circulation gainsborough trough and inferred to be driven by elevated hydraulic heads across the neighbouring topographic high downing et al 1987 within the fault bounded cheshire basin a continuous sequence of sandstones to depths of in excess of 1 km have enabled groundwater circulation to develop again inferred to be driven by heads in the topographic highs at the margins of the basin plant et al 1999 in contrast at the nne end of the same section fig 6a fresh groundwater is effectively absent at depth here the chalk dark green unit in fig 6a aquifer is present and is relatively thin compared with the sherwood sandstone group aquifer at the wnw end of the section this combined with an absence of significant relief and consequently low regional head gradients gale and rutter 2006 is inferred to contribute to an absence of fresh groundwater below the 95 tile of observations relative to sea level in the cleveland basin in the southern section the chalk and lower greensand aquifer is at its thickest and deepest throughout the central part of the section across the wessex basin loveless et al 2018 fig 6b here fresh and brackish groundwater is present at or below the 95 tile of observations relative to sea level and is inferred to be driven by elevated heads at local topographic highs at the margins of the basin allen and crane 2017 whereas at the far southern end of the section fig 6b fresh groundwater is generally absent at depth where the chalk is thinner and the potential for groundwater circulation has been limited by the presence of older less permeable units such as the oxford clay and lias dark grey and pale blue respectively in fig 6b near the surface allen and crane 2017 6 discussion 6 1 some implications for uk groundwater resources and protection as noted above given the presence of albeit limited fresh groundwater in gb s two major aquifers below the current advisory base of groundwater bodies in the uk uktag 2012 fig 2b the base of groundwater bodies in the uk might be more appropriately taken to be at 500 m an implication of this is that under current legislation groundwater down to this depth would need to be both protected and restored to good status under the implementation guidance associated with the european water framework directive european commission 2000 and the daughter groundwater directive european commission 2006 the environmental objectives of preventing deterioration of and protecting enhancing and restoring good groundwater status would apply to all bodies of groundwater down to this depth interval an additional implication of a deepened advisory base of groundwater bodies is that it would reduce the separation between the base of potential future groundwater bodies and the depth of interest for future development of unconventional hydrocarbons ferguson et al 2018a used their analysis of tds to not only analyse the relationship between water well depths and salinity transitions in the usa but also to quantify the separation between the interval of fresh groundwater resources and the depth of onshore hydrocarbon development and other potentially polluting sub surface activities although the latter is not a focus of the present study the results here can be related to the concept of 3d groundwater vulnerability loveless et al 2019 and the concept of safe separation between fresh groundwater requiring protection and onshore hydrocarbon development below aquifers including potential shale gas development in the uk loveless et al 2018 currently high pressure high volume fracking for shale gas is banned above 1 km depth 1 2 km under designated protected land such as national parks in england this is equivalent to a minimum 600 m separation with the current default base of groundwater bodies a separation of about 800 m between the 95 tile depth of water wells in the wellmaster database and a separation of just over 900 m with mean water well depths there is still a lack of consensus as to what constitutes a safe separation between groundwater requiring protection and an interval of shale gas development below a body of groundwater loveless et al 2018 in a study of the separation of the base of aquifers and the top of underlying shale units in england and wales loveless et al 2018 assessed the implications of safe separation intervals for different aquifer shale pairs in the uk they analysed safe separation distances of 600 m and 1000 m representative of the maximum height of induced hydraulic fractures and of natural hydraulic fractures davies et al 2012 in the context of the current study assuming the same safe separation intervals as loveless et al 2018 a slightly deepened depth to base of groundwater bodies of 500 m would mean that there would be no unambiguously safe separation for shale gas development at depths down to 1 1 km based on the maximum height of induced hydraulic fractures similarly there would be no safe separation for shale gas development at depths down to 1 5 km based on the maximum height of natural hydraulic fractures davies et al 2012 loveless et al 2018 6 2 comparison with previous studies the depth distribution of tds data across the study area is broadly consistent with that described in previous data led analyses of tds data from the usa kang and jackson 2016 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 in all cases there is a general increase in mineralisation of groundwater with depth associated with a general increase in the minimum value of tds for a given depth interval and variability in tds is greatest at relatively shallow levels and decreases with depth there is a common upper bound to tds for the different study areas irrespective of depth at about 330 000 mg l these very high values of tds well above that of seawater are consistent with groundwater that is supersaturated with respect to halite hanor 1994a 1994b ferguson et al 2018b it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the depth of transitions between fresh and brackish groundwater in the present study and the findings of the previous studies from the usa kang and jackson 2016 stanton et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018a kang et al 2019 as the studies differ slightly in their respective definitions of groundwater quality however the inferred average transition from fresh to brackish groundwater is broadly consistent with those of the previous studies in particular the average depth of the transition at about 500 m for the present study fig 2b is very similar to the equivalent average transition depth of 550 m across large parts of the usa found by ferguson et al 2018a this is significant in that it provides new additional confirmation of the observation of ferguson et al 2018a that their transition depth was relatively shallow compared with previous global estimates of the average transition depth gleeson et al 2016 ferguson et al 2018a asserted that if their observations could be extrapolated globally it would suggested that there may be considerably less fresh groundwater available than estimated by gleeson et al 2016 the findings of this case study appear to support that assertion 6 3 role of data led studies in understanding deep regional groundwater quality our observation that deep fresh groundwater is present in relatively deep sedimentary basins is consistent with the concept of groundwater as a geologic agent toth 1999 specifically that local to national scale variations in tds result from the long term interaction between local to national scale chemical processes and groundwater flow processes driven by head differences associated with topographic relief in a global study of the relationship between the age and depth of groundwater jasechko et al 2017 have shown that fossil waters water recharged at least 12 000 years ago prior to the holocene comprise a significant proportion of groundwater stored in the top 1 km of the crust and the majority of groundwater abstracted from wells deeper than 250 m however based on measurements of tritium they also noted that much younger post 1953 recharge waters were also present in half of the wells that were dominated by fossil groundwater although there is no comparable systematic set of data on groundwater ages for deep samples from the gb study area deep groundwater flow is known to have been influenced by quaternary history evolving relationships between basins and coastlines and by geological structure for example bath et al 2006 explained the relatively uniform salinity depth profile down to about 1700 m in the low permeability basement of nw england as due to repeated cycles of quaternary recharge black and barker 2016 subsequently supported this interpretation when they estimated lower recharge temperatures and described relict high hydraulic heads to a depth of 1100 m across the same region the long coastline of the study area is a major influence on groundwater systems black and brightman 1996 with groundwater being significantly impacted by changing sea levels sea levels have probably been lower than present for the last 100 000 years reaching their minimum of about 125 m below current levels during the last glacial maximum although the lowest groundwater base levels during this period controlled by palaeo topography have been estimated to be about 65 below current sea level edmunds et al 2001b these lowered sea levels caused freshwater recharge of saline aquifers at the coastline black and barker 2016 edmunds et al 2001a 2001b with groundwater in higher permeability units coming into equilibrium with the changing boundary conditions more quickly than in lower permeability units black and brightman 1996 clearly data led analyses of tds such as presented here do not provide information about groundwater ages or direct insights into the origins of freshwater at depth however when combined with conceptual or numerical models of regional scale hydrogeology they can provide useful information for water resource management agencies and policymakes to make more informed decisions related to groundwater resource development plans and the protection of deep groundwater resources the approaches to tds data exploration and analysis described here analysis of tds with respect to depth of current groundwater exploitation and with respect to sea level in the context of regional hydrogeological models are applicable regardless of hydrogeological setting and could be applied equally effectively wherever there are depth changes in groundwater tds including for example coastal delta systems for large continental sedimentary basins data led analysis of depth variations in tds in the context of a consistent hydrostratigraphy of a given basin may improve the interpretation of the tds data in such settings analysis of tds relative to a basin specific base level such as the level of the lowest flow gauge in the basin would be more appropriate than using sea level as a reference more generally analysis of tds as a function of regional groundwater base levels in addition to depth below ground level may provide additional insights in to the possible controls on tds in addition studies from other regions and hydrogeological environments are encouraged in order to add new evidence for establishing representative depths for the transition from fresh to brackish groundwater and hence contribute to a more refined global estimate of the availability of fresh groundwater 7 conclusions in the study area tds varies over about five orders of magnitude with a general increase in mineralisation with depth the interval of active groundwater exploitation in gb is typically down to about 200 m and most groundwater in this interval is fresh or brackish however there is evidence for fresh and brackish groundwater water below this interval almost 5 of all the tds samples indicate fresh groundwater below about 200 m with about another 1 being brackish groundwater it is inferred from these observations that current groundwater exploitation in gb is not necessarily limited just by tds at depth but may also be limited by other factors such as relatively low groundwater yields other water quality considerations e g potability limits for specific determinands and the relative cost of development and pumping from deep groundwater sources based on averaged tds values for 100 m depth intervals there is a transition from fresh to brackish groundwater at 500 m and from brackish to saline groundwater at 700 m below 700 m groundwater becomes progressively saline with depth so that below 1 km mean tds exceeds that of seawater 35 000 mg l this depth distribution of tds data across the gb study area is consistent with previous data led analyses from the usa the average depth of transition from fresh to brackish groundwater is consistent with that found by ferguson et al 2018a for the usa and supports their assertion that globally there may be considerably less fresh groundwater available than previously estimated by gleeson et al 2016 based on assumptions of groundwater age in the uk a maximum effective base to groundwater bodies has been defined in the absence of any other information at 400 m uktag 2012 however there are a small number of tds observations of fresh and brackish groundwater below 400 m given these observations it is inferred that if a precautionary approach is taken then this threshold might be more appropriately set at 500 m there are differences in the tds distributions between the hydrogeological units in gb for example the mean tds of measurements from the chalk 676 mg l and lower greensand 375 mg l are about two orders of magnitude less than the mean tds of samples from the zechstein 75 515 mg l and the borrowdale volcanic group 41 544 mg l this reflects systematic differences in the depth of occurrence and samples in the units differences in the hydrogeological settings where the units are found and differences in the characteristic hydrogeochemistry of the units when the tds data for gb is analysed relative to sea level and the deep tds observations are mapped fresh and brackish groundwater exhibits some spatial coherence as a function of regional geological and hydrogeological setting spatially coherent fresh and brackish groundwater at depth tends to be associated with relatively deep sedimentary basins overlying older less permeable basement it is inferred from this observation that differences in the regional hydrogeological setting and hydrogeological evolution of the respective basins are important controls on the distribution of fresh and groundwater at depth credit authorship contribution statement j p bloomfield conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft writing review

flood forecasting at waterford river watershed these models included three lumped conceptual models sac sma sacramento soil moisture accounting gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier and mac hbv mcmaster university hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning a semi distributed model hec hms hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system and a fully distributed physically based model watflood university of waterloo flood forecasting system the best model s were chosen by comparison of performance criteria to verify the potential of the best performing hydrological models for operational use deterministic hydrologic forecasts were performed new hydrological insights for the region all five models are capable of simulating streamflow reasonably well in both calibration and validation periods the sac sma and gr4j models perform equally well and perform better than the other three models for all low medium and peak flows the sac sma and gr4j models generally perform better for peak flows followed by hec hms streamflow forecast experiment using deterministic weather prediction shows that sac sma gr4j and hec hms models perform well for up to 1 3 days ahead forecasts and are recommended for operational use however due to the good performance of all five models an ensemble forecasting using continuous multiple hydrological models is also recommended keywords waterford river watershed flood forecasting hydrological models deterministic forecast 1 introduction floods are one of the deadliest disasters in the world and the most common and frequent natural hazard to life property the economy and the environment in canada flood mitigation measures and an enhanced flood forecasting system are critical parts of flood management an accurate flood forecasting system can deliver precise and reliable forecasts with appropriate lead time hydrological modeling is being used to forecast river flows for years and a well developed flood forecasting system can deliver precise and reliable forecasts with appropriate lead time nagai 2003 reed et al 2007 unduche et al 2018 flood damage has become a growing problem in newfoundland and labrador nl canada due to the increasing population density close to water bodies over the last decades sheppard 2018 the results of the flood risk and vulnerability analysis project completed on june 13 2012 have emphasized the need for a robust method to forecast floods to minimize future flood damage and related expenses in newfoundland innes and nimmrichter 2012 according to the report more than 267 communities in newfoundland had been affected by flooding in the last decades causing significant economic loss and infrastructure damages the average annual damage caused by flood related impacts is estimated to be about 8 to 22 million over the period 1962 2011 the cost of estimated damages may be even higher as some of the floods were recorded with no information on the estimated cost of damages st john s is the capital and the largest city of nl and is located on the avalon peninsula the east side of the island of newfoundland according to innes and nimmrichter 2012 st john s has had the most reported floods 73 out of 650 over the period 1950 2011 among 98 communities in nl the same study has identified and ranked communities in newfoundland according to their exposure to the physical hazards vulnerability to direct impacts of flooding and indirect flooding impacts and isolation over the last decade 2000 2011 it was found that st john s is the most vulnerable to flooding and therefore further study and funding had been recommended several hydrological modeling studies have been conducted in the waterford river watershed in st john s for different purposes a series of studies on water quality and quantity in the waterford river watershed was conducted by the canadian government and province of nl over the period from 1980 to 1985 after the five year long project the urban hydrology study of the waterford river basin flood study uhs wrb was published in 1988 smith 1988 the study mainly focused on the effects of urbanization between 1973 and 1981 on peak flows an event based simple and single hydrological model hydrologic model hymo was implemented to simulate the 1 20 and 1 100 annual exceedance probability aep flows after that a hydraulic model was developed using three sections of the waterford river channel and was fed with the flows simulated by the hydrological model to indicate the change in the storm runoff as a result of future urbanization following the study it was concluded that urbanization has increased flows however change in the volume of direct runoff is not significant a study entitled simulation of the effects of urbanization on basin streamflow was conducted as a part of the aforementioned comprehensive investigations of the effect of urbanization on peak flows ng and marsalek 1989 continuous simulation of streamflow was performed utilizing the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model to evaluate the effects of future urban development on annual streamflow and peak flows according to the simulation results streamflow volumes are not affected much but flow peaks and the incidence of flooding has increased significantly in 1988 the waterford river area hydrotechnical study was completed as a joint effort between the water resources division of the department of environment and lands and fenco newfoundland ltd gray 1988 several flood risk maps were developed using flows simulated from quality quantity simulation model qualhymo and hydrologic engineering center hec 2 models in 1998 the water resources management division wrmd of the department of environment and labor conducted a study entitled updated flood extents for the waterford river as an update for the fenco newfoundland study in 1988 the 1 20 and 1 100 aep flood flows from the 1988 study were re examined along with annual instantaneous peak flow up to 1996 existing flood risk maps were updated using a hydraulic model hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras the most recent update of flood risk maps was conducted in 2015 under the study entitled waterford river area flood risk mapping study by cbcl ltd with the collaboration of the wrmd of the department of municipal affairs and environment sheppard 2018 the objective of this study was to update flood risk maps to accurately predict the long term effect of climate change in st john s area coupled hydrologic hydraulic models hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms and hec ras were used in the study a comprehensive set of flood risk maps had been produced to predict the long term effect of climate change on floods in st john s area moreover the study emphasizes the need to implement a flood forecasting system that can allow local authorities to receive flood warnings to respond promptly in the event of a potential flood limited studies have been conducted on hydrological modeling in the waterford river watershed in st john s and the models used in these studies are relatively simple most of these studies were mainly focused on investigating the effects of urbanization on peak flows and streamflow volumes the rest of the studies were focused on developing flood risk maps rather than operational flood forecasting these studies have used hydrological modeling approaches to develop flood maps and these maps had been used for decision making purposes however none of these studies have investigated developing hydrological models that can be used in operational flood forecasting this study has evaluated the use of five hydrological models in varying complexity lumped semi distributed and fully distributed to propose a suitable method for operational flood forecasting in st john s newfoundland 2 study area the study was conducted in the waterford river watershed in st john s nl fig 1 the waterford river starts at the eastern part of the rapidly growing town of paradise and is originated from bremigan s pond and nevilles pond the river takes a meandering course through the city of mount pearl and into the city of st john s in st john s the river flows through the waterford valley before it discharges into the western end of st john s harbor it flows approximately 15 km from the origin before it meets the atlantic ocean at the western part of st john s harbor the river has a drainage basin area of about 70 km2 that covers st john s harbor and three municipalities the city of st john s the city of mount pearl and the town of paradise fig 1 the only hydrometric station located along the river reach is waterford river at kilbride station id 02zm008 and is operated as a collaborative effort of water survey of canada and wrmd nl the watershed is semi urban and provides a home for about 108 860 individuals at the time of the 2016 census statistics newfoundland labrador statistics agency n d land uses and features of the study area include urban areas forest water bodies wetlands barren lands deforested areas and open areas fig 2 a natural resources canada 2009 the urban areas encompass residential commercial and industrial areas and transportation corridors the surface elevation in the watershed ranges from 1 to 262 m above sea level fig 2b the soil is coarse to moderately coarse textured stony acid to extremely acid and low natural fertility soil heringa 1981 this soil is developed from the materials derived from the underlying coarse textured precambrian sedimentary rocks batterson 1984 these soils are characterized as rapid surface drainage the whole area was glaciated and as a result most of the area is underlain by a till heringa 1981 the till deposit lies beneath the surface and contains pockets of clay with low permeability therefore this till deposit acts as an aquitard allowing the accumulation of standing water which contributes to the surface runoff a combination of impervious urban areas impervious till and poorly drained soils cause poor internal drainage and eventually results in a highly flood prone area the average daily temperature of the area is 4 c environment canada 2017 the average annual precipitation is 1416 mm on the average over 296 days in the year environment canada 2017 the minimum and maximum instantaneous flows recorded at waterford river at kilbride were 0 3 and 45 2 m3s 1 environment climate change canada 2017 high intensity rainfall events are frequent throughout the year innes and nimmrichter 2012 the leading cause of flooding in the area is recognized as rainfall followed by events related to coastal processes such as storm surge and waves innes and nimmrichter 2012 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrometeorological and hydrometric data daily climate data recorded at four environment canada ec weather stations were downloaded from the ec website from 2006 to 2015 table 1 this period contained the least amount of missing values both in precipitation and temperature missing values in precipitation data were infilled using canadian precipitation analysis capa data there is a long term flow gauge named waterford river at kilbride located downstream of the confluence of south brook and waterford river fig 1 this station is operated by the water survey of canada and in operation since 1974 a complete time series of flow data is available on both ec s and wrmd s websites wrmd is using data from this gauge station in hydrological modeling daily streamflow data were collected from the hydat database and narrowed to a 10 year time series spanning from 2006 to 2015 to be consistent with available climate data 3 2 hydrological models five hydrological models with complexity ranging from simple lumped models to a fully distributed were chosen for the investigation to identify adequate model s for operational flood forecasting in the waterford river watershed in st john s nl these models include modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j mcmaster university hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning mac hbv sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms and university of waterloo flood forecasting system watflood these hydrological models were implemented calibrated and validated to simulate the flow at waterford river at kilbride hydrometric station 3 2 1 gr4j model gr4j is a simple conceptual hydrological model that runs with four parameters perrin et al 2003 inputs to the original model include precipitation evapotranspiration and the optimized set of parameters in this study the model was modified to include the two components a simplified thornwaite formula to account for daily potential evapotranspiration using temperature and a degree day snow routine to determine snow water equivalent swe following samuel et al 2011 therefore the temperature time series was inputted instead of the calculated evapotranspiration hence the final modified model includes nine parameters that are listed in table a1 in the appendix the range of each of these parameters listed in table a1 was obtained from the previous literature based on the land use soil climate morphology and vegetation in the watershed for a detailed description of the gr4j model the interested readers may refer to the journal article by perrin et al 2003 3 2 2 mac hbv mac hbv model is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model which had been extensively used in hydrological studies leach et al 2018 razavi and coulibaly 2017 samuel et al 2011 it is a modified version of the original hbv model bergström 1976 to provide a better performance especially flow estimation at ungauged sites in canada samuel et al 2011 2012 there are 15 parameters in mac hbv and incorporates a degree day snow routine a soil moisture routine a nonlinear response function and a routing routine parameters and their ranges obtained from the literature for the mac hbv model are listed in table a2 in the appendix further details of the mac hbv model are presented in samuel et al 2011 2012 3 2 3 sac sma sac sma is a conceptual watershed model that is widely used by the national weather services usa in operational flood forecasting since its development by burnash et al 1973 there are 19 input parameters within the model those parameters and their ranges gathered from literature are listed in table a3 in the appendix water accumulation in the catchment is represented using five storages two upper zones tension and free water storages and three lower zones tension water storage and primary and supplementary free water storages koren et al 2004 samuel et al 2014 swe was determined using the degree day snow routine samuel et al 2014 the same evapotranspiration calculation method used in mac hbv is applied in sac sma to account for daily potential evapotranspiration a detailed description of sac sma is available in burnash et al 1973 3 2 4 hec hms hec hms is a hydrological model developed by the hydrologic engineering center of the us army corps of engineers it is designed to simulate complete hydrological processes in a dendritic watershed in both space and time us army corps of engineers 2016 hec hms comprises six different in built algorithms to represent different components in runoff generation meteorological rainfall loss direct runoff river routing base flow and reservoir cunderlik and simonovic 2004 further details of the hec hms model can be found in the hec hms user manual us army corps of engineers 2016 twenty three sub basins were delineated using light detection and ranging lidar and used in the semi distributed hec hms model inputs to the hec hms model include precipitation temperature the monthly average of evapotranspiration and calibrated parameters the simplified thornwaite formula was used to calculate daily potential evapotranspiration using temperature the calibrated parameters in the existing model were used in this study to simulate flows as suggested by chu and steinman in 2009 parameters of the hec hms model and range of them extracted from previous literature are listed in the appendix in table a4 since calibrated parameters of the existing hec hms model were gathered from wrmd parameter ranges are not mentioned in the table 3 2 5 watflood watflood is a physically based distributed hydrological model that has been extensively used in flood forecasting since its first introduction in 1973 kouwen 1973 the model subdivides the watershed into group response units grus assuming surface areas with similar land use to have similar hydrological responses kouwen et al 1993 the runoff response from each gru was calculated considering processes such as interception evaporation infiltration interflow recharge baseflow overland and channel routing snow accumulation and ablation kouwen 2016 ten river and basin parameters 11 surface hydrological parameters and 14 snowmelt parameters for each gru were used in watflood parameter ranges for each of the land cover classes were gathered from the previous literature and used during the calibration since the number of parameters is relatively large only optimized parameters and parameter ranges for forest land cover class were listed in table a5 in the appendix it uses green kenue a gis based data processing and visualization tool as the graphical user interface for data pre and post processing further details on watflood are included in kouwen 1973 3 3 model calibration and validation selected models were calibrated against observed daily streamflow time series for seven years over the period 2006 01 01 to 2012 12 31 models were validated against data for three years over the period 2013 01 01 to 2015 12 31 for model comparison data recorded in the first year 2006 were used for model warm up dynamically dimensioned search dds tolson and shoemaker 2008 optimization algorithm was used to determine optimal parameter sets for all models the optimal parameter sets were found by maximizing nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 1 objective functions that address mean low and high flows at the same time samuel et al 2011 optimization software toolkit ostrich was used to automate the processes of model calibration ostrich is a model independent windows based program that is designed to perform optimization without the need for any other additional software matott 2016 ostrich currently supports 36 optimization and calibration algorithms 7 deterministic local search 13 heuristic global search 3 multi objective optimization and multi criteria calibration 1 hybrid heuristic deterministic and 4 sampling algorithms uncertainty based optimization even though sub daily precipitation is preferred for model calibration and validation especially for flood forecasting daily precipitation data were used in this study due to several reasons data limitation is a challenge in this regional context only daily precipitation data is publicly available from ec for the study period of 2006 2015 the flood management authority for this watershed wrmd had been using daily data for long term hydrological studies the attempt to derive high temporal resolution precipitation from observed daily precipitation using numerous approaches proposed in the literature güntner et al 2001 olsson 1995 was not possible because there was no hourly precipitation data to validate the disaggregated precipitation directly since disaggregation can introduce more errors the original daily data were used for model calibration and validation after considering climate basin morphology drainage pattern and historical flood records gray 1988 suggested that the flood is resulted in the waterford river watershed by synoptic rainfall events with durations of about two days therefore daily streamflow simulations generated by the hydrological models could adequately capture peak flows at the waterford river at kilbride hydrometric station however it is noteworthy that daily peak flow can be different from hourly peak flow the proposed hydrological models will need to be re calibrated for use with sub daily data when they become available 3 4 model performance criteria the fitness of simulated flows to the observed flows was evaluated based on common model performance statistics it is important to note that the performance of evaluation criteria varies according to the targeted portion low mean and peak flows of the hydrograph the model performance criteria used in this study are listed below nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 1 nse only for peak flows was calculated for evaluation of peak flows and it is denoted as pnse the value of 1 indicates a perfect fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 values between 0 0 and 1 0 are generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance whereas nse 0 50 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 correlation coefficient r eq 2 value of 1 indicates a perfect fit kling gupta efficiency kge eq 3 ranges from to 1 with one being the optimal value gupta et al 2009 percent bias pbias eq 4 optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values indicate model overestimation bias and negative values indicate model underestimation bias pfc peak flow criterion eq 5 focuses on the accuracy of predicting peak flows ribeiro et al 1998 the value of 1 indicates no correlation and value of zero for a perfect fit the modified peak flow criterion mpfc is used in this study for consistency i e 1 for the perfect fit rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr eq 6 rsr standardizes rmse using the observations

hydrometric station for the calibration and validation periods is summarized in tables 2 and 3 respectively the sac sma model appears to perform well in simulating stream flows with the best prediction accuracy during the calibration period kge 0 85 and r 0 87 relatively low rmse 1 48 m3s 1 and srs 0 49 statistics suggest that the sac sma model is capable of simulating stream flows more accurately regarding errors even though sac sma performs well the negative pbias suggests that the model slightly underestimates the flow during the calibration relatively high mpfc 0 79 and pnse 0 62 reveals that the sac sma model can capture not only low and medium range flows but also peak flows well the gr4j model also has similar performance results kge 0 82 and r 0 85 as compared to sac sma for both low and medium range flows however the gr4j model underpredicts flows more than sac sma based on the percentage pbias values 1 96 and 5 71 for sac sma and gr4j respectively statistics for peak flows suggest that the gr4j performs equally as the sac sma model in capturing peak flows in the calibration period even though the performances are lower than sac sma and gr4j models kge r and rmse statistics indicate that the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models also can provide satisfactory kge 0 5 results during the calibration period for both low and medium range flows all three models underpredict observed flows but the hec hms model s performance is relatively better than mac hbv and watflood regarding underprediction table 2 peak flow statistics indicate that the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models can provide reasonably good results where hec hms performs relatively better in general all five models provide adequate results but sac sma and gr4j outperform the other three models in the calibration period a similar trend was observed during the validation for all low medium range and peak flows of all five models in contrast to the calibration period the sac sma gr4j and hec hms models appear to slightly overpredict observed flows during the validation period table 3 the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models have similar performance for both low and medium range flows but watflood performs relatively better in the validation period for all flows in general the sac sma and the gr4j models appear the best performing for all flows in both calibration and validation periods the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models perform reasonably well for low to medium range flows but underestimate peak flows in both calibration and validation periods to further assess the general model performances scatter plots of observed vs simulated flows for each model for calibration and validation periods are used fig 3 data are more clustered along the 45 line in the case of both sac sma and gr4j models the sac sma and gr4j models generally perform well for all low medium and high flows in both calibration and validation periods the hec hms model performs reasonably well for most flows in both calibration and validation periods except for overestimating at low flows mac hbv performs well for low flows but shows some inconsistencies at medium and high flows in both calibration and validation periods the watflood also performs reasonably well for low flows in both calibration and validation period but with a clear underestimation at medium range and high flows in the calibration period however watflood performs relatively better in the validation period especially for high flows compared to calibration the scatterplots also show that the results are more dispersed from the 45 line with increasing flows for all models in general the sac sma and the gr4j models show better performance for all flows in both calibration and validation periods on the other hand the hec hms model captures most of the peaks during both calibration and validation period and hence competes with sac sma and gr4j the watflood and mac hbv models perform reasonably well for low to medium range flows but underestimate peak flows in both calibration and validation periods hydrographs of observed and simulated stream flows are shown for the year 2011 for calibration and 2015 for the validation period in figs 4 and 5 respectively sac sma model appears effective at simulating the magnitude and timing of all stream flows better than other models during the calibration period the same trend is observed during the validation period for sac sma but shows some inconsistencies in the early months of the year the gr4j model is also able to capture all flows as accurately as the sac sma model during the calibration period except towards the end of the year the agreement between observed and simulated flows in both rising limbs and falling limbs of the hydrographs is more accurate for both sac sma and gr4j models during the validation period the other models tend to underpredict or overpredict observed flows and are not able to capture the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph accurately as sac sma and gr4j therefore the hydrographs and model performances indicate that the sac sma and the gr4j models to provide better streamflow simulations for further analysis taylor diagrams are used to select the best model based on three statistical parameters standard deviation correlation coefficient and centered root mean square error for both calibration and validation periods fig 6 similarly to the results discussed above the gr4j and sac sma models perform competitively well as they are plotted closest to the black arc as well as the point obs the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models also closely follow gr4j and sac sma models indicating comparatively good performance apart from model simulation accuracy some other factors which affect model selection for operational streamflow forecasting were also considered in this study model simulation time user friendliness input data requirement and availability were also evaluated along with the model simulation accuracy as a requirement for forecasting when all models run on computers with similar computational power no significant time difference observed between the five models a significant difference in user friendliness was experienced among the models used in this study the hec hms model has its own data preprocessing tool called hec dssvue and user friendly graphical user interface gui hec dssvue is a java based program that can be used to process observed meteorological data for input to hec hms hec dssvue produces observed meteorological time series formatted for compatibility with hec hms all three lumped models do not have a gui and original matlab codes were run in matlab software in the study the geen kenue software was used to pre and post processing data for watfllod even though it does not have a prebuilt gui interface therefore data preprocessing input output visualization and model forcing is relatively easy with hec hms compared to the other four models when considering the complexity and input data requirement all three lump models are advantageous as they only require temperature and precipitation as model forcing the fully distributed watflood model only requires land cover as an additional input other than temperature and precipitation on the other hand the semi distributed hec hms model requires more basin characteristics which result in difficulties in model implementation the availability of hydrologic models may also play a role in model selection for operational forecasting all the hec models are freely available at the us army corps of engineers website via www hec usace army mil software hec hms downloads aspx the gr4j model is also available as a pre built full r package airgr where r is free software available to the public calculated evapotranspiration is a requirement for the original gr4j model evapotranspiration also could be calculated using the pre built r package evapotranspiration using 21 different formulations including penman penman monteith fao 56 priestley taylor and morton formulations therefore the use of the gr4j model is advantageous over other models and has openings for further development the other three models used in this study are not freely available and hence is a disadvantage 5 operational flow forecasting to verify the potential of the best performing hydrological models for operational streamflow forecasting in the waterford river watershed deterministic hydrologic forecasts were performed the sac sma gr4j and hec hms hydrological models were used to simulate the streamflow for forecast ranges of 1 5 days ahead the hec hms model was run as the benchmark model flows were simulated for six months from 2017 06 01 to 2017 12 31 on a daily time step the simulation was limited to only six months because the observed flow data were available only up to 31 december 2017 global deterministic prediction system gdps meteorological forecasts archived in canadian surface prediction archive caspar https caspar data ca were used to force the selected hydrological models gdps forecast weather variables are available in daily time step and therefore daily time streamflow simulations for up to five days ahead were generated using selected hydrologic models forecasted gdps meteorological data precipitation and temperature were assessed before forcing the hydrological models to verify the quality of archived meteorological data this assessment was performed using observed precipitation and temperature for two years from 2017 06 01 to 2019 06 01 recorded at st john s intl a and st john s west climate ec weather station in st john s nl the evaluation was performed by first overlying observation gauge points on gdps forecast grids and then by comparing corresponding gdps pixel value with the observed gauge value to evaluate the quality of forecast meteorological data the correlation coefficient and rmse were chosen as shown in table 4 average forecast weather variables corresponding to st john s intl a and st john s west climate ec weather stations were used as input for hydrologic model runs the statistics show that the temperature forecasts for the study area performed well and better than precipitation forecasts table 4 for the precipitation correlation is significant for short lead times on the other hand temperature shows a significant correlation for all lead times up to 5 days ahead in both cases performance decreases with increasing lead time rmse follows a similar pattern as the correlation coefficient for both precipitation and temperature overall the results suggest that the gdps data perform well only for short lead times for precipitation while it performs well for longer lead times for temperature the results of the forecasting flow using sac sma gr4j and hec hms are presented in tables 5 7 respectively both sac sma and gr4j models perform reasonably well for up to 1 3 day ahead forecasts the agreement between observed and simulated flows in both the rising limbs and the falling limbs of the hydrographs fig 7 is more accurate for both sac sma and gr4j models for one day ahead forecasts the benchmark model hec hms does not perform equally well for all flows when compared to the sac sma and gr4j models the hec hms model performs relatively well for the peak flows as the sac sma and gr4j models fig 7 as expected based on the forecast evaluation results the performance decreases with increasing lead time fig 7 the average time of concentration of the watershed was calculated to be about 10 8 h smith 1988 gdps daily forecasts are released in 6 h intervals a day time of 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 therefore daily streamflow forecasts using hydrological models can be issued in 6 h time intervals hence the methods used in this study can capture most of the peaks adequately 6 conclusions from the results presented in this paper it can be concluded that all five models are capable of simulating streamflow reasonably well the sac sma and gr4j models perform equally well and perform better than the other three models in both calibration and validation periods for all low medium and peak flows the sac sma and gr4j models generally perform better for peak flows followed by hec hms the watflood and mac hbv models perform better in simulating low flows but underpredict high flows the results from the statistics hydrographs scatter plots and taylor diagrams indicate that the best performing models are sac sma and gr4j followed by hec hms forecasting model runs using gdps meteorological forecasts have been verified by their accuracy in forecasting the observed streamflow in the waterford river watershed if a single model to be used for forecasting the gr4j model can be recommended relatively smaller basin size less input data requirement efficiency in computational timing freely available r package makes gr4j as the best model to be used in operational flood forecasting in the waterford river basin in st john s nl however due to the good performance of all five models an ensemble streamflow forecast using continuous multiple hydrological models for operational forecasting is also recommended the resultant flows for hydrological models can be used as forcing data for existing hydraulic models at wrmd to produce user friendly flood risk maps to be delivered via social media to the public the use of existing knowledge gathered through a long time of hands on experience of forecasters along with hydrological and hydraulic model runs will produce more accurate operational flood forecasting for st john s nl funding this work was funded by the natural science and engineering research council nserc canadian

recommended keywords waterford river watershed flood forecasting hydrological models deterministic forecast 1 introduction floods are one of the deadliest disasters in the world and the most common and frequent natural hazard to life property the economy and the environment in canada flood mitigation measures and an enhanced flood forecasting system are critical parts of flood management an accurate flood forecasting system can deliver precise and reliable forecasts with appropriate lead time hydrological modeling is being used to forecast river flows for years and a well developed flood forecasting system can deliver precise and reliable forecasts with appropriate lead time nagai 2003 reed et al 2007 unduche et al 2018 flood damage has become a growing problem in newfoundland and labrador nl canada due to the increasing population density close to water bodies over the last decades sheppard 2018 the results of the flood risk and vulnerability analysis project completed on june 13 2012 have emphasized the need for a robust method to forecast floods to minimize future flood damage and related expenses in newfoundland innes and nimmrichter 2012 according to the report more than 267 communities in newfoundland had been affected by flooding in the last decades causing significant economic loss and infrastructure damages the average annual damage caused by flood related impacts is estimated to be about 8 to 22 million over the period 1962 2011 the cost of estimated damages may be even higher as some of the floods were recorded with no information on the estimated cost of damages st john s is the capital and the largest city of nl and is located on the avalon peninsula the east side of the island of newfoundland according to innes and nimmrichter 2012 st john s has had the most reported floods 73 out of 650 over the period 1950 2011 among 98 communities in nl the same study has identified and ranked communities in newfoundland according to their exposure to the physical hazards vulnerability to direct impacts of flooding and indirect flooding impacts and isolation over the last decade 2000 2011 it was found that st john s is the most vulnerable to flooding and therefore further study and funding had been recommended several hydrological modeling studies have been conducted in the waterford river watershed in st john s for different purposes a series of studies on water quality and quantity in the waterford river watershed was conducted by the canadian government and province of nl over the period from 1980 to 1985 after the five year long project the urban hydrology study of the waterford river basin flood study uhs wrb was published in 1988 smith 1988 the study mainly focused on the effects of urbanization between 1973 and 1981 on peak flows an event based simple and single hydrological model hydrologic model hymo was implemented to simulate the 1 20 and 1 100 annual exceedance probability aep flows after that a hydraulic model was developed using three sections of the waterford river channel and was fed with the flows simulated by the hydrological model to indicate the change in the storm runoff as a result of future urbanization following the study it was concluded that urbanization has increased flows however change in the volume of direct runoff is not significant a study entitled simulation of the effects of urbanization on basin streamflow was conducted as a part of the aforementioned comprehensive investigations of the effect of urbanization on peak flows ng and marsalek 1989 continuous simulation of streamflow was performed utilizing the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model to evaluate the effects of future urban development on annual streamflow and peak flows according to the simulation results streamflow volumes are not affected much but flow peaks and the incidence of flooding has increased significantly in 1988 the waterford river area hydrotechnical study was completed as a joint effort between the water resources division of the department of environment and lands and fenco newfoundland ltd gray 1988 several flood risk maps were developed using flows simulated from quality quantity simulation model qualhymo and hydrologic engineering center hec 2 models in 1998 the water resources management division wrmd of the department of environment and labor conducted a study entitled updated flood extents for the waterford river as an update for the fenco newfoundland study in 1988 the 1 20 and 1 100 aep flood flows from the 1988 study were re examined along with annual instantaneous peak flow up to 1996 existing flood risk maps were updated using a hydraulic model hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras the most recent update of flood risk maps was conducted in 2015 under the study entitled waterford river area flood risk mapping study by cbcl ltd with the collaboration of the wrmd of the department of municipal affairs and environment sheppard 2018 the objective of this study was to update flood risk maps to accurately predict the long term effect of climate change in st john s area coupled hydrologic hydraulic models hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms and hec ras were used in the study a comprehensive set of flood risk maps had been produced to predict the long term effect of climate change on floods in st john s area moreover the study emphasizes the need to implement a flood forecasting system that can allow local authorities to receive flood warnings to respond promptly in the event of a potential flood limited studies have been conducted on hydrological modeling in the waterford river watershed in st john s and the models used in these studies are relatively simple most of these studies were mainly focused on investigating the effects of urbanization on peak flows and streamflow volumes the rest of the studies were focused on developing flood risk maps rather than operational flood forecasting these studies have used hydrological modeling approaches to develop flood maps and these maps had been used for decision making purposes however none of these studies have investigated developing hydrological models that can be used in operational flood forecasting this study has evaluated the use of five hydrological models in varying complexity lumped semi distributed and fully distributed to propose a suitable method for operational flood forecasting in st john s newfoundland 2 study area the study was conducted in the waterford river watershed in st john s nl fig 1 the waterford river starts at the eastern part of the rapidly growing town of paradise and is originated from bremigan s pond and nevilles pond the river takes a meandering course through the city of mount pearl and into the city of st john s in st john s the river flows through the waterford valley before it discharges into the western end of st john s harbor it flows approximately 15 km from the origin before it meets the atlantic ocean at the western part of st john s harbor the river has a drainage basin area of about 70 km2 that covers st john s harbor and three municipalities the city of st john s the city of mount pearl and the town of paradise fig 1 the only hydrometric station located along the river reach is waterford river at kilbride station id 02zm008 and is operated as a collaborative effort of water survey of canada and wrmd nl the watershed is semi urban and provides a home for about 108 860 individuals at the time of the 2016 census statistics newfoundland labrador statistics agency n d land uses and features of the study area include urban areas forest water bodies wetlands barren lands deforested areas and open areas fig 2 a natural resources canada 2009 the urban areas encompass residential commercial and industrial areas and transportation corridors the surface elevation in the watershed ranges from 1 to 262 m above sea level fig 2b the soil is coarse to moderately coarse textured stony acid to extremely acid and low natural fertility soil heringa 1981 this soil is developed from the materials derived from the underlying coarse textured precambrian sedimentary rocks batterson 1984 these soils are characterized as rapid surface drainage the whole area was glaciated and as a result most of the area is underlain by a till heringa 1981 the till deposit lies beneath the surface and contains pockets of clay with low permeability therefore this till deposit acts as an aquitard allowing the accumulation of standing water which contributes to the surface runoff a combination of impervious urban areas impervious till and poorly drained soils cause poor internal drainage and eventually results in a highly flood prone area the average daily temperature of the area is 4 c environment canada 2017 the average annual precipitation is 1416 mm on the average over 296 days in the year environment canada 2017 the minimum and maximum instantaneous flows recorded at waterford river at kilbride were 0 3 and 45 2 m3s 1 environment climate change canada 2017 high intensity rainfall events are frequent throughout the year innes and nimmrichter 2012 the leading cause of flooding in the area is recognized as rainfall followed by events related to coastal processes such as storm surge and waves innes and nimmrichter 2012 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrometeorological and hydrometric data daily climate data recorded at four environment canada ec weather stations were downloaded from the ec website from 2006 to 2015 table 1 this period contained the least amount of missing values both in precipitation and temperature missing values in precipitation data were infilled using canadian precipitation analysis capa data there is a long term flow gauge named waterford river at kilbride located downstream of the confluence of south brook and waterford river fig 1 this station is operated by the water survey of canada and in operation since 1974 a complete time series of flow data is available on both ec s and wrmd s websites wrmd is using data from this gauge station in hydrological modeling daily streamflow data were collected from the hydat database and narrowed to a 10 year time series spanning from 2006 to 2015 to be consistent with available climate data 3 2 hydrological models five hydrological models with complexity ranging from simple lumped models to a fully distributed were chosen for the investigation to identify adequate model s for operational flood forecasting in the waterford river watershed in st john s nl these models include modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j mcmaster university hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning mac hbv sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms and university of waterloo flood forecasting system watflood these hydrological models were implemented calibrated and validated to simulate the flow at waterford river at kilbride hydrometric station 3 2 1 gr4j model gr4j is a simple conceptual hydrological model that runs with four parameters perrin et al 2003 inputs to the original model include precipitation evapotranspiration and the optimized set of parameters in this study the model was modified to include the two components a simplified thornwaite formula to account for daily potential evapotranspiration using temperature and a degree day snow routine to determine snow water equivalent swe following samuel et al 2011 therefore the temperature time series was inputted instead of the calculated evapotranspiration hence the final modified model includes nine parameters that are listed in table a1 in the appendix the range of each of these parameters listed in table a1 was obtained from the previous literature based on the land use soil climate morphology and vegetation in the watershed for a detailed description of the gr4j model the interested readers may refer to the journal article by perrin et al 2003 3 2 2 mac hbv mac hbv model is a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model which had been extensively used in hydrological studies leach et al 2018 razavi and coulibaly 2017 samuel et al 2011 it is a modified version of the original hbv model bergström 1976 to provide a better performance especially flow estimation at ungauged sites in canada samuel et al 2011 2012 there are 15 parameters in mac hbv and incorporates a degree day snow routine a soil moisture routine a nonlinear response function and a routing routine parameters and their ranges obtained from the literature for the mac hbv model are listed in table a2 in the appendix further details of the mac hbv model are presented in samuel et al 2011 2012 3 2 3 sac sma sac sma is a conceptual watershed model that is widely used by the national weather services usa in operational flood forecasting since its development by burnash et al 1973 there are 19 input parameters within the model those parameters and their ranges gathered from literature are listed in table a3 in the appendix water accumulation in the catchment is represented using five storages two upper zones tension and free water storages and three lower zones tension water storage and primary and supplementary free water storages koren et al 2004 samuel et al 2014 swe was determined using the degree day snow routine samuel et al 2014 the same evapotranspiration calculation method used in mac hbv is applied in sac sma to account for daily potential evapotranspiration a detailed description of sac sma is available in burnash et al 1973 3 2 4 hec hms hec hms is a hydrological model developed by the hydrologic engineering center of the us army corps of engineers it is designed to simulate complete hydrological processes in a dendritic watershed in both space and time us army corps of engineers 2016 hec hms comprises six different in built algorithms to represent different components in runoff generation meteorological rainfall loss direct runoff river routing base flow and reservoir cunderlik and simonovic 2004 further details of the hec hms model can be found in the hec hms user manual us army corps of engineers 2016 twenty three sub basins were delineated using light detection and ranging lidar and used in the semi distributed hec hms model inputs to the hec hms model include precipitation temperature the monthly average of evapotranspiration and calibrated parameters the simplified thornwaite formula was used to calculate daily potential evapotranspiration using temperature the calibrated parameters in the existing model were used in this study to simulate flows as suggested by chu and steinman in 2009 parameters of the hec hms model and range of them extracted from previous literature are listed in the appendix in table a4 since calibrated parameters of the existing hec hms model were gathered from wrmd parameter ranges are not mentioned in the table 3 2 5 watflood watflood is a physically based distributed hydrological model that has been extensively used in flood forecasting since its first introduction in 1973 kouwen 1973 the model subdivides the watershed into group response units grus assuming surface areas with similar land use to have similar hydrological responses kouwen et al 1993 the runoff response from each gru was calculated considering processes such as interception evaporation infiltration interflow recharge baseflow overland and channel routing snow accumulation and ablation kouwen 2016 ten river and basin parameters 11 surface hydrological parameters and 14 snowmelt parameters for each gru were used in watflood parameter ranges for each of the land cover classes were gathered from the previous literature and used during the calibration since the number of parameters is relatively large only optimized parameters and parameter ranges for forest land cover class were listed in table a5 in the appendix it uses green kenue a gis based data processing and visualization tool as the graphical user interface for data pre and post processing further details on watflood are included in kouwen 1973 3 3 model calibration and validation selected models were calibrated against observed daily streamflow time series for seven years over the period 2006 01 01 to 2012 12 31 models were validated against data for three years over the period 2013 01 01 to 2015 12 31 for model comparison data recorded in the first year 2006 were used for model warm up dynamically dimensioned search dds tolson and shoemaker 2008 optimization algorithm was used to determine optimal parameter sets for all models the optimal parameter sets were found by maximizing nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 1 objective functions that address mean low and high flows at the same time samuel et al 2011 optimization software toolkit ostrich was used to automate the processes of model calibration ostrich is a model independent windows based program that is designed to perform optimization without the need for any other additional software matott 2016 ostrich currently supports 36 optimization and calibration algorithms 7 deterministic local search 13 heuristic global search 3 multi objective optimization and multi criteria calibration 1 hybrid heuristic deterministic and 4 sampling algorithms uncertainty based optimization even though sub daily precipitation is preferred for model calibration and validation especially for flood forecasting daily precipitation data were used in this study due to several reasons data limitation is a challenge in this regional context only daily precipitation data is publicly available from ec for the study period of 2006 2015 the flood management authority for this watershed wrmd had been using daily data for long term hydrological studies the attempt to derive high temporal resolution precipitation from observed daily precipitation using numerous approaches proposed in the literature güntner et al 2001 olsson 1995 was not possible because there was no hourly precipitation data to validate the disaggregated precipitation directly since disaggregation can introduce more errors the original daily data were used for model calibration and validation after considering climate basin morphology drainage pattern and historical flood records gray 1988 suggested that the flood is resulted in the waterford river watershed by synoptic rainfall events with durations of about two days therefore daily streamflow simulations generated by the hydrological models could adequately capture peak flows at the waterford river at kilbride hydrometric station however it is noteworthy that daily peak flow can be different from hourly peak flow the proposed hydrological models will need to be re calibrated for use with sub daily data when they become available 3 4 model performance criteria the fitness of simulated flows to the observed flows was evaluated based on common model performance statistics it is important to note that the performance of evaluation criteria varies according to the targeted portion low mean and peak flows of the hydrograph the model performance criteria used in this study are listed below nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 1 nse only for peak flows was calculated for evaluation of peak flows and it is denoted as pnse the value of 1 indicates a perfect fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 values between 0 0 and 1 0 are generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance whereas nse 0 50 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 correlation coefficient r eq 2 value of 1 indicates a perfect fit kling gupta efficiency kge eq 3 ranges from to 1 with one being the optimal value gupta et al 2009 percent bias pbias eq 4 optimal value of pbias is 0 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values indicate model overestimation bias and negative values indicate model underestimation bias pfc peak flow criterion eq 5 focuses on the accuracy of predicting peak flows ribeiro et al 1998 the value of 1 indicates no correlation and value of zero for a perfect fit the modified peak flow criterion mpfc is used in this study for consistency i e 1 for the perfect fit rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr eq 6 rsr standardizes rmse using the observations standard deviation making it a better tool for model inter comparisons moriasi et al 2007 values of 0 are optimal with lower values indicate good model performance moriasi et al 2007 equations 1 n s e

hydrometric station for the calibration and validation periods is summarized in tables 2 and 3 respectively the sac sma model appears to perform well in simulating stream flows with the best prediction accuracy during the calibration period kge 0 85 and r 0 87 relatively low rmse 1 48 m3s 1 and srs 0 49 statistics suggest that the sac sma model is capable of simulating stream flows more accurately regarding errors even though sac sma performs well the negative pbias suggests that the model slightly underestimates the flow during the calibration relatively high mpfc 0 79 and pnse 0 62 reveals that the sac sma model can capture not only low and medium range flows but also peak flows well the gr4j model also has similar performance results kge 0 82 and r 0 85 as compared to sac sma for both low and medium range flows however the gr4j model underpredicts flows more than sac sma based on the percentage pbias values 1 96 and 5 71 for sac sma and gr4j respectively statistics for peak flows suggest that the gr4j performs equally as the sac sma model in capturing peak flows in the calibration period even though the performances are lower than sac sma and gr4j models kge r and rmse statistics indicate that the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models also can provide satisfactory kge 0 5 results during the calibration period for both low and medium range flows all three models underpredict observed flows but the hec hms model s performance is relatively better than mac hbv and watflood regarding underprediction table 2 peak flow statistics indicate that the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models can provide reasonably good results where hec hms performs relatively better in general all five models provide adequate results but sac sma and gr4j outperform the other three models in the calibration period a similar trend was observed during the validation for all low medium range and peak flows of all five models in contrast to the calibration period the sac sma gr4j and hec hms models appear to slightly overpredict observed flows during the validation period table 3 the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models have similar performance for both low and medium range flows but watflood performs relatively better in the validation period for all flows in general the sac sma and the gr4j models appear the best performing for all flows in both calibration and validation periods the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models perform reasonably well for low to medium range flows but underestimate peak flows in both calibration and validation periods to further assess the general model performances scatter plots of observed vs simulated flows for each model for calibration and validation periods are used fig 3 data are more clustered along the 45 line in the case of both sac sma and gr4j models the sac sma and gr4j models generally perform well for all low medium and high flows in both calibration and validation periods the hec hms model performs reasonably well for most flows in both calibration and validation periods except for overestimating at low flows mac hbv performs well for low flows but shows some inconsistencies at medium and high flows in both calibration and validation periods the watflood also performs reasonably well for low flows in both calibration and validation period but with a clear underestimation at medium range and high flows in the calibration period however watflood performs relatively better in the validation period especially for high flows compared to calibration the scatterplots also show that the results are more dispersed from the 45 line with increasing flows for all models in general the sac sma and the gr4j models show better performance for all flows in both calibration and validation periods on the other hand the hec hms model captures most of the peaks during both calibration and validation period and hence competes with sac sma and gr4j the watflood and mac hbv models perform reasonably well for low to medium range flows but underestimate peak flows in both calibration and validation periods hydrographs of observed and simulated stream flows are shown for the year 2011 for calibration and 2015 for the validation period in figs 4 and 5 respectively sac sma model appears effective at simulating the magnitude and timing of all stream flows better than other models during the calibration period the same trend is observed during the validation period for sac sma but shows some inconsistencies in the early months of the year the gr4j model is also able to capture all flows as accurately as the sac sma model during the calibration period except towards the end of the year the agreement between observed and simulated flows in both rising limbs and falling limbs of the hydrographs is more accurate for both sac sma and gr4j models during the validation period the other models tend to underpredict or overpredict observed flows and are not able to capture the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph accurately as sac sma and gr4j therefore the hydrographs and model performances indicate that the sac sma and the gr4j models to provide better streamflow simulations for further analysis taylor diagrams are used to select the best model based on three statistical parameters standard deviation correlation coefficient and centered root mean square error for both calibration and validation periods fig 6 similarly to the results discussed above the gr4j and sac sma models perform competitively well as they are plotted closest to the black arc as well as the point obs the mac hbv hec hms and watflood models also closely follow gr4j and sac sma models indicating comparatively good performance apart from model simulation accuracy some other factors which affect model selection for operational streamflow forecasting were also considered in this study model simulation time user friendliness input data requirement and availability were also evaluated along with the model simulation accuracy as a requirement for forecasting when all models run on computers with similar computational power no significant time difference observed between the five models a significant difference in user friendliness was experienced among the models used in this study the hec hms model has its own data preprocessing tool called hec dssvue and user friendly graphical user interface gui hec dssvue is a java based program that can be used to process observed meteorological data for input to hec hms hec dssvue produces observed meteorological time series formatted for compatibility with hec hms all three lumped models do not have a gui and original matlab codes were run in matlab software in the study the geen kenue software was used to pre and post processing data for watfllod even though it does not have a prebuilt gui interface therefore data preprocessing input output visualization and model forcing is relatively easy with hec hms compared to the other four models when considering the complexity and input data requirement all three lump models are advantageous as they only require temperature and precipitation as model forcing the fully distributed watflood model only requires land cover as an additional input other than temperature and precipitation on the other hand the semi distributed hec hms model requires more basin characteristics which result in difficulties in model implementation the availability of hydrologic models may also play a role in model selection for operational forecasting all the hec models are freely available at the us army corps of engineers website via www hec usace army mil software hec hms downloads aspx the gr4j model is also available as a pre built full r package airgr where r is free software available to the public calculated evapotranspiration is a requirement for the original gr4j model evapotranspiration also could be calculated using the pre built r package evapotranspiration using 21 different formulations including penman penman monteith fao 56 priestley taylor and morton formulations therefore the use of the gr4j model is advantageous over other models and has openings for further development the other three models used in this study are not freely available and hence is a disadvantage 5 operational flow forecasting to verify the potential of the best performing hydrological models for operational streamflow forecasting in the waterford river watershed deterministic hydrologic forecasts were performed the sac sma gr4j and hec hms hydrological models were used to simulate the streamflow for forecast ranges of 1 5 days ahead the hec hms model was run as the benchmark model flows were simulated for six months from 2017 06 01 to 2017 12 31 on a daily time step the simulation was limited to only six months because the observed flow data were available only up to 31 december 2017 global deterministic prediction system gdps meteorological forecasts archived in canadian surface prediction archive caspar https caspar data ca were used to force the selected hydrological models gdps forecast weather variables are available in daily time step and therefore daily time streamflow simulations for up to five days ahead were generated using selected hydrologic models forecasted gdps meteorological data precipitation and temperature were assessed before forcing the hydrological models to verify the quality of archived meteorological data this assessment was performed using observed precipitation and temperature for two years from 2017 06 01 to 2019 06 01 recorded at st john s intl a and st john s west climate ec weather station in st john s nl the evaluation was performed by first overlying observation gauge points on gdps forecast grids and then by comparing corresponding gdps pixel value with the observed gauge value to evaluate the quality of forecast meteorological data the correlation coefficient and rmse were chosen as shown in table 4 average forecast weather variables corresponding to st john s intl a and st john s west climate ec weather stations were used as input for hydrologic model runs the statistics show that the temperature forecasts for the study area performed well and better than precipitation forecasts table 4 for the precipitation correlation is significant for short lead times on the other hand temperature shows a significant correlation for all lead times up to 5 days ahead in both cases performance decreases with increasing lead time rmse follows a similar pattern as the correlation coefficient for both precipitation and temperature overall the results suggest that the gdps data perform well only for short lead times for precipitation while it performs well for longer lead times for temperature the results of the forecasting flow using sac sma gr4j and hec hms are presented in tables 5 7 respectively both sac sma and gr4j models perform reasonably well for up to 1 3 day ahead forecasts the agreement between observed and simulated flows in both the rising limbs and the falling limbs of the hydrographs fig 7 is more accurate for both sac sma and gr4j models for one day ahead forecasts the benchmark model hec hms does not perform equally well for all flows when compared to the sac sma and gr4j models the hec hms model performs relatively well for the peak flows as the sac sma and gr4j models fig 7 as expected based on the forecast evaluation results the performance decreases with increasing lead time fig 7 the average time of concentration of the watershed was calculated to be about 10 8 h smith 1988 gdps daily forecasts are released in 6 h intervals a day time of 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 therefore daily streamflow forecasts using hydrological models can be issued in 6 h time intervals hence the methods used in this study can capture most of the peaks adequately 6 conclusions from the results presented in this paper it can be concluded that all five models are capable of simulating streamflow reasonably well the sac sma and gr4j models perform equally well and perform better than the other three models in both calibration and validation periods for all low medium and peak flows the sac sma and gr4j models generally perform better for peak flows followed by hec hms the watflood and mac hbv models perform better in simulating low flows but underpredict high flows the results from the statistics hydrographs scatter plots and taylor diagrams indicate that the best performing models are sac sma and gr4j followed by hec hms forecasting model runs using gdps meteorological forecasts have been verified by their accuracy in forecasting the observed streamflow in the waterford river watershed if a single model to be used for forecasting the gr4j model can be recommended relatively smaller basin size less input data requirement efficiency in computational timing freely available r package makes gr4j as the best model to be used in operational flood forecasting in the waterford river basin in st john s nl however due to the good performance of all five models an ensemble streamflow forecast using continuous multiple hydrological models for operational forecasting is also recommended the resultant flows for hydrological models can be used as forcing data for existing hydraulic models at wrmd to produce user friendly flood risk maps to be delivered via social media to the public the use of existing knowledge gathered through a long time of hands on experience of forecasters along with hydrological and hydraulic model runs will produce more accurate operational flood forecasting for st john s nl funding this work was funded by the natural science and engineering research council nserc canadian

8384,study region southeastern united states study focus the objective was to evaluate the ability of two modified scs cn models to predict direct runoff dro and peak discharge rate qp for selected storm events in three forested watersheds in the region one low gradient system in south carolina two high gradient upland systems in north carolina and a mid gradient upland system in arkansas new hydrological insights for the region the calculated peak discharge rate qp values by all methods were unsatisfactory when using the default pond and swamp adjustment factor fp value of 0 72 recommended in the scs tr55 guideline indicating that use of the default fp value may result in erroneous qp estimates for forest watersheds with high retention capacities these findings indicating the superiority of the modified sahu mishra eldo sme m method to the original scs method in runoff calculations and substantially lower fp values in the associated qp method are significant for hydrologists and engineers who frequently apply the methods in design of storm water management structures including road culverts on forested landscapes keywords antecedent moisture condition fp factor sme m method tr 55 procedure 1 introduction an accurate method for quantifying the direct runoff volume and peak discharge rate from ungauged catchments is becoming increasingly important to better understand how land use change affects water balance stormwater management and downstream water quality and ecosystem functions and services lockaby et al 2011 o driscoll et al 2010 walsh et al 2016 accordingly there are many different rainfall runoff models in the literature available for application in various types of landscapes blair et al 2012 day and bremer 2013 epps et al 2013a goodrow 2009 hec 2015 walega and salata 2019 the direct runoff obtained as a balance of precipitation interception infiltration surface retention and evapotranspiration et is one of the outputs of some hydrological models arnold and gibbons 1998 banasik et al 2014 bedient et al 2013 along with each site s stormwater management design practices the catchment hydrological processes can generally be modeled by using topography land cover soil parameters and rainfall characteristics all potentially affecting direct runoff generation vaezi 2014 the soil conservation service now natural resources conservation service nrcs curve number scs cn method epps et al 2013a usda 1986 is a widely accepted method for estimating watershed runoff as a response to rainfall the scs cn is a storm event based lumped model that uses empirical data to estimate direct runoff volume from a given storm rainfall amount ponce 1989 ponce and hawkins 1996 usda 2004 this model has been used since 1970s around the world because it is computationally user friendly with easily available required inputs that relate runoff to the soil type land cover land use and hydrological conditions the scs cn method estimates direct event runoff for a rainfall amount of known quantity using a cn value obtained from catchment characteristics and antecedent rainfall 5 days prior to the event the cn values for an ungauged catchment are derived from lookup tables based on the soil hydrologic group a function of soil type and land cover and land use and antecedent moisture condition amc cunha et al 2010 maidment 1993 mishra et al 2013 usda 1986 woodward et al 2003 numerous studies have shown that cn values either theoretical or those obtained using the scs cn guidelines can be substantially different from empirically calculated values using observed rainfall runoff events banasik and woodward 2010 ebrahimian et al 2012 epps et al 2013a king and balogh 2008 soulis and valiantzas 2013 walega and salata 2019 warranting a need for their improvement caviedes voullième et al 2012 ponce and hawkins 1996 walega et al 2015 walega and rutkowska 2015 including in the application for events with less than a 24 h duration meadows 2016 one of the greatest weaknesses of the original scs cn method for deriving single direct runoff is a missing explicit dependency between the initial abstraction and the amc sahu et al 2012 initial abstraction is all losses including water stored in surface depressions vegetation canopy interception and evaporation and infiltration usda 1986 before the runoff begins berni et al 2008 stated runoff depth estimates using a distributed cn are as much as 100 higher than that obtained considering a uniform cn underestimation of runoff depth due to cn compositing is most severe for wide cn ranges low cn values and low precipitation depths woodward et al 2010 and meadows 2016 stated that the scs cn method was not applicable at time resolutions smaller than 24 hr according to hawkins 1993 the scs cn calculated runoff was much more sensitive to the value of cn chosen than it was to rainfall amounts in addition it is also not as easy to accurately select cn values from available literature one of the large uncertainties results from a consistent decline in storm event cn values with increasing rainfall amount this is mainly attributed to the discounting of the temporal variation in rainfall and runoff process ponce and hawkins 1996 bartlett et al 2016 introduced a revised scs cn method by incorporating a spatial description of runoff that includes the source areas of runoff and the probability distribution functions characterizing the runoff variability besides variable watershed moisture conditions the higher abundance of precipitation also affects the cn parameter unfortunately engineers designers and land managers still use the original scs cn method in their hydrological design and analyses which can potentially lead to unreliable results of actual flood parameters furthermore calculated direct runoff depths are also often used in empirical formulas estimating the storm event based or design peak discharge rates that are frequently used in the design of transportation and water management infrastructures the reliability and appropriate method of such peak discharge formulas besides other factors are increasingly becoming a concern in economic and risk analyses of such structures in the face of growing extreme precipitation events in recent years thus first potential discrepancies in direct runoff depths using the classic scs cn methods have direct consequences in peak discharge estimates therefore it is becoming critical to validate the the scs cn method for range of hydro climatic conditions before promoting its wide application in engineering practice to reduce the modeling uncertainty and predictions secondly peak discharge formulas generally use the maximum 24 h design rainfall for a given frequency published in the literature for a given locality within a region usda 1986 bonnin et al 2006 also scs cn is simply empirical model that does not included factors that potentially influence on outflow like topography and infiltration processes that means the method is not as appropriate for estimating the incremental rainfall excess during a storm event grimaldi et al 2013 grimaldi and petroselli 2014 literature based cn values are most successfully applied for traditional agricultural watersheds less successfully for semiarid rangelands and least successfully for forest watersheds epps et al 2013a tedela et al 2012 also emphasized that the methods are still weak and have large uncertainties for application in forested landscapes with complex soil land cover and topographic conditions amatya and jha 2011 used a swat model and adjusted cn values to calibrate the stream flow for a large forested watershed the only other study the authors are aware of that evaluates the scs cn method for forested conditions was conducted by tedela et al 2012 but that study was limited to upland high gradient watersheds in the northeastern united states and did not include any modifications of the original scs cn method the main objectives of this study were a to evaluate the usefulness of two modified scs cn methods and identify the most accurate method for determining the direct runoff for upland and lowland forested watersheds and b to modify the scs tr55 based graphical peak discharge method by applying calculated event runoff using the modified scs cn method for both upland and lowland forested watersheds the following hypotheses were tested 1 the original scs cn underestimates direct runofffrom small forested watersheds 2 modified sahu mishra eldo sme method sme m is expected to provide more accurate results than the original scs cn method for direct runofffrom forested watersheds 3 use of the sme m method for assessing direct runoffincreases the precision of calculated peak flow rate using the scs tr55 method 4 finally the pond and swamp adjustment factor fp factor in the graphical peak discharge method has lower values for forested watersheds than were recommended in the original formula and is a function of the event precipitation the calibrated peak discharge method was then applied to assess the design peak discharges using the 24 h design rainfall intensity following the bonnin et al 2006 for various return periods for all the study sites this work was carried out to compliment the study by tian et al 2019 who assessed various widely used methods of computing design discharges except the scs cn based methods using both the on site long term rainfall and flow data based and noaa based precipitation intensity duration frequency for application in design of forest road cross drainage structures at the same study sites 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted using data from three usda forest service long term experimental forest sites in distinct physiographic regions of the southeast a low gradient coastal watershed in south carolina sc a high gradient mountainous watershed in north carolina nc and a lower relief mountain type watershed in arkansas ar fig 1 2 1 1 coweeta watershed ws14 nc the coweeta hydrologic laboratory chl is located in western north carolina 35 05 n 83 43 w and is representative of southern appalachian mixed deciduous hardwoods streamflow records in the 61 ha reference ws14 fig 1 began in 1936 and the watershed has been used as a reference for paired watershed experiments dating back to the 1950s ws14 was selectively harvested in the early 1920s prior to the establishment of the chl douglass and hoover 1988 but has been unmanaged since that time elevation in the nw facing ws14 ranges from 701 to 1007 m mean 872 m with mean slopes of 50 sixty nine percent of the watershed consists of soils of hydrologic soil group b and 22 group c with the balance consisting of rock outcrop the annual precipitation and temperature average 1847 mm and 12 9 c respectively based on the data from the main climate station at the site additional information about the watershed characteristics are given in table 1 2 1 2 santee watershed ws80 sc the second study site watershed 80 ws80 is a 1st order headwater stream that drains to huger creek a tributary of east branch of cooper river and then drains further downstream to charleston harbor fig 1 the site is located at the usda forest service santee experimental forest 33 15 n 79 8 w which is about 60 km from the city of charleston sc this long term experimental forest watershed the control in a paired system had an initial drainage area of 206 ha that was reduced to 160 ha in 2001 the watershed is characterized by low gradient topography less than three percent slope and shallow water table conditions harder et al 2007 the watershed is currently comprised of about 70 mixed pine and hardwood stands and 30 forested wetland ws80 has poorly drained soils dominated by the wahee type with a high field capacity and lower permeability than sandy soils harder et al 2007 the long term mean rainfall and temperature of the site are 1370 mm and 18 3 c respectively dai et al 2013 rainfall has been continuously measured using an automatic gauge backed up by a manual gauge in the middle of the watershed the streamflow rates have been computed using a continuously measured stage height and an equation for a compound v notch weir installed at the watershed outlet fig 1 the hydrologic water balance characteristics of storm event hydrology and long term flow dynamics of this site have been described by amatya et al 2016 epps et al 2013b and harder et al 2007 2 1 3 alum creek watershed ac11 ar the 4 9 ha ac11 watershed is located in the ouachita mountains of central arkansas and is part of the usda forest service alum creek experimental forest fig 1 the ouachita mountains have a humid subtropical climate with hot summers relatively mild winters and year round precipitation mean annual temperatures in the area range from 1 to 34 c while mean annual precipitation is 1321 mm and occurs predominantly as rain the ac11 watershed has a mostly nw aspect with a maximum elevation just over 380 m slope gradients typically between 15 and 35 and an overall relief of 51 8 m the underlying bedrock is comprised of intermixed paleozoic sandstone and shale formations which are highly folded and faulted the drainage pattern is dendritic soils are hapludults in the pirum townley or carnasaw series these soils are typically well drained shallow 1 m gravelly to stony silt loams the watershed is covered by a mixed pine hardwood forest with shortleaf pine pinus echinata a variety of oaks quercus spp and sweetgum liquidambar styraciflua as the dominant overstory species overstory age ranges from 60 to 100 years streamflow is mostly continuous during the winter and spring but becomes sporadic during the summer and fall a streamflow gauging station was operated at the ac11 outlet from 1979 through 2016 streamflow was measured using a 0 9 m h flume and water elevations were recorded on either charts or digital data recorders no timber harvesting has occurred since the alum creek experimental forest was established in 1959 and there is little evidence of harvesting before 1907 08 when the ouachita national forest was created this basin has served as a control in past studies evaluating the effects of timber harvesting on streamflow quantity and quality miller et al 1985 1988 2 2 storm event data approximately five medium to large storm events event rainfall amount of 12 5 mm half inch or higher were identified from each of the five years 2011 15 of storm event data recorded at each of the above forested watersheds the data consisted of rainfall amount and corresponding estimated stormflow volume peak flow rate and baseflow volume for each event obtained using hydrograph separation techniques of hibbert and cunningham 1966 with a linear recess function for upland coweeta and alum creek watersheds and epps et al 2013b with an exponential recess for the low gradient santee watershed hourly precipitation data from 2011 to 2015 from a nearby rain gage at each site was used to analyze the flow hydrograph as a response of the storm event and its characteristics we used 36 observed rainfall runoff events for w80 watershed 27 for ws14 and 19 for ac11 watersheds in the analysis time resolution for measured flow rates was equal to 10 min for both the ws80 and ac11 and 5 min for the ws14 direct outflow was separated from base flow using a straight line where beginning was start of rising limb and end was identified as an inflection point on recession limb of the storm runoff hydrograph time step for rainfall data measured using an automatic tipping bucket rain gauge with instantaneous tips to obtain the total rainfall of each storm event was assumed adequate for small forested watershed with mild slope the simulation time steps assumed in conceptual hydrological models depend on the dynamics of the output it is clear that watershed filtering the high frequencies of the input signal rainfall and those of the processes related to production of rainfall excess in the watershed is lagged and outflow can be assumed with longer time resolution especially in case of forested watersheds generally with high retention the flow response of watershed to rainfall signal is generally lagged longer and thus the process dynamics is not so rapid like in watershed with small retention capacity other data describing basin characteristics including area aspect basin and channel slopes elevation maximum and lowest at the outlet hydrologic soil group type for the given soil main stream length land use percent wetland area if any and calculated time of concentration for each of the study watersheds were computed in a geographical information system table 1 2 3 computations of scs 1986 and empirical curve numbers a general form of the scs cn model usda 1986 is expressed by the following equations 1 q p i a 2 p i a s i f p i a 2 q 0 otherwise 3 i a λ s where q is direct runoff note that direct runoff is total event direct runoff volume mm p is cumulative precipitation for event mm ia is initial abstraction mm s is potential maximum retention mm and λ is the initial abstraction coefficient dimensionless the parameter s is expressed as 4 s 25400 c n 254 where s is in mm and cn is the curve number which depends on the soil type land cover and land use hydrological conditions and antecedent moisture condition amc obtained from the scs usda 1986 according to usda 2004 hydrologic condition is based on combinations of factors that affect infiltration and runoff including a density and canopy of vegetative areas b amount of year round cover c amount of grass or close seeded legumes d percent of residue cover on the land surface good 20 and e degree of surface toughness in the next step empirical curve number cnemp values were determined for each storm event measured on each investigated watershed using the recorded rainfall runoff p q events based on the formula below developed by deshmukh et al 2013 where p and q represent the rainfall and runoff amounts for each event 5 c n e m p 25400 254 s e m p the empirical value of potential maximum retention semp was calculated using the equation provided by chen 1982 6 s e m p p λ 1 λ q 1 λ 2 q 2 4 λ p q 2 λ 2 the measured p and q values for each watershed were sorted separately and realigned on a rank order basis to form p q pairs of equal return periods hawkins 1993 next the measured p q data were transformed into the equivalent p cnemp the cn parameter was determined as a function of precipitation depth using the standard asymptote model described by hawkins 1993 and summarized by the formula 7 c n p 1 c n 100 c n e x p k p where cn is constant value approached as p k is a constant obtained by fitting asymptotic function to observed p q pairs then the arithmetic mean median and geometric mean of cnemp was calculated for each watershed the standard asymptotic model was used in describing the p q pair relationship with two individual variants of λ parameter 0 2 for standard value and 0 05 as recommended elsewhere in the literature blair et al 2012 curve number calculated based on observed rainfall runoff events eq 5 cn according to usda 2004 and empirical cn form asymptotic curve eq 7 were used in further calculation of direct runoff according to the method described in section 2 4 paragraph 2 4 methods for calculation of direct runoff q estimates of direct runoff q are then calculated using each of the following methods 1 original scs cn method usda 2004 2 mishra singh model ms model mishra and singh 2002 and 3 the modified sme model sme m walega and salata 2019 2 4 1 mishra singh ms model mishra and singh 2002 modified the original scs cn method in eq 1 to include a measure of antecedent moisture m 8 q p i a p i a m p i a m s where m is the antecedent moisture mm 9 m 0 5 1 λ s 1 λ 2 s 2 4 p 5 s here ia and λ are the same as in eqs 1 and 2 and p5 is the amount of antecedent 5 day rainfall eq 9 represents the amount of moisture added to the dry soil profile by rain p5 walega et al 2016 2 4 2 modified sahu mishra eldo sme model sme m the sme model sahu et al 2012 uses a more continuous expression for estimating antecedent moisture and allows for optimization of the absolute maximum retention capacity and thus uses a constant quantity for a specific watershed sahu et al 2010 2012 allowed for antecedent moisture in their calculations of the direct runoff in this model the authors introduced the s0 parameter which is the absolute maximum retention capacity and m is the antecedent moisture that is assumed to be a fraction β of the amount of moisture water infiltrated during the antecedent period depending on the 5 day antecedent rainfall amount p5 this assumption is based on the fact that only a fractionof the rainfall added to the soil profile will contribute to m because of evapotranspiration drainage and other losses during the antecedent 5 day period according to sahu et al 2012 and the sme method s0 is the potential maximum retention in completely dry conditions and is independent of the antecedent moisture and fully depends on catchment characteristics recently walega and salata 2019 further modified the 3 parameter sme model sme m to calculate direct runoff using just a 2 parameter equation 10 q p i a p i a m p i a s i f p i a 11 q 0 otherwise 12 i a λ s m where s is the maximum retention capacity replacing the s0 of the sme method obtained in the second stage in eq 12 the higher the antecedent moisture m the lower the initial abstraction ia and vice versa the antecedent moisture is given as 13 m β p 5 λ s s p 5 λ s s f o r p 5 λ s 14 m 0 for p5 λs where β is the parameter to be optimized and the parameter λ is equal to 0 20 as in the first stage the parameter β is a part of the 5 day rainfall that is intercepted this parameter was calibrated base on the observed rainfall runoff events the main difference between the original sme and the proposed modified sme m method is the way the parameter s is calibrated in the original method s0 was assumed to be the parameter functionally related to the catchment characteristics a different approach is adopted in the sme m method by walega and salata 2019 when the scs cn and sme method are combined s0 is substituted with the maximum potential retention s established from eq 4 the scs cn method is also widely used in arid and semi arid regions bo et al 2011 rawat and singh 2017 it was assumed that in moderate climate catchments which are rather rich in moisture such as those investigated and described in this paper the absolute maximum retention values higher than s are not typical of catchments in the southeastern us region therefore the original parameter s0 was substituted for with s moreover according to sahu et al 2010 the values of s0 may be equal to or higher than s therefore the authors adopted the less desirable variant s0 s in this work the positive difference between s0 and s s is equal to or higher than s0 determined that model generates lower rainfall losses and higher runoff values when compared to the original sme method values s0 and s have a constant quantity for a given watershed 2 5 assessment of peak discharge rate for determining the peak discharge of storm events with different return periods the simpler usda tr55 procedure usda 1986 based graphical peak discharge method was used instead of the model that uses a unit hydrograph method and was employed by blair et al 2012 based on time and discharge ratios developed by the usda 2007 the tr55 graphical peak discharge equation for a storm event is given by 15 q p q u a m q f p where qp peak discharge cfs qu unit peak discharge csm in which is a function of time of concentration tc and ia p ratio am drainage area mi2 q runoff in and fp pond and swamp adjustment factor in the usda 2007 method qu is represented by prf a q tp where prf is the peak rate factor defined as a ratio of recession and peaking limbs of the hydrograph and depends upon terrain gradient and catchment imperviousness a is the watershed area and tp is time to peak of the hydrograph blair et al 2012 used a lower value of prf 200 as a suitable number for the low gradient southeastern coastal plain landscape that is characteristic of higher ratio of recession to peak hydrograph instead of the default value of 484 recommended by nrcs for the upland sites potentially with lower recession to peak ratios next q was calculated using the original scs cn method and also the sme m method unit peak discharge qu was determined assuming a type ii rainfall distribution for all the three study sites and using corresponding calculated tc and ia p coefficients for each study site from exhibit4 ii chart usda 1986 in case of the observed rainfall events the p value is the cumulative rainfall for the event and 24 hr maximum rainfall from noaa atlas 14 bonnin et al 2006 for design rainfall events in the final step design peak discharge for each return period was calculated from eq 15 an fp value equal to 0 72 for five percent of swamp and pond areas was recommended by the usda likely for agricultural settings 1986 but for these forest watershed study sites the authors examined the land cover using available high resolution spatial data to estimate the percentage of wetlands and accurately estimate the value of fp by using it as a calibration factor the rest of the parameters were held constant and were not calibrated for example for each rainfall event and q assessed based on the method described above qp was calculated for different fp values then the values of fp were optimized using the solver tools available in excel ms excel 2013 the nonlinear algorithm option was chosen to find an optimal value of fp for each event based on the comparisons of predicted direct runoff values using each of the three cn models with the observed runoff data for each of the three forested watershed study sites the most accurate method for each watershed was selected using the model

partial series based design storm events data instead of just 24 hr maximum with a precipitation raster development process employed by the prism mean annual precipitation daly et al 2008 peak discharge rates for each design frequency were assessed according to the tr55 eq 15 and direct runoff was calculated according to the modified sme model fp values were obtained from the equation shown in fig 6 because the peak discharges calculated using the tr55 method with the direct runoff obtained from the modified sme model were found to be more accurate fig 5 then these peak discharges were compared to the values that were calculated using the tr55 and direct runoff based on the original scs cn for amcii and fp 0 72 all calculations were performed for rainfall distribution type ii and with a cn for medium antecedent conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 the cnemp values versus cn according to usda 2004 based on 27 observed rainfall runoff event data for the high gradient mountainous coweeta watershed ws14 table 1 the empirical method using eq 5 yielded the mean median and geometric mean cnemp of 64 6 66 3 and 65 9 respectively these small differences in calculated mean and median cn values suggest that this cn parameter is stable and can probably be described by a normal distribution for this mountain watershed in other words stable conditions seem to exist for formation of direct outflow at this site that was potentially attributed to homogenous land cover and soil types these estimated values were slightly 7 10 higher than the cn value of 60 recommended by the original usda 2004 method for amcii given the site s land cover and soil characteristics it is possible that using the same default lower cn value from the usda 2004 is the reason tedela et al 2012 found only a marginal correlation between predicted flow and the observed data for mountainous ws36 and ws37 at coweeta not shown although a somewhat modest correlation ef 0 56 was found for coweeta ws28 similarly using the measured event rainfall runoff data for the low gradient coastal watershed ws80 the cnemp values were 66 3 60 1 and 65 8 respectively which were much lower than the cn value of 75 recommended by the usda 2004 for amcii and land cover and soil characteristics of the watershed based on their analysis of 23 storm events recorded from 2008 to 2011 epps et al 2013a found a mean value of 70 also lower than that from the usda 2004 in their simulation study using a swat model for a 52 km2 forest watershed nearby the ws80 watershed amatya and jha 2011 reduced the cnii values for all the hydrologic response units hru obtained by using the usda 2004 method based on given land cover and soil type by 10 as a part of calibration of the predicted daily streamflow with the measured data on the other hand for the observed rainfall runoff events on the ac11 watershed in arkansas the computed mean median and geometric mean of the cnemp values were 79 1 80 7 and 81 9 respectively higher than the cn value of 70 recommended by the usda 2004 for amcii and the site s land cover and soil characteristics the results showed that compared to the measured data based empirical values the nrcs based method seems to underestimate the cn value and runoff for upland sites like coweeta and alum creek and overestimate cn and runoff for lowland sites like the ws80 watershed tedela et al 2012 noted that when a tabulated nrcs curve number consistently underestimates runoff from an undeveloped forest the effect of urbanization will be consistently overestimated causing drainage to be overdesigned potentially wasting resources unnecessarily the authors also noted that the causes of inaccurate runoff estimates established by using tabulated curve numbers in 10 forested watersheds in the northeastern united states are unclear the original information used to estimate the tabulated curve numbers for forested areas is no longer available hawkins et al 2009 the authors ruled out errors in selection of the soil hydrologic group and hydrologic conditions as potential contributors to the discrepancies they observed between the observed and tabulated cn values in their study this demonstrates a need for further studies into the calculation of direct runoff using other forms of the modified scs cn method assessment of cn for storm events resulting from increased magnitude of intense precipitation was also investigated using p cnemp relationship to address uncertainties in predictions analysis for 27 rainfall runoff episodes at the coweeta watershed were performed with an initial abstraction coefficient of λ 0 20 from fig 2 it is evident that empirical plot of p cnemp data are closely located to the theoretical curve according to standard behavior so the model correctly approximated the empirical data for λ 0 20 it can also be observed from the relationship that an increasing p is accompanied by a reduction in cnemp however clear stabilization of cn with an asymptotic behavior at higher rainfalls as described by other authors banasik et al 2014 banasik and woodward 2010 king and balogh 2008 was not observed cn would possibly have been stabilized for event rainfall amount exceeding maximum observed equal to 102 3 mm which was not observed during the study period similar relationships were found in the watersheds of southern poland that measured between 25 and almost 55 ha kowalik and walega 2015 it has been suggested that the decrease in cnemp with increasing p might be a result of different runoff triggering mechanisms such as rapid subsurface flow due to macropores in the matured forest stands as was noted recently by skaggs et al 2019 for matured managed pine stands in coastal nc in addition even small precipitation falling directly on the streams and shallow subsurface flow from near stream riparian areas also contribute to rapid flow response similar to variable source area concept szymczak and krężałek 2018 resulting in higher curve numbers for small events larger events would have these mechanisms as well but these would be overshadowed by the larger and delayed contribution from areas outside the riparian zone resulting in a lower curve number for larger events as a result small precipitation events are associated with high cnemp values although seasonal antecedent conditions generally during wet winters with low et demands prior to the precipitation event may also cause this using eq 7 and the observed data the p cnobs relationship resulted in the following 18 c n p 49 3 100 49 3 exp p 435 6 the analysis revealed improved model accuracy for λ 0 20 with an rmse equal to 0 84 mm and ef 0 99 when compared to results from the standard cn method in the coweeta watershed the value of cn 49 3 was lower than the cntheor determined for amcii these results clearly indicate that measures should be taken to accurately determine the actual soil moisture when using the original scs cn method as this parameter is crucial for calculating the amount of the direct runoff in practice cn for amcii generally assumes soil moisture for normal conditions which often leads to underestimation of the catchment runoff similar results were observed by tedela et al 2012 for small forested watersheds in the mountains of the eastern united states for coweeta watersheds 2 28 36 and 37 tabulated cn was 55 for amcii but mean median geometric mean and cn varied between 58 and 75 3 for λ 0 05 a stable p cnemp relationship was found for precipitation above 70 mm the cnemp for higher precipitation was 49 3 in contrast to the coweeta watershed the standard asymptote model fairly approximated the empirical data for the ws80 watershed and λ 0 20 fig 3 the cnemp is almost a flat straight line indicating absolutely no influence of p on the cn value this is likely due to higher soil water retention capacity and et rates of ws80 when compared to the high gradient coweeta watershed which could potentially store a higher amount of precipitation in the soil profile this observation is consistent with tedela et al 2012 who found substantially smaller curve numbers for the low to mid elevation watersheds 2 and 28 at their coweeta site compared to the two higher elevation watersheds 36 and 37 the authors attributed these large differences in hydrologic responses to the physical differences between the watersheds i e soil depth and annual et that were much larger on the lower elevation watersheds swift et al 1988 sun et al 2002 and increased the potential for soil moisture storage and controlling subsurface flow during storm events hibbert and troendle 1988 hewlett and hibbert 1966 a better approximation of the p cn relationship was achieved for the initial abstraction λ 0 05 fig 3 which is consistent with blair et al 2012 who based on a recent reevaluation of the ratio by nrcs found that 0 05 ﬁts better than 0 2 as a default value requiring a change in conversion of s and cn values woodward et al 2010 this relationship with λ 0 05 shows a violent behavior which is opposite of that noted by hawkins 1993 who showed a decreasing cn for increasing p values as was observed for the coweeta site in fig 2 above the violent behavior in this case shows increasing cn value with increasing p likely due to decreasing soil capacity this result showed that in watershed ws80 which has a lower permeability due to a restrictive clayey layer than sandy soils the runoff process is possibly influenced by other processes e g antecedent moisture condition shallow water tables as the key parameters controlling the storage available in these shallow poorly drained soils williams and amatya 2016 than in watersheds with better soil retention capacity these results are also consistent with earlier studies on event rainfall runoff relationships and their association with curve number at ws80 for example la torre torres et al 2011 also found a poor relationship with large seasonal variability between event runoff and rainfall potentially due to the differences in forest et that might have affected seasonal soil moisture conditions and a slightly better relationship for wet winter periods with relatively lower soil water storage and et demands the authors suggested that soil water status i e antecedent soil moisture and groundwater table level is important to consider in addition to the rainfall and seasonal runoff generation in the coastal plain region with shallow soil argillic horizons accordingly epps et al 2013a noted that runoff generation from storm events on this watershed ws80 were strongly related to water table elevation where seasonally variable et based wet and dry moisture conditions persist their results show improvement in ﬂow predictions using cns adjusted for antecedent runoff conditions and based on water table position epps et al 2013b these analyses then resulted in the following p cnobs relationship as the violent model described by hawkins 1993 19 c n p 55 4 1 e x p 0 029 p the cn 55 4 value from the violent behavior is similar to the values obtained by tedela et al 2012 for the same conditions based on the computed rmse value of 3 40 mm and ef 0 63 for λ 0 05 this model was deemed unsatisfactory the model performance was even worse for λ 0 20 based on the calculated ef value of only 0 03 although the rmse value of 2 03 mm was slightly lower interestingly the hawkins model was able to successfully approximate the cnemp and p relationship for the ac11 watershed in arkansas for λ 0 20 fig 4 the relationship shows that as p increases the calculated cn value decreases asymptotically likely due to reasons similar to those suggested previously for the upland coweeta watershed fig 4 also shows that the cn value has a tendency to stabilize at p 35 mm the stable cn of 79 3 for this p value and λ 0 20 is similar to the mean value 79 1 from all events and is close to the cn value of 85 for amciii usda 2004 in case of λ 0 05 with lower initial abstraction this tendency is clearly visible with increasing cn with p due to higher soil moisture the analyses were then used to develop a p cnemp relationship for λ 0 20 using the standard model described as follows 20 c n p 79 3 100 79 3 exp p 10 748 the corresponding calculated rmse was equal to 0 98 mm and ef 0 65 the worst approximation of p cn was obtained for λ 0 05 with the calculated rmse and ef values of 2 41 mm and 0 04 respectively indicating that λ 0 20 is perhaps a better parameter than 0 05 for this mild gradient upland watershed 3 2 comparison of direct event outflow by three methods computed values of statistics for evaluation of the models are presented in table 2 in the table direct runoff from the scs cn method was not calculated for observed events because all parameters like cn and s were estimated empirically e g cn was calculated based on soil hydrologic group and land cover whereas in the ms and original sme models parameters like s lambda and beta were calibrated accordingly the ms and sme m models were shown to perform almost the same like the original following ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 criteria if parameters were calibrated based on observed rainfall runoff events for the coweeta and ac11 high gradient watersheds in the case of the coweeta watershed if the cn was assessed based on the hawkins standard model instead of the usda model 2004 results of direct runoff were better but still unsatisfactory because the modified sme m model yielded the ef of 0 44 and rmse of 1 68 mm followed by the ms model which performed more poorly with an ef 0 41 and rmse 1 72 mm when the cn assessment was done using the usda tables usda 2004 and the amc was estimated based on the observed rainfall runoff events all models for coweeta watershed were rated as unsatisfactory table 2 for example the sme m model yielded an ef 0 27 and an rmse 1 91 mm although it was slightly better when compared to the results from the ms and scs method both of which performed similarly based on this analysis cnemp based on observed events is recommended for the assessment of direct runoff on coweeta watershed in nc in the case of ws80 in sc the ms and sme m model results were deemed unsatisfactory with the lowest quality performance following ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 quality criteria although parameters were calibrated based on the observed rainfall runoff events this was likely because the s parameter for ms and sme m was calibrated as independent parameter from the scs method in other words s was not linked with the scs method following the procedure described by sahu et al 2012 however when the amc was estimated based on observed rainfall runoff events results from all models were found to be satisfactory with the highest quality performance based on the same criteria prediction of the direct runoff from the ms model yielded the highest quality performance ef 0 79 rmse 7 21 mm followed by the modified sme sme m and scs method both of which provided similar results based on the calibration process the parameters of the ms method were obtained as s 458 8 mm and λ 0 01 and that for the sme model as so 482 2 mm and β 0 96 in case of ws80 direct runoff calculation using the scs ms and sme m method was not performed for the scenario with cn assessment by hawkins asymptotic curve because the curve was not approximated well by the p cnemp relationships fig 3 direct runoff estimated by all the models based on the observed rainfall runoff events for the ac11 watershed in arkansas were in good agreement with the measured data and acceptable based on the ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 quality criteria with the ms model yielding the highest quality ef 0 79 rmse 5 01 mm on the basis of the calibration process the parameters of the ms method were obtained as s 40 0 mm and λ 0 35 and the sme model yielded the parameters so 36 8 mm and β 0 25 when the cn assessment was done based on the usda tables usda 2004 and the amc estimated based on the observed rainfall runoff events the ms and sme models were found to be very good although the best results were achieved using the original scs cn method with an ef equal to 0 93 and the rmse 3 50 mm also when the cnemp was used for calculation all models yielded similar results when compared to the observed events generally for the moderate upland ac11 watershed in arkansas acceptable results of direct runoff calculations were achieved when the cn was assessed using the standard cn obtained from the usda table usda 2004 consistent with results obtained by walega and salata 2019 for a mountain catchment located in the southern part of poland the results demonstrated that in general the use of the modified sme cn instead of the original scs cn method provides a more accurate prediction of direct runoff in the study watersheds based on the computed model evaluation criteria table 2 the effects of the modified sme m method are compared to the original scs method on direct runoff calculation and presented in fig 5 as ratios versus the frequencies of design storms for the ws80 watershed direct runoff from the sme m model was smaller about 50 when compared to the scs cn method and the differences increased with increasing design storm frequency in the case of the ac11 watershed runoff from the scs method was slighty higher than the sme m method about 20 and the differences decreased for lower storm frequency for the ws14 watershed results of direct runoff were similar from w of the methods but differences between both method was higher than for w80 watershed 3 3 assessment of peak discharges using the tr55 method fig 6 shows the computed values of nash sutcliffe ef and root mean square error rmse of peak discharges calculated according to the usda 1986 tr55 method shown in eq 15 using the observed event data all calculations were performed first using fp 0 72 the default maximum retention value given in the tr55 method in fig 6 and then using the fp values obtained by calibration with observed events not shown the results showed that the calculated peak discharge qp for all methods was unsatisfactory when using the fp value of 0 72 recommended in tr55 usda 1986 with the large rmse values above 115 l s the highest rmse was obtained for the ws80 watershed 2000 l s the nash sutcliffe ef coefficients were below zero in most cases indicating that the use of a mean value is better than using the predicted values for this site with the largest drainage area 160 ha of all the sites as expected potentially due to more heterogeneity of soils and land cover than the two other smaller watersheds our results show the default fp value recommended in tr55 should not be used for these forested watersheds with high retention capacities somewhat enhanced results with an ef higher than 0 4 were obtained for calibrated fp values not shown it is interesting to note that the computed ef coefficients were found to be similar for both the scs cn and sme m models although slightly better results were obtained by using the sme m method for these forest watersheds with high retention capacity calibrated fp values were found to be lower than 0 40 when using all methods relationships between fp and p for each of the measured events on each study watershed are presented in fig 7 results show that the calibrated fp values vary from 0 41 to 0 062 for the coweeta watershed from 0 50 to 0 02 for ws80 and from 1 00 to 0 08 for ac11 fig 7 respectively in general the data showed a decreasing trend in fp when precipitation increased as a result the fitted relationship yielded a correlation coefficient of r 0 58 which is not too high but is statistically significant at α 0 05 and 0 01 however the large variability of observed data also shows that the fp perhaps is also influenced by other factors including antecedent soil moisture soil properties etc besides the event rainfall for example low rainfall amounts with high antecedent wet conditions may yield larger fp values perhaps due to reduced soil water storage in contrast to high rainfall amounts with high antecedent dry conditions which may yield smaller fp values due to large soil water storage as is shown by the fitted relationship this may indicate that the observed data in fig 7 might have been biased for those conditions this leads to another speculation that the fp may also be related to soil permeability as shown by watersheds ac11 hsg of c and ws80 hsg of d with low soil permeability tending to yield higher ranges of fp when compared to the low fp range values yielded by ws14 which had a dominant soil category b with higher permeability infiltration rates than either of the ac11 or ws80 thirdly a close examination of the data also tends to indicate that the fp factor may be related to watershed drainage area for example the smallest watershed ac11 yielded higher fp values than those for the ws80 and ws14 this seems plausible as the time of concentration of the smallest watershed ac11 would be the shortest potentially reducing residence time and for that matter retention of runoff and increasing peak flow rates last but not least it also seems that fp values could have been influenced by the duration of each rainfall event as shown in fig 8 although the correlation coefficient is rather low r 0 46 it is statistically significant for α 0 05 and 0 01 short duration rainfall events generally have high intensity potentially resulting in both reduced loss of precipitation to infiltration and retention of runoff than would have been observed for longer durations of rainfall the low intensity long duration rainfall influences soil saturation potentially recharging elevating ground water resulting in saturation excess flow with reduced runoff retention and thus yielding a higher fp value and peak flow rate in that context use of 24 hr duration rainfall much higher than the time of concentration for computing runoff for design storms may have also somewhat biased the peak discharge rates on these small watersheds when a variable fp for each event as a function of p fig 6 was used the estimates of peak discharges using the modified sme m model were in better agreement with the observed data in the case of the ws80 and ac11 watersheds the results were more satisfactory than those from coweeta which provided unacceptable results the rest of the methods usda and ms yielded poor results this study s results showed that for watersheds with the highest forest cover and a high soil capacity the fp value should be lower than is recommended in tr55 and should be changed for different precipitation levels lowering this fp value is consistent with blair et al 2012 who suggested that a peak rate factor of 200 is more representative than the default value of 484 recommended in the peak discharge method they used usda 2007 for the ﬂat terrain of the southeast coastal plain often called the low country the peak rate factor is a constant intended to reﬂect the slope of the watershed and ranges from 600 in steep areas to 100 in ﬂat swampy areas sheridan et al 2002 usda 2007 3 4 design discharge calculations design peak discharges calculated with tr55 method using the original scs cn and modified sme m based runoff volumes obtained from 24 h design storms for type ii design rainfall distribution as described above are presented in table 3 the results show that the design peak discharges obtained from the original tr55 procedure where the direct runoff was calculated using the scs cn method and a default fp parameter equal to 0 72 are higher than the modified sme m method for design storms by as much as eight or nine times for the ws80 and ws14 watershed generally higher differences were found for large design storms with lower frequencies like those occurring once in 50 or 100 yr frequencies one of the main reasons for this discrepancy is likely caused by the fp values which should be substantially less for flat watersheds with large soil water storage as noted above and also by blair et al 2012 for example smaller fp values were obtained for high intensity rainfall amounts for the low gradient ws80 watershed where such events generally occur during summer seasons when the soil water storage is generally high due to high evaporative demands of these forests fig 7 comparison of the results from fig 9 for peak discharges and fig 5 for volume of runoff clearly shows that peak discharge is mainly influenced by the fp parameter as the peak discharges obtained using the modified tr55 release are much less than that from the original tr55 the peak discharges are however independent of calculated differences observed in direct runoff volumes by the two methods for example even though there was only a 50 difference in runoff the sme method yielded as much as nine times smaller peak discharge levels than the scs for small size high frequency storms to 12 times smaller levels for the large size low frequency storms on the ws14 watershed these results clearly show that the empirical methods are sensitive to changes in their parameters and thus calibration processes is necessary such a calibration is possible in gauged watersheds with sufficient hydrometeorological data but in case of ungauged watersheds it is impossible or problematic calibrating these parameters in such circumstances rainfall runoff models based on unit hydrographs theory can be used the examples of these models are synthetic unit hydrograph as scs uh or snyder uh cupak and wałęga 2018 egiazarova et al 2017 gądek et al 2017 also geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph is commonly used to assess the direct hydrograph rodríguez iturbe and valdez 1979 in addition to address problems with application of the empirical models in ungauged watersheds the need arises to develop methods that are more objective for practical application reducing the subjectivity in design hydrograph estimation and in the consequent flood mapping event based approach for small and ungauged basins eba4sub rainfall runoff model is a framework that has been fully adapted for determining runoff in ungauged catchments eba4sub is based on geographic information systems and on the optimization of the topographic information contained in the digital elevation model dem and uses the same input data necessary to apply the well known rational formula petroselli and grimaldi 2018 piscopia et al 2015 alternate method of pidf calculation using the pdfs based method above analysis was conducted based on the pidf from the noaa atlas 14 that uses the 24 h maximum only rainfall intensity series however if the noaa s alternate partial frequency duration series based maximum intensity data stated earlier were used the range of the new pidf would have been somewhat larger table 4 than the 24 h design pidf values shown in table 3 in this study for example 24 h 100 yr p value of 219 2 mm is at the lower end of the range obtained below in table 4 for coweeta nc the 100 yr value of 231 6 mm for ws80 is even smaller than the lower range based on the new pidf table 4 same is true for alum creek we believe further analysis with these new pidf data is beyond our scope 4 summary and conclusions this study was conducted at three usda forest service long term experimental forest sites in distinct physiographic regions of the southeastern united states the low gradient coastal watershed in south carolina the high gradient mountainous watershed in north carolina and a lower relief mountain type watershed in arkansas the objectives of this work were divided into three parts first objective was to evaluate the performance of some of the modified scs cn methods and identify the most accurate method in determining the direct runoff the 2nd objective was to modify the scs tr55 based graphical peak discharge method first by applying calculated direct runoff using the most reliable modified scs cn method followed by evaluating the currently recommended default fp factor for both the upland and lowland forested watersheds the models including the scs cn model the mishra singh ms model and the sahu mishra eldho sme model modified earlier by walega and salata 2019 sme m model all modifications of the widely used scs cn method were evaluated using multi year 2011 2015 storm events 29 data from those study sites the results showed that compared to the empirical values the usda or scs based method underestimated the cnii value for the upland sites like coweeta and alum creek and overestimated the same value for the lowland ws80 watershed for upland watersheds however it was shown that the p cnemp relationship may be approximated by the model with a standard behavior as described by hawkins 1993 for the lowland ws80 watershed p cnemp did not show any visible trend for initial abstraction equal 0 20 however the initial abstraction 0 05 yielded a good relationship with a nash sutcliffe efficiency ef coefficient of 0 63 but was still deemed unsatisfactory warranting a need for further enhancement in parameters to accurately determine the actual soil moisture when using the original scs cn method direct runoff calculated using the modified sme m method was slightly in better agreement with the observed data than that from the ms and original scs cn methods for coweeta watershed but similar or slightly poorer than the ms or scs methods for ws80 and ac11 if cn was calculated based on usda 2004 or hawkins curve 1993 difference between the scs cn ms and sme m methods would not have been visible but slightly better results were achieved for the ms and sme m methods the modified sme m method included more complex information about soil conditions mainly the antecedent soil moisture than the original scs cn method and thus was expected to more precisely describe the runoff the sme m method has a low sensitivity to input parameters apart from rainfall walega and salata 2019 in case of peak discharges qp the results showed that the calculated qp for all methods was unsatisfactory when using the default fp value of 0 72 recommended by the tr55 guideline indicating that use of the default fp value may mislead the qp estimates for these forest watersheds with higher retention capacities better results with an ef higher than 0 4 were obtained for calibrated fp values the results of this study also showed that the fp is likely influenced by soil permeability in watersheds event rainfall and duration of rainfall furthermore the results also showed that the peak discharges obtained from the original tr55 procedure with the standard scs cn method and the default fp parameter value of 0 72 were higher than those obtained using the modified method with the sme m method based direct runoff and the fp value calibrated for individual events by 5 to almost 24 times for all study watersheds in addition some discrepancies of application of the tr55 peak discharge method on the large ws80 watershed may also have been due to its large size with more heterogeneous soils and land cover than two other smaller watersheds generally higher differences in design peak discharge estimates between the two methods were found for design rainfall events with lower frequencies e g 100 yr or 50 yr that are generally used in design of road culverts although some discrepancies might have also been due to potential errors in noaa design rainfall values derived by the interpolation methods only on the ac11 watershed difference between peak discharges was smallest for 2 year frequency this study indicates a need for further testing of the methods with additional forest watersheds with various catchment characteristics it also provides an opportunity to assess limitations and uncertainty among the widely used design discharge computation tools including the rational method that uses the design rainfall intensity and usgs regional flood frequency based regressions tian et al 2019 for the design of road cross drainage and other water management structures on these forested watersheds in the humid southeast us furthermore peak discharge analyses using the noaa s partial duration

storm events in three forested watersheds in the region one low gradient system in south carolina two high gradient upland systems in north carolina and a mid gradient upland system in arkansas new hydrological insights for the region the calculated peak discharge rate qp values by all methods were unsatisfactory when using the default pond and swamp adjustment factor fp value of 0 72 recommended in the scs tr55 guideline indicating that use of the default fp value may result in erroneous qp estimates for forest watersheds with high retention capacities these findings indicating the superiority of the modified sahu mishra eldo sme m method to the original scs method in runoff calculations and substantially lower fp values in the associated qp method are significant for hydrologists and engineers who frequently apply the methods in design of storm water management structures including road culverts on forested landscapes keywords antecedent moisture condition fp factor sme m method tr 55 procedure 1 introduction an accurate method for quantifying the direct runoff volume and peak discharge rate from ungauged catchments is becoming increasingly important to better understand how land use change affects water balance stormwater management and downstream water quality and ecosystem functions and services lockaby et al 2011 o driscoll et al 2010 walsh et al 2016 accordingly there are many different rainfall runoff models in the literature available for application in various types of landscapes blair et al 2012 day and bremer 2013 epps et al 2013a goodrow 2009 hec 2015 walega and salata 2019 the direct runoff obtained as a balance of precipitation interception infiltration surface retention and evapotranspiration et is one of the outputs of some hydrological models arnold and gibbons 1998 banasik et al 2014 bedient et al 2013 along with each site s stormwater management design practices the catchment hydrological processes can generally be modeled by using topography land cover soil parameters and rainfall characteristics all potentially affecting direct runoff generation vaezi 2014 the soil conservation service now natural resources conservation service nrcs curve number scs cn method epps et al 2013a usda 1986 is a widely accepted method for estimating watershed runoff as a response to rainfall the scs cn is a storm event based lumped model that uses empirical data to estimate direct runoff volume from a given storm rainfall amount ponce 1989 ponce and hawkins 1996 usda 2004 this model has been used since 1970s around the world because it is computationally user friendly with easily available required inputs that relate runoff to the soil type land cover land use and hydrological conditions the scs cn method estimates direct event runoff for a rainfall amount of known quantity using a cn value obtained from catchment characteristics and antecedent rainfall 5 days prior to the event the cn values for an ungauged catchment are derived from lookup tables based on the soil hydrologic group a function of soil type and land cover and land use and antecedent moisture condition amc cunha et al 2010 maidment 1993 mishra et al 2013 usda 1986 woodward et al 2003 numerous studies have shown that cn values either theoretical or those obtained using the scs cn guidelines can be substantially different from empirically calculated values using observed rainfall runoff events banasik and woodward 2010 ebrahimian et al 2012 epps et al 2013a king and balogh 2008 soulis and valiantzas 2013 walega and salata 2019 warranting a need for their improvement caviedes voullième et al 2012 ponce and hawkins 1996 walega et al 2015 walega and rutkowska 2015 including in the application for events with less than a 24 h duration meadows 2016 one of the greatest weaknesses of the original scs cn method for deriving single direct runoff is a missing explicit dependency between the initial abstraction and the amc sahu et al 2012 initial abstraction is all losses including water stored in surface depressions vegetation canopy interception and evaporation and infiltration usda 1986 before the runoff begins berni et al 2008 stated runoff depth estimates using a distributed cn are as much as 100 higher than that obtained considering a uniform cn underestimation of runoff depth due to cn compositing is most severe for wide cn ranges low cn values and low precipitation depths woodward et al 2010 and meadows 2016 stated that the scs cn method was not applicable at time resolutions smaller than 24 hr according to hawkins 1993 the scs cn calculated runoff was much more sensitive to the value of cn chosen than it was to rainfall amounts in addition it is also not as easy to accurately select cn values from available literature one of the large uncertainties results from a consistent decline in storm event cn values with increasing rainfall amount this is mainly attributed to the discounting of the temporal variation in rainfall and runoff process ponce and hawkins 1996 bartlett et al 2016 introduced a revised scs cn method by incorporating a spatial description of runoff that includes the source areas of runoff and the probability distribution functions characterizing the runoff variability besides variable watershed moisture conditions the higher abundance of precipitation also affects the cn parameter unfortunately engineers designers and land managers still use the original scs cn method in their hydrological design and analyses which can potentially lead to unreliable results of actual flood parameters furthermore calculated direct runoff depths are also often used in empirical formulas estimating the storm event based or design peak discharge rates that are frequently used in the design of transportation and water management infrastructures the reliability and appropriate method of such peak discharge formulas besides other factors are increasingly becoming a concern in economic and risk analyses of such structures in the face of growing extreme precipitation events in recent years thus first potential discrepancies in direct runoff depths using the classic scs cn methods have direct consequences in peak discharge estimates therefore it is becoming critical to validate the the scs cn method for range of hydro climatic conditions before promoting its wide application in engineering practice to reduce the modeling uncertainty and predictions secondly peak discharge formulas generally use the maximum 24 h design rainfall for a given frequency published in the literature for a given locality within a region usda 1986 bonnin et al 2006 also scs cn is simply empirical model that does not included factors that potentially influence on outflow like topography and infiltration processes that means the method is not as appropriate for estimating the incremental rainfall excess during a storm event grimaldi et al 2013 grimaldi and petroselli 2014 literature based cn values are most successfully applied for traditional agricultural watersheds less successfully for semiarid rangelands and least successfully for forest watersheds epps et al 2013a tedela et al 2012 also emphasized that the methods are still weak and have large uncertainties for application in forested landscapes with complex soil land cover and topographic conditions amatya and jha 2011 used a swat model and adjusted cn values to calibrate the stream flow for a large forested watershed the only other study the authors are aware of that evaluates the scs cn method for forested conditions was conducted by tedela et al 2012 but that study was limited to upland high gradient watersheds in the northeastern united states and did not include any modifications of the original scs cn method the main objectives of this study were a to evaluate the usefulness of two modified scs cn methods and identify the most accurate method for determining the direct runoff for upland and lowland forested watersheds and b to modify the scs tr55 based graphical peak discharge method by applying calculated event runoff using the modified scs cn method for both upland and lowland forested watersheds the following hypotheses were tested 1 the original scs cn underestimates direct runofffrom small forested watersheds 2 modified sahu mishra eldo sme method sme m is expected to provide more accurate results than the original scs cn method for direct runofffrom forested watersheds 3 use of the sme m method for assessing direct runoffincreases the precision of calculated peak flow rate using the scs tr55 method 4 finally the pond and swamp adjustment factor fp factor in the graphical peak discharge method has lower values for forested watersheds than were recommended in the original formula and is a function of the event precipitation the calibrated peak discharge method was then applied to assess the design peak discharges using the 24 h design rainfall intensity following the bonnin et al 2006 for various return periods for all the study sites this work was carried out to compliment the study by tian et al 2019 who assessed various widely used methods of computing design discharges except the scs cn based methods using both the on site long term rainfall and flow data based and noaa based precipitation intensity duration frequency for application in design of forest road cross drainage structures at the same study sites 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted using data from three usda forest service long term experimental forest sites in distinct physiographic regions of the southeast a low gradient coastal watershed in south carolina sc a high gradient mountainous watershed in north carolina nc and a lower relief mountain type watershed in arkansas ar fig 1 2 1 1 coweeta watershed ws14 nc the coweeta hydrologic laboratory chl is located in western north carolina 35 05 n 83 43 w and is representative of southern appalachian mixed deciduous hardwoods streamflow records in the 61 ha reference ws14 fig 1 began in 1936 and the watershed has been used as a reference for paired watershed experiments dating back to the 1950s ws14 was selectively harvested in the early 1920s prior to the establishment of the chl douglass and hoover 1988 but has been unmanaged since that time elevation in the nw facing ws14 ranges from 701 to 1007 m mean 872 m with mean slopes of 50 sixty nine percent of the watershed consists of soils of hydrologic soil group b and 22 group c with the balance consisting of rock outcrop the annual precipitation and temperature average 1847 mm and 12 9 c respectively based on the data from the main climate station at the site additional information about the watershed characteristics are given in table 1 2 1 2 santee watershed ws80 sc the second study site watershed 80 ws80 is a 1st order headwater stream that drains to huger creek a tributary of east branch of cooper river and then drains further downstream to charleston harbor fig 1 the site is located at the usda forest service santee experimental forest 33 15 n 79 8 w which is about 60 km from the city of charleston sc this long term experimental forest watershed the control in a paired system had an initial drainage area of 206 ha that was reduced to 160 ha in 2001 the watershed is characterized by low gradient topography less than three percent slope and shallow water table conditions harder et al 2007 the watershed is currently comprised of about 70 mixed pine and hardwood stands and 30 forested wetland ws80 has poorly drained soils dominated by the wahee type with a high field capacity and lower permeability than sandy soils harder et al 2007 the long term mean rainfall and temperature of the site are 1370 mm and 18 3 c respectively dai et al 2013 rainfall has been continuously measured using an automatic gauge backed up by a manual gauge in the middle of the watershed the streamflow rates have been computed using a continuously measured stage height and an equation for a compound v notch weir installed at the watershed outlet fig 1 the hydrologic water balance characteristics of storm event hydrology and long term flow dynamics of this site have been described by amatya et al 2016 epps et al 2013b and harder et al 2007 2 1 3 alum creek watershed ac11 ar the 4 9 ha ac11 watershed is located in the ouachita mountains of central arkansas and is part of the usda forest service alum creek experimental forest fig 1 the ouachita mountains have a humid subtropical climate with hot summers relatively mild winters and year round precipitation mean annual temperatures in the area range from 1 to 34 c while mean annual precipitation is 1321 mm and occurs predominantly as rain the ac11 watershed has a mostly nw aspect with a maximum elevation just over 380 m slope gradients typically between 15 and 35 and an overall relief of 51 8 m the underlying bedrock is comprised of intermixed paleozoic sandstone and shale formations which are highly folded and faulted the drainage pattern is dendritic soils are hapludults in the pirum townley or carnasaw series these soils are typically well drained shallow 1 m gravelly to stony silt loams the watershed is covered by a mixed pine hardwood forest with shortleaf pine pinus echinata a variety of oaks quercus spp and sweetgum liquidambar styraciflua as the dominant overstory species overstory age ranges from 60 to 100 years streamflow is mostly continuous during the winter and spring but becomes sporadic during the summer and fall a streamflow gauging station was operated at the ac11 outlet from 1979 through 2016 streamflow was measured using a 0 9 m h flume and water elevations were recorded on either charts or digital data recorders no timber harvesting has occurred since the alum creek experimental forest was established in 1959 and there is little evidence of harvesting before 1907 08 when the ouachita national forest was created this basin has served as a control in past studies evaluating the effects of timber harvesting on streamflow quantity and quality miller et al 1985 1988 2 2 storm event data approximately five medium to large storm events event rainfall amount of 12 5 mm half inch or higher were identified from each of the five years 2011 15 of storm event data recorded at each of the above forested watersheds the data consisted of rainfall amount and corresponding estimated stormflow volume peak flow rate and baseflow volume for each event obtained using hydrograph separation techniques of hibbert and cunningham 1966 with a linear recess function for upland coweeta and alum creek watersheds and epps et al 2013b with an exponential recess for the low gradient santee watershed hourly precipitation data from 2011 to 2015 from a nearby rain gage at each site was used to analyze the flow hydrograph as a response of the storm event and its characteristics we used 36 observed rainfall runoff events for w80 watershed 27 for ws14 and 19 for ac11 watersheds in the analysis time resolution for measured flow rates was equal to 10 min for both the ws80 and ac11 and 5 min for the ws14 direct outflow was separated from base flow using a straight line where beginning was start of rising limb and end was identified as an inflection point on recession limb of the storm runoff hydrograph time step for rainfall data measured using an automatic tipping bucket rain gauge with instantaneous tips to obtain the total rainfall of each storm event was assumed adequate for small forested watershed with mild slope the simulation time steps assumed in conceptual hydrological models depend on the dynamics of the output it is clear that watershed filtering the high frequencies of the input signal rainfall and those of the processes related to production of rainfall excess in the watershed is lagged and outflow can be assumed with longer time resolution especially in case of forested watersheds generally with high retention the flow response of watershed to rainfall signal is generally lagged longer and thus the process dynamics is not so rapid like in watershed with small retention capacity other data describing basin characteristics including area aspect basin and channel slopes elevation maximum and lowest at the outlet hydrologic soil group type for the given soil main stream length land use percent wetland area if any and calculated time of concentration for each of the study watersheds were computed in a geographical information system table 1 2 3 computations of scs 1986 and empirical curve numbers a general form of the scs cn model usda 1986 is expressed by the following equations 1 q p i a 2 p i a s i f p i a 2 q 0 otherwise 3 i a λ s where q is direct runoff note that direct runoff is total event direct runoff volume mm p is cumulative precipitation for event mm ia is initial abstraction mm s is potential maximum retention mm and λ is the initial abstraction coefficient dimensionless the parameter s is expressed as 4 s 25400 c n 254 where s is in mm and cn is the curve number which depends on the soil type land cover and land use hydrological conditions and antecedent moisture condition amc obtained from the scs usda 1986 according to usda 2004 hydrologic condition is based on combinations of factors that affect infiltration and runoff including a density and canopy of vegetative areas b amount of year round cover c amount of grass or close seeded legumes d percent of residue cover on the land surface good 20 and e degree of surface toughness in the next step empirical curve number cnemp values were determined for each storm event measured on each investigated watershed using the recorded rainfall runoff p q events based on the formula below developed by deshmukh et al 2013 where p and q represent the rainfall and runoff amounts for each event 5 c n e m p 25400 254 s e m p the empirical value of potential maximum retention semp was calculated using the equation provided by chen 1982 6 s e m p p λ 1 λ q 1 λ 2 q 2 4 λ p q 2 λ 2 the measured p and q values for each watershed were sorted separately and realigned on a rank order basis to form p q pairs of equal return periods hawkins 1993 next the measured p q data were transformed into the equivalent p cnemp the cn parameter was determined as a function of precipitation depth using the standard asymptote model described by hawkins 1993 and summarized by the formula 7 c n p 1 c n 100 c n e x p k p where cn is constant value approached as p k is a constant obtained by fitting asymptotic function to observed p q pairs then the arithmetic mean median and geometric mean of cnemp was calculated for each watershed the standard asymptotic model was used in describing the p q pair relationship with two individual variants of λ parameter 0 2 for standard value and 0 05 as recommended elsewhere in the literature blair et al 2012 curve number calculated based on observed rainfall runoff events eq 5 cn according to usda 2004 and empirical cn form asymptotic curve eq 7 were used in further calculation of direct runoff according to the method described in section 2 4 paragraph 2 4 methods for calculation of direct runoff q estimates of direct runoff q are then calculated using each of the following methods 1 original scs cn method usda 2004 2 mishra singh model ms model mishra and singh 2002 and 3 the modified sme model sme m walega and salata 2019 2 4 1 mishra singh ms model mishra and singh 2002 modified the original scs cn method in eq 1 to include a measure of antecedent moisture m 8 q p i a p i a m p i a m s where m is the antecedent moisture mm 9 m 0 5 1 λ s 1 λ 2 s 2 4 p 5 s here ia and λ are the same as in eqs 1 and 2 and p5 is the amount of antecedent 5 day rainfall eq 9 represents the amount of moisture added to the dry soil profile by rain p5 walega et al 2016 2 4 2 modified sahu mishra eldo sme model sme m the sme model sahu et al 2012 uses a more continuous expression for estimating antecedent moisture and allows for optimization of the absolute maximum retention capacity and thus uses a constant quantity for a specific watershed sahu et al 2010 2012 allowed for antecedent moisture in their calculations of the direct runoff in this model the authors introduced the s0 parameter which is the absolute maximum retention capacity and m is the antecedent moisture that is assumed to be a fraction β of the amount of moisture water infiltrated during the antecedent period depending on the 5 day antecedent rainfall amount p5 this assumption is based on the fact that only a fractionof the rainfall added to the soil profile will contribute to m because of evapotranspiration drainage and other losses during the antecedent 5 day period according to sahu et al 2012 and the sme method s0 is the potential maximum retention in completely dry conditions and is independent of the antecedent moisture and fully depends on catchment characteristics recently walega and salata 2019 further modified the 3 parameter sme model sme m to calculate direct runoff using just a 2 parameter equation 10 q p i a p i a m p i a s i f p i a 11 q 0 otherwise 12 i a λ s m where s is the maximum retention capacity replacing the s0 of the sme method obtained in the second stage in eq 12 the higher the antecedent moisture m the lower the initial abstraction ia and vice versa the antecedent moisture is given as 13 m β p 5 λ s s p 5 λ s s f o r p 5 λ s 14 m 0 for p5 λs where β is the parameter to be optimized and the parameter λ is equal to 0 20 as in the first stage the parameter β is a part of the 5 day rainfall that is intercepted this parameter was calibrated base on the observed rainfall runoff events the main difference between the original sme and the proposed modified sme m method is the way the parameter s is calibrated in the original method s0 was assumed to be the parameter functionally related to the catchment characteristics a different approach is adopted in the sme m method by walega and salata 2019 when the scs cn and sme method are combined s0 is substituted with the maximum potential retention s established from eq 4 the scs cn method is also widely used in arid and semi arid regions bo et al 2011 rawat and singh 2017 it was assumed that in moderate climate catchments which are rather rich in moisture such as those investigated and described in this paper the absolute maximum retention values higher than s are not typical of catchments in the southeastern us region therefore the original parameter s0 was substituted for with s moreover according to sahu et al 2010 the values of s0 may be equal to or higher than s therefore the authors adopted the less desirable variant s0 s in this work the positive difference between s0 and s s is equal to or higher than s0 determined that model generates lower rainfall losses and higher runoff values when compared to the original sme method values s0 and s have a constant quantity for a given watershed 2 5 assessment of peak discharge rate for determining the peak discharge of storm events with different return periods the simpler usda tr55 procedure usda 1986 based graphical peak discharge method was used instead of the model that uses a unit hydrograph method and was employed by blair et al 2012 based on time and discharge ratios developed by the usda 2007 the tr55 graphical peak discharge equation for a storm event is given by 15 q p q u a m q f p where qp peak discharge cfs qu unit peak discharge csm in which is a function of time of concentration tc and ia p ratio am drainage area mi2 q runoff in and fp pond and swamp adjustment factor in the usda 2007 method qu is represented by prf a q tp where prf is the peak rate factor defined as a ratio of recession and peaking limbs of the hydrograph and depends upon terrain gradient and catchment imperviousness a is the watershed area and tp is time to peak of the hydrograph blair et al 2012 used a lower value of prf 200 as a suitable number for the low gradient southeastern coastal plain landscape that is characteristic of higher ratio of recession to peak hydrograph instead of the default value of 484 recommended by nrcs for the upland sites potentially with lower recession to peak ratios next q was calculated using the original scs cn method and also the sme m method unit peak discharge qu was determined assuming a type ii rainfall distribution for all the three study sites and using corresponding calculated tc and ia p coefficients for each study site from exhibit4 ii chart usda 1986 in case of the observed rainfall events the p value is the cumulative rainfall for the event and 24 hr maximum rainfall from noaa atlas 14 bonnin et al 2006 for design rainfall events in the final step design peak discharge for each return period was calculated from eq 15 an fp value equal to 0 72 for five percent of swamp and pond areas was recommended by the usda likely for agricultural settings 1986 but for these forest watershed study sites the authors examined the land cover using available high resolution spatial data to estimate the percentage of wetlands and accurately estimate the value of fp by using it as a calibration factor the rest of the parameters were held constant and were not calibrated for example for each rainfall event and q assessed based on the method described above qp was calculated for different fp values then the values of fp were optimized using the solver tools available in excel ms excel 2013 the nonlinear algorithm option was chosen to find an optimal value of fp for each event based on the comparisons of predicted direct runoff values using each of the three cn models with the observed runoff data for each of the three forested watershed study sites the most accurate method for each watershed was selected using the model performance criteria stated below 2 6 model performance assessment the root mean square error rmse and modeling efficiency ef nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used as goodness of fit measures to assess performance of the three above models scs cn ms and modified sme sme m for three scenarios cn based on observed events cn according to usda 2004 and cnemp based on hawkins 1993 16 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q

performance ratings were as follows acceptable 0 65 ef 0 80 good 0 80 ef 0 90 and very good ef 0 90 2 7 design discharge calculations the final step was to make calculations for the design discharge values for each of the three watersheds for the 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 yr return periods design precipitation intensity duration frequency pidf values from the noaa atlas maps bonnin et al 2006 for durations of 24 h were obtained for each of the three watershed sites the atlas 14 pidf also provides estimates of upper and lower bounds at 90 confidence interval of the mean and made the data available in raster format for efficient modeling and analysis in gis framework as per the atlas 14 metadata hdsc nws noaa gov hdsc pfds meta na14 vol9 se grid metadata xml pidf estimates are used as basic design criteria for a wide variety of hydraulic structures such as culverts roadway drainages bridges and small dams in u s with the advent of satellite remote sensing and geospatial technology long term weather stations based latest pidf gridded data is now available in 800 m resolution at noaa site hdsc nws noaa gov hdsc pfds pfds gis html this new pidf data developed by noaa hdsc uses the partial series based design storm events data instead of just 24 hr maximum with a precipitation raster development process employed by the prism mean annual precipitation daly et al 2008 peak discharge rates for each design frequency were assessed according to the tr55 eq 15 and direct runoff was calculated according to the modified sme model fp values were obtained from the equation shown in fig 6 because the peak discharges calculated using the tr55 method with the direct runoff obtained from the modified sme model were found to be more accurate fig 5 then these peak discharges were compared to the values that were calculated using the tr55 and direct runoff based on the original scs cn for amcii and fp 0 72 all calculations were performed for rainfall distribution type ii and with a cn for medium antecedent conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 the cnemp values versus cn according to usda 2004 based on 27 observed rainfall runoff event data for the high gradient mountainous coweeta watershed ws14 table 1 the empirical method using eq 5 yielded the mean median and geometric mean cnemp of 64 6 66 3 and 65 9 respectively these small differences in calculated mean and median cn values suggest that this cn parameter is stable and can probably be described by a normal distribution for this mountain watershed in other words stable conditions seem to exist for formation of direct outflow at this site that was potentially attributed to homogenous land cover and soil types these estimated values were slightly 7 10 higher than the cn value of 60 recommended by the original usda 2004 method for amcii given the site s land cover and soil characteristics it is possible that using the same default lower cn value from the usda 2004 is the reason tedela et al 2012 found only a marginal correlation between predicted flow and the observed data for mountainous ws36 and ws37 at coweeta not shown although a somewhat modest correlation ef 0 56 was found for coweeta ws28 similarly using the measured event rainfall runoff data for the low gradient coastal watershed ws80 the cnemp values were 66 3 60 1 and 65 8 respectively which were much lower than the cn value of 75 recommended by the usda 2004 for amcii and land cover and soil characteristics of the watershed based on their analysis of 23 storm events recorded from 2008 to 2011 epps et al 2013a found a mean value of 70 also lower than that from the usda 2004 in their simulation study using a swat model for a 52 km2 forest watershed nearby the ws80 watershed amatya and jha 2011 reduced the cnii values for all the hydrologic response units hru obtained by using the usda 2004 method based on given land cover and soil type by 10 as a part of calibration of the predicted daily streamflow with the measured data on the other hand for the observed rainfall runoff events on the ac11 watershed in arkansas the computed mean median and geometric mean of the cnemp values were 79 1 80 7 and 81 9 respectively higher than the cn value of 70 recommended by the usda 2004 for amcii and the site s land cover and soil characteristics the results showed that compared to the measured data based empirical values the nrcs based method seems to underestimate the cn value and runoff for upland sites like coweeta and alum creek and overestimate cn and runoff for lowland sites like the ws80 watershed tedela et al 2012 noted that when a tabulated nrcs curve number consistently underestimates runoff from an undeveloped forest the effect of urbanization will be consistently overestimated causing drainage to be overdesigned potentially wasting resources unnecessarily the authors also noted that the causes of inaccurate runoff estimates established by using tabulated curve numbers in 10 forested watersheds in the northeastern united states are unclear the original information used to estimate the tabulated curve numbers for forested areas is no longer available hawkins et al 2009 the authors ruled out errors in selection of the soil hydrologic group and hydrologic conditions as potential contributors to the discrepancies they observed between the observed and tabulated cn values in their study this demonstrates a need for further studies into the calculation of direct runoff using other forms of the modified scs cn method assessment of cn for storm events resulting from increased magnitude of intense precipitation was also investigated using p cnemp relationship to address uncertainties in predictions analysis for 27 rainfall runoff episodes at the coweeta watershed were performed with an initial abstraction coefficient of λ 0 20 from fig 2 it is evident that empirical plot of p cnemp data are closely located to the theoretical curve according to standard behavior so the model correctly approximated the empirical data for λ 0 20 it can also be observed from the relationship that an increasing p is accompanied by a reduction in cnemp however clear stabilization of cn with an asymptotic behavior at higher rainfalls as described by other authors banasik et al 2014 banasik and woodward 2010 king and balogh 2008 was not observed cn would possibly have been stabilized for event rainfall amount exceeding maximum observed equal to 102 3 mm which was not observed during the study period similar relationships were found in the watersheds of southern poland that measured between 25 and almost 55 ha kowalik and walega 2015 it has been suggested that the decrease in cnemp with increasing p might be a result of different runoff triggering mechanisms such as rapid subsurface flow due to macropores in the matured forest stands as was noted recently by skaggs et al 2019 for matured managed pine stands in coastal nc in addition even small precipitation falling directly on the streams and shallow subsurface flow from near stream riparian areas also contribute to rapid flow response similar to variable source area concept szymczak and krężałek 2018 resulting in higher curve numbers for small events larger events would have these mechanisms as well but these would be overshadowed by the larger and delayed contribution from areas outside the riparian zone resulting in a lower curve number for larger events as a result small precipitation events are associated with high cnemp values although seasonal antecedent conditions generally during wet winters with low et demands prior to the precipitation event may also cause this using eq 7 and the observed data the p cnobs relationship resulted in the following 18 c n p 49 3 100 49 3 exp p 435 6 the analysis revealed improved model accuracy for λ 0 20 with an rmse equal to 0 84 mm and ef 0 99 when compared to results from the standard cn method in the coweeta watershed the value of cn 49 3 was lower than the cntheor determined for amcii these results clearly indicate that measures should be taken to accurately determine the actual soil moisture when using the original scs cn method as this parameter is crucial for calculating the amount of the direct runoff in practice cn for amcii generally assumes soil moisture for normal conditions which often leads to underestimation of the catchment runoff similar results were observed by tedela et al 2012 for small forested watersheds in the mountains of the eastern united states for coweeta watersheds 2 28 36 and 37 tabulated cn was 55 for amcii but mean median geometric mean and cn varied between 58 and 75 3 for λ 0 05 a stable p cnemp relationship was found for precipitation above 70 mm the cnemp for higher precipitation was 49 3 in contrast to the coweeta watershed the standard asymptote model fairly approximated the empirical data for the ws80 watershed and λ 0 20 fig 3 the cnemp is almost a flat straight line indicating absolutely no influence of p on the cn value this is likely due to higher soil water retention capacity and et rates of ws80 when compared to the high gradient coweeta watershed which could potentially store a higher amount of precipitation in the soil profile this observation is consistent with tedela et al 2012 who found substantially smaller curve numbers for the low to mid elevation watersheds 2 and 28 at their coweeta site compared to the two higher elevation watersheds 36 and 37 the authors attributed these large differences in hydrologic responses to the physical differences between the watersheds i e soil depth and annual et that were much larger on the lower elevation watersheds swift et al 1988 sun et al 2002 and increased the potential for soil moisture storage and controlling subsurface flow during storm events hibbert and troendle 1988 hewlett and hibbert 1966 a better approximation of the p cn relationship was achieved for the initial abstraction λ 0 05 fig 3 which is consistent with blair et al 2012 who based on a recent reevaluation of the ratio by nrcs found that 0 05 ﬁts better than 0 2 as a default value requiring a change in conversion of s and cn values woodward et al 2010 this relationship with λ 0 05 shows a violent behavior which is opposite of that noted by hawkins 1993 who showed a decreasing cn for increasing p values as was observed for the coweeta site in fig 2 above the violent behavior in this case shows increasing cn value with increasing p likely due to decreasing soil capacity this result showed that in watershed ws80 which has a lower permeability due to a restrictive clayey layer than sandy soils the runoff process is possibly influenced by other processes e g antecedent moisture condition shallow water tables as the key parameters controlling the storage available in these shallow poorly drained soils williams and amatya 2016 than in watersheds with better soil retention capacity these results are also consistent with earlier studies on event rainfall runoff relationships and their association with curve number at ws80 for example la torre torres et al 2011 also found a poor relationship with large seasonal variability between event runoff and rainfall potentially due to the differences in forest et that might have affected seasonal soil moisture conditions and a slightly better relationship for wet winter periods with relatively lower soil water storage and et demands the authors suggested that soil water status i e antecedent soil moisture and groundwater table level is important to consider in addition to the rainfall and seasonal runoff generation in the coastal plain region with shallow soil argillic horizons accordingly epps et al 2013a noted that runoff generation from storm events on this watershed ws80 were strongly related to water table elevation where seasonally variable et based wet and dry moisture conditions persist their results show improvement in ﬂow predictions using cns adjusted for antecedent runoff conditions and based on water table position epps et al 2013b these analyses then resulted in the following p cnobs relationship as the violent model described by hawkins 1993 19 c n p 55 4 1 e x p 0 029 p the cn 55 4 value from the violent behavior is similar to the values obtained by tedela et al 2012 for the same conditions based on the computed rmse value of 3 40 mm and ef 0 63 for λ 0 05 this model was deemed unsatisfactory the model performance was even worse for λ 0 20 based on the calculated ef value of only 0 03 although the rmse value of 2 03 mm was slightly lower interestingly the hawkins model was able to successfully approximate the cnemp and p relationship for the ac11 watershed in arkansas for λ 0 20 fig 4 the relationship shows that as p increases the calculated cn value decreases asymptotically likely due to reasons similar to those suggested previously for the upland coweeta watershed fig 4 also shows that the cn value has a tendency to stabilize at p 35 mm the stable cn of 79 3 for this p value and λ 0 20 is similar to the mean value 79 1 from all events and is close to the cn value of 85 for amciii usda 2004 in case of λ 0 05 with lower initial abstraction this tendency is clearly visible with increasing cn with p due to higher soil moisture the analyses were then used to develop a p cnemp relationship for λ 0 20 using the standard model described as follows 20 c n p 79 3 100 79 3 exp p 10 748 the corresponding calculated rmse was equal to 0 98 mm and ef 0 65 the worst approximation of p cn was obtained for λ 0 05 with the calculated rmse and ef values of 2 41 mm and 0 04 respectively indicating that λ 0 20 is perhaps a better parameter than 0 05 for this mild gradient upland watershed 3 2 comparison of direct event outflow by three methods computed values of statistics for evaluation of the models are presented in table 2 in the table direct runoff from the scs cn method was not calculated for observed events because all parameters like cn and s were estimated empirically e g cn was calculated based on soil hydrologic group and land cover whereas in the ms and original sme models parameters like s lambda and beta were calibrated accordingly the ms and sme m models were shown to perform almost the same like the original following ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 criteria if parameters were calibrated based on observed rainfall runoff events for the coweeta and ac11 high gradient watersheds in the case of the coweeta watershed if the cn was assessed based on the hawkins standard model instead of the usda model 2004 results of direct runoff were better but still unsatisfactory because the modified sme m model yielded the ef of 0 44 and rmse of 1 68 mm followed by the ms model which performed more poorly with an ef 0 41 and rmse 1 72 mm when the cn assessment was done using the usda tables usda 2004 and the amc was estimated based on the observed rainfall runoff events all models for coweeta watershed were rated as unsatisfactory table 2 for example the sme m model yielded an ef 0 27 and an rmse 1 91 mm although it was slightly better when compared to the results from the ms and scs method both of which performed similarly based on this analysis cnemp based on observed events is recommended for the assessment of direct runoff on coweeta watershed in nc in the case of ws80 in sc the ms and sme m model results were deemed unsatisfactory with the lowest quality performance following ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 quality criteria although parameters were calibrated based on the observed rainfall runoff events this was likely because the s parameter for ms and sme m was calibrated as independent parameter from the scs method in other words s was not linked with the scs method following the procedure described by sahu et al 2012 however when the amc was estimated based on observed rainfall runoff events results from all models were found to be satisfactory with the highest quality performance based on the same criteria prediction of the direct runoff from the ms model yielded the highest quality performance ef 0 79 rmse 7 21 mm followed by the modified sme sme m and scs method both of which provided similar results based on the calibration process the parameters of the ms method were obtained as s 458 8 mm and λ 0 01 and that for the sme model as so 482 2 mm and β 0 96 in case of ws80 direct runoff calculation using the scs ms and sme m method was not performed for the scenario with cn assessment by hawkins asymptotic curve because the curve was not approximated well by the p cnemp relationships fig 3 direct runoff estimated by all the models based on the observed rainfall runoff events for the ac11 watershed in arkansas were in good agreement with the measured data and acceptable based on the ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 quality criteria with the ms model yielding the highest quality ef 0 79 rmse 5 01 mm on the basis of the calibration process the parameters of the ms method were obtained as s 40 0 mm and λ 0 35 and the sme model yielded the parameters so 36 8 mm and β 0 25 when the cn assessment was done based on the usda tables usda 2004 and the amc estimated based on the observed rainfall runoff events the ms and sme models were found to be very good although the best results were achieved using the original scs cn method with an ef equal to 0 93 and the rmse 3 50 mm also when the cnemp was used for calculation all models yielded similar results when compared to the observed events generally for the moderate upland ac11 watershed in arkansas acceptable results of direct runoff calculations were achieved when the cn was assessed using the standard cn obtained from the usda table usda 2004 consistent with results obtained by walega and salata 2019 for a mountain catchment located in the southern part of poland the results demonstrated that in general the use of the modified sme cn instead of the original scs cn method provides a more accurate prediction of direct runoff in the study watersheds based on the computed model evaluation criteria table 2 the effects of the modified sme m method are compared to the original scs method on direct runoff calculation and presented in fig 5 as ratios versus the frequencies of design storms for the ws80 watershed direct runoff from the sme m model was smaller about 50 when compared to the scs cn method and the differences increased with increasing design storm frequency in the case of the ac11 watershed runoff from the scs method was slighty higher than the sme m method about 20 and the differences decreased for lower storm frequency for the ws14 watershed results of direct runoff were similar from w of the methods but differences between both method was higher than for w80 watershed 3 3 assessment of peak discharges using the tr55 method fig 6 shows the computed values of nash sutcliffe ef and root mean square error rmse of peak discharges calculated according to the usda 1986 tr55 method shown in eq 15 using the observed event data all calculations were performed first using fp 0 72 the default maximum retention value given in the tr55 method in fig 6 and then using the fp values obtained by calibration with observed events not shown the results showed that the calculated peak discharge qp for all methods was unsatisfactory when using the fp value of 0 72 recommended in tr55 usda 1986 with the large rmse values above 115 l s the highest rmse was obtained for the ws80 watershed 2000 l s the nash sutcliffe ef coefficients were below zero in most cases indicating that the use of a mean value is better than using the predicted values for this site with the largest drainage area 160 ha of all the sites as expected potentially due to more heterogeneity of soils and land cover than the two other smaller watersheds our results show the default fp value recommended in tr55 should not be used for these forested watersheds with high retention capacities somewhat enhanced results with an ef higher than 0 4 were obtained for calibrated fp values not shown it is interesting to note that the computed ef coefficients were found to be similar for both the scs cn and sme m models although slightly better results were obtained by using the sme m method for these forest watersheds with high retention capacity calibrated fp values were found to be lower than 0 40 when using all methods relationships between fp and p for each of the measured events on each study watershed are presented in fig 7 results show that the calibrated fp values vary from 0 41 to 0 062 for the coweeta watershed from 0 50 to 0 02 for ws80 and from 1 00 to 0 08 for ac11 fig 7 respectively in general the data showed a decreasing trend in fp when precipitation increased as a result the fitted relationship yielded a correlation coefficient of r 0 58 which is not too high but is statistically significant at α 0 05 and 0 01 however the large variability of observed data also shows that the fp perhaps is also influenced by other factors including antecedent soil moisture soil properties etc besides the event rainfall for example low rainfall amounts with high antecedent wet conditions may yield larger fp values perhaps due to reduced soil water storage in contrast to high rainfall amounts with high antecedent dry conditions which may yield smaller fp values due to large soil water storage as is shown by the fitted relationship this may indicate that the observed data in fig 7 might have been biased for those conditions this leads to another speculation that the fp may also be related to soil permeability as shown by watersheds ac11 hsg of c and ws80 hsg of d with low soil permeability tending to yield higher ranges of fp when compared to the low fp range values yielded by ws14 which had a dominant soil category b with higher permeability infiltration rates than either of the ac11 or ws80 thirdly a close examination of the data also tends to indicate that the fp factor may be related to watershed drainage area for example the smallest watershed ac11 yielded higher fp values than those for the ws80 and ws14 this seems plausible as the time of concentration of the smallest watershed ac11 would be the shortest potentially reducing residence time and for that matter retention of runoff and increasing peak flow rates last but not least it also seems that fp values could have been influenced by the duration of each rainfall event as shown in fig 8 although the correlation coefficient is rather low r 0 46 it is statistically significant for α 0 05 and 0 01 short duration rainfall events generally have high intensity potentially resulting in both reduced loss of precipitation to infiltration and retention of runoff than would have been observed for longer durations of rainfall the low intensity long duration rainfall influences soil saturation potentially recharging elevating ground water resulting in saturation excess flow with reduced runoff retention and thus yielding a higher fp value and peak flow rate in that context use of 24 hr duration rainfall much higher than the time of concentration for computing runoff for design storms may have also somewhat biased the peak discharge rates on these small watersheds when a variable fp for each event as a function of p fig 6 was used the estimates of peak discharges using the modified sme m model were in better agreement with the observed data in the case of the ws80 and ac11 watersheds the results were more satisfactory than those from coweeta which provided unacceptable results the rest of the methods usda and ms yielded poor results this study s results showed that for watersheds with the highest forest cover and a high soil capacity the fp value should be lower than is recommended in tr55 and should be changed for different precipitation levels lowering this fp value is consistent with blair et al 2012 who suggested that a peak rate factor of 200 is more representative than the default value of 484 recommended in the peak discharge method they used usda 2007 for the ﬂat terrain of the southeast coastal plain often called the low country the peak rate factor is a constant intended to reﬂect the slope of the watershed and ranges from 600 in steep areas to 100 in ﬂat swampy areas sheridan et al 2002 usda 2007 3 4 design discharge calculations design peak discharges calculated with tr55 method using the original scs cn and modified sme m based runoff volumes obtained from 24 h design storms for type ii design rainfall distribution as described above are presented in table 3 the results show that the design peak discharges obtained from the original tr55 procedure where the direct runoff was calculated using the scs cn method and a default fp parameter equal to 0 72 are higher than the modified sme m method for design storms by as much as eight or nine times for the ws80 and ws14 watershed generally higher differences were found for large design storms with lower frequencies like those occurring once in 50 or 100 yr frequencies one of the main reasons for this discrepancy is likely caused by the fp values which should be substantially less for flat watersheds with large soil water storage as noted above and also by blair et al 2012 for example smaller fp values were obtained for high intensity rainfall amounts for the low gradient ws80 watershed where such events generally occur during summer seasons when the soil water storage is generally high due to high evaporative demands of these forests fig 7 comparison of the results from fig 9 for peak discharges and fig 5 for volume of runoff clearly shows that peak discharge is mainly influenced by the fp parameter as the peak discharges obtained using the modified tr55 release are much less than that from the original tr55 the peak discharges are however independent of calculated differences observed in direct runoff volumes by the two methods for example even though there was only a 50 difference in runoff the sme method yielded as much as nine times smaller peak discharge levels than the scs for small size high frequency storms to 12 times smaller levels for the large size low frequency storms on the ws14 watershed these results clearly show that the empirical methods are sensitive to changes in their parameters and thus calibration processes is necessary such a calibration is possible in gauged watersheds with sufficient hydrometeorological data but in case of ungauged watersheds it is impossible or problematic calibrating these parameters in such circumstances rainfall runoff models based on unit hydrographs theory can be used the examples of these models are synthetic unit hydrograph as scs uh or snyder uh cupak and wałęga 2018 egiazarova et al 2017 gądek et al 2017 also geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph is commonly used to assess the direct hydrograph rodríguez iturbe and valdez 1979 in addition to address problems with application of the empirical models in ungauged watersheds the need arises to develop methods that are more objective for practical application reducing the subjectivity in design hydrograph estimation and in the consequent flood mapping event based approach for small and ungauged basins eba4sub rainfall runoff model is a framework that has been fully adapted for determining runoff in ungauged catchments eba4sub is based on geographic information systems and on the optimization of the topographic information contained in the digital elevation model dem and uses the same input data necessary to apply the well known rational formula petroselli and grimaldi 2018 piscopia et al 2015 alternate method of pidf calculation using the pdfs based method above analysis was conducted based on the pidf from the noaa atlas 14 that uses the 24 h maximum only rainfall intensity series however if the noaa s alternate partial frequency duration series based maximum intensity data stated earlier were used the range of the new pidf would have been somewhat larger table 4 than the 24 h design pidf values shown in table 3 in this study for example 24 h 100 yr p value of 219 2 mm is at the lower end of the range obtained below in table 4 for coweeta nc the 100 yr value of 231 6 mm for ws80 is even smaller than the lower range based on the new pidf table 4 same is true for alum creek we believe further analysis with these new pidf data is beyond our scope 4 summary and conclusions this study was conducted at three usda forest service long term experimental forest sites in distinct physiographic regions of the southeastern united states the low gradient coastal watershed in south carolina the high gradient mountainous watershed in north carolina and a lower relief mountain type watershed in arkansas the objectives of this work were divided into three parts first objective was to evaluate the performance of some of the modified scs cn methods and identify the most accurate method in determining the direct runoff the 2nd objective was to modify the scs tr55 based graphical peak discharge method first by applying calculated direct runoff using the most reliable modified scs cn method followed by evaluating the currently recommended default fp factor for both the upland and lowland forested watersheds the models including the scs cn model the mishra singh ms model and the sahu mishra eldho sme model modified earlier by walega and salata 2019 sme m model all modifications of the widely used scs cn method were evaluated using multi year 2011 2015 storm events 29 data from those study sites the results showed that compared to the empirical values the usda or scs based method underestimated the cnii value for the upland sites like coweeta and alum creek and overestimated the same value for the lowland ws80 watershed for upland watersheds however it was shown that the p cnemp relationship may be approximated by the model with a standard behavior as described by hawkins 1993 for the lowland ws80 watershed p cnemp did not show any visible trend for initial abstraction equal 0 20 however the initial abstraction 0 05 yielded a good relationship with a nash sutcliffe efficiency ef coefficient of 0 63 but was still deemed unsatisfactory warranting a need for further enhancement in parameters to accurately determine the actual soil moisture when using the original scs cn method direct runoff calculated using the modified sme m method was slightly in better agreement with the observed data than that from the ms and original scs cn methods for coweeta watershed but similar or slightly poorer than the ms or scs methods for ws80 and ac11 if cn was calculated based on usda 2004 or hawkins curve 1993 difference between the scs cn ms and sme m methods would not have been visible but slightly better results were achieved for the ms and sme m methods the modified sme m method included more complex information about soil conditions mainly the antecedent soil moisture than the original scs cn method and thus was expected to more precisely describe the runoff the sme m method has a low sensitivity to input parameters apart from rainfall walega and salata 2019 in case of peak discharges qp the results showed that the calculated qp for all methods was unsatisfactory when using the default fp value of 0 72 recommended by the tr55 guideline indicating that use of the default fp value may mislead the qp estimates for these forest watersheds with higher retention capacities better results with an ef higher than 0 4 were obtained for calibrated fp values the results of this study also showed that the fp is likely influenced by soil permeability in watersheds event rainfall and duration of rainfall furthermore the results also showed that the peak discharges obtained from the original tr55 procedure with the standard scs cn method and the default fp parameter value of 0 72 were higher than those obtained using the modified method with the sme m method based direct runoff and the fp value calibrated for individual events by 5 to almost 24 times for all study watersheds in addition some discrepancies of application of the tr55 peak discharge method on the large ws80 watershed may also have been due to its large size with more heterogeneous soils and land cover than two other smaller watersheds generally higher differences in design peak discharge estimates between the two methods were found for design rainfall events with lower frequencies e g 100 yr or 50 yr that are generally used in design of road culverts although some discrepancies might have also been due to potential errors in noaa design rainfall values derived by the interpolation methods only on the ac11 watershed difference between peak discharges was smallest for 2 year frequency this study indicates a need for further testing of the methods with additional forest watersheds with various catchment characteristics it also provides an opportunity to assess limitations and uncertainty among the widely used design discharge computation tools including the rational method that uses the design rainfall intensity and usgs regional flood frequency based regressions tian et al 2019 for the design of road cross drainage and other water management structures on these forested watersheds in the humid southeast us furthermore peak discharge analyses using the noaa s partial duration frequency series pdfs based pidf would provide a context in comparison with other widely used methods acknowledgements the authors would like to sincerely thank the university of agriculture in krakow
