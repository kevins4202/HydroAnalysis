this work a sustainable strategy for p recovery from sewage sludge via alkali activated pyrolysis water leaching and crystallization was proposed and a high value added product of vivianite was recovered effects of the type and dose of alkali activator on p transformation during sludge pyrolysis were investigated 50 wt dose of khco3 was determined as the alkali activated pyrolysis condition the content of water soluble p referred to as water p in biochar derived from raw sludge referred to as rs and ferric sludge fenton s reagent conditioned sludge referred to as fs by khco3 activated pyrolysis at different temperatures was compared the fe element in the fenton s reagent enhanced the content of fe bound p in the dewatered sludge which was readily transformed into potassium phosphate during khco3 activated pyrolysis thus increasing the water p content in the biochar derived from fs the proportions of water p to total p in the biochar samples obtained by khco3 activated pyrolysis of rs and fs at 600 c were 72 5 and 96 2 respectively which were notably higher than those in the biochar samples obtained by direct pyrolysis of rs and fs 3 5 and 0 5 respectively the water leaching solution of biochar obtained by khco3 activated pyrolysis of fs at 600 c was purified to remove impurity elements and vivianite with high purity was finally recovered by crystallization a total p recovery efficiency of 88 08 was achieved throughout the process from sewage sludge to the final vivianite product this study proposes a promising and sustainable approach for realizing the recovery of high value added product vivianite from sewage sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge phosphorus recovery alkali activated pyrolysis biochar water soluble phosphorus vivianite data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is an irreplaceable and indispensable chemical element for all lives mayer et al 2016 it is predicted that under the current exploitation and consumption rates the phosphate rock resources around the world will be exhausted in 50 to 100 years or even sooner cooper et al 2011 meanwhile a substantial proportion of p consumed by human activities ends up in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps elser and bennett 2011 peng and guo 2018 and more than 90 of p in wastewater eventually enriched in the sludge with the continuing growth of sewage sludge production its reduction stabilization harmlessness and resource utilization have become an urgent demand rumky et al 2018 therefore recovering p from sewage sludge is of practical significance for alleviating p scarcity and facilitating the harmless disposal and recycling of sludge which has attracted increasing attentions mayer et al 2016 tonini et al 2019 the existence form of p in sewage sludge is complex mainly including extracellular polymeric substances eps bound p orthophosphate dna polyphosphate and metal phosphates mainly ca p fe p al p and mg p in the solid phase and dissolved p in the liquid phase ding et al 2022 directly recovering p from sewage sludge is difficult currently studies on recovering p from sewage sludge mainly focus on releasing p in sludge to liquid phase through acid alkali pretreatment xu et al 2015 hydrothermal pretreatment fang et al 2020 or anaerobic digestion tian et al 2019 extracting p from the incinerated sewage sludge ash with strong acid has also been proved as a valid method to release p fang et al 2018a then p could be recovered from the p rich solution by chemical precipitation adsorption or crystallization liang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 however those p recovery processes may suffer from low release efficiency of p long processes or high energy costs liang et al 2021 recently the pyrolysis technology has attracted increasing attentions in the field of sewage sludge disposal because it enables energy recovery while converting sludge into carbonaceous functional materials gan et al 2020 during sludge pyrolysis the pyrophosphate and long chain polyphosphates are decomposed to orthophosphate and short chain polyphosphates at 250 600 c and p is eventually enriched in solid biochar huang and tang 2015 studies concerning p recovery from sludge derived biochar mainly treat the biochar as a potential p fertilizer and soil conditioner chen et al 2020 fristák et al 2017 however the bioavailability of p in the biochar obtained by the direct pyrolysis of sludge is relatively low buss et al 2020 extracting p from the biochar by acid alkali leaching is an alternative to recover p nevertheless it has been reported that thermal treatments alter the acid alkali extractability of p speciation in sludge and p becomes less extractable as the pyrolysis temperature rises huang and tang 2015 resulting in a low acid alkali leaching efficiency of p from biochar meanwhile it is unavoidable that the heavy metals in the sludge derived biochar are co leached with p from the biochar by acid alkali treatment which will lead to difficulties in subsequent impurity removal and p recovery procedure further reducing the p recovery efficiency fang et al 2018b it is reported that alkali metal elements such as potassium and sodium have a strong affinity for p element during biomass thermal treatment and carbothermal reduction of iron ore with high p content and water soluble alkali metal phosphates can be formed bai et al 2013 piotrowska et al 2010 khco3 was applied as the alkali activator for sludge pyrolysis to prepare hierarchically porous biochar in our previous study qiu et al 2022 phase transformation study showed that water soluble potassium aluminosilicates and potassium phosphate were generated in biochar samples it enlightens us that transferring insoluble metal phosphates in sludge into water soluble alkali metal phosphates is an efficient p recovery method it is also predicted that water leaching can obtain leaching solution with less impurities than acid alkali leaching solution leading to an easier following purification process however current studies on the alkali activated pyrolysis of sludge mainly aim at improving the pore structure of sludge derived biochar the migration and transformation of p in the sludge during the alkali activated pyrolysis is still unclear in addition how to improve the conversion efficiency of p from sludge to water soluble p referred to as water p in sludge derived biochar needs to be studied herein a sustainable strategy for p recovery from sewage sludge via alkali activated pyrolysis water leaching and crystallization was proposed vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o was chosen as the final p recovery product rather than the common struvite and calcium hydroxyapatite products since vivianite has relatively simple synthesis conditions extensive utilization and predictable economic value tian et al 2019 wilfert et al 2015 effects of the type and dose of alkali activator on p conversion during pyrolysis were intensively studied the content of water p in biochar derived from raw sludge and ferric sludge by khco3 activated pyrolysis at different temperatures was compared the transformation mechanism of insoluble p to water p during the alkali activated pyrolysis was revealed in addition the key factors of impurity removal and vivianite crystallization from the water leaching solution of sludge derived biochar were investigated the flowchart of this study is presented in fig s1 supplementary material this study will fill the technical gap of effective combination of sludge pyrolysis and p recovery providing a sustainable strategy for realizing recovery of high value added product vivianite from sewage sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 pretreatment of sewage sludge the raw sludge referred to as rs was collected from the gravitational thickener which was the combination of primary and secondary sludge in shahu wastewater treatment plant wwtp in wuhan china the process diagram of the shahu wttp is shown in fig s2 the main characteristics of the rs are provided in table s1 rs was directly dewatered by filtration separation process and then the moisture content of sludge decreased from 94 09 to 79 41 which created difficulties in the reduction of sludge volume and increased energy consumption in subsequent drying process hence fenton s reagent was used to pretreat the rs to improve sludge dewaterability and ferric sludge referred to as fs cake was obtained dose of fenton s reagent was 100 mg fe2 g volatile solids vs and 88 mg h2o2 g vs according to our previous study yu et al 2016 the moisture content of fs cake decreased to 63 52 p was barely detectable in the dewatered filtrate indicating that p was entirely reserved in the dewatered sludge cake heavy metal contents in the dewatered filtrate and sludge cakes were very low which were determined by an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp oes perking elmer 8300 usa table s2 both rs and fs cakes were dried at 105 c for 2 days then sequentially crushed screened and passed through an 80 mesh sieve for further pyrolysis experiments table 1 shows the physicochemical properties for sludge cake samples of rs and fs with the addition of inorganic conditioning agent the ash content of fs 62 16 wt was higher than that of rs 60 51 wt which made the higher heating value of fs 8 92 mj kg lower than that of rs 10 28 mj kg the fe2o3 content in the ash of fs 10 31 wt was notably higher than that of rs 4 87 wt since feso4 7h2o in the fenton s reagent was added meanwhile the fe element in the fenton s reagent is easy to combine with the p in the sludge fixing the p in the solid phase liang et al 2021 therefore the content of p2o5 in ash of fs 3 39 wt was slightly higher than that of rs 3 23 wt 2 2 biochar samples preparation the biochar samples were prepared in a horizontal electric tube furnace otf 1500x z8 china under ar flow 100 ml min at a rate of 10 c min up to the target temperature for 2 h after cooling down naturally biochar samples were collected weighted and then crushed and passed through an 80 mesh sieve the experimental design is shown in table s3 effects of the type and dose of alkali activator on the conversion of insoluble metal phosphates in sludge to water p in biochar were tested by altering the type of alkali activator koh naoh k2co3 na2co3 khco3 nahco3 and the dose of khco3 0 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 wt blended with rs respectively before pyrolysis the pyrolysis temperature was selected as 500 c based on the results of preliminary research the p transformation of rs and fs during khco3 activated pyrolysis at temperatures of 300 400 500 600 and 700 c was investigated rs and fs were mixed evenly with khco3 at a dose of 50 wt and the obtained mixtures from which were named as k rs and k fs respectively the biochar samples obtained from rs fs k rs and k fs at various temperatures were denoted as rs 300 400 500 600 and 700 fs 300 400 500 600 and 700 k rs 300 400 500 600 and 700 and k fs 300 400 500 600 and 700 respectively the biochar yields wt are listed in table s4 2 3 p recovery procedure from biochar samples biochar samples were crushed and passed through an 80 mesh sieve before water leaching then biochar samples were leached by deionized water in a thermostated shaker 150 rpm 25 c the leaching conditions of solid to liquid ratio s l and leaching time were selected as 10 g l and 30 min respectively established on pre optimization experiments after water leaching the mixture was filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane for analysis of the concentrations of p and impurity elements by icp oes and contents of dissolved organic matter dom by three dimensional excitation emission matrix spectrometer 3d eem hitachi f4600 japan in the water leaching solution impurity elements separated from the water leaching solution is critical for the synthesis of p product previous research indicated that alkali activated pyrolysis could promote the dissolution of si element in the water leaching solution qiu et al 2022 in order to avoid the influence of si element on the crystallization of vivianite fe2 solution prepared from feso4 7h2o was added to the solution to remove the si impurity with a molar ratio of fe si 1 6 while maintaining the ph at 12 0 based on the chemical equilibrium simulation after purification fe2 was added to the p rich solution for vivianite crystallization under the pre optimization condition of fe p molar ratio 1 5 ph 7 0 adjusted by h2so4 after filtration the element concentrations in the filtrate were measured by icp oes and the final vivianite product was obtained by washing and vacuum freeze drying of the precipitate the vivianite product was dissolved by 0 1 mol l hcl and the acquired solution was determined by icp oes to analyze its chemical composition and impurity elements 2 4 analysis of p speciation the modified standards measurements and testing protocol smt method was adopted to measure the total p tp content and p speciation comprising organic p op inorganic p ip apatite p ap non apatite ip naip and water p in the sludge cake and biochar samples the biochar was extracted by deionized water at a s l of 5 g l 25 c to determine the water p content the separated solid residue was used for further analysis based on the conventional smt method saleh bairq et al 2018 the p bonding status of biochar samples were obtained by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermal scientific escalab 250xi usa all spectra were corrected to the c1s peak at 284 8 ev the liquid 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr spectra of the sludge and biochar samples were acquired by a bruker ascend 400 spectrometer at 162 mhz the widely used naoh edta solution was employed for p extraction huang and tang 2015 2 5 analytical methods x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf axiosmax panalytical b v netherland was used to measure the chemical components of different sludge samples and the heating values were determined by a calorimeter sdac6000 sundy hunan x ray diffraction xrd xrd 7000 shimadzu japan was used to determine the crystalline phases of biochar and p product at an angle range 2θ from 10 to 80 with a scanning speed of 8 min the morphology of biochar and p product was examined using scanning electron microscopy sem ultra 55 zeiss germany and the p product was further characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem talos f200x fei america a brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analyzer bk 100b jwgb china was used to analyze the specific surface area of biochar samples before and after water leaching 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of the type and dose of alkali activator on the conversion of water p in sludge derived biochar 3 1 1 effect of the type of alkali activator the proportion of water p to tp noted as water p tp in biochar samples derived from the pyrolysis of rs with the addition of different alkali activators of 50 wt at 500 c is shown in fig 1 a the water p tp in the biochar derived from the direct pyrolysis of rs was only 2 8 indicating that most of p was insoluble metal phosphates in the biochar after adding koh naoh k2co3 na2co3 khco3 or nahco3 for the alkali activated pyrolysis of rs the water p tp in the obtained biochar samples were significantly increased to 74 6 66 7 49 9 42 8 55 5 and 46 1 respectively to investigate the transformation mechanism of p during the alkali activated pyrolysis of sludge the gibbs free energies δg were calculated for the reactions between the various alkali activators and the main metal phosphates fepo4 alpo4 and ca3 po4 2 in sludge reactions 1 18 at a temperature range of 0 1000 c figs 1 b d almost all the possible reactions besides the reaction 12 have a negative δg within the calculated temperature range indicating the reactions of the conversion of the insoluble metal phosphates to potassium sodium phosphate as water p could occur spontaneously under tested temperature conditions in accordance with the experimental results in fig 1 a as the temperature increases the δg becomes more negative and the reactions occurs more easily comparing the δg of the reactions between the different alkali activators and the main metal phosphates the order of promotion effect of the various alkali activators to the conversion of insoluble p in sludge to water soluble k3po4 na3po4 in biochar is presented as follows koh naoh khco3 k2co3 nahco3 na2co3 because koh and naoh are strong bases they might cause equipment corrosion and slagging problems during the pyrolysis process lian and zhao 2021 thus khco3 was selected as the activating reagent for subsequent co pyrolysis with sludge furthermore the generation of co2 and water vapor from the decomposing of khco3 during activated pyrolysis process is conducive to the formation of hierarchical pore in the biochar qiu et al 2022 1 2fepo4 s 6koh s 2k3po4 s fe2o3 s 3h2o g 2 2alpo4 s 6koh s 2k3po4 s al2o3 s 3h2o g 3 ca3 po4 2 s 6koh s 2k3po4 s 3cao s 3h2o g 4 2fepo4 s 6naoh s

samples derived from the khco3 activated pyrolysis of rs at 500 c is shown in fig s3 the water p tp ratio increased continuously from 2 8 to 51 8 with the increasing khco3 dose from 0 wt to 50 wt low dose of khco3 was insufficient to convert the metal phosphates in the sludge to soluble k3po4 in biochar as presented in reactions 13 15 with the increasing of khco3 dose the metal phosphates in the sludge sufficiently reacted with khco3 to be converted into soluble k3po4 the water p tp ratio increased by only 1 8 when the khco3 dose was extended up from 50 wt to 60 wt considering the efficiency of converting p in sludge to water p in biochar as well as the cost of khco3 50 wt dose of khco3 was chosen as the subsequent experimental condition 3 2 comparison of the conversion of water p during alkali activated pyrolysis at different temperatures between rs and fs 3 2 1 p speciation of biochar samples fig 2 shows the contents of tp and different p species measured by the modified smt method in the different sludge samples and derived biochar samples p element in the dewatered cake samples of rs and fs was mainly composed of ip and a little amount of op control in figs 2 a b indicating that p was primarily presented as metal phosphates the ratios of ap naip and water p to ip in the rs were 29 7 45 6 and 19 9 respectively while those values changed to 0 89 5 and 1 7 respectively in the fs this is because the fe element in fenton s reagent is easy to combine with the p during sludge conditioning liang et al 2021 with the increasing of pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 700 c tp in all biochar samples gradually increased which was due to the gradual decomposing of organic matters at elevated temperature resulting in an enrichment of p tp contents of biochar samples derived from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs were apparently lower than those of biochar samples derived from the pyrolysis of rs and fs which is due to the addition of khco3 activator the p elements in the biochar samples mainly consisted of ip because most of op was transferred into ip during the chemical conditioning and thermal treatment huang and tang 2015 as the temperature increased the content of water p in rs derived biochar samples was reduced from 2 59 mg g ds in rs to 0 in rs 700 fig 2 a this is because during the pyrolysis of sludge part of water p in the sludge would be converted into insoluble metal phosphates in the biochar samples wang et al 2020 as for the biochar samples obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs partial naip was turned into ap when the pyrolysis temperature was raised from 300 to 700 c naip to ip ratio decreased from 51 7 wt in rs 300 to 48 0 wt in rs 700 fig 2 a it is consistent with previous literatures that fe al phosphates can interact with ca compounds and forming ca phosphates and fe2o3 al2o3 in sludge atienza martínez et al 2014 jin et al 2017 p predominantly existed as naip in the biochar samples derived from the direct pyrolysis of fs naip to ip ratio decreased from 93 8 wt in fs 300 to 72 3 wt in fs 700 fig 2 b in general for the biochar obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs and fs p could barely be extracted by water fig 2 a b on the contrary as for the biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs with 50 wt khco3 activator naip and ap were gradually converted to water p with the increasing pyrolysis temperature and naip was more easily converted to water p fig 2 c d water p tp ratio in biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs was significantly higher than that of biochar samples obtained from the pyrolysis of rs and fs fig 3 it confirmed that the dose of khco3 activator could promote the conversion of insoluble naip and ap to k3po4 as water p in the biochar samples as discussed in section 3 1 1 water p tp ratio in the biochar samples obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs increased from 32 6 wt to 82 5 wt and 46 1 wt to 100 0 wt respectively when the temperature increased from 300 to 700 c fig 3 it is consistent with the reduced δg of phosphate conversion reactions at elevated temperatures fig 1 d furthermore the water p tp ratio in biochar samples derived from the pyrolysis of k fs was significantly higher that of k rs at the same pyrolysis temperature indicating that the fe element in fenton s reagent has a significant enhancement on the water p tp ratio in sludge derived biochar by alkali activated pyrolysis comparing the δg of the reactions between fepo4 alpo4 ca3 po4 2 and khco3 at various temperatures fig 1 d it could be concluded that the δg of the reaction between fepo4 and khco3 reaction 13 is significantly smaller than that of the reactions between ca3 po4 2 alpo4 and khco3 reactions 14 15 therefore fenton conditioning process enhanced the fe bound p in the sludge cake facilitating the transformation of ip to water p during the khco3 activated pyrolysis process effect of other iron containing conditioners such as fecl3 or fe2 s2o8 2 on the transformation of p during khco3 activated pyrolysis will be investigated in our future work 3 2 2 31p nmr spectra and p 2p xps characterizations the liquid 31p nmr spectra were applied to further analyze the p species in the different sludge and biochar samples fig s4 only one spiky peak at 5 ppm was detected from the spectra of rs and fs figs s4 a b demonstrating that p in the sludge cakes before pyrolysis was dominantly composed of inorganic orthophosphate cade menun 2005 similar spectra were also detected in all biochar samples which further proved the durability of orthophosphates in sludge throughout the pyrolysis process the above results is in accordance with the results in previous literature li et al 2018 p 2p xps analysis of the biochar samples obtained from the different sludge samples of rs fs k rs and k fs pyrolyzed at 600 c was further conducted to understand the p bonding states in biochar fig s5 in all biochar samples the peaks of p 2p spectra can be fitted at 130 135 ev corresponding to orthophosphate yin and kong 2014 the binding energy values of p 2p in the biochar samples of k rs 600 133 00 ev and k fs 600 133 03 ev were higher than those in the biochar samples of rs 600 132 73 ev and fs 600 132 90 ev respectively indicating that p element tends to form a more stable structure with k element in the presence of khco3 3 2 3 crystalline phases in the different biochar samples sio2 and kal3si3o10 oh 2 were identified as the main crystalline phases in the xrd spectra of the biochar samples obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs and fs fig 4 and the contents of these main phases remained almost unchanged with the increasing of the pyrolysis temperature after adding khco3 the main phases identified in the different biochar samples included sio2 and k2co3 when the pyrolysis temperature was below 500 c indicating that khco3 was not completely decomposed with a further increase of the pyrolysis temperature kalsio4 and kalo2 were detected in k rs 600 and k fs 600 samples due to the reaction of k2co3 with al2o3 and sio2 wibberley and wall 1982 however no obvious p containing phases were observed mainly resulting from the low p content in the biochar samples 3 3 recovery of p from the water leaching solution of the biochar samples 3 3 1 properties of the water leaching solution for a better understanding of the leaching behavior of p the variation of leaching concentrations of the five key elements of p fe al ca and si in the water leaching solutions of the different biochar samples are presented in fig 5 leaching concentrations of p fe and al elements were very low for the biochar obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs and fs because most of p existed as insoluble ap and naip in those biochar samples fig 2 the leaching concentration of p in the biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k fs was higher than that in the biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs at the same temperature figs 5 c d which is consistent with their water p content fig 3 the ph values of the water leaching solutions of biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs were significantly higher than those of the biochar obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs and fs table s5 such an alkaline environment of the water leaching solution is beneficial for removing the impurity metal elements however considerable concentration of si element was leached out in the highly alkaline leaching solution due to the formation of water soluble potassium aluminosilicates fig 4 therefore si element was the main impurity affecting p recovery and should be removed before vivianite recovery process contents of heavy metals as cr cu pb zn and cd and dom in the water leaching solutions from the different biochar samples derived from pyrolysis of rs fs k rs and k fs were also determined for heavy metals only a small amount of as cr cu and pb were leached out and zn and cd were not detected table s6 this is because the sewage sludge was taken from the domestic wwtp which treats influent with low content of heavy metals as the temperature increased the fluorescence intensity of dom in the water leaching solution from the different biochar samples exhibited an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend fig s6 this is because the transformation of dom during sludge pyrolysis can be divided into devolatilization stage and carbonization stage du et al 2022 under low pyrolysis temperatures 300 400 c the organic matters in the sludge were significantly decomposed some insoluble and poorly soluble organic matters began to be converted into dom djandja et al 2020 and the type of dom in the water leaching solution was mainly humic acid with the further increase in temperature 500 700 c the organic matters in the sludge were further decomposed resulting in the decrease of the content of dom and the type of dom in the water leaching solution was mainly tryptophan protein it was reported that the presence of organic matters could greatly affect the growth of crystal chen et al 2020 li and sheng 2021 in general the dom contents in the water leaching solution of the biochar samples obtained at high pyrolysis temperature were low 6 ru which has minimal impact on vivianite recovery 3 3 2 purification of the water leaching solution and vivianite crystallization based on the previous results the biochar sample of k fs 600 was selected for subsequent p recovery comprehensively considering the water p content the pyrolysis cost the contents of impurity elements fe al ca and si heavy metals and dom in the water leaching solution p was recovered from the k fs 600 biochar sample via a three step process of water leaching purification and crystallization process table 2 shows the mass balances of the key elements of p fe and si in the recovery process firstly 5 00 g of the k fs 600 biochar sample was leached with 500 00 ml of water and the p leaching efficiency in the water leaching solution was 96 60 table 2 the si element with a concentration of 81 16 mg l was also leached out which could be precipitated as fe3si2o5 oh 4 according to the fraction diagram of fe si and p elements based on chemical equilibrium simulation fig s7 the ph of the water leaching solution was adapted to 12 00 and then the purified p rich solution was obtained by adding ferrous solution to control the molar ratio of fe si at 1 6 after purification around 93 35 of si was removed from the water leaching solution meanwhile around 6 82 of p was lost table 2 since part of p might be adsorbed by the formed fe3si2o5 oh 4 precipitate the purified p rich solution was further applied for crystallization of vivianite the crystallization efficiency of p was 98 32 table 2 and vivianite pdf no 01 079 1928 phase was determined as the predominant crystalline phase of the recovered product by xrd fig 6 a the sem image of the vivianite product fig 6 b shows a flower like crystal morphology corresponding to the results in the literature liu et al 2018 the eds result showed that the recovered product mainly contained fe p and o elements the normalized atomic ratio of fe p was 1 2 fig 6 c which was slightly lower than the theoretical value fe p atomic ratio 1 5 in fe3 po4 2 8h2o this might be attributed to the partial oxidation of the vivianite product to fepo4 with fe p atomic ratio 1 0 chemical composition analysis revealed that the recovered vivianite had a high purity and the contents of impurity elements such as si k and ca were very low table s7 the p content in the vivianite product was 13 17 wt which was slightly higher than the theoretical value 12 35 wt in fe3 po4 2 8h2o but much lower than the theoretical value 20 53 wt in fepo4 from the hrtem image of the recovered product it could be found that the lattice fringe of the crystal structure was 6 67 å corresponding to the vivianite 020 plane fig 6 d 3 4 potential applications of the water leaching residue of biochar and the k rich filtrate after vivianite crystallization the energy consumption and economic analysis of the whole recovery process were calculated text s1 tables s8 and 3 showing that the total profit for recovery p was 4 30 kg dry sludge cake a high p recovery efficiency of 88 08 from sewage sludge to the final vivianite product was obtained by the proposed p recovery strategy including alkali activated pyrolysis water leaching and vivianite crystallization process fig 7 table 3 to further enhance the economic benefits of the whole process the properties of biochar sample of k fs 600 after water leaching leaching residue and filtrate after vivianite crystallization from the water leaching solution of k fs 600 were analyzed fig s8 shows the sem images of fs 600 k fs 600 and their corresponding leaching residues the surface of fs 600 and its leaching residue exhibited a similar densified morphology with low pore distribution in accordance with their small specific surface area 12 9 m2 g vs 14 3 m2 g as for the k fs 600 biochar sample there was obvious melting agglomeration on the surface due to the formation of potassium aluminosilicates with low melting point while the corresponded leaching residue showed a porous morphology the specific surface area of leaching residue of k fs 600 37 9 m2 g was much higher than that of fs 600 biochar sample 12 9 m2 g attributing to the leaching of potassium phosphate and other soluble potassium silicates xrd results showed that the leaching residue of fs 600 mainly contained sio2 and kal3si3o10 oh 2 while the leaching residue of k fs 600 was rich in fe3o4 fig s9 which may serve as a potential iron rich adsorbent or catalyst to remove contaminant gan et al 2020 wan et al 2021 the filtrate after vivianite crystallization from the water leaching solution of k fs 600 was abundant in nutrient element of k 2873 54 mg l with the growth of population the demand for k is becoming greater leading to a surge in the price of potash fertilizer all over the world sipert et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 the k rich filtrate after vivianite crystallization not only can be applied as liquid potash fertilizer but also can be used to synthesize k containing compounds by physicochemical methods after further purification procedure further efforts would be made to optimize the proposed p recovery route based on the above mentioned aspects in addition it is necessary to carry out systematic scale up experiments of sludge from different sources in order to improve the possibility of engineering application 4 conclusions a sustainable strategy for p recovery from sewage sludge via alkali activated pyrolysis water leaching and crystallization process was proposed in this study through which a high value added product vivianite was obtained effects of alkali activator and fe element on enhancing the conversion of insoluble p in sludge into water soluble p in biochar during pyrolysis were elucidated the metal phosphates in the sludge reacted with the alkali activator to generate water soluble k3po4 and iron phosphate is more prone to undergo conversion reactions by khco3 activated pyrolysis of ferric sludge the water leaching efficiency of the biochar obtained at 600 c with the addition of 50 wt khco3 could reach 96 60 the vivianite product was recovered from the water leaching solution after purification and crystallization and the recovery efficiency of p throughout the whole process from sewage sludge to the final vivianite product achieved 88 08 furthermore the reuse of biochar after water leaching and filtrate after vivianite crystallization could increase the economic and environmental benefits of the proposed p recovery route from sewage sludge declaration of competing interest

this work a sustainable strategy for p recovery from sewage sludge via alkali activated pyrolysis water leaching and crystallization was proposed and a high value added product of vivianite was recovered effects of the type and dose of alkali activator on p transformation during sludge pyrolysis were investigated 50 wt dose of khco3 was determined as the alkali activated pyrolysis condition the content of water soluble p referred to as water p in biochar derived from raw sludge referred to as rs and ferric sludge fenton s reagent conditioned sludge referred to as fs by khco3 activated pyrolysis at different temperatures was compared the fe element in the fenton s reagent enhanced the content of fe bound p in the dewatered sludge which was readily transformed into potassium phosphate during khco3 activated pyrolysis thus increasing the water p content in the biochar derived from fs the proportions of water p to total p in the biochar samples obtained by khco3 activated pyrolysis of rs and fs at 600 c were 72 5 and 96 2 respectively which were notably higher than those in the biochar samples obtained by direct pyrolysis of rs and fs 3 5 and 0 5 respectively the water leaching solution of biochar obtained by khco3 activated pyrolysis of fs at 600 c was purified to remove impurity elements and vivianite with high purity was finally recovered by crystallization a total p recovery efficiency of 88 08 was achieved throughout the process from sewage sludge to the final vivianite product this study proposes a promising and sustainable approach for realizing the recovery of high value added product vivianite from sewage sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge phosphorus recovery alkali activated pyrolysis biochar water soluble phosphorus vivianite data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is an irreplaceable and indispensable chemical element for all lives mayer et al 2016 it is predicted that under the current exploitation and consumption rates the phosphate rock resources around the world will be exhausted in 50 to 100 years or even sooner cooper et al 2011 meanwhile a substantial proportion of p consumed by human activities ends up in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps elser and bennett 2011 peng and guo 2018 and more than 90 of p in wastewater eventually enriched in the sludge with the continuing growth of sewage sludge production its reduction stabilization harmlessness and resource utilization have become an urgent demand rumky et al 2018 therefore recovering p from sewage sludge is of practical significance for alleviating p scarcity and facilitating the harmless disposal and recycling of sludge which has attracted increasing attentions mayer et al 2016 tonini et al 2019 the existence form of p in sewage sludge is complex mainly including extracellular polymeric substances eps bound p orthophosphate dna polyphosphate and metal phosphates mainly ca p fe p al p and mg p in the solid phase and dissolved p in the liquid phase ding et al 2022 directly recovering p from sewage sludge is difficult currently studies on recovering p from sewage sludge mainly focus on releasing p in sludge to liquid phase through acid alkali pretreatment xu et al 2015 hydrothermal pretreatment fang et al 2020 or anaerobic digestion tian et al 2019 extracting p from the incinerated sewage sludge ash with strong acid has also been proved as a valid method to release p fang et al 2018a then p could be recovered from the p rich solution by chemical precipitation adsorption or crystallization liang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 however those p recovery processes may suffer from low release efficiency of p long processes or high energy costs liang et al 2021 recently the pyrolysis technology has attracted increasing attentions in the field of sewage sludge disposal because it enables energy recovery while converting sludge into carbonaceous functional materials gan et al 2020 during sludge pyrolysis the pyrophosphate and long chain polyphosphates are decomposed to orthophosphate and short chain polyphosphates at 250 600 c and p is eventually enriched in solid biochar huang and tang 2015 studies concerning p recovery from sludge derived biochar mainly treat the biochar as a potential p fertilizer and soil conditioner chen et al 2020 fristák et al 2017 however the bioavailability of p in the biochar obtained by the direct pyrolysis of sludge is relatively low buss et al 2020 extracting p from the biochar by acid alkali leaching is an alternative to recover p nevertheless it has been reported that thermal treatments alter the acid alkali extractability of p speciation in sludge and p becomes less extractable as the pyrolysis temperature rises huang and tang 2015 resulting in a low acid alkali leaching efficiency of p from biochar meanwhile it is unavoidable that the heavy metals in the sludge derived biochar are co leached with p from the biochar by acid alkali treatment which will lead to difficulties in subsequent impurity removal and p recovery procedure further reducing the p recovery efficiency fang et al 2018b it is reported that alkali metal elements such as potassium and sodium have a strong affinity for p element during biomass thermal treatment and carbothermal reduction of iron ore with high p content and water soluble alkali metal phosphates can be formed bai et al 2013 piotrowska et al 2010 khco3 was applied as the alkali activator for sludge pyrolysis to prepare hierarchically porous biochar in our previous study qiu et al 2022 phase transformation study showed that water soluble potassium aluminosilicates and potassium phosphate were generated in biochar samples it enlightens us that transferring insoluble metal phosphates in sludge into water soluble alkali metal phosphates is an efficient p recovery method it is also predicted that water leaching can obtain leaching solution with less impurities than acid alkali leaching solution leading to an easier following purification process however current studies on the alkali activated pyrolysis of sludge mainly aim at improving the pore structure of sludge derived biochar the migration and transformation of p in the sludge during the alkali activated pyrolysis is still unclear in addition how to improve the conversion efficiency of p from sludge to water soluble p referred to as water p in sludge derived biochar needs to be studied herein a sustainable strategy for p recovery from sewage sludge via alkali activated pyrolysis water leaching and crystallization was proposed vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o was chosen as the final p recovery product rather than the common struvite and calcium hydroxyapatite products since vivianite has relatively simple synthesis conditions extensive utilization and predictable economic value tian et al 2019 wilfert et al 2015 effects of the type and dose of alkali activator on p conversion during pyrolysis were intensively studied the content of water p in biochar derived from raw sludge and ferric sludge by khco3 activated pyrolysis at different temperatures was compared the transformation mechanism of insoluble p to water p during the alkali activated pyrolysis was revealed in addition the key factors of impurity removal and vivianite crystallization from the water leaching solution of sludge derived biochar were investigated the flowchart of this study is presented in fig s1 supplementary material this study will fill the technical gap of effective combination of sludge pyrolysis and p recovery providing a sustainable strategy for realizing recovery of high value added product vivianite from sewage sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 pretreatment of sewage sludge the raw sludge referred to as rs was collected from the gravitational thickener which was the combination of primary and secondary sludge in shahu wastewater treatment plant wwtp in wuhan china the process diagram of the shahu wttp is shown in fig s2 the main characteristics of the rs are provided in table s1 rs was directly dewatered by filtration separation process and then the moisture content of sludge decreased from 94 09 to 79 41 which created difficulties in the reduction of sludge volume and increased energy consumption in subsequent drying process hence fenton s reagent was used to pretreat the rs to improve sludge dewaterability and ferric sludge referred to as fs cake was obtained dose of fenton s reagent was 100 mg fe2 g volatile solids vs and 88 mg h2o2 g vs according to our previous study yu et al 2016 the moisture content of fs cake decreased to 63 52 p was barely detectable in the dewatered filtrate indicating that p was entirely reserved in the dewatered sludge cake heavy metal contents in the dewatered filtrate and sludge cakes were very low which were determined by an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp oes perking elmer 8300 usa table s2 both rs and fs cakes were dried at 105 c for 2 days then sequentially crushed screened and passed through an 80 mesh sieve for further pyrolysis experiments table 1 shows the physicochemical properties for sludge cake samples of rs and fs with the addition of inorganic conditioning agent the ash content of fs 62 16 wt was higher than that of rs 60 51 wt which made the higher heating value of fs 8 92 mj kg lower than that of rs 10 28 mj kg the fe2o3 content in the ash of fs 10 31 wt was notably higher than that of rs 4 87 wt since feso4 7h2o in the fenton s reagent was added meanwhile the fe element in the fenton s reagent is easy to combine with the p in the sludge fixing the p in the solid phase liang et al 2021 therefore the content of p2o5 in ash of fs 3 39 wt was slightly higher than that of rs 3 23 wt 2 2 biochar samples preparation the biochar samples were prepared in a horizontal electric tube furnace otf 1500x z8 china under ar flow 100 ml min at a rate of 10 c min up to the target temperature for 2 h after cooling down naturally biochar samples were collected weighted and then crushed and passed through an 80 mesh sieve the experimental design is shown in table s3 effects of the type and dose of alkali activator on the conversion of insoluble metal phosphates in sludge to water p in biochar were tested by altering the type of alkali activator koh naoh k2co3 na2co3 khco3 nahco3 and the dose of khco3 0 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 wt blended with rs respectively before pyrolysis the pyrolysis temperature was selected as 500 c based on the results of preliminary research the p transformation of rs and fs during khco3 activated pyrolysis at temperatures of 300 400 500 600 and 700 c was investigated rs and fs were mixed evenly with khco3 at a dose of 50 wt and the obtained mixtures from which were named as k rs and k fs respectively the biochar samples obtained from rs fs k rs and k fs at various temperatures were denoted as rs 300 400 500 600 and 700 fs 300 400 500 600 and 700 k rs 300 400 500 600 and 700 and k fs 300 400 500 600 and 700 respectively the biochar yields wt are listed in table s4 2 3 p recovery procedure from biochar samples biochar samples were crushed and passed through an 80 mesh sieve before water leaching then biochar samples were leached by deionized water in a thermostated shaker 150 rpm 25 c the leaching conditions of solid to liquid ratio s l and leaching time were selected as 10 g l and 30 min respectively established on pre optimization experiments after water leaching the mixture was filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane for analysis of the concentrations of p and impurity elements by icp oes and contents of dissolved organic matter dom by three dimensional excitation emission matrix spectrometer 3d eem hitachi f4600 japan in the water leaching solution impurity elements separated from the water leaching solution is critical for the synthesis of p product previous research indicated that alkali activated pyrolysis could promote the dissolution of si element in the water leaching solution qiu et al 2022 in order to avoid the influence of si element on the crystallization of vivianite fe2 solution prepared from feso4 7h2o was added to the solution to remove the si impurity with a molar ratio of fe si 1 6 while maintaining the ph at 12 0 based on the chemical equilibrium simulation after purification fe2 was added to the p rich solution for vivianite crystallization under the pre optimization condition of fe p molar ratio 1 5 ph 7 0 adjusted by h2so4 after filtration the element concentrations in the filtrate were measured by icp oes and the final vivianite product was obtained by washing and vacuum freeze drying of the precipitate the vivianite product was dissolved by 0 1 mol l hcl and the acquired solution was determined by icp oes to analyze its chemical composition and impurity elements 2 4 analysis of p

effects of the type and dose of alkali activator on the conversion of water p in sludge derived biochar 3 1 1 effect of the type of alkali activator the proportion of water p to tp noted as water p tp in biochar samples derived from the pyrolysis of rs with the addition of different alkali activators of 50 wt at 500 c is shown in fig 1 a the water p tp in the biochar derived from the direct pyrolysis of rs was only 2 8 indicating that most of p was insoluble metal phosphates in the biochar after adding koh naoh k2co3 na2co3 khco3 or nahco3 for the alkali activated pyrolysis of rs the water p tp in the obtained biochar samples were significantly increased to 74 6 66 7 49 9 42 8 55 5 and 46 1 respectively to investigate the transformation mechanism of p during the alkali activated pyrolysis of sludge the gibbs free energies δg were calculated for the reactions between the various alkali activators and the main metal phosphates fepo4 alpo4 and ca3 po4 2 in sludge reactions 1 18 at a temperature range of 0 1000 c figs 1 b d almost all the possible reactions besides the reaction 12 have a negative δg within the calculated temperature range indicating the reactions of the conversion of the insoluble metal phosphates to potassium sodium phosphate as water p could occur spontaneously under tested temperature conditions in accordance with the experimental results in fig 1 a as the temperature increases the δg becomes more negative and the reactions occurs more easily comparing the δg of the reactions between the different alkali activators and the main metal phosphates the order of promotion effect of the various alkali activators to the conversion of insoluble p in sludge to water soluble k3po4 na3po4 in biochar is presented as follows koh naoh khco3 k2co3 nahco3 na2co3 because koh and naoh are strong bases they might cause equipment corrosion and slagging problems during the pyrolysis process lian and zhao 2021 thus khco3 was selected as the activating reagent for subsequent co pyrolysis with sludge furthermore the generation of co2 and water vapor from the decomposing of khco3 during activated pyrolysis process is conducive to the formation of hierarchical pore in the biochar qiu et al 2022 1 2fepo4 s 6koh s 2k3po4 s fe2o3 s 3h2o g 2 2alpo4 s 6koh s 2k3po4 s al2o3 s 3h2o g 3 ca3 po4 2 s 6koh s 2k3po4 s 3cao s 3h2o g 4 2fepo4 s 6naoh s

samples derived from the khco3 activated pyrolysis of rs at 500 c is shown in fig s3 the water p tp ratio increased continuously from 2 8 to 51 8 with the increasing khco3 dose from 0 wt to 50 wt low dose of khco3 was insufficient to convert the metal phosphates in the sludge to soluble k3po4 in biochar as presented in reactions 13 15 with the increasing of khco3 dose the metal phosphates in the sludge sufficiently reacted with khco3 to be converted into soluble k3po4 the water p tp ratio increased by only 1 8 when the khco3 dose was extended up from 50 wt to 60 wt considering the efficiency of converting p in sludge to water p in biochar as well as the cost of khco3 50 wt dose of khco3 was chosen as the subsequent experimental condition 3 2 comparison of the conversion of water p during alkali activated pyrolysis at different temperatures between rs and fs 3 2 1 p speciation of biochar samples fig 2 shows the contents of tp and different p species measured by the modified smt method in the different sludge samples and derived biochar samples p element in the dewatered cake samples of rs and fs was mainly composed of ip and a little amount of op control in figs 2 a b indicating that p was primarily presented as metal phosphates the ratios of ap naip and water p to ip in the rs were 29 7 45 6 and 19 9 respectively while those values changed to 0 89 5 and 1 7 respectively in the fs this is because the fe element in fenton s reagent is easy to combine with the p during sludge conditioning liang et al 2021 with the increasing of pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 700 c tp in all biochar samples gradually increased which was due to the gradual decomposing of organic matters at elevated temperature resulting in an enrichment of p tp contents of biochar samples derived from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs were apparently lower than those of biochar samples derived from the pyrolysis of rs and fs which is due to the addition of khco3 activator the p elements in the biochar samples mainly consisted of ip because most of op was transferred into ip during the chemical conditioning and thermal treatment huang and tang 2015 as the temperature increased the content of water p in rs derived biochar samples was reduced from 2 59 mg g ds in rs to 0 in rs 700 fig 2 a this is because during the pyrolysis of sludge part of water p in the sludge would be converted into insoluble metal phosphates in the biochar samples wang et al 2020 as for the biochar samples obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs partial naip was turned into ap when the pyrolysis temperature was raised from 300 to 700 c naip to ip ratio decreased from 51 7 wt in rs 300 to 48 0 wt in rs 700 fig 2 a it is consistent with previous literatures that fe al phosphates can interact with ca compounds and forming ca phosphates and fe2o3 al2o3 in sludge atienza martínez et al 2014 jin et al 2017 p predominantly existed as naip in the biochar samples derived from the direct pyrolysis of fs naip to ip ratio decreased from 93 8 wt in fs 300 to 72 3 wt in fs 700 fig 2 b in general for the biochar obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs and fs p could barely be extracted by water fig 2 a b on the contrary as for the biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs with 50 wt khco3 activator naip and ap were gradually converted to water p with the increasing pyrolysis temperature and naip was more easily converted to water p fig 2 c d water p tp ratio in biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs was significantly higher than that of biochar samples obtained from the pyrolysis of rs and fs fig 3 it confirmed that the dose of khco3 activator could promote the conversion of insoluble naip and ap to k3po4 as water p in the biochar samples as discussed in section 3 1 1 water p tp ratio in the biochar samples obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs increased from 32 6 wt to 82 5 wt and 46 1 wt to 100 0 wt respectively when the temperature increased from 300 to 700 c fig 3 it is consistent with the reduced δg of phosphate conversion reactions at elevated temperatures fig 1 d furthermore the water p tp ratio in biochar samples derived from the pyrolysis of k fs was significantly higher that of k rs at the same pyrolysis temperature indicating that the fe element in fenton s reagent has a significant enhancement on the water p tp ratio in sludge derived biochar by alkali activated pyrolysis comparing the δg of the reactions between fepo4 alpo4 ca3 po4 2 and khco3 at various temperatures fig 1 d it could be concluded that the δg of the reaction between fepo4 and khco3 reaction 13 is significantly smaller than that of the reactions between ca3 po4 2 alpo4 and khco3 reactions 14 15 therefore fenton conditioning process enhanced the fe bound p in the sludge cake facilitating the transformation of ip to water p during the khco3 activated pyrolysis process effect of other iron containing conditioners such as fecl3 or fe2 s2o8 2 on the transformation of p during khco3 activated pyrolysis will be investigated in our future work 3 2 2 31p nmr spectra and p 2p xps characterizations the liquid 31p nmr spectra were applied to further analyze the p species in the different sludge and biochar samples fig s4 only one spiky peak at 5 ppm was detected from the spectra of rs and fs figs s4 a b demonstrating that p in the sludge cakes before pyrolysis was dominantly composed of inorganic orthophosphate cade menun 2005 similar spectra were also detected in all biochar samples which further proved the durability of orthophosphates in sludge throughout the pyrolysis process the above results is in accordance with the results in previous literature li et al 2018 p 2p xps analysis of the biochar samples obtained from the different sludge samples of rs fs k rs and k fs pyrolyzed at 600 c was further conducted to understand the p bonding states in biochar fig s5 in all biochar samples the peaks of p 2p spectra can be fitted at 130 135 ev corresponding to orthophosphate yin and kong 2014 the binding energy values of p 2p in the biochar samples of k rs 600 133 00 ev and k fs 600 133 03 ev were higher than those in the biochar samples of rs 600 132 73 ev and fs 600 132 90 ev respectively indicating that p element tends to form a more stable structure with k element in the presence of khco3 3 2 3 crystalline phases in the different biochar samples sio2 and kal3si3o10 oh 2 were identified as the main crystalline phases in the xrd spectra of the biochar samples obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs and fs fig 4 and the contents of these main phases remained almost unchanged with the increasing of the pyrolysis temperature after adding khco3 the main phases identified in the different biochar samples included sio2 and k2co3 when the pyrolysis temperature was below 500 c indicating that khco3 was not completely decomposed with a further increase of the pyrolysis temperature kalsio4 and kalo2 were detected in k rs 600 and k fs 600 samples due to the reaction of k2co3 with al2o3 and sio2 wibberley and wall 1982 however no obvious p containing phases were observed mainly resulting from the low p content in the biochar samples 3 3 recovery of p from the water leaching solution of the biochar samples 3 3 1 properties of the water leaching solution for a better understanding of the leaching behavior of p the variation of leaching concentrations of the five key elements of p fe al ca and si in the water leaching solutions of the different biochar samples are presented in fig 5 leaching concentrations of p fe and al elements were very low for the biochar obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs and fs because most of p existed as insoluble ap and naip in those biochar samples fig 2 the leaching concentration of p in the biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k fs was higher than that in the biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs at the same temperature figs 5 c d which is consistent with their water p content fig 3 the ph values of the water leaching solutions of biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of k rs and k fs were significantly higher than those of the biochar obtained from the direct pyrolysis of rs and fs table s5 such an alkaline environment of the water leaching solution is beneficial for removing the impurity metal elements however considerable concentration of si element was leached out in the highly alkaline leaching solution due to the formation of water soluble potassium aluminosilicates fig 4 therefore si element was the main impurity affecting p recovery and should be removed before vivianite recovery process contents of heavy metals as cr cu pb zn and cd and dom in the water leaching solutions from the different biochar samples derived from pyrolysis of rs fs k rs and k fs were also determined for heavy metals only a small amount of as cr cu and pb were leached out and zn and cd were not detected table s6 this is because the sewage sludge was taken from the domestic wwtp which treats influent with low content of heavy metals as the temperature increased the fluorescence intensity of dom in the water leaching solution from the different biochar samples exhibited an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend fig s6 this is because the transformation of dom during sludge pyrolysis can be divided into devolatilization stage and carbonization stage du et al 2022 under low pyrolysis temperatures 300 400 c the organic matters in the sludge were significantly decomposed some insoluble and poorly soluble organic matters began to be converted into dom djandja et al 2020 and the type of dom in the water leaching solution was mainly humic acid with the further increase in temperature 500 700 c the organic matters in the sludge were further decomposed resulting in the decrease of the content of dom and the type of dom in the water leaching solution was mainly tryptophan protein it was reported that the presence of organic matters could greatly affect the growth of crystal chen et al 2020 li and sheng 2021 in general the dom contents in the water leaching solution of the biochar samples obtained at high pyrolysis temperature were low 6 ru which has minimal impact on vivianite recovery 3 3 2 purification of the water leaching solution and vivianite crystallization based on the previous results the biochar sample of k fs 600 was selected for subsequent p recovery comprehensively considering the water p content the pyrolysis cost the contents of impurity elements fe al ca and si heavy metals and dom in the water leaching solution p was recovered from the k fs 600 biochar sample via a three step process of water leaching purification and crystallization process table 2 shows the mass balances of the key elements of p fe and si in the recovery process firstly 5 00 g of the k fs 600 biochar sample was leached with 500 00 ml of water and the p leaching efficiency in the water leaching solution was 96 60 table 2 the si element with a concentration of 81 16 mg l was also leached out which could be precipitated as fe3si2o5 oh 4 according to the fraction diagram of fe si and p elements based on chemical equilibrium simulation fig s7 the ph of the water leaching solution was adapted to 12 00 and then the purified p rich solution was obtained by adding ferrous solution to control the molar ratio of fe si at 1 6 after purification around 93 35 of si was removed from the water leaching solution meanwhile around 6 82 of p was lost table 2 since part of p might be adsorbed by the formed fe3si2o5 oh 4 precipitate the purified p rich solution was further applied for crystallization of vivianite the crystallization efficiency of p was 98 32 table 2 and vivianite pdf no 01 079 1928 phase was determined as the predominant crystalline phase of the recovered product by xrd fig 6 a the sem image of the vivianite product fig 6 b shows a flower like crystal morphology corresponding to the results in the literature liu et al 2018 the eds result showed that the recovered product mainly contained fe p and o elements the normalized atomic ratio of fe p was 1 2 fig 6 c which was slightly lower than the theoretical value fe p atomic ratio 1 5 in fe3 po4 2 8h2o this might be attributed to the partial oxidation of the vivianite product to fepo4 with fe p atomic ratio 1 0 chemical composition analysis revealed that the recovered vivianite had a high purity and the contents of impurity elements such as si k and ca were very low table s7 the p content in the vivianite product was 13 17 wt which was slightly higher than the theoretical value 12 35 wt in fe3 po4 2 8h2o but much lower than the theoretical value 20 53 wt in fepo4 from the hrtem image of the recovered product it could be found that the lattice fringe of the crystal structure was 6 67 å corresponding to the vivianite 020 plane fig 6 d 3 4 potential applications of the water leaching residue of biochar and the k rich filtrate after vivianite crystallization the energy consumption and economic analysis of the whole recovery process were calculated text s1 tables s8 and 3 showing that the total profit for recovery p was 4 30 kg dry sludge cake a high p recovery efficiency of 88 08 from sewage sludge to the final vivianite product was obtained by the proposed p recovery strategy including alkali activated pyrolysis water leaching and vivianite crystallization process fig 7 table 3 to further enhance the economic benefits of the whole process the properties of biochar sample of k fs 600 after water leaching leaching residue and filtrate after vivianite crystallization from the water leaching solution of k fs 600 were analyzed fig s8 shows the sem images of fs 600 k fs 600 and their corresponding leaching residues the surface of fs 600 and its leaching residue exhibited a similar densified morphology with low pore distribution in accordance with their small specific surface area 12 9 m2 g vs 14 3 m2 g as for the k fs 600 biochar sample there was obvious melting agglomeration on the surface due to the formation of potassium aluminosilicates with low melting point while the corresponded leaching residue showed a porous morphology the specific surface area of leaching residue of k fs 600 37 9 m2 g was much higher than that of fs 600 biochar sample 12 9 m2 g attributing to the leaching of potassium phosphate and other soluble potassium silicates xrd results showed that the leaching residue of fs 600 mainly contained sio2 and kal3si3o10 oh 2 while the leaching residue of k fs 600 was rich in fe3o4 fig s9 which may serve as a potential iron rich adsorbent or catalyst to remove contaminant gan et al 2020 wan et al 2021 the filtrate after vivianite crystallization from the water leaching solution of k fs 600 was abundant in nutrient element of k 2873 54 mg l with the growth of population the demand for k is becoming greater leading to a surge in the price of potash fertilizer all over the world sipert et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 the k rich filtrate after vivianite crystallization not only can be applied as liquid potash fertilizer but also can be used to synthesize k containing compounds by physicochemical methods after further purification procedure further efforts would be made to optimize the proposed p recovery route based on the above mentioned aspects in addition it is necessary to carry out systematic scale up experiments of sludge from different sources in order to improve the possibility of engineering application 4 conclusions a sustainable strategy for p recovery from sewage sludge via alkali activated pyrolysis water leaching and crystallization process was proposed in this study through which a high value added product vivianite was obtained effects of alkali activator and fe element on enhancing the conversion of insoluble p in sludge into water soluble p in biochar during pyrolysis were elucidated the metal phosphates in the sludge reacted with the alkali activator to generate water soluble k3po4 and iron phosphate is more prone to undergo conversion reactions by khco3 activated pyrolysis of ferric sludge the water leaching efficiency of the biochar obtained at 600 c with the addition of 50 wt khco3 could reach 96 60 the vivianite product was recovered from the water leaching solution after purification and crystallization and the recovery efficiency of p throughout the whole process from sewage sludge to the final vivianite product achieved 88 08 furthermore the reuse of biochar after water leaching and filtrate after vivianite crystallization could increase the economic and environmental benefits of the proposed p recovery route from sewage sludge declaration of competing interest

14981,dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra bacteria imposing double edged sword effects on anammox bacteria were investigated in an anammox membrane bioreactor mbr experiencing an induced crash recovery event during the experiment the anammox mbr was loaded with nh4 n no2 n ratios rationh4 n no2 n of 1 20 1 60 initially the anammox mbr removed over 95 of 100 mg l nh4 n and 132 mg l no2 n rationh4 n no2 n 0 76 the well accepted stoichiometric rationh4 n no2 n for anammox in the influent stage 0 then we induced a system crash recovery event via nitrite shock loadings to better understand responses from different guilds of bacteria in anammox mbr loaded with 1 60 rationh4 n no2 n with 100 mg l no2 n in the influent stage 1 interestingly the nitrogen removal by anammox bacteria was maintained for about 20 days before starting to decrease significantly in stage 2 we further increased influent nitrite concentration to 120 mg l 1 33 rationh4 n no2 n to simulate a high nitrite toxicity scenario for a short period of time as expected nitrogen removal efficiency dropped to only 16 8 after the induced system crash anammox mbr performance recovered steadily to 93 2 nitrogen removal with a 1 25 rationh4 n no2 n and a low nitrite influent concentration of 80 mg l no2 n metagenomics analysis revealed that a probable causality of the decreasing nitrogen removal efficiency in stage 1 was the overgrowth of dnra capable bacteria the results showed that the members within the ignavibacteriales order 21 7 out competed anammox bacteria 17 0 in the anammox mbr with elevated nitrite concentrations in the effluent high no2 n loading 120 mg n l further caused the predominant candidatus kuenenia spp were replaced by candidatus brocadia spp therefore it was evident that dnra bacteria posed negative effects on anammox with 1 60 rationh4 n no2 n also when 120 mg l no2 n fed to anammox mbr rationh4 n no2 n 1 33 canonical denitrification became the primary nitrogen sink with both dnra and anammox activities decreased they probably fed on lysed microbial cells of anammox and dnra in stage 3 a low rationh4 n no2 n 1 25 with 80 mg l no2 n was used to rescue the system which effectively promoted dnra capable bacteria growth although anammox bacteria s abundance was only 7 7 during this stage they could be responsible for about 90 of the total nitrogen removal during this stage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dnra anammox denitrification overgrowth performance crash data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria were discovered in wastewater sludge in the early 1990s kuenen 2008 this type of autotrophic bacteria can use ammonium as an electron donor and nitrite as an electron acceptor to make nitrogen gas to gain energy eq 1 in fig 1 keren et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 due to their high efficiency and low operational costs anammox based nitrogen removal processes have been regarded as promising technology for dealing with nitrogen laden wastewater up to date a suite of lab pilot and full scale anammox based processes have been reported to successfully treat high nitrogen loading wastewater mccarty 2018 zhao et al 2022 anammox bacteria have been found in five candidatus genera including brocadia kuenenia jettenia scalindua and anammoxoglobus overall members from candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadia candidatus anammoxoglobus or candidatus jettenia are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems lawson et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 currently no pure culture of anammox bacteria has been obtained indicating anammox bacteria might need to rely on other microorganisms in wastewater treatment systems to survive cao et al 2017 jetten et al 1998 additionally anammox bacteria need a constant supply of no2 n for catabolism zhang et al 2017 therefore the canonical denitrifying bacteria that can reduce nitrate to nitrite eq 2 in fig 1 have been frequently discovered to co exist with anammox bacteria in anammox based bioreactors wang et al 2021a additionally the canonical heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria can consume organic carbon in wastewater to keep nitrite concentrations lower than toxic levels to anammox bacteria du et al 2019 that being said nitrite reducing bacteria can also compete with anammox bacteria for nitrite supply du et al 2019 li et al 2018 different from anammox and canonical denitrifies dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra bacteria reduce nitrate to ammonium via nitrite as an intermediate eqs 2 and 3 in fig 1 dnra was first discovered in 1938 and was considered as a vital part of the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems recently chi et al 2021 valiente et al 2022 metagenomic analyses showed that dnra capable bacteria are ubiquatously presented in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment systems however the roles of the dnra capable bacteria in these systems have not been adequately studied wang et al 2020a zhou et al 2021 as shown in fig 1 the denitratation step no3 no2 in both dnra and canonical denitrification processes is functionally identical so both types of bacteria can produce nitrite for the anammox bacteria by reducing nitrate with an electron donor e g an organic carbon a major difference is that the dnra bacteria can further reduce nitrite to ammonium which is another substrate for anammox bacteria in contrast the canonical denitrifying bacteria reduces nitrite to nitrogen gas which is considered a competitor to anammox bacteria for nitrite therefore dnra has been considered a viable nitrite and ammonia generating mechanism from nitrate in an anammox bioprocess and has been used in various bioreactor setups to enhance anammox nitrogen removal li et al 2020 wang et al 2022b sheng et al 2021 reported that the total nitrogen removal efficiency had an average of 20 increase during the reactor start up period with enhanced dnra activities in the appropriate range keren et al 2020 reported that nitrite reduction via dnra and denitrification appeared to be equally important during the anammox performance crash events in another innovative study dnra activities were used to reduce excess nitrite to ammonium to minimize nitrite toxicity to anammox bacteria qiao et al 2022 however some other studies showed that high dnra activities could cause low overall nitrogen removal efficiencies in anammox bioreactors especially during the start up periods sheng et al 2021 wang et al 2022b it seems that dnra bacteria can be a double edged sword when growing with anammox bacteria it is primarily due to anammox bacteria being sensitive to nitrite concentrations in their environments madeira and de araújo 2021 while dnra bacteria can either produce or remove nitrite from a system more research is needed to elucidate the interactions between the dnra and anammox bacteria in biological nitrogen removal processes this study aimed to obtain a mechanical understanding of how dnra bacteria interact with anammox bacteria in a membrane bioreactor mbr during induced nitrite shock loading events a lab scale anammox mbr was operated for over 100 days with different rationh4 n no2 n 1 20 1 60 molecular biology techniques such as 16s rrna gene based analysis and metagenomics were used to understand the dynamics of the bacterial community associated with different nitrogen e g ammonium and nitrite loadings in the anammox mbr anammox bacteria played the key role as the nitrogen sink at the beginning of reactor operation however when a low rationh4 n no2 n 1 33 with 120 mg l no2 n was used in the influent to the anammox mbr the canonical denitrifiers became dominant with both dnra and anammox activities likely inhibited by accumulated nitrite low rationh4 n no2 n 1 25 with 80 mg l no2 n effectively promoted anammox bacteria and dnra bacteria to become the dominant nitrogen sinks 2 materials and methods 2 1 start up and operation of anammox reactor a laboratory scale anammox mbr fig 1 with a working volume of 0 8 l was seeded with sludge from a pilot scale anammox sequencing batch reactor sbr synthetic wastewater containing 100 mg n l nh4 n and 132 mg n l no2 n was used to maintain the anammox mbr the influent of the anammox mbr was prepared with the constituents listed in table 1 a polyvinyl chloride hollow fiber membrane module pore size 0 02 μm with a total surface area of 1 88 m2 water code guangzhou china was mounted in the reactor a mixed gas argon gas co2 95 5 50 ml min was supplied continuously to minimize the oxygen effect adjust ph 7 0 7 8 and induce a cross flow motion for effectively scouring the membrane surface co2 also worked as an inorganic carbon source on top of 840 mg l nahco3 which was added to the influent to provide an adequate inorganic carbon supplement the reactor was agitated using a stirring station at 120 200 rpm and the effluent pump was operated with the mode of 8 min on 2 min off the hydraulic retention time hrt and the solids retention time srt were maintained at 48 h and 12 days respectively the effluent flow rate was estimated at approximately 16 5 ml h which was maintained using a water level controller the anammox mbr reactor was first fed with synthetic wastewater containing 100 mg l nh4 n and 132 mg l no2 n for 50 days both nh4 n and no2 n were removed to almost nondetectable in the effluent during this stage day 1 50 stage 0 then nh4 n and no2 n of the influent were changed to 160 mg l and 100 mg l from day 51 to day 98 stage 1 later nh4 n and no2 n of the influent were adjusted to 160 mg l and 120 mg l from day 100 to day 117 stage 2 and further reduced to 100 mg l and 80 mg l from day 119 to day 155 stage 3 2 2 dna extraction before dna extraction all biomass samples were stored at 80 c after flash frozen with liquid nitrogen samples were

moreover the thermocycler was set using the following program 1 94 c for 5 min 2 30 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 52 c for 30 s and 72 c for 30 s 3 72 c for 10 min and 4 hold at 4 c then the samples were

performance according to cui et al 2021 2 4 metagenome sequencing and analysis three parallel anammox sludge samples collected on day 155 were used for metagenomic analysis the sequencing and analysis were carried out following the procedure previously reported zhou et al 2021 diamond bisht et al 2018 was used to align dna sequences against the ncbi database the krona analysis was based on the abundance table of each taxonomic hierarchy bisht et al 2018 the diamond software was also adopted to align protein sequences against the functional enzyme database from the kegg database 2 5 chemistry analysis nh4 n no2 n no3 n mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured in accordance with the standard methods china nepa 2002 nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured in triplicates ph and do were also monitored daily with a ph meter az8651 az instrument china and a do meter az8403 az instrument china respectively total organic carbon toc total inorganic carbon tic and total carbon tc were measured using a toc analyzer toc 2000 metash china nitrate reductase activity assay kit aknm001u boxbio china and nitrite reductase activity assay kit aknm004c boxbio china were applied for the total activity of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase nitric oxide was measured with a no content assay kit aknm005c boxbio china 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance in stage 0 the anammox mbr received an influent containing 100 mg l nh4 n and 132 mg l no2 n and stably performed for 50 days with an effluent containing almost no detectable nh4 n and no2 n in stage 1 no2 n concentration 100 mg l was used in the influent to induce a nitrite shock loading scenario in response we also ramped up the influent ammonium nitrogen concentration to 160 mg l corresponding to a 1 33 rationh4 n no2 n to counteract the potential nitrite accumulation interestingly the nitrogen removal in the anammox mbr was maintained for about 20 days before starting to decrease significantly during the 20 day period based on the results we suspected that dnra capable bacteria the blue line in fig 1 and canonical denitrifying bacteria could reduce nitrate a byproduct from the anammox process to nitrite meanwhile nitrite could be further reduced to other denitrification intermediates or ammonium depending on whether denitrifiers or dnra bacteria were dominant we further suspected that the relatively high concentrations of nh4 n in the bioreactor were thermodynamically unfavorable for dnra to convert no2 n to nh4 n wang et al 2021b as shown in fig 2 a the anammox mbr immediately had an obvious no3 n accumulation during the first 20 days in stage i while nh4 n and no2 n were still removed over 95 in general the ratio of nh4 n to no2 n consumption and no3 n production in a conventional anammox process is 1 1 34 0 26 eq 1 of fig 1 as in our case we did not have a plausible explanation for the relatively high nitrogen removal in this stage moreover no was undetected and do was maintained below 0 01 mg l during the whole stage 1 indicating that nitrification and denitrification had no significant effect on the overall nitrogen metabolism during stage 1 even if dnra bacteria could convert all anammox origin no3 n back into no2 n to support anammox there were still approximately 37 mg l nh4 n removed that were unaccountable nevertheless we suspected from this phenomenon that dnra utilized the extracellular organic carbon produced by anammox bacteria eq 1 in fig 1 to supply some nitrite by reducing nitrate for ammonia oxidation keren et al 2020 as shown in fig 2c the declining anammox bacteria population could be deduced based on the gradual decrease of mlvss concentrations in stage 1 also the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent started to increase from day 71 furthermore the no3 n concentrations started to increase from day 82 especially no3 n achieved 10 mg l at day 82 which was reported to be above the levels leading to the anammox crash gu et al 2018 guo et al 2021 all these results indicated a clear trajectory of performance crash of our anammox mbr it is critical to notice that both toc and mlvss in the anammox mbr started to decrease simultaneously fig 2c in this stage they were strong indicators that the microbial activities and interactions in the anammox mbr were unstable and started to collapse in stage 2 the influent was adjusted to contain 160 mg l nh4 n and 100 mg l no2 n we purposely increased the concentration of no2 n to induce nitrite toxicity to the whole anammox mbr and wanted to investigate if the system could still be rescued after the nitrite inhibition event meanwhile the concentration of no3 n was decreased in stage 2 although the removal efficiency of nh4 n was improved the system was still in a state of collapse at the beginning of stage 2 we washed the sludge remaining in the anammox mbr with 0 9 nacl solution at day 99 to reduce any residual nh4 n no2 n and no3 n to undetectable levels then the rationh4 n no2 n of influent in stage 2 was dropped from 1 60 stage 1 to 1 33 with 160 mg l nh4 n and 120 mg l no2 n from fig 2 it is evident that anammox bacteria were inhibited because only approximately 20 mg l no2 n was removed as the reactor s nitrogen removal was poorly performed we considered the anammox mbr had descended into a crash stage as previous studies argued huang et al 2022 madeira and de araújo 2021 jin et al 2012 also reviewed that the anammox process was easily inhibited by overloading nitrite thus rationh4 n no2 n adjusting should be carried out immediately to prevent the anammox reactor from spinning into a downward spiral eventuating the decay and death of anammox bacteria keren et al 2020 therefore after 15 days in stage 2 we reduced rationh4 n no2 n to 1 25 with 100 mg l nh4 n and 80 mg l in the reactor influent which marked the beginning of stage 3 the sludge remaining in the anammox mbr was washed similarly as in stage 2 during day 119 139 nh4 n and no2 n was removed around 45 3 mg l and 59 8 mg l corresponding to the theoretical rationh4 n no2 n for anammox reaction eq 1 of fig 1 but the reactor only contained very low toc and mlvss in the reactor fig 2c furthermore no2 n and no3 n in the effluent decreased with toc increase indicating that dnra likely were active transforming no3 n into no2 n and or nh4 n to support anammox process it was evident that total nitrogen removal started becoming higher from day 140 the result indicated that dnra probably provided additional electron acceptors for anammox during this stage thus by comparing stages 1 2 and 3 it is plausible that dnra had the double edged sword effects on anammox depending on rationh4 n no2 n and no2 loadings 3 2 microbial community shifts of anammox sludge fig 3 shows the microbial community shifts within the anammox mbr during different stages based on 16s rrna gene analysis anammox sludge was mainly composed of proteobacteria planctomycetes chloroflexi and bacteroidetes ya et al 2021 also showed that planctomycetes 29 9 46 8 proteobacteria 20 8 38 2 and chloroflexi 18 1 27 1 were dominant in their anammox sludge our results were aligned with their study furthermore chao index fig s1 shows that the richness of the bacterial community in stage 0 635 was the highest among all stages and the higher rationh4 n no2 n seemed to be responsible for reducing the richness to below 500 the rank abundance fig s2a also supported the microbial community richness decreases in the later stages fig s2b shows that bacterial communities from stage 0 stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 formed clusters nicely with samples from the same stage the results strongly indicated the effect of different rationh4 n no2 n and nitrite loadings on the shaping of microbial communities previous literature huang et al 2022 jin et al 2012 reported that overloading nitrite was toxic to anammox bacteria and easily led to the decay and death of anammox bacteria resulting in anammox process inhibition keren et al 2020 also found that overloading nitrite led to an obvious bacterial community shift in a short time during anammox performance crash event which was similar to our results overall in all stages most mags belonged to proteobacteria candidatus brocadia mag 3 and candidatus kuenenia mag 178 were identified as planctomycetes and were the most abundant anammox bacteria in the anammox mbr reactor xiao et al 2021 denitratisoma mag 6 belonging to proteobacteria played a denitrifying role in the anammox sludge 3 3 nitrogen metabolism of the anammox sludge 3 3 1 bacteria for nitrogen metabolism according to our 16s rrna gene analysis fig 3 and mags recovered from metagenomics datasets table 2 15 mags were identified from anammox sludge and contributed to most of the bacterial community of each stage functional genes analysis of nitrogen metabolism revealed that 12 out of the 15 mags were directly involved in anammox dnra and or canonical denitrification respectively at the same time the other three taxonomic groups mag 11 13 and 21 were only attributed to the bacterial community with low abundances 0 1 mag 3 and mag 178 were identified to be members of candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia respectively they carried a complete anammox pathway with all the functional genes identified candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia are by far the most extensively studied in terms of their physiology and biochemistry and are widely identified in seawater and wastewater treatment systems kuenen 2008 peeters and van niftrik 2019 it is interesting that chloroflexi bacterium mag 1 ignavibacteriales bacterium mag 2 anaerolineae bacterium mag 4 denitratisoma mag 6 ignavibacteriales mag 10 were identified to contain all functional genes encoding for whole dnra process while only burkholderiales bacterium mag 5 and betaproteobacteria mag 8 was with all functional genes encoding for whole denitrification pathway moreover betaproteobacteria mag 7 rhodocyclaceae mag 9 and betaproteobacteria mag 12 also contained nitrate reductase which was the same enzyme both for dnra and denitrification to reduce nitrate into nitrite 3 3 2 double edged sword effects of dnra on anammox negative effects figs 2 and 4 show that high rationh4 n no2 n 1 60 with a relatively high influent nitrate concentration 100 mg l no2 n in stage 1 did not lead to complete inhibition of anammox bacteria compared with stage 0 however the conditions seemed to encourage the growth of candidatus kuenenia over candidatus brocadia previous reports showed that candidatus kuenenia could outgrow other anammox bacteria when they co existed with dnra bacteria moreover candidatus kuenenia could be more adaptive than other anammox bacteria like candidatus brocadia to the changing environment song et al 2021 wang et al 2022b total dnra bacteria s abundance especially ignavibacteriales bacterium mag 2 started to increase from day 32 to 21 7 as a possible response to the performance crash eventually dnra bacteria overgrew anammox bacteria 17 0 in this stage the high abundance of dnra bacteria in stage i indicated that the sludge in the anammox mbr possessed a high capacity for nitrate reduction wang et al 2020b in contrast the abundances of denitrification bacteria and microorganisms only with nitrate reductase did not vary significantly thus the nitrate concentration increases were likely the result of anammox activities eq 1 in fig 1 chloroflexi bacteria e g ignavibacteriales and denitratisoma are capable of denitrification in particular denitratisoma can use eps as an electron donor for denitrification li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b in the anammox mbr we supected that the dnra bacteria could use eps to reduce no3 n to no2 n and or nh4 n which could be in turn used by anammox bacteria in normal conditions the nitrogen metabolism declined with the dnra bacteria depletion and the anammox inhibition by over 10 mg l no2 n in the effluent from day 82 while the toc and mlvss concentrations also decreased in the reactor therefore the overgrowth of dnra bacteria could be correlated to the decline of nitrogen metabolism and further inhibited anammox in this study it represented the adverse effects of dnra on anammox 3 3 3 double edged sword effects of dnra on anammox positive effects as shown in figs 2 and 4 the low rationh4 n no2 n 1 33 with 120 mg l no2 n stage 2 in the influent led to the decrease of both anammox bacteria and dnra bacteria while denitrification bacteria increased to become the dominant nitrogen metabolism species wang et al 2022a and chen et al 2023 both reported that low rationh4 n no2 n resulted in more abundant denitrification bacteria in anammox sludge samples in addition the effluent no3 n was still around 5 mg l meaning that anammox was not completely inhibited in stage 2 moreover no was constantly below the detection limit of the assay kit during stage 2 considering that no was also undetectable during stage 1 the results strongly indicated the presence of functional denitrifying bacteria in the anammox mbr liu et al 2022 also reported that denitrification bacteria could effectively reduce no2 n to no to mitigate the inhibition effects of no2 n on anammox but dnra bacteria only reduced no3 n into no2 n and then nh4 n with organic carbon wang et al 2020b during days 119 139 in stage 3 dnra bacteria became the dominant nitrogen sink with a low rationh4 n no2 n 1 25 and a low nitrite concentration 80 mg l no2 n in the influent meanwhile anammox were still at a low abundance of approximately 7 7 with toc and mlvss started to increase fig 2c bacteria of both dnra and anammox increased with canonical denitrifying bacteria going the opposite direction dnra and anammox became the primary nitrogen sink in this stage which became more obvious after day 140 li et al 2020 reported that dnra could effectively enhance anammox activities by continuously providing no2 n from no3 n sheng et al 2021 also reported that anammox bioreactors could be started more quickly with dnra activities to balance the ratio and metabolism of different nitrogen species moreover candidatus brocadia was reported to contain higher nitrogen removal capacity than candidatus kuenenia liu et al 2020 thus dnra increase also changed the dominant anammox bacteria for promoting whole nitrogen metabolism to achieve better nitrogen removal especially with organic carbon source amendments previous studies he et al 2023 zhang et al 2021 reported that organic carbon amendment improved anammox activities in mixed cultures but anammox bacteria are autotrophs so the results are interesting because the enhancement mechanisms were not discussed in the study some recent studies valiente et al 2022 wang et al 2022b argued that dnra bacteria thriving in anammox bioreactors could consume organic carbons to reduce nitrate to nitrite and ammonium our results aligned with the previous studies and showed that dnra bacteria could exercise positive effects of dnra on anammox 3 4 nitrogen removal mechanism of anammox sludge with double edged sword effects of dnra as shown in fig s3 translation ribosomal structure and biogenesis amino acid transport and metabolism cell wall membrane envelope biogenesis energy production and conversion and co enzyme transport and metabolism were the dominant bacterial functions of the anammox sludge all these functions had no apparent variations during the whole reactor operation fig 5 shows a pca plot for taxa abundance bacteria of dnra anammox and denitrification and reactor performance the removal efficiency of nh4 n and no2 n bacteria of dnra and anammox both contributed some positive effects to the anammox mbr it is evident that the removal efficiency of no2 n was positively correlated with anammox and dnra bacteria however the correlation of dnra bacteria was stronger than anammox bacteria although nitrite concentrations were regarded as an essential factor affecting the anammox mbr performances the results also corresponded to the change of dnra bacteria abundance directly affecting anammox reactor performance moreover nh4 n removal efficiency was well correlated with the relatively high abundance of anammox bacteria in stage 1 however the anammox performance finally crashed when dnra bacteria became dominant in the later stages in stage 3 reactor performance recovery was dependent on no2 n removal efficiency enhancement due to the recovery of anammox and dnra bacteria based on the above analysis dnra had the double edged sword effects on anammox in our study as shown in fig 6 dnra could effectively reduce no3 n a by product of anammox activity eq 1 in fig 1 into no2 n and nh4 n by utilizing eps or other extracellular organic carbon that were most likely produced by anammox bacteria dnra and anammox bacteria could maintain a balanced system for efficient nitrogen removal as observed in stage 3 and a few other studies li et al 2020 sheng et al 2021 the positive effect of dnra provided a credible answer to why anammox systems in the literature did not have the same theoretical 1 33 rationh4 n no2 n keren et al 2020 it is also a plausible mechanism for some observations that anammox activities could be enhanced by adding organic carbon wang et al 2021b on the other hand the concentrations of no2 n accumulation due to the dnra bacteria could have adverse effects on anammox bacteria even causing the anammox reactor crash for example the overgrowth of dnra bacteria broke the nitrogen metabolism balance resulting in anammox inhibition with high no2 n concentrations stage 1 performance for the inhibition situation denitrification bacteria could take over dnra bacteria to reduce no2 n to no n2o or n2 eq 3 in fig 1 relatively high no2 n loadings also led candidatus kuenenia to become the dominant anammox bacteria which were more tolerant to nitrite toxicity organic carbon source and no2 n loading played significant roles in dnra effects on anammox it was reported that the organic carbon sources could be the driving force for dnra and denitrification castro barros et al 2017 and dnra process could be the main nitrogen sink in various circumstances wang et al 2022c also showed that the total nitrogen removal efficiency could be significantly increased by enhancing the dnra activities in an anammox system even when the influent cod n ratio was low 4 conclusions the mbr reactor had an over 95 no2 n and nh4 n removal efficiency before its performance crashed at a rationh4 n no2 n of 1 60 and a 100 mg l no2 n concentration the overgrowth of dnra bacteria compared with the anammox bacteria in the mbr caused no2 n accumulation and finally resulted in anammox bacteria inhibition which was considered the negative effect of the dnra bacteria on the anammox bacteria on the other hand a low rationh4 n no2 n of 1 20 with 80 mg l no2 n concentration effectively promoted dnra while mbr anammox reaction processed corresponding to the theoretical rationh4 n no2 n with 90 no2 n removal this was regarded as the positive effect of dnra on anammox author contributions lijie zhou contributed to the conceptualization methodology and writing review

14981,dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra bacteria imposing double edged sword effects on anammox bacteria were investigated in an anammox membrane bioreactor mbr experiencing an induced crash recovery event during the experiment the anammox mbr was loaded with nh4 n no2 n ratios rationh4 n no2 n of 1 20 1 60 initially the anammox mbr removed over 95 of 100 mg l nh4 n and 132 mg l no2 n rationh4 n no2 n 0 76 the well accepted stoichiometric rationh4 n no2 n for anammox in the influent stage 0 then we induced a system crash recovery event via nitrite shock loadings to better understand responses from different guilds of bacteria in anammox mbr loaded with 1 60 rationh4 n no2 n with 100 mg l no2 n in the influent stage 1 interestingly the nitrogen removal by anammox bacteria was maintained for about 20 days before starting to decrease significantly in stage 2 we further increased influent nitrite concentration to 120 mg l 1 33 rationh4 n no2 n to simulate a high nitrite toxicity scenario for a short period of time as expected nitrogen removal efficiency dropped to only 16 8 after the induced system crash anammox mbr performance recovered steadily to 93 2 nitrogen removal with a 1 25 rationh4 n no2 n and a low nitrite influent concentration of 80 mg l no2 n metagenomics analysis revealed that a probable causality of the decreasing nitrogen removal efficiency in stage 1 was the overgrowth of dnra capable bacteria the results showed that the members within the ignavibacteriales order 21 7 out competed anammox bacteria 17 0 in the anammox mbr with elevated nitrite concentrations in the effluent high no2 n loading 120 mg n l further caused the predominant candidatus kuenenia spp were replaced by candidatus brocadia spp therefore it was evident that dnra bacteria posed negative effects on anammox with 1 60 rationh4 n no2 n also when 120 mg l no2 n fed to anammox mbr rationh4 n no2 n 1 33 canonical denitrification became the primary nitrogen sink with both dnra and anammox activities decreased they probably fed on lysed microbial cells of anammox and dnra in stage 3 a low rationh4 n no2 n 1 25 with 80 mg l no2 n was used to rescue the system which effectively promoted dnra capable bacteria growth although anammox bacteria s abundance was only 7 7 during this stage they could be responsible for about 90 of the total nitrogen removal during this stage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dnra anammox denitrification overgrowth performance crash data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria were discovered in wastewater sludge in the early 1990s kuenen 2008 this type of autotrophic bacteria can use ammonium as an electron donor and nitrite as an electron acceptor to make nitrogen gas to gain energy eq 1 in fig 1 keren et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 due to their high efficiency and low operational costs anammox based nitrogen removal processes have been regarded as promising technology for dealing with nitrogen laden wastewater up to date a suite of lab pilot and full scale anammox based processes have been reported to successfully treat high nitrogen loading wastewater mccarty 2018 zhao et al 2022 anammox bacteria have been found in five candidatus genera including brocadia kuenenia jettenia scalindua and anammoxoglobus overall members from candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadia candidatus anammoxoglobus or candidatus jettenia are commonly found in wastewater treatment systems lawson et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 currently no pure culture of anammox bacteria has been obtained indicating anammox bacteria might need to rely on other microorganisms in wastewater treatment systems to survive cao et al 2017 jetten et al 1998 additionally anammox bacteria need a constant supply of no2 n for catabolism zhang et al 2017 therefore the canonical denitrifying bacteria that can reduce nitrate to nitrite eq 2 in fig 1 have been frequently discovered to co exist with anammox bacteria in anammox based bioreactors wang et al 2021a additionally the canonical heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria can consume organic carbon in wastewater to keep nitrite concentrations lower than toxic levels to anammox bacteria du et al 2019 that being said nitrite reducing bacteria can also compete with anammox bacteria for nitrite supply du et al 2019 li et al 2018 different from anammox and canonical denitrifies dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra bacteria reduce nitrate to ammonium via nitrite as an intermediate eqs 2 and 3 in fig 1 dnra was first discovered in 1938 and was considered as a vital part of the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems recently chi et al 2021 valiente et al 2022 metagenomic analyses showed that dnra capable bacteria are ubiquatously presented in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment systems however the roles of the dnra capable bacteria in these systems have not been adequately studied wang et al 2020a zhou et al 2021 as shown in fig 1 the denitratation step no3 no2 in both dnra and canonical denitrification processes is functionally identical so both types of bacteria can produce nitrite for the anammox bacteria by reducing nitrate with an electron donor e g an organic carbon a major difference is that the dnra bacteria can further reduce nitrite to ammonium which is another substrate for anammox bacteria in contrast the canonical denitrifying bacteria reduces nitrite to nitrogen gas which is considered a competitor to anammox bacteria for nitrite therefore dnra has been considered a viable nitrite and ammonia generating mechanism from nitrate in an anammox bioprocess and has been used in various bioreactor setups to enhance anammox nitrogen removal li et al 2020 wang et al 2022b sheng et al 2021 reported that the total nitrogen removal efficiency had an average of 20 increase during the reactor start up period with enhanced dnra activities in the appropriate range keren et al 2020 reported that nitrite reduction via dnra and denitrification appeared to be equally important during the anammox performance crash events in another innovative study dnra activities were used to reduce excess nitrite to ammonium to minimize nitrite toxicity to anammox bacteria qiao et al 2022 however some other studies showed that high dnra activities could cause low overall nitrogen removal efficiencies in anammox bioreactors especially during the start up periods sheng et al 2021 wang et al 2022b it seems that dnra bacteria can be a double edged sword when growing with anammox bacteria it is primarily due to anammox bacteria being sensitive to nitrite concentrations in their environments madeira and de araújo 2021 while dnra bacteria can either produce or remove nitrite from a system more research is needed to elucidate the interactions between the dnra and anammox bacteria in biological nitrogen removal processes this study aimed to obtain a mechanical understanding of how dnra bacteria interact with anammox bacteria in a membrane bioreactor mbr during induced nitrite shock loading events a lab scale anammox mbr was operated for over 100 days with different rationh4 n no2 n 1 20 1 60 molecular biology techniques such as 16s rrna gene based analysis and metagenomics were used to understand the dynamics of the bacterial community associated with different nitrogen e g ammonium and nitrite loadings in the anammox mbr anammox bacteria played the key role as the nitrogen sink at the beginning of reactor operation however when a low rationh4 n no2 n 1 33 with 120 mg l no2 n was used in the influent to the anammox mbr the canonical denitrifiers became dominant with both dnra and anammox activities likely inhibited by accumulated nitrite low rationh4 n no2 n 1 25 with 80 mg l no2 n effectively promoted anammox bacteria and dnra bacteria to become the dominant nitrogen sinks 2 materials and methods 2 1 start up and operation of anammox reactor a laboratory scale anammox mbr fig 1 with a working volume of 0 8 l was seeded with sludge from a pilot scale anammox sequencing batch reactor sbr synthetic wastewater containing 100 mg n l nh4 n and 132 mg n l no2 n was used to maintain the anammox mbr the influent of the anammox mbr was prepared with the constituents listed in table 1 a polyvinyl chloride hollow fiber membrane module pore size 0 02 μm with a total surface area of 1 88 m2 water code guangzhou china was mounted in the reactor a mixed gas argon gas co2 95 5 50 ml min was supplied continuously to minimize the oxygen effect adjust ph 7 0 7 8 and induce a cross flow motion for effectively scouring the membrane surface co2 also worked as an inorganic carbon source on top of 840 mg l nahco3 which was added to the influent to provide an adequate inorganic carbon supplement the reactor was agitated using a stirring station at 120 200 rpm and the effluent pump was operated with the mode of 8 min on 2 min off the hydraulic retention time hrt and the solids retention time srt were maintained at 48 h and 12 days respectively the effluent flow rate was estimated at approximately 16 5 ml h which was maintained using a water level controller the anammox mbr reactor was first fed with synthetic wastewater containing 100 mg l nh4 n and 132 mg l no2 n for 50 days both nh4 n and no2 n were removed to almost nondetectable in the effluent during this stage day 1 50 stage 0 then nh4 n and no2 n of the influent were changed to 160 mg l and 100 mg l from day 51 to day 98 stage 1 later nh4 n and no2 n of the influent were adjusted to 160 mg l and 120 mg l from day 100 to day 117 stage 2 and further reduced to 100 mg l and 80 mg l from day 119 to day 155 stage 3 2 2 dna extraction before dna extraction all biomass samples were stored at 80 c after flash frozen with liquid nitrogen samples were

moreover the thermocycler was set using the following program 1 94 c for 5 min 2 30 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 52 c for 30 s and 72 c for 30 s 3 72 c for 10 min and 4 hold at 4 c then the samples were sequenced on a miseq platform illumina san diego ca later the sequencing data and diversity calculations chao index rank abundance were processed with the magichand http cloud magigene com yomics metagenomic taxonomic groups mags were identified based on the sequences with 97 similarities we also carried out principal component analysis pca to link the changes of taxa abundance and reactor performance according to cui et al 2021 2 4 metagenome sequencing and analysis three parallel anammox sludge samples collected on day 155 were used for metagenomic analysis the sequencing and analysis were carried out following the procedure previously reported zhou et al 2021 diamond bisht et al 2018 was used to align dna sequences against the ncbi database the krona analysis was based on the abundance table of each taxonomic hierarchy bisht et al 2018 the diamond software was also adopted to align protein sequences against the functional enzyme database from the kegg database 2 5 chemistry analysis nh4 n no2 n no3 n mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured in accordance with the standard methods china nepa 2002 nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured in triplicates ph and do were also monitored daily with a ph meter az8651 az instrument china and a do meter az8403 az instrument china respectively total organic carbon toc total inorganic carbon tic and total carbon tc were measured using a toc analyzer toc 2000 metash china nitrate reductase activity assay kit aknm001u boxbio china and nitrite reductase activity assay kit aknm004c boxbio china were applied for the total activity of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase nitric oxide was measured with a no content assay kit aknm005c boxbio china 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance in stage 0 the anammox mbr received an influent containing 100 mg l nh4 n and 132 mg l no2 n and stably performed for 50 days with an effluent containing almost no detectable nh4 n and no2 n in stage 1 no2 n concentration 100 mg l was used in the influent to induce a nitrite shock loading scenario in response we also ramped up the influent ammonium nitrogen concentration to 160 mg l corresponding to a 1 33 rationh4 n no2 n to counteract the potential nitrite accumulation interestingly the nitrogen removal in the anammox mbr was maintained for about 20 days before starting to decrease significantly during the 20 day period based on the results we suspected that dnra capable bacteria the blue line in fig 1 and canonical denitrifying bacteria could reduce nitrate a byproduct from the anammox process to nitrite meanwhile nitrite could be further reduced to other denitrification intermediates or ammonium depending on whether denitrifiers or dnra bacteria were dominant we further suspected that the relatively high concentrations of nh4 n in the bioreactor were thermodynamically unfavorable for dnra to convert no2 n to nh4 n wang et al 2021b as shown in fig 2 a the anammox mbr immediately had an obvious no3 n accumulation during the first 20 days in stage i while nh4 n and no2 n were still removed over 95 in general the ratio of nh4 n to no2 n consumption and no3 n production in a conventional anammox process is 1 1 34 0 26 eq 1 of fig 1 as in our case we did not have a plausible explanation for the relatively high nitrogen removal in this stage moreover no was undetected and do was maintained below 0 01 mg l during the whole stage 1 indicating that nitrification and denitrification had no significant effect on the overall nitrogen metabolism during stage 1 even if dnra bacteria could convert all anammox origin no3 n back into no2 n to support anammox there were still approximately 37 mg l nh4 n removed that were unaccountable nevertheless we suspected from this phenomenon that dnra utilized the extracellular organic carbon produced by anammox bacteria eq 1 in fig 1 to supply some nitrite by reducing nitrate for ammonia oxidation keren et al 2020 as shown in fig 2c the declining anammox bacteria population could be deduced based on the gradual decrease of mlvss concentrations in stage 1 also the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent started to increase from day 71 furthermore the no3 n concentrations started to increase from day 82 especially no3 n achieved 10 mg l at day 82 which was reported to be above the levels leading to the anammox crash gu et al 2018 guo et al 2021 all these results indicated a clear trajectory of performance crash of our anammox mbr it is critical to notice that both toc and mlvss in the anammox mbr started to decrease simultaneously fig 2c in this stage they were strong indicators that the microbial activities and interactions in the anammox mbr were unstable and started to collapse in stage 2 the influent was adjusted to contain 160 mg l nh4 n and 100 mg l no2 n we purposely increased the concentration of no2 n to induce nitrite toxicity to the whole anammox mbr and wanted to investigate if the system could still be rescued after the nitrite inhibition event meanwhile the concentration of no3 n was decreased in stage 2 although the removal efficiency of nh4 n was improved the system was still in a state of collapse at the beginning of stage 2 we washed the sludge remaining in the anammox mbr with 0 9 nacl solution at day 99 to reduce any residual nh4 n no2 n and no3 n to undetectable levels then the rationh4 n no2 n of influent in stage 2 was dropped from 1 60 stage 1 to 1 33 with 160 mg l nh4 n and 120 mg l no2 n from fig 2 it is evident that anammox bacteria were inhibited because only approximately 20 mg l no2 n was removed as the reactor s nitrogen removal was poorly performed we considered the anammox mbr had descended into a crash stage as previous studies argued huang et al 2022 madeira and de araújo 2021 jin et al 2012 also reviewed that the anammox process was easily inhibited by overloading nitrite thus rationh4 n no2 n adjusting should be carried out immediately to prevent the anammox reactor from spinning into a downward spiral eventuating the decay and death of anammox bacteria keren et al 2020 therefore after 15 days in stage 2 we reduced rationh4 n no2 n to 1 25 with 100 mg l nh4 n and 80 mg l in the reactor influent which marked the beginning of stage 3 the sludge remaining in the anammox mbr was washed similarly as in stage 2 during day 119 139 nh4 n and no2 n was removed around 45 3 mg l and 59 8 mg l corresponding to the theoretical rationh4 n no2 n for anammox reaction eq 1 of fig 1 but the reactor only contained very low toc and mlvss in the reactor fig 2c furthermore no2 n and no3 n in the effluent decreased with toc increase indicating that dnra likely were active transforming no3 n into no2 n and or nh4 n to support anammox process it was evident that total nitrogen removal started becoming higher from day 140 the result indicated that dnra probably provided additional electron acceptors for anammox during this stage thus by comparing stages 1 2 and 3 it is plausible that dnra had the double edged sword effects on anammox depending on rationh4 n no2 n and no2 loadings 3 2 microbial community shifts of anammox sludge fig 3 shows the microbial community shifts within the anammox mbr during different stages based on 16s rrna gene analysis anammox sludge was mainly composed of proteobacteria planctomycetes chloroflexi and bacteroidetes ya et al 2021 also showed that planctomycetes 29 9 46 8 proteobacteria 20 8 38 2 and chloroflexi 18 1 27 1 were dominant in their anammox sludge our results were aligned with their study furthermore chao index fig s1 shows that the richness of the bacterial community in stage 0 635 was the highest among all stages and the higher rationh4 n no2 n seemed to be responsible for reducing the richness to below 500 the rank abundance fig s2a also supported the microbial community richness decreases in the later stages fig s2b shows that bacterial communities from stage 0 stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 formed clusters nicely with samples from the same stage the results strongly indicated the effect of different rationh4 n no2 n and nitrite loadings on the shaping of microbial communities previous literature huang et al 2022 jin et al 2012 reported that overloading nitrite was toxic to anammox bacteria and easily led to the decay and death of anammox bacteria resulting in anammox process inhibition keren et al 2020 also found that overloading nitrite led to an obvious bacterial community shift in a short time during anammox performance crash event which was similar to our results overall in all stages most mags belonged to proteobacteria candidatus brocadia mag 3 and candidatus kuenenia mag 178 were identified as planctomycetes and were the most abundant anammox bacteria in the anammox mbr reactor xiao et al 2021 denitratisoma mag 6 belonging to proteobacteria played a denitrifying role in the anammox sludge 3 3 nitrogen metabolism of the anammox sludge 3 3 1 bacteria for nitrogen metabolism according to our 16s rrna gene analysis fig 3 and mags recovered from metagenomics datasets table 2 15 mags were identified from anammox sludge and contributed to most of the bacterial community of each stage functional genes analysis of nitrogen metabolism revealed that 12 out of the 15 mags were directly involved in anammox dnra and or canonical denitrification respectively at the same time the other three taxonomic groups mag 11 13 and 21 were only attributed to the bacterial community with low abundances 0 1 mag 3 and mag 178 were identified to be members of candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia respectively they carried a complete anammox pathway with all the functional genes identified candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia are by far the most extensively studied in terms of their physiology and biochemistry and are widely identified in seawater and wastewater treatment systems kuenen 2008 peeters and van niftrik 2019 it is interesting that chloroflexi bacterium mag 1 ignavibacteriales bacterium mag 2 anaerolineae bacterium mag 4 denitratisoma mag 6 ignavibacteriales mag 10 were identified to contain all functional genes encoding for whole dnra process while only burkholderiales bacterium mag 5 and betaproteobacteria mag 8 was with all functional genes encoding for whole denitrification pathway moreover betaproteobacteria mag 7 rhodocyclaceae mag 9 and betaproteobacteria mag 12 also contained nitrate reductase which was the same enzyme both for dnra and denitrification to reduce nitrate into nitrite 3 3 2 double edged sword effects of dnra on anammox negative effects figs 2 and 4 show that high rationh4 n no2 n 1 60 with a relatively high influent nitrate concentration 100 mg l no2 n in stage 1 did not lead to complete inhibition of anammox bacteria compared with stage 0 however the conditions seemed to encourage the growth of candidatus kuenenia over candidatus brocadia previous reports showed that candidatus kuenenia could outgrow other anammox bacteria when they co existed with dnra bacteria moreover candidatus kuenenia could be more adaptive than other anammox bacteria like candidatus brocadia to the changing environment song et al 2021 wang et al 2022b total dnra bacteria s abundance especially ignavibacteriales bacterium mag 2 started to increase from day 32 to 21 7 as a possible response to the performance crash eventually dnra bacteria overgrew anammox bacteria 17 0 in this stage the high abundance of dnra bacteria in stage i indicated that the sludge in the anammox mbr possessed a high capacity for nitrate reduction wang et al 2020b in contrast the abundances of denitrification bacteria and microorganisms only with nitrate reductase did not vary significantly thus the nitrate concentration increases were likely the result of anammox activities eq 1 in fig 1 chloroflexi bacteria e g ignavibacteriales and denitratisoma are capable of denitrification in particular denitratisoma can use eps as an electron donor for denitrification li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b in the anammox mbr we supected that the dnra bacteria could use eps to reduce no3 n to no2 n and or nh4 n which could be in turn used by anammox bacteria in normal conditions the nitrogen metabolism declined with the dnra bacteria depletion and the anammox inhibition by over 10 mg l no2 n in the effluent from day 82 while the toc and mlvss concentrations also decreased in the reactor therefore the overgrowth of dnra bacteria could be correlated to the decline of nitrogen metabolism and further inhibited anammox in this study it represented the adverse effects of dnra on anammox 3 3 3 double edged sword effects of dnra on anammox positive effects as shown in figs 2 and 4 the low rationh4 n no2 n 1 33 with 120 mg l no2 n stage 2 in the influent led to the decrease of both anammox bacteria and dnra bacteria while denitrification bacteria increased to become the dominant nitrogen metabolism species wang et al 2022a and chen et al 2023 both reported that low rationh4 n no2 n resulted in more abundant denitrification bacteria in anammox sludge samples in addition the effluent no3 n was still around 5 mg l meaning that anammox was not completely inhibited in stage 2 moreover no was constantly below the detection limit of the assay kit during stage 2 considering that no was also undetectable during stage 1 the results strongly indicated the presence of functional denitrifying bacteria in the anammox mbr liu et al 2022 also reported that denitrification bacteria could effectively reduce no2 n to no to mitigate the inhibition effects of no2 n on anammox but dnra bacteria only reduced no3 n into no2 n and then nh4 n with organic carbon wang et al 2020b during days 119 139 in stage 3 dnra bacteria became the dominant nitrogen sink with a low rationh4 n no2 n 1 25 and a low nitrite concentration 80 mg l no2 n in the influent meanwhile anammox were still at a low abundance of approximately 7 7 with toc and mlvss started to increase fig 2c bacteria of both dnra and anammox increased with canonical denitrifying bacteria going the opposite direction dnra and anammox became the primary nitrogen sink in this stage which became more obvious after day 140 li et al 2020 reported that dnra could effectively enhance anammox activities by continuously providing no2 n from no3 n sheng et al 2021 also reported that anammox bioreactors could be started more quickly with dnra activities to balance the ratio and metabolism of different nitrogen species moreover candidatus brocadia was reported to contain higher nitrogen removal capacity than candidatus kuenenia liu et al 2020 thus dnra increase also changed the dominant anammox bacteria for promoting whole nitrogen metabolism to achieve better nitrogen removal especially with organic carbon source amendments previous studies he et al 2023 zhang et al 2021 reported that organic carbon amendment improved anammox activities in mixed cultures but anammox bacteria are autotrophs so the results are interesting because the enhancement mechanisms were not discussed in the study some recent studies valiente et al 2022 wang et al 2022b argued that dnra bacteria thriving in anammox bioreactors could consume organic carbons to reduce nitrate to nitrite and ammonium our results aligned with the previous studies and showed that dnra bacteria could exercise positive effects of dnra on anammox 3 4 nitrogen removal mechanism of anammox sludge with double edged sword effects of dnra as shown in fig s3 translation ribosomal structure and biogenesis amino acid transport and metabolism cell wall membrane envelope biogenesis energy production and conversion and co enzyme transport and metabolism were the dominant bacterial functions of the anammox sludge all these functions had no apparent variations during the whole reactor operation fig 5 shows a pca plot for taxa abundance bacteria of dnra anammox and denitrification and reactor performance the removal efficiency of nh4 n and no2 n bacteria of dnra and anammox both contributed some positive effects to the anammox mbr it is evident that the removal efficiency of no2 n was positively correlated with anammox and dnra bacteria however the correlation of dnra bacteria was stronger than anammox bacteria although nitrite concentrations were regarded as an essential factor affecting the anammox mbr performances the results also corresponded to the change of dnra bacteria abundance directly affecting anammox reactor performance moreover nh4 n removal efficiency was well correlated with the relatively high abundance of anammox bacteria in stage 1 however the anammox performance finally crashed when dnra bacteria became dominant in the later stages in stage 3 reactor performance recovery was dependent on no2 n removal efficiency enhancement due to the recovery of anammox and dnra bacteria based on the above analysis dnra had the double edged sword effects on anammox in our study as shown in fig 6 dnra could effectively reduce no3 n a by product of anammox activity eq 1 in fig 1 into no2 n and nh4 n by utilizing eps or other extracellular organic carbon that were most likely produced by anammox bacteria dnra and anammox bacteria could maintain a balanced system for efficient nitrogen removal as observed in stage 3 and a few other studies li et al 2020 sheng et al 2021 the positive effect of dnra provided a credible answer to why anammox systems in the literature did not have the same theoretical 1 33 rationh4 n no2 n keren et al 2020 it is also a plausible mechanism for some observations that anammox activities could be enhanced by adding organic carbon wang et al 2021b on the other hand the concentrations of no2 n accumulation due to the dnra bacteria could have adverse effects on anammox bacteria even causing the anammox reactor crash for example the overgrowth of dnra bacteria broke the nitrogen metabolism balance resulting in anammox inhibition with high no2 n concentrations stage 1 performance for the inhibition situation denitrification bacteria could take over dnra bacteria to reduce no2 n to no n2o or n2 eq 3 in fig 1 relatively high no2 n loadings also led candidatus kuenenia to become the dominant anammox bacteria which were more tolerant to nitrite toxicity organic carbon source and no2 n loading played significant roles in dnra effects on anammox it was reported that the organic carbon sources could be the driving force for dnra and denitrification castro barros et al 2017 and dnra process could be the main nitrogen sink in various circumstances wang et al 2022c also showed that the total nitrogen removal efficiency could be significantly increased by enhancing the dnra activities in an anammox system even when the influent cod n ratio was low 4 conclusions the mbr reactor had an over 95 no2 n and nh4 n removal efficiency before its performance crashed at a rationh4 n no2 n of 1 60 and a 100 mg l no2 n concentration the overgrowth of dnra bacteria compared with the anammox bacteria in the mbr caused no2 n accumulation and finally resulted in anammox bacteria inhibition which was considered the negative effect of the dnra bacteria on the anammox bacteria on the other hand a low rationh4 n no2 n of 1 20 with 80 mg l no2 n concentration effectively promoted dnra while mbr anammox reaction processed corresponding to the theoretical rationh4 n no2 n with 90 no2 n removal this was regarded as the positive effect of dnra on anammox author contributions lijie zhou contributed to the conceptualization methodology and writing review

14982,in rural areas where low temperature groundwater is used as a drinking water source cost effective sterilization techniques are needed to prevent groundwater consumers from the disease risks triggered by pathogenic microorganisms like escherichia coli and fungal spores in this study micro nano bubbles mnbs coupled with the tellurium te based catalysts were used to considerably enhance the solar disinfection sodis efficiency while overcoming the intrinsic defects of sodis particularly in low temperature sterilization tests showed that 6 5 log10 cfu ml of e coli k 12 and 4 0 log10 cfu ml of aspergillus niger spores were completely inactivated within 5 min while applying this novel process for disinfection of raw groundwater even in low temperature the underlying mechanisms of the extraordinary sterilization efficiency were revealed through comprehensive characterization of the catalysts and the physiological changes of the microorganisms the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of the te catalysts was identified to take advantage of photothermal synergism to achieve cell death the integration of mnbs with the facet engineered te catalysts improved the photothermal catalytic effect and extracellular electron transfer which substantially strengthened disinfection efficiency this study provides a targeted solution into microbial inactivation in groundwater and emphasizes a cost effective groundwater sterilization process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords low temperature groundwater micro nano bubbles facet engineered tellurium sterilization device data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction groundwater is used as the major source of drinking water in many rural places over the world for example around 34 of rural communities use groundwater as the drinking water source in china li et al 2022 anthropogenic activities in those places cause microbiological and chemical pollution of groundwater which threatens the health of water consumers anastasi et al 2013 soller et al 2014 for example outbreaks of groundwater borne escherichia coli e coli o157 h7 and aspergillus niger a niger spores have been reported in rural communities in new zealand and saudi arabia al sum et al 2012 bartholomew et al 2014 to protect consumers of groundwater from the health risks triggered by pathogenic microorganisms effective disinfection techniques to eliminate those microorganisms are urgently needed conventional disinfection techniques for groundwater sterilization suffer from several limitations e g uv radiation suffers from bacterial resurrection and light penetration in water chlor am ine disinfection generates toxic halogenated byproducts ozonation requires expensive generators which are unaffordable to people in rural places eischeid et al 2011 moreover the bactericidal activity of these conventional disinfection processes is low in groundwater because the average temperature of groundwater in most areas is lower than 20 c and the pathogenic microorganisms like fungi can go into a dormant state at low temperatures hähnlein et al 2013 keller et al 2010 ran et al 2010 shields et al 2008 in this context developing disinfection processes by taking advantages of the disinfection uv portion in sunlight and thermal properties of sunlight is gaining popularity considering the sustainability low cost and universal applicability related to the solar based processes dong et al 2018 xu et al 2017 conventional solar disinfection sodis has some limitations related to low disinfection efficiency and possible bacteria regrowth during the storage periods in darkness a promising strategy to overcome these limitations is to combine solar irradiation with catalysts with photothermal and or photocatalytic capabilities to generate locally high temperature and reactive species rss for microorganism inactivation alvear daza et al 2021 notably thermomechanical damage and thermal denaturation of proteins induced by hyperthermia 50 c can disrupt cell membranes to promote the direct oxidation of intracellular cytoplasm by rss tang et al 2022 this feature also can well solve problems of water disinfection at low temperatures of groundwater at present one popular focus in the development of photothermal catalysts is the use of localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of plasmonic noble metals jia et al 2020 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 very recently the lspr effect has been found in low cost semimetal tellurium te which achieves photothermal catalysis comparable to that of noble metals ishii et al 2017 ma et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 however limited studies are devoted to the dependence of photothermal catalytic reactivity on crystal facets of te controlled by hydrothermal times as identified crystal facet engineering can induce surface atomic arrangement and distorted electronic structure in the exposed facets of catalysts and a high index facet with a high percentage of under coordinated atoms and defects always exhibits high surface energy to capture and react with neighboring molecules he et al 2020 motivated by these facts the internal property of facet engineered te is expected to be excellent for efficient sodis which will be verified in this study although incorporating solar radiation with catalysts can improve the sodis process weak light intensity slow oxygen o2 mass transportation and fast photogenerated electron hole pairs recombination at the reaction interface severely affect the generation of rss and hyperthermia lowering the efficiency of water disinfection xia et al 2017 micro nano bubbles mnbs treatment is an effective technique for optimizing interfacial environments to enhance interface reactions in environmental restoration fan et al 2021a zhou et al 2022a mnbs have been reported to possess unique physicochemical properties related to low buoyancy high internal gas density and high lifetime which enhance the mass transportation of o2 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2022b moreover altering interfacial photoelectric effects such as the promotion of light absorption and enhancement of local photoelectric fields are also important properties of mnbs for enhanced photocatalytic water purification and disinfection fan et al 2021b therefore an integrated system coupling mnbs with te catalysts is hypothesized to enhance water disinfection but the underlying mechanisms have yet been explored in this work an mnbs assisted photothermal catalytic system for sodis enhancement was demonstrated the role of mnbs in accelerating interface reactions was discussed and highlighted the enhanced photothermal catalysis for facet engineered te was explained via electrochemical characterization together with the density functional theory calculations of the catalysts especially enzyme activity and microscopy characterizations indicated the extracellular electron extraction function by te nanorods for accelerated bacterial inactivation the novel process developed in this study was further used for disinfection of raw groundwater in low temperature via a simple device along with the analyses of engineering cost effectiveness and implementation potential 2 materials and methods all used chemicals were listed in text s1 in the supplementary

characterization analyses of e coli k 12 cells were demonstrated in text s4 the model simulation methods for optical absorption efficiency and photoelectric field distribution were documented in detail in text s5 the density functional theory dft calculation processes were described in detail in text s6 2 1 mnbs disinfection device as shown in fig 1 a a pilot scale circulating flow through disinfection device was developed by incorporating an mnbs generator yc mnb yuchuang environmental technology co ltd and simulated solar light a solar simulator based on a 300 watt xenon lamp was used as the light source for the experiments pls sxe300d beijing perfect light technology co ltd 2000 w m2 the light was turned on 30 min before the experiment to stabilize the light intensity fig s1 showed the wavelength emission spectrum of the xenon lamp the circulating flow through reactor facilitated the efficient mixing and disinfection processes the low density property of te materials facilitates their separation from suspension for use in multiple test cycles fig 1b showed that the total number of mnbs in the suspension was 4 08 105 particles ml with an average diameter of 1 μm the mnbs suspension exhibited negative ζ potential in fig s2 the velocity and internal pressure during ascent were calculated to be 5 44 10 7 m s and 2 87 atm respectively the continuous supply of o2 was one of the key roles of mnbs fig 1c the morphology and properties of mnbs were described in detail in text s2 2 2 synthesis of facet engineered te materials 160 mg of na2teo3 and 1 0 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp were firstly dissolved in 70 ml of ultrapure water with vigorous stirring then 7 0 ml of nh3 h2o and 3 0 ml of n2h4 h2o were added into the solution the mixture was put into a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave then heated in an oven at 200 c for 10 h after that the autoclave was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature ca 25 c the precipitate obtained by centrifugation was washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol finally the precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h the obtained product was labeled as te 10 by changing the hydrothermal conditions while keeping the other processing parameters constant te 5 200 c 5 h te 7 200 c 7 h te 12 200 c 12 h and te 15 200 c 15 h were obtained 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 bacterial inactivation experiments since e coli and a niger are the dominant species in polluted groundwater it is necessary to inactivate them to prevent groundwater consumers from the disease risks triggered by pathogenic microorganisms wan et al 2020 cultivation and acquisition of the e coli k 12 cells obtained from guangdong microbial culture collection center the e coli k 12 cells were cultured in luria bertani broth for 16 h 37 c and then washed twice with sterile saline 0 9 sodium chloride to obtain a suitable concentration of e coli k 12 suspension xia et al 2019 cultivation and acquisition of the a niger spores obtained from xi an university of architecture and technology school of environmental and municipal engineering the a niger mycelium was cultured in dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol drbc agar for 7 14 days 27 c and washed with phosphate buffered solution pbs to obtain a suitable concentration of a niger spores suspension bacterial inactivation experiments were performed in low temperature groundwater taken from inspection wells in guangzhou china 23 07 n 113 39 e the groundwater quality parameters were monitored and the results were shown in table s1 before starting the experiments natural microorganisms were filtered with 0 22 μm filters firstly 500 ml of the appropriate concentration of bacterial solution 6 50 log10 cfu ml of e coli k 12 4 00 log10 cfu ml of a niger spores was prepared with the pre filtered groundwater mnbs and 500 mg of te were then added to the solution the reactor was placed under the stable xenon light source to start the experiment after different treatment times the reacted bacterial solution was obtained and used for culture and counting control group experiments were conducted under the same experimental conditions by controlling for variables each experiment was replicated three times the disinfection experiment of this system under real solar radiation was carried out e coli k 12 3 50 log10 cfu ml solar radiation power density 350 w m2 reaction time 5 min the te 10 catalyst was used and other experimental conditions were kept constant the conventional disinfection processes were performed under the same experimental conditions uv optical power density clo2 dosing and 3 dosing were set to 0 045 mw cm2 1 mg l and 1 mg l respectively bolton et al 2011 wen et al 2020 2017 2 3 2 determination of photothermal synergistic effect further disinfection experiments were carried out in photothermal and photocatalytic systems respectively the photocatalytic system was placed in an electrothermal thermostatic water bath to exclude the effect of high temperatures on cell inactivation in contrast the photothermal system was placed in a dark environment and heated at a heating rate of the solar te 10 mnbs system fig s3 2 3 3 statistical analysis all statistical tests were performed using the software origin using a level of significance fixed at 0 05 log base 10 transformations were made to achieve homogeneity of variance one way analysis of variance anova and pearson parametric correlation test were conducted to assess the statistical difference of the inactivation of microorganisms in different systems table s2 2 4 preliminary cost estimation the price of the te samples was calculated to be 0 563 g in table s3 the electricity consumed was approximately 0 00056 h 0 25 wt of the te sample was lost per cycle of the experiments in the flow through disinfection device based on the above data the operating cost for the system for water disinfection was 1 0 m3 the fixed investment cost includes the micro nano bubbles generator yc mnb yuchuang environmental technology co ltd and the circulating flow through disinfection device the micro nano bubbles generator is valued at 200 while the circulating flow through disinfection device for household use can be made from recycled glass plastic folded bottles which are literally free therefore a fixed investment of 200 together with an operating cost of 1 0 m3 should be acceptable by most users table s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection performance by coupling mnbs and te base photocatalysis frequently detected bacteria and fungi in groundwater sources require cost effective disinfection techniques for their inactivation especially for fungal spores with disinfectant resistance rodriguez gonzalez et al 2020 sisti et al 2012 tang et al 2022 wen et al 2020 experiments were first conducted to evaluate the inactivation efficiency of different disinfection processes on a niger spores and e coli k 12 in low temperature groundwater notably mnbs treatment and the combination of solar irradiation with mnbs showed low disinfection efficiencies as shown in fig 2 a the solar te 10 mnbs system exhibited the best disinfection efficiency inactivating 3 97 log10 cfu ml of the a niger cells in 5 min clo2 uv and ozone disinfection p 0 05 only inactivated 3 97 2 82 and 0 15 log10 cfu ml of the cells after 60 min respectively for the inactivation of e coli k 12 fig 2b all the disinfection processes apart from mnbs treatment and solar mnbs treatment inactivated around 6 50 log10 cfu ml of the e coli k 12 cells in 10 min p 0 05 therefore the solar te 10 mnbs system showed significant superiority over conventional sterilization technologies for low temperature groundwater disinfection to reveal the excellent disinfection performance of the solar te 10 mnbs system the inactivation performances of e coli k 12 by the solar mnbs te 10 mnbs solar te 10 and solar te 10 mnbs systems were evaluated in fig 2c the stable and culturable e coli k 12 cells were observed without external stimuli red line only 0 79 and 1 12 log10 cfu ml of the cells were observed to be inactivated when solar mnbs and te 10 mnbs were applied to the reactor for 5 min green line and yellow line respectively significantly different from the solar mnbs and te 10 mnbs systems the solar te 10 system inactivated 5 47 log10 cfu ml of the cells blue line based on the photothermal and or photocatalytic effects more significantly the solar te 10 mnbs system inactivated 6 50 log10 cfu ml of the cells within 5 min orange line and maintained the excellent inactivation efficiency for five use cycles fig 2d the enhanced inactivation performance could be attributed to the role of mnbs in enhancing interfacial reactions fig s4 as mentioned above the photothermal and or photocatalytic effects were responsible for bacterial inactivation this hypothesis was confirmed by performing the photothermal and photocatalytic processes in fig 2e the photocatalytic and photothermal processes alone could inactivate 3 29 log10 cfu ml and 2 83 log10 cfu ml of the e coli k 12 cells respectively notably the inactivation efficiency of the solar te 10 mnbs system 6 50 log10 cfu ml was greater than the superposition of the two processes alone demonstrating a synergistic effect between the photocatalytic and photothermal processes more importantly the photocatalytic and photothermal effects were generated based on the lspr effect of te which was significantly influenced by the light wavelength light with different wavelength ranges was used to compare the sterilization performance in fig 2f as predicted the solar te 10 mnbs system exhibited different inactivation efficiencies with different light wavelengths notably 5 68 log10 cfu ml of the cells was inactivated when the wavelength was above 560 nm while 2 86 log10 cfu ml of the cells was inactivated when the wavelength was above 700 nm pearson r 0 87 this huge performance difference might reveal a quite different sterilization mechanism under 560 nm light the facet engineered te materials determined by the preparation time from 5 h to 15 h were prepared and used to study the effect on the sterilization efficiency in the solar te mnbs system fig 2g te 5 te 7 te 10 te 12 and te 15 inactivated 3 13 4 14 6 50 4 67 and 3 25 log10 cfu ml of the cells pearson r 0 09 respectively the sterilization performance of the te samples affected by the hydrothermal time showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing indicating that the morphology and properties of te played an important role in the solar te mnbs system moreover too little or too much photocatalyst dosage can lead to a decrease in sterilization efficiency therefore the te 10 sample was further used to study the effect of catalyst dosing as shown in fig 2h the best inactivation performance 6 50 log10 cfu ml of the cells was reached by 1 0 and 1 5 mg ml of te 10 interestingly 2 0 mg ml of te 10 only inactivated 5 64 log10 cfu ml of the cells pearson r 0 24 indicating that the possible inhibition of light propagation caused by high catalyst dosage reduced the inactivation efficiency to evaluate the potential of the solar te 10 mnbs system for application in real environments real world solar irradiation was used notably 3 50 log10 cfu ml of e coli k 12 cells were completely inactivated by one cycle solar te 10 mnbs treatment suggesting that the solar te 10 mnbs system could meet the requirements for disinfection of low temperature groundwater in rural areas figs 2i and s5 moreover the spread plate assay confirmed that the treated cells were non culturable and completely inactivated fig s6 3 2 mnbs stimulated photocatalytic and photothermal inactivation mnbs with an average diameter of 1 μm could act as an o2 bank to sustainably supply o2 and enhance the interfacial o2 mass transportation in the solar te 10 mnbs system fig 1c as identified the provision of mnbs would alter the interfacial photoelectric effect finite difference time domain fdtd model simulations showed the interfacial photoelectric field of different systems in fig 3 a the highly heterogeneous electric fields with periodic oscillation were found in solutions under solar irradiation notably the mnb te 10 and te 10 mnb systems showed the significantly enhanced regional electric field compared to the pure water while the strongest regional electric field was found on the surface of te 10 mnb fig s7 therefore it could be predicted that sufficient o2 supply rapid o2 mass transportation and enhanced regional photoelectric field would potentiate water disinfection through strengthened interface reactions apparently the high dissolved oxygen content fast o2 mass transportation enhanced regional electric field and light absorption could promote the generation of rss fan et al 2021a the generation of rss investigated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr fig 3b showed that superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 was generated in the solar te 10 and solar te 10 mnbs system the boosted signals in the solar te 10 mnbs system demonstrated that the generation of o2 and 1o2 was significantly promoted by the supply of mnbs notably no signal of hydroxyl radicals oh was detected even in the mnbs environment which was confirmed by the scavenging tests in fig s8 the addition of isopropanol scavenger for oh had little effect on the disinfection efficiency significantly different from oh the quenching of o2 and 1o2 addition of tempol and nan3 only inactivated 2 65 and 3 67 log10 cfu ml of the cells respectively indicating the dominant role of o2 and 1o2 in this work for water disinfection therefore the introduction of mnbs significantly enhanced the generation of rss o2 and 1o2 to accelerate cell inactivation large amounts of rss would be depleted in destroying cell membranes since cell membranes are mainly composed of polysaccharides proteins phospholipids and other macromolecular organics chen et al 2021 nonetheless thermomechanical damage and thermal denaturation of proteins induced by hyperthermia 50 c can disrupt cell membranes to promote the direct oxidation of intracellular cytoplasm by rss the photothermal conversion ability of te assessed by infrared thermographic images fig 3e showed that the fast photothermal conversion based on the lspr effect rapidly raised the temperature of te 10 to 60 c after 5 min of solar irradiation the generated high temperature heated the te 10 suspension since the temperature of pure water was much lower than that of the te 10 suspension notably as shown in figs 3e and s9 the introduction of mnbs contributed to a further increase in temperature which might be one of the reasons for enhanced groundwater disinfection the o nitrophenyl β d galactopyranoside onpg hydrolysis rate was used to evaluate the effect of hyperthermia on the cell membrane permeability fig 3c the photocatalytic effect generated rss that increased the cell membrane permeability through oxidation this contribution was much lower than that of hyperthermia generated by the photothermal process highlighting the photothermal effect responsible for cell membrane disruption the higher cell membrane permeability induced by the solar te 10 preheating treatment process than the solar te 10 process further confirmed this conclusion moreover the photothermal synergism was further confirmed by the fact that the cell membrane permeability treated by the solar te 10 mnbs process was much higher than the sum of the photothermal and photocatalytic processes more importantly the solar te 10 mnbs process exhibited the highest cell membrane permeability confirming the crucial role of mnbs in enhancing the generation of rss and hyperthermia the results of the fluorescent based staining tests showed that the red fluorescence representing cell membrane disruption occupied the entire image after 5 min of treatment confirming the excellent cell membrane disrupting ability of the solar te 10 mnbs process fig s10 the destruction of cell membranes reduced the oxidation load of rss and promoted the direct entry of rss into the cells to participate in the oxidation of cytoplasm sun et al 2016 the content of intracellular rss was studied and the results were shown in fig 3d the photocatalytic process exhibited the higher content of intracellular rss than the photothermal process since the photocatalytic process generated more rss notably more intracellular rss were found in the solar te 10 mnbs process than the sum of the photothermal and photocatalytic processes in combination with the aforementioned analysis a photothermal synergism was proposed where the photothermal effect disrupted cell membranes while the photocatalytic effect primarily generated rss and the disrupted cell membrane promoted the direct penetration of rss into the cells to achieve complete cell death higher temperatures and more rss would result in more intracellular rss as confirmed by the highest content of intracellular rss in the solar te 10 mnbs system therefore mnbs promoted the photothermal synergism by enhancing interface reactions for the enhancement of water disinfection notably the highest quantity of intracellular rss in the solar te 10 mnbs system led to a decrease in the adenosine triphosphate atp content and the activities of catalase cat glutathione gsh and superoxide dismutase sod to 0 after 5 min of treatment fig s11 indicating complete cell death the conclusion was confirmed by the results of the scanning electron microscope sem images fig s12 3 3 interfacial disinfection induced by facet engineered te facet engineered te materials were employed to enhance interfacial disinfection by promoting electron transfer and o2 adsorption activation the morphologies of the as prepared samples were investigated by sem and transmission electron microscope tem in fig 4 a b te 10 and te 5 exhibited nanorod structure while te 10 nanorods were longer than te 5 nanorods this result demonstrated that the te nanorods would continue to grow with increasing time during the 10 h hydrothermal time when the hydrothermal time was prolonged to 15 h te 15 nanosheets were formed in fig 4c high resolution tem hrtem image of te 10 showed the characteristic 100 101 and 012 planes of crystalline te fig s13 confirming that the te materials were successfully synthesized the crystal structure was studied by x ray diffraction xrd showed that the samples showed the pure te phase jcpds 36 1452 the strongest diffraction peak attributed to the 100 plane was detected in te 5 and te 10 interestingly although te 15 maintained the strongest 100 plane the proportion of the 101 plane exposed increased significantly due to the formation of nanosheet structure therefore te was first grown along the 001 direction to form nanorods and then aggregated to form nanosheets in the hydrothermal process which might result in the te materials exhibiting significantly different physicochemical properties in the uv vis spectra fig s14a two absorption peaks around 350 and 560 nm could be observed in the samples which were attributed to an allowed direct transition 3 6 ev and a forbidden transition 0 3 ev triggered by the lspr effect of te respectively han et al 2019 the fdtd model simulations figs s14b d further confirmed that the lspr effect of te was triggered by the light at a wavelength near 560 nm the migration and interface reactivity of charges were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis fig 4e showed that te 10 with the smallest arc radius exhibited the highest charge transfer efficiency in the photocurrent responses fig 4f the photocurrent intensity of te 10 was significantly stronger than that of te 5 and te 15 under solar irradiation revealing the highest separation efficiency of electron hole pairs over te 10 moreover the stable and reproducible photocurrents and the intact morphological structure fig s15 after reactions together confirmed the excellent stability of the te samples based on the above analyses te models with different exposed planes were constructed as shown in fig s16 the main exposed surfaces of te 10 and te 15 were the 100 and 101 planes respectively facet engineered te samples were predicted to promote the capture and reaction with neighboring o2 molecules in the mnbs environment the adsorption energies eads of o2 on the surfaces of te 10 and te 15 were first performed and the results were shown in fig 4g h te 10 0 98 ev exhibited much higher eads than te 15 0 54 ev indicating that te 10 with the 100 plane was easier to adsorb activate o2 the longer oo bond and more obtained electrons of the adsorbed o2 on the surface of te 10 1 31 1 28 å 0 56 0 39 e further confirmed the anticipation apparently this result was consistent with the fast electron transfer of te 10 the adsorption behavior of h2o was also performed in figs 4i and s17 the oh radicals could not be formed on the surface of the te samples due to the low eads 0 10 ev and weak bond length variation 0 01 å of the adsorbed h2o which confirmed the results of the esr tests as identified above the best water disinfection performance of te 10 was attributed to the highest separation efficiency of electron hole pairs the fastest charge transfer and the most efficient capture and activation of o2 contact between catalysts and cells has been reported to induce extracellular electron transfer which destroys cell membranes and accelerates cell inactivation fu et al 2021 the kelvin probe force microscopy kpfm mode of atomic force microscope afm was used to investigate the extracellular electron transfer in the afm image fig 5 a the e coli k 12 cells with a length of 1 6 μm were detected five regions of the corresponding kpfm images fig 5b c were randomly selected for quantification of contact potential difference and work function the initial contact potential difference and work function were calculated to be 116 mv and 4 184 ev in table 1 respectively after contact with te 10 for a period of time the contact potential difference decreased to 106 mv while the work function increased to 4 194 ev revealing that te 10 captured cellular electrons through the built in electric field generated at the material cell contact interface the extracellular electron transfer affected the life activities of the cells since the atp and gsh contents in fig 5d e increased rapidly after te 10 contact with the cells in the linear sweep voltammetry lsv curves fig 5f the attachment of live cells to te 10 led to extracellular electron transfer that enhanced the current this result was consistent with the results of kpfm images in contrast the attachment of inactivated cells led to an increased resistance that reduced the current interestingly the enhancement of extracellular electron transfer by mnbs was revealed since the introduction of mnbs exhibited the strongest current the reasons behind might be that 1 the mnbs environment accelerated cellular life activities 2 the enhanced o2 mass transportation provided electron carriers to promote electron extraction and 3 the electron deficient state of te 10 due to o2 reduction promoted the extracellular electron transfer in conclusion groundwater disinfection was facilitated through the enhanced interface reactions enhanced photothermal synergism and extracellular electron transfer induced by the combination of mnbs with the facet engineered te materials 3 4 implementation potential the sustainable development goals no 6 sdg 6 claimed that ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is a worldwide pursuit in rural areas where low temperature groundwater is used as a drinking water source the current study demonstrated that the solar te 10 mnbs system prevents groundwater consumers from the disease risks triggered by pathogenic microorganisms like e coli and fungal spores for the practicality and scalability of the solar te 10 mnbs system it can be directly installed behind hand pressed wells fig s18 as shown in fig s18 the solar te 10 mnbs system consists of an mnbs generator and a circulating flow through disinfection device among them the circulating flow through disinfection device can be replaced by clear glass plastic folded flow reactors to fully utilize solar light the industrial molding te pellets are held in the reactor by supports for easy replacement under sunlight illumination the solar te 10 mnbs system effectively inactivates a variety of microorganisms in the outlet water of hand pressed wells without the introduction of any additional chemical reagents affordable water disinfection technologies are especially important the application of cdte thin film cells and the abundant te mineral resources in china have driven the development of the te material industry moreover inexpensive micro nano bubble devices based on the proven micro nano bubble technology are gradually being applied in the kitchens of households based on these developments the fixed investment and operating cost for this work were calculated to be 200 and 1 0 m3 respectively which was similar to or even lower than that of other point of use water disinfection technologies table s5 moreover the solar te 10 process can meet the needs of consumers with limited funds and less stringent water quality requirements in conclusion this work provides a cost effective technology for low temperature groundwater disinfection 4 conclusions this work highlighted a novel approach to enhance the sodis of low temperature groundwater by the mnbs assisted photothermal activation of facet engineered te materials in a circulating flow through disinfection device the approach achieved complete inactivation of target concentrations of a niger and e coli k 12 in 5 min which was significantly superior to the conventional disinfection techniques the introduction of mnbs was proven to increase dissolved oxygen content promote o2 mass transportation and optimize the interfacial photoelectric effect thus enhancing interface reactions related to the generation of rss and hyperthermia as well as extracellular electron transfer the lspr effect of te was identified to take advantage of photothermal synergism to achieve efficient and complete cell inactivation the photothermal synergism was proposed that rss generated by the photocatalytic effect entered directly into the cells whose cell membranes were disrupted by the photothermal effect and reacted with cytoplasm to achieve complete cell death the perfect applicability of facet engineered te materials in mnbs environment was also demonstrated this work provides new insights on catalyst microorganism electron heat transfer mechanisms and

14982,in rural areas where low temperature groundwater is used as a drinking water source cost effective sterilization techniques are needed to prevent groundwater consumers from the disease risks triggered by pathogenic microorganisms like escherichia coli and fungal spores in this study micro nano bubbles mnbs coupled with the tellurium te based catalysts were used to considerably enhance the solar disinfection sodis efficiency while overcoming the intrinsic defects of sodis particularly in low temperature sterilization tests showed that 6 5 log10 cfu ml of e coli k 12 and 4 0 log10 cfu ml of aspergillus niger spores were completely inactivated within 5 min while applying this novel process for disinfection of raw groundwater even in low temperature the underlying mechanisms of the extraordinary sterilization efficiency were revealed through comprehensive characterization of the catalysts and the physiological changes of the microorganisms the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of the te catalysts was identified to take advantage of photothermal synergism to achieve cell death the integration of mnbs with the facet engineered te catalysts improved the photothermal catalytic effect and extracellular electron transfer which substantially strengthened disinfection efficiency this study provides a targeted solution into microbial inactivation in groundwater and emphasizes a cost effective groundwater sterilization process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords low temperature groundwater micro nano bubbles facet engineered tellurium sterilization device data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction groundwater is used as the major source of drinking water in many rural places over the world for example around 34 of rural communities use groundwater as the drinking water source in china li et al 2022 anthropogenic activities in those places cause microbiological and chemical pollution of groundwater which threatens the health of water consumers anastasi et al 2013 soller et al 2014 for example outbreaks of groundwater borne escherichia coli e coli o157 h7 and aspergillus niger a niger spores have been reported in rural communities in new zealand and saudi arabia al sum et al 2012 bartholomew et al 2014 to protect consumers of groundwater from the health risks triggered by pathogenic microorganisms effective disinfection techniques to eliminate those microorganisms are urgently needed conventional disinfection techniques for groundwater sterilization suffer from several limitations e g uv radiation suffers from bacterial resurrection and light penetration in water chlor am ine disinfection generates toxic halogenated byproducts ozonation requires expensive generators which are unaffordable to people in rural places eischeid et al 2011 moreover the bactericidal activity of these conventional disinfection processes is low in groundwater because the average temperature of groundwater in most areas is lower than 20 c and the pathogenic microorganisms like fungi can go into a dormant state at low temperatures hähnlein et al 2013 keller et al 2010 ran et al 2010 shields et al 2008 in this context developing disinfection processes by taking advantages of the disinfection uv portion in sunlight and thermal properties of sunlight is gaining popularity considering the sustainability low cost and universal applicability related to the solar based processes dong et al 2018 xu et al 2017 conventional solar disinfection sodis has some limitations related to low disinfection efficiency and possible bacteria regrowth during the storage periods in darkness a promising strategy to overcome these limitations is to combine solar irradiation with catalysts with photothermal and or photocatalytic capabilities to generate locally high temperature and reactive species rss for microorganism inactivation alvear daza et al 2021 notably thermomechanical damage and thermal denaturation of proteins induced by hyperthermia 50 c can disrupt cell membranes to promote the direct oxidation of intracellular cytoplasm by rss tang et al 2022 this feature also can well solve problems of water disinfection at low temperatures of groundwater at present one popular focus in the development of photothermal catalysts is the use of localized surface plasmon resonance lspr of plasmonic noble metals jia et al 2020 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 very recently the lspr effect has been found in low cost semimetal tellurium te which achieves photothermal catalysis comparable to that of noble metals ishii et al 2017 ma et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 however limited studies are devoted to the dependence of photothermal catalytic reactivity on crystal facets of te controlled by hydrothermal times as identified crystal facet engineering can induce surface atomic arrangement and distorted electronic structure in the exposed facets of catalysts and a high index facet with a high percentage of under coordinated atoms and defects always exhibits high surface energy to capture and react with neighboring molecules he et al 2020 motivated by these facts the internal property of facet engineered te is expected to be excellent for efficient sodis which will be verified in this study although incorporating solar radiation with catalysts can improve the sodis process weak light intensity slow oxygen o2 mass transportation and fast photogenerated electron hole pairs recombination at the reaction interface severely affect the generation of rss and hyperthermia lowering the efficiency of water disinfection xia et al 2017 micro nano bubbles mnbs treatment is an effective technique for optimizing interfacial environments to enhance interface reactions in environmental restoration fan et al 2021a zhou et al 2022a mnbs have been reported to possess unique physicochemical properties related to low buoyancy high internal gas density and high lifetime which enhance the mass transportation of o2 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2022b moreover altering interfacial photoelectric effects such as the promotion of light absorption and enhancement of local photoelectric fields are also important properties of mnbs for enhanced photocatalytic water purification and disinfection fan et al 2021b therefore an integrated system coupling mnbs with te catalysts is hypothesized to enhance water disinfection but the underlying mechanisms have yet been explored in this work an mnbs assisted photothermal catalytic system for sodis enhancement was demonstrated the role of mnbs in accelerating interface reactions was discussed and highlighted the enhanced photothermal catalysis for facet engineered te was explained via electrochemical characterization together with the density functional theory calculations of the catalysts especially enzyme activity and microscopy characterizations indicated the extracellular electron extraction function by te nanorods for accelerated bacterial inactivation the novel process developed in this study was further used for disinfection of raw groundwater in low temperature via a simple device along with the analyses of engineering cost effectiveness and implementation potential 2 materials and methods all used chemicals were listed in text s1 in the supplementary information the morphology and properties of mnbs were described in detail text s2 characterization of the catalysts dissolved oxygen and free radical test methods were presented in text s3 characterization analyses of e coli k 12 cells were demonstrated in text s4 the model simulation methods for optical absorption efficiency and photoelectric field distribution were documented in detail in text s5 the density functional theory dft calculation processes were described in detail in text s6 2 1 mnbs disinfection device as shown in fig 1 a a pilot scale circulating flow through disinfection device was developed by incorporating an mnbs generator yc mnb yuchuang environmental technology co ltd and simulated solar light a solar simulator based on a 300 watt xenon lamp was used as the light source for the experiments pls sxe300d beijing perfect light technology co ltd 2000 w m2 the light was turned on 30 min before the experiment to stabilize the light intensity fig s1 showed the wavelength emission spectrum of the xenon lamp the circulating flow through reactor facilitated the efficient mixing and disinfection processes the low density property of te materials facilitates their separation from suspension for use in multiple test cycles fig 1b showed that the total number of mnbs in the suspension was 4 08 105 particles ml with an average diameter of 1 μm the mnbs suspension exhibited negative ζ potential in fig s2 the velocity and internal pressure during ascent were calculated to be 5 44 10 7 m s and 2 87 atm respectively the continuous supply of o2 was one of the key roles of mnbs fig 1c the morphology and properties of mnbs were described in detail in text s2 2 2 synthesis of facet engineered te materials 160 mg of na2teo3 and 1 0 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp were firstly dissolved in 70 ml of ultrapure water with vigorous stirring then 7 0 ml of nh3 h2o and 3 0 ml of n2h4 h2o were added into the solution the mixture was put into a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave then heated in an oven at 200 c for 10 h after that the autoclave was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature ca 25 c the precipitate obtained by centrifugation was washed several times with ultrapure water and ethanol finally the precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h the obtained product was labeled as te 10 by changing the hydrothermal conditions while keeping the other processing parameters constant te 5 200 c 5 h te 7 200 c 7 h te 12 200 c 12 h and te 15 200 c 15 h were obtained 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 bacterial inactivation experiments since e coli and a niger are the dominant species in polluted groundwater it is necessary to inactivate them to prevent groundwater consumers from the disease risks triggered by pathogenic microorganisms wan et al 2020 cultivation and acquisition of the e coli k 12 cells obtained from guangdong microbial culture collection center the e coli k 12 cells were cultured in luria bertani broth for 16 h 37 c and then washed twice with sterile saline 0 9 sodium chloride to obtain a suitable concentration of e coli k 12 suspension xia et al 2019 cultivation and acquisition of the a niger spores obtained from xi an university of architecture and technology school of environmental and municipal engineering the a niger mycelium was cultured in dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol drbc agar for 7 14 days 27 c and washed with phosphate buffered solution pbs to obtain a suitable concentration of a niger spores suspension bacterial inactivation experiments were performed in low temperature groundwater taken from inspection wells in guangzhou china 23 07 n 113 39 e the groundwater quality parameters were monitored and the results were shown in table s1 before starting the experiments natural microorganisms were filtered with 0 22 μm filters firstly 500 ml of the appropriate concentration of bacterial solution 6 50 log10 cfu ml of e coli k 12 4 00 log10 cfu ml of a niger spores was prepared with the pre filtered groundwater mnbs and 500 mg of te were then added to the solution the reactor was placed under the stable xenon light source to start the experiment after different treatment times the reacted bacterial solution was obtained and used for culture and counting control group experiments were conducted under the same experimental conditions by controlling for variables each experiment was replicated three times the disinfection experiment of this system under real solar radiation was carried out e coli k 12 3 50 log10 cfu ml solar radiation power density 350 w m2 reaction time 5 min the te 10 catalyst was used and other experimental conditions were kept constant the conventional disinfection processes were performed under the same experimental conditions uv optical power density clo2 dosing and 3 dosing were set to 0 045 mw cm2 1 mg l and 1 mg l respectively bolton et al 2011 wen et al 2020 2017 2 3 2 determination of photothermal synergistic effect further disinfection experiments were carried out in photothermal and photocatalytic systems respectively the photocatalytic system was placed in an electrothermal thermostatic water bath to exclude the effect of high temperatures on cell inactivation in contrast the photothermal system was placed in a dark environment and heated at a heating rate of the solar te 10 mnbs system fig s3 2 3 3 statistical analysis all statistical tests were performed using the software origin using a level of significance fixed at 0 05 log base 10 transformations were made to achieve homogeneity of variance one way analysis of variance anova and pearson parametric correlation test were conducted to assess the statistical difference of the inactivation of microorganisms in different systems table s2 2 4 preliminary cost estimation the price of the te samples was calculated to be 0 563 g in table s3 the electricity consumed was approximately 0 00056 h 0 25 wt of the te sample was lost per cycle of the experiments in the flow through disinfection device based on the above data the operating cost for the system for water disinfection was 1 0 m3 the fixed investment cost includes the micro nano bubbles generator yc mnb yuchuang environmental technology co ltd and the circulating flow through disinfection device the micro nano bubbles generator is valued at 200 while the circulating flow through disinfection device for household use can be made from recycled glass plastic folded bottles which are literally free therefore a fixed investment of 200 together with an operating cost of 1 0 m3 should be acceptable by most users table s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection performance by coupling mnbs and te base photocatalysis frequently detected bacteria and fungi in groundwater sources require cost effective disinfection techniques for their inactivation especially for fungal spores with disinfectant resistance rodriguez gonzalez et al 2020 sisti et al 2012 tang et al 2022 wen et al 2020 experiments were first conducted to evaluate the inactivation efficiency of different disinfection processes on a niger spores and e coli k 12 in low temperature groundwater notably mnbs treatment and the combination of solar irradiation with mnbs showed low disinfection efficiencies as shown in fig 2 a the solar te 10 mnbs system exhibited the best disinfection efficiency inactivating 3 97 log10 cfu ml of the a niger cells in 5 min clo2 uv and ozone disinfection p 0 05 only inactivated 3 97 2 82 and 0 15 log10 cfu ml of the cells after 60 min respectively for the inactivation of e coli k 12 fig 2b all the disinfection processes apart from mnbs treatment and solar mnbs treatment inactivated around 6 50 log10 cfu ml of the e coli k 12 cells in 10 min p 0 05 therefore the solar te 10 mnbs system showed significant superiority over conventional sterilization technologies for low temperature groundwater disinfection to reveal the excellent disinfection performance of the solar te 10 mnbs system the inactivation performances of e coli k 12 by the solar mnbs te 10 mnbs solar te 10 and solar te 10 mnbs systems were evaluated in fig 2c the stable and culturable e coli k 12 cells were observed without external stimuli red line only 0 79 and 1 12 log10 cfu ml of the cells were observed to be inactivated when solar mnbs and te 10 mnbs were applied to the reactor for 5 min green line and yellow line respectively significantly different from the solar mnbs and te 10 mnbs systems the solar te 10 system inactivated 5 47 log10 cfu ml of the cells blue line based on the photothermal and or photocatalytic effects more significantly the solar te 10 mnbs system inactivated 6 50 log10 cfu ml of the cells within 5 min orange line and maintained the excellent inactivation efficiency for five use cycles fig 2d the enhanced inactivation performance could be attributed to the role of mnbs in enhancing interfacial reactions fig s4 as mentioned above the photothermal and or photocatalytic effects were responsible for bacterial inactivation this hypothesis was confirmed by performing the photothermal and photocatalytic processes in fig 2e the photocatalytic and photothermal processes alone could inactivate 3 29 log10 cfu ml and 2 83 log10 cfu ml of the e coli k 12 cells respectively notably the inactivation efficiency of the solar te 10 mnbs system 6 50 log10 cfu ml was greater than the superposition of the two processes alone demonstrating a synergistic effect between the photocatalytic and photothermal processes more importantly the photocatalytic and photothermal effects were generated based on the lspr effect of te which was significantly influenced by the light wavelength light with different wavelength ranges was used to compare the sterilization performance in fig 2f as predicted the solar te 10 mnbs system exhibited different inactivation efficiencies with different light wavelengths notably 5 68 log10 cfu ml of the cells was inactivated when the wavelength was above 560 nm while 2 86 log10 cfu ml of the cells was inactivated when the wavelength was above 700 nm pearson r 0 87 this huge performance difference might reveal a quite different sterilization mechanism under 560 nm light the facet engineered te materials determined by the preparation time from 5 h to 15 h were prepared and used to study the effect on the sterilization efficiency in the solar te mnbs system fig 2g te 5 te 7 te 10 te 12 and te 15 inactivated 3 13 4 14 6 50 4 67 and 3 25 log10 cfu ml of the cells pearson r 0 09 respectively the sterilization performance of the te samples affected by the hydrothermal time showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing indicating that the morphology and properties of te played an important role in the solar te mnbs system moreover too little or too much photocatalyst dosage can lead to a decrease in sterilization efficiency therefore the te 10 sample was further used to study the effect of catalyst dosing as shown in fig 2h the best inactivation performance 6 50 log10 cfu ml of the cells was reached by 1 0 and 1 5 mg ml of te 10 interestingly 2 0 mg ml of te 10 only inactivated 5 64 log10 cfu ml of the cells pearson r 0 24 indicating that the possible inhibition of light propagation caused by high catalyst dosage reduced the inactivation efficiency to evaluate the potential of the solar te 10 mnbs system for application in real environments real world solar irradiation was used notably 3 50 log10 cfu ml of e coli k 12 cells were completely inactivated by one cycle solar te 10 mnbs treatment suggesting that the solar te 10 mnbs system could meet the requirements for disinfection of low temperature groundwater in rural areas figs 2i and s5 moreover the spread plate assay confirmed that the treated cells were non culturable and completely inactivated fig s6 3 2 mnbs stimulated photocatalytic and photothermal inactivation mnbs with an average diameter of 1 μm could act as an o2 bank to sustainably supply o2 and enhance the interfacial o2 mass transportation in the solar te 10 mnbs system fig 1c as identified the provision of mnbs would alter the interfacial photoelectric effect finite difference time domain fdtd model simulations showed the interfacial photoelectric field of different systems in fig 3 a the highly heterogeneous electric fields with periodic oscillation were found in solutions under solar irradiation notably the mnb te 10 and te 10 mnb systems showed the significantly enhanced regional electric field compared to the pure water while the strongest regional electric field was found on the surface of te 10 mnb fig s7 therefore it could be predicted that sufficient o2 supply rapid o2 mass transportation and enhanced regional photoelectric field would potentiate water disinfection through strengthened interface reactions apparently the high dissolved oxygen content fast o2 mass transportation enhanced regional electric field and light absorption could promote the generation of rss fan et al 2021a the generation of rss investigated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy esr fig 3b showed that superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 was generated in the solar te 10 and solar te 10 mnbs system the boosted signals in the solar te 10 mnbs system demonstrated that the generation of o2 and 1o2 was significantly promoted by the supply of mnbs notably no signal of hydroxyl radicals oh was detected even in the mnbs environment which was confirmed by the scavenging tests in fig s8 the addition of isopropanol scavenger for oh had little effect on the disinfection efficiency significantly different from oh the quenching of o2 and 1o2 addition of tempol and nan3 only inactivated 2 65 and 3 67 log10 cfu ml of the cells respectively indicating the dominant role of o2 and 1o2 in this work for water disinfection therefore the introduction of mnbs significantly enhanced the generation of rss o2 and 1o2 to accelerate cell inactivation large amounts of rss would be depleted in destroying cell membranes since cell membranes are mainly composed of polysaccharides proteins phospholipids and other macromolecular organics chen et al 2021 nonetheless thermomechanical damage and thermal denaturation of proteins induced by hyperthermia 50 c can disrupt cell membranes to promote the direct oxidation of intracellular cytoplasm by rss the photothermal conversion ability of te assessed by infrared thermographic images fig 3e showed that the fast photothermal conversion based on the lspr effect rapidly raised the temperature of te 10 to 60 c after 5 min of solar irradiation the generated high temperature heated the te 10 suspension since the temperature of pure water was much lower than that of the te 10 suspension notably as shown in figs 3e and s9 the introduction of mnbs contributed to a further increase in temperature which might be one of the reasons for enhanced groundwater disinfection the o nitrophenyl β d galactopyranoside onpg hydrolysis rate was used to evaluate the effect of hyperthermia on the cell membrane permeability fig 3c the photocatalytic effect generated rss that increased the cell membrane permeability through oxidation this contribution was much lower than that of hyperthermia generated by the photothermal process highlighting the photothermal effect responsible for cell membrane disruption the higher cell membrane permeability induced by the solar te 10 preheating treatment process than the solar te 10 process further confirmed this conclusion moreover the photothermal synergism was further confirmed by the fact that the cell membrane permeability treated by the solar te 10 mnbs process was much higher than the sum of the photothermal and photocatalytic processes more importantly the solar te 10 mnbs process exhibited the highest cell membrane permeability confirming the crucial role of mnbs in enhancing the generation of rss and hyperthermia the results of the fluorescent based staining tests showed that the red fluorescence representing cell membrane disruption occupied the entire image after 5 min of treatment confirming the excellent cell membrane disrupting ability of the solar te 10 mnbs process fig s10 the destruction of cell membranes reduced the oxidation load of rss and promoted the direct entry of rss into the cells to participate in the oxidation of cytoplasm sun et al 2016 the content of intracellular rss was studied and the results were shown in fig 3d the photocatalytic process exhibited the higher content of intracellular rss than the photothermal process since the photocatalytic process generated more rss notably more intracellular rss were found in the solar te 10 mnbs process than the sum of the photothermal and photocatalytic processes in combination with the aforementioned analysis a photothermal synergism was proposed where the photothermal effect disrupted cell membranes while the photocatalytic effect primarily generated rss and the disrupted cell membrane promoted the direct penetration of rss into the cells to achieve complete cell death higher temperatures and more rss would result in more intracellular rss as confirmed by the highest content of intracellular rss in the solar te 10 mnbs system therefore mnbs promoted the photothermal synergism by enhancing interface reactions for the enhancement of water disinfection notably the highest quantity of intracellular rss in the solar te 10 mnbs system led to a decrease in the adenosine triphosphate atp content and the activities of catalase cat glutathione gsh and superoxide dismutase sod to 0 after 5 min of treatment fig s11 indicating complete cell death the conclusion was confirmed by the results of the scanning electron microscope sem images fig s12 3 3 interfacial disinfection induced by facet engineered te facet engineered te materials were employed to enhance interfacial disinfection by promoting electron transfer and o2 adsorption activation the morphologies of the as prepared samples were investigated by sem and transmission electron microscope tem in fig 4 a b te 10 and te 5 exhibited nanorod structure while te 10 nanorods were longer than te 5 nanorods this result demonstrated that the te nanorods would continue to grow with increasing time during the 10 h hydrothermal time when the hydrothermal time was prolonged to 15 h te 15 nanosheets were formed in fig 4c high resolution tem hrtem image of te 10 showed the characteristic 100 101 and 012 planes of crystalline te fig s13 confirming that the te materials were successfully synthesized the crystal structure was studied by x ray diffraction xrd showed that the samples showed the pure te phase jcpds 36 1452 the strongest diffraction peak attributed to the 100 plane was detected in te 5 and te 10 interestingly although te 15 maintained the strongest 100 plane the proportion of the 101 plane exposed increased significantly due to the formation of nanosheet structure therefore te was first grown along the 001 direction to form nanorods and then aggregated to form nanosheets in the hydrothermal process which might result in the te materials exhibiting significantly different physicochemical properties in the uv vis spectra fig s14a two absorption peaks around 350 and 560 nm could be observed in the samples which were attributed to an allowed direct transition 3 6 ev and a forbidden transition 0 3 ev triggered by the lspr effect of te respectively han et al 2019 the fdtd model simulations figs s14b d further confirmed that the lspr effect of te was triggered by the light at a wavelength near 560 nm the migration and interface reactivity of charges were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis fig 4e showed that te 10 with the smallest arc radius exhibited the highest charge transfer efficiency in the photocurrent responses fig 4f the photocurrent intensity of te 10 was significantly stronger than that of te 5 and te 15 under solar irradiation revealing the highest separation efficiency of electron hole pairs over te 10 moreover the stable and reproducible photocurrents and the intact morphological structure fig s15 after reactions together confirmed the excellent stability of the te samples based on the above analyses te models with different exposed planes were constructed as shown in fig s16 the main exposed surfaces of te 10 and te 15 were the 100 and 101 planes respectively facet engineered te samples were predicted to promote the capture and reaction with neighboring o2 molecules in the mnbs environment the adsorption energies eads of o2 on the surfaces of te 10 and te 15 were first performed and the results were shown in fig 4g h te 10 0 98 ev exhibited much higher eads than te 15 0 54 ev indicating that te 10 with the 100 plane was easier to adsorb activate o2 the longer oo bond and more obtained electrons of the adsorbed o2 on the surface of te 10 1 31 1 28 å 0 56 0 39 e further confirmed the anticipation apparently this result was consistent with the fast electron transfer of te 10 the adsorption behavior of h2o was also performed in figs 4i and s17 the oh radicals could not be formed on the surface of the te samples due to the low eads 0 10 ev and weak bond length variation 0 01 å of the adsorbed h2o which confirmed the results of the esr tests as identified above the best water disinfection performance of te 10 was attributed to the highest separation efficiency of electron hole pairs the fastest charge transfer and the most efficient capture and activation of o2 contact between catalysts and cells has been reported to induce extracellular electron transfer which destroys cell membranes and accelerates cell inactivation fu et al 2021 the kelvin probe force microscopy kpfm mode of atomic force microscope afm was used to investigate the extracellular electron transfer in the afm image fig 5 a the e coli k 12 cells with a length of 1 6 μm were detected five regions of the corresponding kpfm images fig 5b c were randomly selected for quantification of contact potential difference and work function the initial contact potential difference and work function were calculated to be 116 mv and 4 184 ev in table 1 respectively after contact with te 10 for a period of time the contact potential difference decreased to 106 mv while the work function increased to 4 194 ev revealing that te 10 captured cellular electrons through the built in electric field generated at the material cell contact interface the extracellular electron transfer affected the life activities of the cells since the atp and gsh contents in fig 5d e increased rapidly after te 10 contact with the cells in the linear sweep voltammetry lsv curves fig 5f the attachment of live cells to te 10 led to extracellular electron transfer that enhanced the current this result was consistent with the results of kpfm images in contrast the attachment of inactivated cells led to an increased resistance that reduced the current interestingly the enhancement of extracellular electron transfer by mnbs was revealed since the introduction of mnbs exhibited the strongest current the reasons behind might be that 1 the mnbs environment accelerated cellular life activities 2 the enhanced o2 mass transportation provided electron carriers to promote electron extraction and 3 the electron deficient state of te 10 due to o2 reduction promoted the extracellular electron transfer in conclusion groundwater disinfection was facilitated through the enhanced interface reactions enhanced photothermal synergism and extracellular electron transfer induced by the combination of mnbs with the facet engineered te materials 3 4 implementation potential the sustainable development goals no 6 sdg 6 claimed that ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is a worldwide pursuit in rural areas where low temperature groundwater is used as a drinking water source the current study demonstrated that the solar te 10 mnbs system prevents groundwater consumers from the disease risks triggered by pathogenic microorganisms like e coli and fungal spores for the practicality and scalability of the solar te 10 mnbs system it can be directly installed behind hand pressed wells fig s18 as shown in fig s18 the solar te 10 mnbs system consists of an mnbs generator and a circulating flow through disinfection device among them the circulating flow through disinfection device can be replaced by clear glass plastic folded flow reactors to fully utilize solar light the industrial molding te pellets are held in the reactor by supports for easy replacement under sunlight illumination the solar te 10 mnbs system effectively inactivates a variety of microorganisms in the outlet water of hand pressed wells without the introduction of any additional chemical reagents affordable water disinfection technologies are especially important the application of cdte thin film cells and the abundant te mineral resources in china have driven the development of the te material industry moreover inexpensive micro nano bubble devices based on the proven micro nano bubble technology are gradually being applied in the kitchens of households based on these developments the fixed investment and operating cost for this work were calculated to be 200 and 1 0 m3 respectively which was similar to or even lower than that of other point of use water disinfection technologies table s5 moreover the solar te 10 process can meet the needs of consumers with limited funds and less stringent water quality requirements in conclusion this work provides a cost effective technology for low temperature groundwater disinfection 4 conclusions this work highlighted a novel approach to enhance the sodis of low temperature groundwater by the mnbs assisted photothermal activation of facet engineered te materials in a circulating flow through disinfection device the approach achieved complete inactivation of target concentrations of a niger and e coli k 12 in 5 min which was significantly superior to the conventional disinfection techniques the introduction of mnbs was proven to increase dissolved oxygen content promote o2 mass transportation and optimize the interfacial photoelectric effect thus enhancing interface reactions related to the generation of rss and hyperthermia as well as extracellular electron transfer the lspr effect of te was identified to take advantage of photothermal synergism to achieve efficient and complete cell inactivation the photothermal synergism was proposed that rss generated by the photocatalytic effect entered directly into the cells whose cell membranes were disrupted by the photothermal effect and reacted with cytoplasm to achieve complete cell death the perfect applicability of facet engineered te materials in mnbs environment was also demonstrated this work provides new insights on catalyst microorganism electron heat transfer mechanisms and

14983,microplastics mps diameter 5 mm are widely distributed on earth especially in the oceans diatoms account for 40 of marine primary productivity and affect the global biogeochemical cycles of macroelements however the effects of mps on marine nitrogen cycling remain poorly understood particularly comparisons between nitrogen replete and nitrogen limited conditions we found that mps trigger the matthew effect on nitrogen assimilation in diatoms where mps inhibited nitrogen assimilation under nitrogen limited conditions while enhancing nitrogen metabolism under nitrogen replete conditions in phaeodactylum tricornutum nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir are upregulated but nitrate transporter nrt and glutamine synthetase gs are downregulated by mps under nitrogen limited conditions in contrast nr nir and gs are all upregulated by mps under nitrogen replete conditions mps accelerate nitrogen anabolic processes with an increase in the accumulation of carbohydrates by 80 7 7 9 and enhance the activities of key nitrogen metabolizing enzymes 8 20 44 90 under nitrogen replete conditions in contrast the abundance of carbohydrates decreases by 22 0 34 4 and nrt activity is inhibited by 79 0 86 5 in nitrogen limited algae exposed to mps metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to further explore the molecular mechanisms of reprogrammed nitrogen assimilation including carbon metabolism nitrogen transport and ammonia assimilation the aforementioned spatial redistribution e g the matthew effect between nitrogen replete and limited conditions of nitrogen

documented mp triggered denitrifying activity and greenhouse gas n2o production su et al 2022 phytoplankton play a key role in the process of global carbon and nitrogen sequestration and the inhibition of phytoplankton growth by mps may interfere with the marine carbon and nitrogen cycles galgani and loiselle 2021 hitchcock 2022 furthermore mps are incorporated into marine snow and then affect the delivery of nutrients to deep sea environments disturbing global biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles porter et al 2018 mps inhibit algal growth and photosynthetic activity and change algal morphology nava and leoni 2021 however the direct connections between mp pollution and nitrogen assimilation in marine diatoms remain unclear nitrogen limitation tends to affect primary productivity throughout much of the surface of low latitude oceans which represent more than half of the global oceans moore et al 2013 nitrogen depletion leads to a fragile marine environment tang et al 2020 marine phytoplankton are responsible for approximately 40 of marine net primary productivity vincent and bowler 2020 and account for 2000 tg of nitrate reduction per year six times more than land plants duce et al 2008 kuypers et al 2018 diatoms the main marine phytoplankton have a predominant capacity for rapid nutrient uptake and nitrate storage malviya et al 2016 smith et al 2019 compared with bulk plastic wastes mps present high activity due to their small sizes huffer et al 2017 and might affect diatom nitrogen assimilation through an interfacial interaction that occurs at the molecular atomic and even electronic levels nitrogen limitation occurs in much of the surface of low latitude oceans including in the eastern mediterranean and the subtropical north atlantic while high nitrate areas are distributed mainly in the southern ocean and the eastern equatorial pacific moore et al 2013 during the dual regulatory effects of nitrogen levels and mps on diatom nitrogen

critical for rethinking nitrogen cycling processes especially for the reshaping of the nitrogen distribution in aquatic environments carpenter et al detected polystyrene spherules in marine zooplankton in 1972 carpenter et al 1972 research on mps has flourished in recent years polystyrene polyethylene and polypropylene comprise an estimated 56 of global plastic waste and are widely distributed in aquatic environments pabortsava and lampitt 2020 styrene oligomers generated from discarded polystyrene were reported in the north west pacific ocean kwon et al 2017 and polystyrene 228 350 particles m3 and 148 424 µg m3 was identified in the near surface water of the atlantic ocean pabortsava and lampitt 2020 small particles of mps less than 0 3 mm accounted for 92 of the total mps detected in the south china sea and the average particle sizes of mps in surface waters increased exponentially with decreasing particle sizes cai et al 2018 moreover smaller mps are more likely to be swallowed by and attach to biological tissues of organisms such as fish and shrimp ugwu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 most researchers assessing the uptake of mps by aquatic organisms and the effect on ecosystem functioning preferentially used polystyrene beads size 1 0 μm jeong et al 2022 wang et al 2022 therefore polystyrene beads with micron scale diameters 1 μm covering the common sizes reported in the literature were selected as the model mps in the present study we investigated the interfacial biochemical interactions of mps diatoms in nitrogen assimilation using a combination of cutting edge techniques including atomic force microscopy afm flow cytometry confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy molecular dynamics md simulation and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to further explore the molecular mechanisms by which mps and nitrogen levels reshape nitrogen assimilation given the wide distribution of mps and phytoplankton the processes and models of global nitrogen cycling should consider the nitrogen distribution in the ocean that is reshaped by mps 2 materials and methods 2 1 diatom culture and mp exposure the model marine pennate diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum was exposed to micron sized polystyrene beads at an environmentally relevant concentration 1 mg l li et al 2021 stocks of 1 μm polystyrene beads ps in deionized water were purchased from tianjin baseline chromtech research centre exhibiting green fluorescence upon excitation at 488 nm excitation and emission at 518 nm a stock culture of p tricornutum mascc 0025 was obtained from the algal center of the institute of oceanography chinese academy of sciences qingdao china the diatoms were initially grown in sterile f 2 medium prepared using artificial seawater ph 8 0 0 1 at 21 0 5 c with an illumination of 3000 lux under a 14 10 h light and dark cycle the artificial seawater was prepared in the laboratory as described previously harrison et al 1980 p tricornutum was grown in f 2 medium under axenic conditions and maintained in exponential growth for 3 weeks before being used to inoculate biological duplicate cultures algal cells in the exponential phase 105 cells ml were collected by centrifugation 4000 g 10 min washed with n free medium and resuspended in n free medium during 4 h of incubation in n free medium the ability of p tricornutum to take up nitrate developed according to a previous report 300 μm nitrate was exhausted from the media by p tricornutum in exponential phase cultures approximately 3 h after addition mccarthy et al 2017 recent studies on nitrogen assimilation and the intracellular distribution of nitrogen in p tricornutum also used 300 μm nitrate for n limitation smith et al 2019 therefore 300 μm nitrate was used as the n limited condition the concentrations added to the n replete group in previous studies e g hong et al 2017 100 µm for n replete were administered during the 36 72 h experimental period in the present study the experimental period was 5 days and a large amount of nitrogen was needed to maintain the n replete condition the nitrate concentration was 884 μm in f 2 medium and was regraded under n replete conditions in laboratory experiments aranguren gassis et al 2019 therefore 1 mm was used as the n replete treatment the potential effect of mps on diatom nitrogen availability was examined at two different initial nitrate concentrations 300 μm nitrogen limited treatment ln and 1 mm nitrogen replete treatment rn after preacclimation for approximately five generations under different n conditions ma et al 2022 the exposure experiments were conducted in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks with 100 ml of adjusted f 2 medium and the initial cell density was maintained at approximately 105 cells ml 2 2 characterization of mps the morphology surface charge and chemical composition of mps were characterized using a scanning electron microscope

mps was investigated using a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope clsm lsm880 with airyscan zeiss germany a concanavalin a alexa fluor 594 conjugate cona 594 molecular probes c 11 253 was used to label eps by binding to glucose and mannose residues of polysaccharides briefly algal cells were incubated with 25 µg ml con a in the dark at room temperature for 20 min fluorescently labeled epss were excited at a wavelength of 405 nm and the fluorescence signal was recorded at 460 nm moreover the autofluorescence of the mps and chlorophyll in the microalgae were excited with a laser 458 and 633 nm respectively and the fluorescence signals were recorded at 503 and 693 nm respectively eps extraction was performed using a heat treatment method wang et al 2020 and the levels of total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were measured using a toc analyzer multi n c3100 analytik jena japan 2 9 stable isotope incubations and 15n uptake rate measurements stable isotope incubations were performed with the addition of 15n sodium nitrate 99 sigma aldrich usa after exposure to mps with the addition of 15n nitrate 300 μm and 1 mm for 5 days the cultures were collected by filtration

significant effects on algal growth compared with rn fig 1 a consistent with a previous study niu et al 2021b in the initial 1 2 days significant growth inhibition was not observed but significant growth inhibition was observed on the 3rd day fig 1a growth inhibition took time for example n free cultures showed similar cell growth to n replete cultures during the initial 48 h of cultivation alipanah et al 2015 however the algae presented a significantly lower density at 3 days under nitrogen limited conditions diatoms exposed to mps and nitrogen limitation accumulated the largest amount

resulted in heteroaggregation when cells reached the stationary growth phase fig s4 after 48 h of exposure mps with red fluorescence tended to adhere to the surface of algal cells with green

acid tca cycles was observed under nitrogen limited conditions fig s14 aminoacyl trna biosynthesis arginine and proline metabolism alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were significantly upregulated in diatoms exposed to mps under nitrogen replete conditions fig s15 in contrast glycerolipid metabolism inositol phosphate metabolism and the phosphatidylinositol signaling system linked to lipid synthesis responses to environmental stress were downregulated in mp treated cells under nitrogen replete conditions in particular mps induced the downregulation of ascorbate and aldarate metabolism related to carbohydrate metabolism under nitrogen limited conditions 4 discussion one of the major challenges in understanding the dynamics of the health and functioning of the ocean is the potential effect of the increasing presence of plastic the mp beads present in cosmetics such as scrubs toothpastes air blasting media and in clothing enter the aquatic environment through industrial or domestic drainage systems auta et al 2017 mps with small sizes 5 mm and a low density are abundant in ocean waters contributing to widespread transport and distribution across larger distances by currents eerkes medrano et al 2015 eriksen et al 2013 research has increasingly focused on the ecological effects of mps on diatoms however the biochemical interactions of mps diatoms in nitrogen assimilation are lacking consistent with a previous study environmentally relevant concentrations of mps 1 μm polystyrene beads have little effect on the growth of marine diatoms niu et al 2021b uptake of the mps was not observed fig s16 the negative surface charge of mps impeded their contact with the negatively charged cell surface generally high concentrations of mps exert an obvious effect on photosynthesis liu et al 2020 however photosynthesis was enhanced by mps at environmentally relevant concentrations under nitrogen replete conditions accompanied by an increase in nitrogen uptake p tricornutum has the capability to continue to take up no3 for growth and is a major contributor to marine primary productivity smith et al 2019 the transformation of no3 and the accumulation of nh4 were facilitated in the rn ps group compared to the rn group fig 1 in contrast a decrease in the carbohydrate content and inhibition of nrt activity were observed in nitrogen limited algae exposed to mps mps significantly affected the nitrogen assimilation rate of p tricornutum hydrophobic interactions were identified between the mp surface and residues of nrt fig 3c nrt switches the transporter from a low affinity to high affinity state accompanied by phosphorylation of a key threonine residue thr 101 sun et al 2014 the no3 binding site in the eukaryotic nrt crystal structure was represented by a protonated histidine his 356 parker and newstead 2014 mps affect nrt activity by influencing two regions as shown in fig 3c rather than by directly affecting the no3 binding site the targeted residues were far from thr 101 and his 356 exhibiting a special pattern affected by the ala 450 lys 538 arg 540 leu 445 arg 446 tyr 542 and ala 582 residues explaining the synergistic inhibition of nrt levels by nitrogen limitation and mps a number of studies have confirmed that the adverse effects of mps e g on pathological stress blocked enzyme production reduced growth rate and oxidative stress are mainly caused by the uptake and accumulation of mps in aquatic organisms bhatt et al 2021 algal aggregation is a physiological phenomenon in response to ambient stressors to reduce direct contact with pollutants nava and leoni 2021 tang et al 2018 in the present study the adsorption of mps on the cell surface was elucidated using clms and afm the hydrophilicity of mps which is affected by the type of functional groups and the surface roughness was determined by measuring the mp contact angle niu et al 2021 physicochemical properties of the mp surface are relevant for biofilm formation and algal cell attachment nava and leoni 2021 zettler et al 2013 algal eps production was affected by the hydrophobic features and surface roughness of mps junaid and wang 2021 the contact angle of ps was 73 5 90 with hydrophilic polarity and facilitated the absorption of mps on the cell surface mps accumulated around algal cells and were encased in the eps matrix further encasing in the eps matrix had a similar effect to quorum sensing preventing cell uptake gao et al 2020 junaid and wang 2021 the csh of algal cells is a key factor contributing to affinity for contaminants and the affinity increases as the csh increases zhang et al 2016 the hydrophobicity of algae may be directly determined by the composition of the cell surface the surface potentials explained the increase in the csh and confirmed the packing of mps by the eps matrix no significant differences in the roughness of diatom surfaces were observed between nitrogen replete and nitrogen limited conditions with mps figs 4e and s6 however the mechanical strength increased with mp exposure under nitrogen replete conditions but decreased with nitrogen limitation fig 4f cell membrane fluidity and mechanical strength affect nitrate assimilation lo et al 2021 wilhelm et al 2006 explaining the phenotypically opposite trends of nitrogen utilization mediated by mps under nitrogen replete and nitrogen limited conditions fig 4g diatoms flexibly direct carbon and nitrogen to various macromolecules associated with specific intracellular compartments to optimize growth under varying environmental conditions levitan et al 2015 specifically p tricornutum under nitrogen stress cannibalizes and remobilizes plastid proteins and polar lipids toward energy storage levitan et al 2015 mps strongly affect the expression of genes in microalgae plants and protists wu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a zhang et al 2022b yet little is known about how diatoms respond to mps in the presence of varying nitrogen levels the upregulation of carbon metabolism photosynthesis and transportation by mps under nitrogen replete conditions fig s11 was consistent with the enhanced photosynthesis shown in fig s2d the downregulated pathways were enriched in photosynthesis by nitrogen limitation explaining the decrease in the chlorophyll a content fig s2d the cellular pathways and processes related to nitrogen metabolism are illustrated in fig s17 the level of glutamate the main precursor for the tetrapyrrole moiety of chlorophyll biosynthesis allen et al 2008 decreased under nitrogen limited conditions fig s14 based on these results mps enhanced nitrogen metabolism by promoting carbohydrate accumulation and lipid depletion in nitrogen replete cells exposed to mps however the suppression of carbohydrate metabolism perturbed nitrogen metabolism in nitrogen limited cells exposed to mps ammonia assimilation by gs and gogat in chloroplasts leads to the production of glutamine and glutamate the levels of leucine and phenylalanine which are related to the tca cycle were increased by mps under nitrogen replete conditions fig s18a the decreased levels of glutamic acid and glutamine were consistent with the increases in gs and gogat activities following mp exposure however mp exposure under nitrogen limited conditions decreased glutamic acid and glutamine levels many genes involved in ammonium assimilation by glutamate synthase glutamine synthetase to generate amino acids fig 5 a such as glna glurs hema and gltd and gltx were upregulated in mp exposed algal cells under nitrogen replete conditions fig s18b d in contrast the expression of glna gltd and gltx was transcriptionally repressed following mp exposure with nitrogen limitation compared with nitrogen limitation alone the gs gogat cycle was primarily hindered in nitrogen limited cells exposed to mps leading to decreased nitrogen utilization fig 5b integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the reprogramming of nitrogen assimilation following dynamic changes in nitrate levels mps exert strong effects on gene expression and the regulation of metabolic processes under nitrogen replete and nitrogen depleted states functionally the genes and metabolites that were upregulated by mps when nitrogen concentrations were sufficient were involved in photosynthesis and the biosynthesis of key amino acids during n limitation components of ammonium assimilation and carbohydrate metabolism were downregulated in diatom cells exposed to mps providing evidence of decreased recycling of internal nitrogen the mean mp concentration was reported to be 8277 particles l 1 8 3 106 particles m 3 in

phenology boyce et al 2017 surface inorganic nitrogen is strongly depleted throughout much of the low latitude oceans moore et al 2013 and the inhibitory effects of mps on nitrogen utilization in the aforementioned areas deserve urgent attention 5 conclusions and environmental implications by characterizing the dynamic response of nitrogen metabolism to mp exposure under both nitrogen deficient and sufficient conditions we explored the underlying mechanisms of mp mediated nitrogen assimilation in globally distributed diatom species p tricornutum mps trigger the matthew effect on nitrogen assimilation in diatoms where mps exacerbate nitrogen assimilation in diatoms under nitrogen limited conditions while enhancing nitrogen metabolism under nitrogen replete conditions these findings

14983,microplastics mps diameter 5 mm are widely distributed on earth especially in the oceans diatoms account for 40 of marine primary productivity and affect the global biogeochemical cycles of macroelements however the effects of mps on marine nitrogen cycling remain poorly understood particularly comparisons between nitrogen replete and nitrogen limited conditions we found that mps trigger the matthew effect on nitrogen assimilation in diatoms where mps inhibited nitrogen assimilation under nitrogen limited conditions while enhancing nitrogen metabolism under nitrogen replete conditions

nanosims metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to further explore the molecular mechanisms by which mps and nitrogen levels reshape nitrogen assimilation given the wide distribution

downregulation of ascorbate and aldarate metabolism related to carbohydrate metabolism under nitrogen limited conditions 4 discussion one of the major challenges in understanding the dynamics of the health and functioning of the ocean is the potential effect of the increasing presence of plastic the mp beads present in cosmetics such as scrubs toothpastes air blasting media and in clothing enter the aquatic environment through industrial or domestic drainage systems auta et al 2017 mps with small sizes 5 mm and a low density are abundant in ocean waters contributing to widespread transport and distribution across larger distances by currents eerkes medrano et al 2015 eriksen et al 2013 research has increasingly focused on the ecological effects of mps on diatoms however the biochemical interactions of mps diatoms in nitrogen assimilation are lacking consistent with a previous study environmentally relevant concentrations of mps 1 μm polystyrene beads have little effect on the growth of marine diatoms niu et al 2021b uptake of the mps was not observed fig s16 the negative surface charge of mps impeded their contact with the negatively charged cell surface generally high concentrations of mps exert an obvious effect on photosynthesis liu et al 2020 however photosynthesis was enhanced by mps at environmentally relevant concentrations under nitrogen replete conditions accompanied by an increase in nitrogen uptake p tricornutum has the capability to continue to take up no3 for growth and is a major contributor to marine primary productivity smith et al 2019 the transformation of no3 and the accumulation of nh4 were facilitated in the rn ps group compared to the rn group fig 1 in contrast a decrease in the carbohydrate content and inhibition of nrt activity

residues explaining the synergistic inhibition of nrt levels by nitrogen limitation and mps a number of studies have confirmed that the adverse effects of mps e g on pathological stress blocked enzyme production reduced growth rate and oxidative stress are mainly caused by the uptake and accumulation of mps in aquatic organisms bhatt et al 2021 algal aggregation is a physiological phenomenon in response to ambient stressors to reduce direct contact with pollutants nava and leoni 2021 tang et al 2018 in the present study the adsorption of mps on the cell surface was elucidated using clms and afm the hydrophilicity of mps which is affected by the type of functional groups and the surface roughness was determined by measuring the mp contact angle niu et al 2021 physicochemical properties of

of mps junaid and wang 2021 the contact angle of ps was 73 5 90 with hydrophilic polarity and facilitated the absorption of mps on the cell surface mps accumulated around algal cells and were encased in the eps matrix further encasing in the eps matrix had a similar effect to quorum sensing preventing cell uptake gao et al 2020 junaid and wang 2021 the csh of algal cells is a key factor contributing to affinity for contaminants and the affinity increases as the csh increases zhang et al 2016 the hydrophobicity of algae may be directly determined by the composition of the cell surface the surface potentials explained the increase in the csh and confirmed the packing of mps by the eps matrix no significant differences in the roughness of diatom surfaces were observed between nitrogen replete and nitrogen limited conditions with mps figs 4e and s6 however the mechanical strength increased with mp exposure under nitrogen replete conditions but decreased with nitrogen limitation fig 4f cell membrane fluidity and mechanical strength affect nitrate assimilation lo et al 2021 wilhelm et al 2006 explaining the phenotypically opposite trends of nitrogen utilization

to optimize growth under varying environmental conditions levitan et al 2015 specifically p tricornutum under nitrogen stress cannibalizes and remobilizes plastid proteins and polar lipids toward energy storage levitan et al 2015 mps strongly affect the expression of genes in microalgae plants and protists wu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022a zhang et al 2022b yet little is known about how diatoms respond to mps in the presence of varying nitrogen levels the upregulation of carbon metabolism photosynthesis and transportation by mps under nitrogen replete conditions fig s11 was consistent with the enhanced photosynthesis shown in fig s2d the downregulated pathways were enriched in photosynthesis by nitrogen limitation explaining the decrease in the chlorophyll a content fig s2d the cellular pathways and processes related to nitrogen metabolism are illustrated in fig s17 the level of glutamate the main precursor for the tetrapyrrole moiety of chlorophyll biosynthesis allen et al 2008 decreased under nitrogen limited conditions fig s14 based on these results mps enhanced nitrogen metabolism by promoting carbohydrate accumulation and lipid depletion in nitrogen replete cells exposed to mps however the suppression of carbohydrate metabolism perturbed nitrogen metabolism in nitrogen limited cells exposed to mps ammonia assimilation by gs and gogat in chloroplasts leads to the production of glutamine and glutamate the levels of leucine and phenylalanine which are related to the tca cycle were increased by mps under nitrogen replete conditions fig s18a the decreased levels of glutamic acid and glutamine were consistent with the increases in gs and gogat activities following mp exposure however mp exposure under nitrogen limited conditions decreased glutamic acid and glutamine levels many genes involved in ammonium assimilation by glutamate synthase glutamine synthetase to generate amino acids fig 5 a such as glna glurs hema and gltd and gltx were upregulated in mp exposed algal cells under nitrogen replete conditions fig s18b d in contrast the expression of glna gltd and gltx was transcriptionally repressed following mp exposure with nitrogen limitation compared with nitrogen limitation alone the gs gogat cycle was primarily hindered in nitrogen limited cells exposed to mps leading to decreased nitrogen utilization fig 5b integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the reprogramming of nitrogen assimilation following dynamic changes in nitrate levels mps exert strong effects on gene expression and the regulation of metabolic processes under nitrogen replete and nitrogen depleted states functionally the genes and metabolites that were upregulated by mps when nitrogen concentrations were sufficient were involved in photosynthesis and the biosynthesis of key amino acids during n limitation components of ammonium assimilation and carbohydrate metabolism were downregulated in diatom cells exposed to mps providing evidence of decreased recycling of internal nitrogen the mean mp concentration was reported to be 8277 particles l 1 8 3 106 particles m 3 in surface seawater brandon et al 2020 and mps are continuously accumulating across vast areas of the oceans cozar et al 2014 wilcox et al 2020 nitrate is one of the predominant drivers of marine phenology boyce et al 2017 surface inorganic nitrogen is strongly depleted throughout much of the low latitude oceans moore et al 2013 and the inhibitory effects of mps on nitrogen utilization in the aforementioned areas deserve urgent attention 5 conclusions and environmental implications by characterizing the dynamic response of nitrogen metabolism to mp exposure under both nitrogen deficient and sufficient conditions we explored the underlying mechanisms of mp mediated nitrogen assimilation in globally distributed diatom species p tricornutum mps trigger the matthew effect on nitrogen assimilation in diatoms where mps exacerbate nitrogen assimilation in diatoms under nitrogen limited conditions while enhancing nitrogen metabolism under nitrogen replete conditions these findings emphasize the complicated effect of plastic pollution on diatom nitrogen cycles in aquatic environments nitrogen fixation is crucial for maintaining biological productivity in the oceans and primary

exist in the npsg resulting in biogeochemical ramifications on local and even global oceanic scales in contrast to the results of nitrogen limitation mps enhance nitrogen metabolism in nitrogen replete algae mps accelerated nitrogen anabolic processes with an 80 7 increase the accumulation of carbohydrates and 8 20 44 90 increases in the activities of key nitrogen metabolizing enzymes under nitrogen replete conditions mp pollution may promote the growth of marine diatoms in high nitrate and low chlorophyll hnlc regions of the oceans such as areas of the equatorial pacific and the southern ocean the baltic sea and the german bight north sea are nitrogen replete areas and mp contamination will promote nitrogen assimilation by diatoms in these areas compared with external input from atmospheric deposition 40 tg nitrogen yr 1 the reactive nitrogen content in the oceans was increased by biological nitrogen fixation 140 tg n yr 1 fowler et al 2013 the marine nitrogen cycle mainly consists of the uptake of inorganic forms by phytoplankton the oxidation of reduced inorganic forms such as ammonia and nitrite by bacterial chemoautotrophs termed nitrifiers and the reduction

sequestration in the ocean shen et al 2022 moreover zooplankton graze on primary producers e g phytoplankton and zooplankton fecal materials drive nitrogen export from surface waters kvale et al 2021 thus mps may indirectly alter marine nitrogen flux by interfering with the marine food chain and nutrient cycles our findings reveal that mps trigger the matthew effect on nitrogen assimilation

be different from those in lpuv chlorine for example photolysis of ocl produces cl o φ254nm 0 28 or cl o 1d φ254nm 0 13 under lpuv irradiation that predominantly emits at 254 nm but quantum yields for these pathways are much lower at 365 nm than at 254 nm φ365nm is 0 08 for cl o and 0 for cl o 1d rao et al 2012 rather cl o 3p φ 0 28 is the main product channel for the photolysis of ocl at 365 nm rao et al 2012 o is not very reactive with contaminants but is likely transformed into oh by reacting with h2o eq 1 and o 3p primarily reacts with dissolved oxygen resulting in the formation of o3 eq 2 buxton and subnani 1972 forsyth et al 2013 klaening et al 1984 these findings suggest that reactive species formation from the photolysis of chlorine is strongly wavelength dependent and the degradation kinetics of micropollutants during uv chlorine may be distinct from those of sunlight chlorine indeed research has demonstrated that the enhanced inactivation of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and bacillus subtilis endospores during sunlight chlorine was driven by o3 forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014b which forms at lower concentrations under lpuv irradiation than under sunlight bulman et al 2019 1 o h2o oh oh 2 o 3p o2 o3 although research has explored the contributions of reactive species to the degradation of chemical contaminants during uv chlorine treatment and to a lesser extent during sunlight chlorine treatment forsyth et al 2013 sun et al 2016 yang et al 2020 these studies largely focused on the initial stage of reactions where chlorine remained at similar levels i e chlorine depletion 44 or residual chlorine concentration 2 mg l as cl2 at the end of the experiments however products or intermediates from the photolysis of chlorine may affect the degradation of contaminants particularly after prolonged light exposure during which chlorine is largely consumed for example a previous study demonstrated that the degradation of caffeine accelerated as uv chlorine treatment proceeded driven by increasing steady state concentrations of ocl over time sun et al 2016 however a possible shift in the contributions of reactive species to contaminant degradation along the reaction time was not captured in previous studies of sunlight chlorine treatment this phenomenon warrants further study because the average sunlight exposure in engineered systems e g open channel disinfection units in wwtps or water treatment plants wtps or natural environments e g water bodies that receive disinfected wwtp effluent which is on the order of hours is much longer than the half life t1 2 of chlorine under sunlight exposure 10 min nowell and hoigne 1992 the objective of this study was to investigate the contaminant degradation kinetics and mechanism during sunlight photolysis in the presence of chlorine under environmentally relevant conditions in particular we focused on the effect of the evolution of reactive species on degrading contaminants in this study we examined the degradation of ketamine an environmentally persistent compound under simulated sunlight irradiation in the presence of low mg l levels of chlorine the kinetic model was also established to elucidate the formation and contribution of reactive species during sunlight chlorine 2 methods 2 1 photolysis experiments to initiate each experiment deionized water buffered with 5 mm phosphate at the desired ph was spiked with ketamine and sodium hypochlorite at target concentrations and decanted in round bottom quartz glass tubes 1 6 cm i d 13 5 cm depth volume 27 ml capped with quartz stoppers the photochemical experiments were conducted in a sunlight simulator suntest cps atlas chicago il usa at an irradiation intensity of 700 w m2 with a temperature thermostatted at 20 c the ph was adjusted using phosphate buffer sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid in different experiments samples were taken periodically and the residual chlorine was quenched immediately with an excess amount of quencher sodium thiosulfate or ascorbic acid was used to quench samples for target compound analyses and glycine was used to quench samples for chloride and chlorate analyses glycine rapidly reacts with hocl or ocl to form n chloroglycine avoiding cl formation as in the case of ascorbic acid or thiosulfate 2 2 analytical methods the concentrations of ketamine atenolol caffeine ibuprofen metoprolol and pentoxifylline were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms with an agilent 1200 liquid chromatograph agilent ca usa

zorbax c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 µm 2 3 kinetics model the kinetics model was implemented with kintecus 4 55 ianni 2019 this model contains 108 elementary reactions obtained from the literature or estimated by analogy with similar reactions table s4 while the model was based on previous models that were validated against experimental data from the uv h2o2 aop chuang et al 2016 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 and the uv chlorine aop chuang et al 2017 this model was refined with additional reactions as discussed below 3 results and discussions 3 1 ketamine degradation during sunlight chlorine fig 1 shows the time dependent concentrations of ketamine and chlorine in deionized water at ph 7 during sunlight irradiation with and without 1 0 mg l as cl2 free chlorine the degradation of ketamine attributable to direct photolysis and reacting with chlorine was 10 and 20 respectively over the 3 h experimental time scale fig 1 concurring with its low direct photolysis rate under sunlight irradiation the t1 2 was 21 6 2 6 h under 700 w m2 simulated sunlight lin et al 2014 however 3 h sunlight irradiation resulted in 87 degradation of 50 μg l ketamine with 1 0 mg l as cl2 chlorine highlighting the synergy of sunlight irradiation and chlorination interestingly after a 40 min reaction time at which the chlorine residual was below the 0 02 mg l as cl2 detection limit an additional 53 removal was observed from 14 µg l to 6 5 µg l the right figure in fig 1 for the following 140 min compared to only 3 5 removal for the no chlorine control over the same course of sunlight exposure note that the degradation of ketamine during chlorination alone sunlight irradiation alone and sunlight irradiation coupled with 1 mg l as cl2 after chlorine depletion i e after 40 min of reaction time fig 1 followed the pseudo first order model facilitating the comparison of rate constants for different degradation mechanisms the pseudo first order rate constant for ketamine degradation after 40 min of sunlight chlorine treatment 7 6 0 50 10 3 min 1 was more than an order of magnitude faster than sunlight photolysis alone 2 9 0 15 10 4 min 1 as discussed later this degradation is plausibly attributable to reactions with reactive species o3 chlorine oxides evolved during the photolysis of chlorine 3 2 reactivity of ketamine toward different reactive species at ph 7 0 where hocl and ocl coexist at a molar ratio of 3 4 1 the polychromatic sunlight irradiation of chlorine produces an array of primary reactive species these primary reactive species include oh and cl obtained via eq 3 which features a high quantum yield in the uv b range 311 nm φ 1 0 bulman et al 2019 and cl o o 1d and o 3p obtained via eqs 4 6 bulman et al 2019 reactions of primary reactive species with parent oxidants hocl or ocl generate secondary reactive species ocl eqs 8 9 among others 3 hocl hv oh cl 4 ocl hv o cl 5 ocl hv o 1d cl 6 ocl hv o 3p cl 7 o 3p o2 o3 8 oh cl hocl ocl h2o hcl 9 oh cl ocl ocl oh cl to elucidate the contribution of oh and cl on the degradation of ketamine the steady state concentration of oh and cl was experimentally measured by spiking 1 µm benzoic acid and 1 µm nitrobenzene into the system that contained 50 µg l ketamine and 1 mg l as cl2 chlorine text s3 as suggested by previous studies bulman et al 2019 fang et al 2014 sun et al 2016 note that the calculation was based on data obtained from the first 10 min of reaction time where the free chlorine concentration decay was 58 and thus it reflected the quasi steady state concentrations of radicals within the first ten minutes our experimental results indicated that the oh ss and cl ss were determined to be 4 7 10 14 m and 2 3 10 14 m respectively the k oh for ketamine is 4 43 109 m 1s 1 gu et al 2019 and the k oh for ketamine oh ss 2 1 10 4 s 1 accounted for 50 of the measured kobs for ketamine degradation 4 1 0 1 10 4 s 1 reflecting that the degradation of ketamine was driven oh at the beginning of the sunlight chlorine treatment moreover to isolate the contribution of reactive species other than oh and cl to the removal of ketamine sunlight chlorine experiments were first carried out in the presence of tert butyl alcohol t buoh as the oh cl quencher t buoh is two times more reactive with oh than with cl k oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 k cl 3 0 108 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2014b yet it exhibits relatively low reactivity with o 3p k 4 107 m 1 s 1 and o3 k 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 hoigne and bader 1983b t buoh also exhibits negligible photon absorbance at wavelengths 250 nm fig s2 when 25 mm t buoh was spiked into the systems containing 50 µg l ketamine 0 21 µm and 1 0 mg l as cl2 free chlorine in which t buoh scavenged 99 oh 99 cl 57 o 3p and negligible o3 although we can t know the accurate value of k cl and ko 3p of ketamine we assumed k cl and ko 3p of ketamine 1010 m 1 s 1 which approaches diffusion limit text s5 the degradation of ketamine after 40 min of reaction was reduced to 43 in contrast to 72 degradation in the system without spiked t buoh fig s3 note that while t buoh scavenges almost all oh and cl such that the formation of the secondary radicals e g cl2 ocl cloh should be halted the differences in degradation kinetics were likely attributable to o3 or the daughter radicals derived from the reactions between oh cl and t buoh our additional experiments suggest that o3 contributes to degradation particularly at the amine nhch3 functional group discussed in a later section 3 3 intermediates and reactive species during sunlight chlorine byproducts and or intermediates formed during the photolysis of chlorine may facilitate the formation of certain reactive species in the system apart from o3 eq 2 examples include cl leading to the formation of cl2 or cloh via eq 10 or 11 klaning and wolff 1985 mártire et al 2001 however cl2 or cloh had no significant effect to the degradation of ketamine text s6 on the other hand the self recombination of ocl a radical derived from the reactions between hocl ocl and oh cl eqs 8 9 produces cl2o2 eq 12 cl2o2 is rapidly hydrolyzed to clo2 eq 13 k 1 0 104 s 1 klaning and wolff 1985 mialocq et al 1973 subsequent reactions of oh with clo2 yield clo2 eq 14 alfassi et al 1988 and clo3 eq 16 alfassi et al 1988 some of these chlorine oxides feature high molar absorption coefficients at uva wavelengths i e 320 400 nm fig s2 such that their photosensitization may give rise to the formation of reactive species contributing to the degradation of ketamine compared to oh and cl the evolution of cl2 cloh o3 and chlorine oxides might be relevant to the degradation of ketamine at later stages of sunlight chlorine treatment when photolysis of chlorine liberates large amounts of intermediates byproducts 10 cl cl cl2 k 8 5 109 m

sunlight irradiation at ph 5 2 mm phosphate the 628 µm background cl concentration increased to 662 µm as 79 of hocl photolyzed corresponding to a 56 yield of cl the clo3 concentration did not significantly increase during this time fig s4 the relatively high background concentration of cl may be due to impurities in the chemicals used for buffer preparation in contrast when treating 73 µm ocl by maintaining the ph at 10 using 2 mm phosphate buffer with sunlight irradiation the yields were 80 for cl and 22 for clo3 fig s4 clo2 and clo2 were below the 0 3 µm detection limits in all cases presumably due to their high reactivity with radicals k oh is 7 109 m 1 s 1 for clo2 and 4 109 m 1 s 1 for clo2 eriksen et al 1981 klaning et al 1985 o3 formation in a sunlight chlorine system is directly linked to the product channel for o 3p research has shown that the φo 3p for aqueous ocl increases from 0 074 at 254 nm to 0 28 at 365 nm yet the φo 3p for aqueous hocl remains unclear at uva wavelengths bulman et al 2019 buxton and subnani 1972 bulman et al 2019 evaluated the product channel for o 3p during photolysis of free chlorine at 365 nm at ph 6 10 by determining cumulative o3 concentrations using cinnamic acid as a probe compound one cinnamic acid reacts with one o3 to generate one benzaldehyde their results indicated that the cumulative o3 concentrations when normalized by k obs for oxidant decay were 2 fold higher at ph 6 than at ph 10 suggesting the capability of hocl to form o 3p under uva irradiation this also suggests that sunlight photolysis of hocl may lead to more o3 formation than sunlight photolysis of ocl indeed when we measured the benzaldehyde concentration during sunlight chlorine treatment in the presence of 5 mm acetate at ph 5 or ph 10 the benzaldehyde yield calculated by benzaldehyde δ cl2 was 12 5 0 5 at ph 5 slightly higher than the value of 10 1 at ph 10 fig s5 note that during the experiments 5 mm acetate effectively scavenged both oh and cl but not o3 ko3 for acetate 3 10 5 m 1 s 1 which degraded benzaldehyde and catalyzed oxidant decay additional experiments were carried out to evaluate whether chlorine oxides i e clo2 clo2 clo3 or o3 with or without sunlight irradiation degrade ketamine treating 50 µg l 0 21 µm ketamine in deionized water buffered with 5 mm phosphate at ph 7 with 1 mg l 15 4 µm clo2 1 mg l 12 µm clo3 or 5 mg l as cl2 74 µm clo2 in the dark for up to 20 min caused negligible ketamine degradation treating 20 µg l ketamine with 0 096 mg l 2 µm o3 in the dark rapidly removed ketamine by 44 within the first 10 min with a concomitant o3 depletion of 80 fig 2 repeating these experiments with sunlight irradiation resulted in the synergistic removal of ketamine for three of the compounds clo2 clo2 o3 fig 2 a total of 40 of 50 μg l ketamine was degraded in 20 min during sunlight clo2 fig 2 in sunlight clo2 treatment of ketamine ketamine ketamine 0 50 μg l decreased by 28 over 1 min concurring with the 81 decrease in clo2 chlorine 0 5 mg l as cl2 fig 2 rapid depletion of oxidants was also observed in the case of sunlight o3 76 of 0 096 mg l o3 and 84 of 20 µg l ketamine decayed within 3 min fig 2 3 4 the importance of chlorine oxides and o3 kinetic modeling while our experiments confirmed that clo2 clo2 and o3 are capable of generating reactive species with sunlight irradiation we employed a kinetic model to evaluate their time dependent concentration levels during sunlight chlorine treatment the kinetic model was based on previous models that were validated against experimental data from the uv free chlorine aop and the uv clo2 aop chuang et al 2022 2017 zhang et al 2019 the model includes reactions associated with the formation and decomposition of clo2 clo3 and hocl ocl and an additional fifteen reactions related to the formation and decomposition of o3 were added table s4 eqs s99 113 fig 3 shows the kinetic model without incorporating the reactions associated with o3 reacting with ketamine and the photolysis of clo2 clo2 clo3 and o3 during sunlight chlorine ketamine 0 50 μg l 2 1 10 7 m chlorine 0 1 0 mg l as cl2 1 4 10 5 m o2 0 1 9 10 4 m 5 mm phosphate buffer initial ph 7 as shown in fig 3 chlorine was almost depleted after 40 min and clo3 gradually increased to 3 9 μm at 40 min model also indicated clo2 and clo2 concentrations at 3 5 to 0 96 nm and 0 45 to 0 12 nm respectively throughout sunlight chlorine treatment over 40 min owing to rapid reaction rates between oh and cl and clo2 k 7 109 m 1 s 1 or clo2 k 4 109 m 1 s 1 in contrast the o3 concentration gradually increased to 0 91 μm at 40 min reflecting its relatively low reactivity toward radicals indeed k oh for o3 was 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 40 fold lower than those for clo2 or clo2 when the photolysis of o3 and the reaction of o3 with ketamine whose rate constants were experimentally determined in this study text s11 were incorporated into the kinetics model the modeled concentrations remained comparable for chlorine clo3 0 to 3 9 μm clo2 3 5 to 0 98 nm and clo2 0 45 to 0 13 nm but were always below 0 10 µm for o3 throughout the 40 min course of sunlight chlorine treatment we also performed experiments with 20 µm cinnamic acid as the o3 probe compound to analyze the o3 concentration during sunlight chlorine at 1 mg l as cl2 our experimental measurements concurred with the low modeled concentrations of o3 fig 4 although the o3 concentrations were at sub µm levels in the sunlight chlorine systems we experimentally confirmed that these sub µm levels of o3 resulted in substantial removal of ketamine 70 of 20 µg l 84 nm ketamine was degraded within 60 s when applying 2 µm o3 with 5 mm phosphate buffered at ph 7 fig 2 once o3 is formed from the reaction of o 3p o2 in the sunlight chlorine system it may undergo photocatalytic decomposition to generate oh eqs 17 18 or react with hydroxide to generate o2 and oh eqs 19 25 for example photolysis of o3 at λ 411 nm generates o 1d anglada et al 2014 which reacts with water to form two oh eqs 15 16 on the other hand oh catalyzes o3 decomposition through the ho2 intermediate or the ho2 intermediate the reaction pathways demonstrate an overall stoichiometry of 3o3 to 2 oh for the ho2 intermediate pathways overall reaction 3o3 oh h 4o2 2 oh although oh scavenging by o3 may lower the observed yield of oh from o3 decay i e δ oh δ o3 this was confirmed by our experiments using terephthalate as a probe compound which reacts with oh to generate 2 hydroxyterephathate briefly aliquots of o3 stock solution 0 42 mm were added to solutions containing 10 µm terephthalate in 5 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7 to prepare initial o3 concentrations of 0 20 µm the o3 treated samples were held overnight such that no o3 residual was detected prior to the analysis of 2 hydroxyterephthalate and the results demonstrated decreasing trends for 2 hydroxyterephthalate and oh with increasing initial o3 concentration fig s9 17 o3 hv 411nm o2 o 1d 18 o 1d h2o 2 oh 19 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 k 70 m 1 s 1 20 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 k 38 m 1 s 1 21 h o 2 o 3 o 2 oh o 2 k 5 5 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 22 h o 2 h o 2 p k a 4 8

importance of o3 and o3 derived oh in degrading ketamine without sunlight the o3 decay rate was dependent on the initial concentration at ph 7 while a t1 2 of 12 min was observed with an initial o3 concentration o3 ini of 2 6 mg l 54 µm fig s10 o3 self decay was 10 fold slower when o3 ini was 3 µm o3 dropped to 2 6 µm from 3 µm after 10 min fig s10 o3 decay became 28 fold faster with sunlight than without sunlight in experiments with the same o3 ini 2 3 µm fig s7 and s10 therefore these results suggest a negligible contribution of o3 self decay induced oh to ketamine degradation i e eqs 19 25 modeling with incorporation of the reaction of o3 with ketamine and the reaction of o3 photolysis further revealed the contributions of o3 and oh induced from the photolysis of o3 to the degradation of ketamine throughout sunlight chlorine treatment the results confirmed that 31 ketamine 5 5 was used for photolysis of o3 and 25 was used for o3 oxidation ketamine 0 50 µg l chlorine 0 1 0 mg l as cl2 was degraded by o3 and that o3 was the dominant reactive species after the depletion of chlorine in the sunlight chlorine system text s14 3 5 key reaction site the contribution of o3 in the later stage of sunlight chlorine depends on the chemical structure of the compound a ketamine molecule features a cl benzene ring a cyclohexanone and an aminomethyl group i e nhch3 fig s12 while cl benzene ko3 0 75 m 1 s 1 hoigne and bader 1983b and cyclohexanone have low reactivity toward o3 von gunten 2003 the high ko3 for dimethylamine nh ch3 2 ko3 1 9 107 m 1 s 1 hoigne and bader 1983a suggests that the aminomethyl group on ketamine is the reaction site for o3 indeed the application of 21 µm o3 to 0 21 µm ketamine with 10 mm t buoh at ph 3 5 in which ketamine primarily exists in protonated form pka for ketamine 7 5 resulted in negligible removal over 10 min fig s13 additionally we examined the degradation behaviors of five compounds atenolol caffeine metoprolol ibuprofen and pentoxifylline during sunlight chlorine treatment chlorine 0 1 0 mg l as cl2 with and without 25 mm t buoh at ph 7 these compounds are resistant to sunlight photolysis and chlorination fig s14 concurring with the observations for ketamine substantial removal 90 was found for two compounds that feature aminomethyl groups i e atenolol and metroprolol in the presence of the 25 mm tert butanol oh cl quencher compared to 0 removal for the other three compounds after 180 min of treatment fig 5 4 conclusion in this study oh was identified as the dominant radical in the initial stage of sunlight chlorine degradation of ketamine but byproducts and or intermediates such as clo2 clo2 and o3 during sunlight chlorine also facilitate the reaction in the system the results showed that 1 0 mg l clo2 and 5 0 mg l as cl2 clo2 can significantly degrade 40 and 28 of ketamine in 20 min and 1 min respectively under simulated sunlight however compared with o3 the clo2 and clo2 concentrations 0 12 0 45 and 0 96 3 5 nm respectively throughout sunlight chlorine at ph 7 chlorine 0 1 mg l as cl2 estimated by the kintecus simulation model were much lower than that of o3 the cumulative o3 concentration gradually increased to 0 91 μm moreover by using cinnamic acid as a probe o3 yields of 12 5 0 5 and 10 1 were detected at ph 5 and ph 10 in sunlight chlorine owing to the amount of o3 formed and the high reactivity of o3 with ketamine 44 of 20 μg l ketamine was degraded by 2 μm o3 without sunlight in 10 min 84 of 20 μg l ketamine was degraded by 2 μm o3 with sunlight in 3 min o3 become the dominant reactive species after the depletion of chlorine in the sunlight chlorine system additionally primary and secondary amine functional groups were demonstrated to be the reaction

14984,sunlight induced photoirradiation of chlorine sunlight chlorine can be observed in outdoor swimming pools and open channel disinfection units for wastewater treatment in this study the degradation of ketamine an environmentally persistent pharmaceutical under sunlight irradiation in the presence of a low concentration of chlorine 1 mg l as cl2 was investigated to elucidate the evolution of reactive species and their contribution to ketamine removal oh dominates the initial stage of sunlight chlorine however after chlorine depletion reactions still progress with an observed rate constant kobs 7 6 0 50 10 3 min 1 an order of magnitude higher than photolysis alone kobs 2 9 0 15 10 4 min 1 when chlorine is depleted o3 becomes the major reactant that degrades ketamine high o3 yields were found in both sunlight hocl 12 5 0 5 at ph 5 and sunlight clo 10 1 at ph 10 systems at sub µm levels o3 resulted in substantial removal of ketamine and even faster rates were observed in the presence of sunlight a kinetic model was also established and evaluate time dependent concentration levels during sunlight chlorine the model simulation showed that the cumulative o3 concentration could reach 0 91 μm and o3 contributed 31 ketamine removal during the sunlight chlorine process primary and secondary amine functional groups were demonstrated to be the reaction sites of o3 other pharmaceuticals such as atenolol and metoprolol underwent similar phenomena in addition the experimental and model results further indicated that sunlight clo2 or clo2 also participates in the degradation of ketamine with a minor role trace amounts below nm level of clo2 and clo2 were estimated by the simulation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sunlight chlorine time dependent reactive species ozone chlorine dioxide chlorite ketamine data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the combination of ultraviolet irradiation and chlorination uv chlorine as an advanced oxidation process aop or de facto uv chlorine is frequently employed in engineered systems for water purification examples of de facto uv chlorine include swimming pools equipped with low pressure uv lpuv 254 nm for the abatement of chloramines afifi and blatchley 2016 soltermann et al 2014 and water reclamation plants e g melbourne water australia equipped with uv following chlorination for micropollutant removal gerrity et al 2013 furthermore potable reuse utilities are implementing uv chlorine in place of uv h2o2 for potable reuse treatment to improve the efficiency of contaminant removal kwon et al 2020 roback et al 2021 these uv chlorine units feature the application of high intensity uv fluence to convert chlorine to reactive radicals to destroy micropollutants within a short reaction time i e within minutes sunlight irradiation induced photocatalysis of chlorine can also be found in many natural or engineered systems including outdoor swimming pools and open channel disinfection units in wastewater treatment plants wwtps where the chlorine dosages tend to be kept at low concentrations e g 3 mg l as cl2 with relatively long light exposure nowell and hoigne 1992 research has highlighted the synergistic effects of combining light irradiation uv or sunlight with chlorine on the removal of micropollutants uv coupled with chlorine significantly enhanced the degradation of an array of aromatic compounds i e nitrobenzene carbamazepine and trimethoprim compared to uv or chlorination alone wang et al 2017 watts et al 2007 wu et al 2016 a number of studies also indicated that sunlight chlorine enhanced the degradation of chemical sun et al 2016 and biological micropollutants forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014a compared to chlorine or sunlight irradiation alone the formation of reactive species and the mechanisms for degrading micropollutants have also been extensively studied particularly for uv chlorine treatment in engineered systems wang et al 2017 watts et al 2007 wu et al 2016 reactive species evolved in the uv chlorine system include oh cl cl2 and ocl and their concentrations are functions of light intensity chlorine dosage ph and inorganic constituents carbonates chloride etc wang et al 2017 watts et al 2007 wu et al 2016 the main product channels for reactive species formation in sunlight chlorine may be different from those in lpuv chlorine for example photolysis of ocl produces cl o φ254nm 0 28 or cl o 1d φ254nm 0 13 under lpuv irradiation that predominantly emits at 254 nm but quantum yields for these pathways are much lower at 365 nm than at 254 nm φ365nm is 0 08 for cl o and 0 for cl o 1d rao et al 2012 rather cl o 3p φ 0 28 is the main product channel for the photolysis of ocl at 365 nm rao et al 2012 o is not very reactive with contaminants but is likely transformed into oh by reacting with h2o eq 1 and o 3p primarily reacts with dissolved oxygen resulting in the formation of o3 eq 2 buxton and subnani 1972 forsyth et al 2013 klaening et al 1984 these findings suggest that reactive species formation from the photolysis of chlorine is strongly wavelength dependent and the degradation kinetics of micropollutants during uv chlorine may be distinct from those of sunlight chlorine indeed research has demonstrated that the enhanced inactivation of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and bacillus subtilis endospores during sunlight chlorine was driven by o3 forsyth et al 2013 zhou et al 2014b which forms at lower concentrations under lpuv irradiation than under sunlight

lesser extent during sunlight chlorine treatment forsyth et al 2013 sun et al 2016 yang et al 2020 these studies largely focused on the initial stage of reactions where chlorine remained at similar levels i e chlorine depletion 44 or residual chlorine concentration 2 mg l as cl2 at the end of the experiments however products or intermediates from the photolysis of chlorine may affect the degradation of contaminants particularly after prolonged light exposure during which chlorine is largely consumed for example a previous study demonstrated that the degradation of caffeine accelerated as uv chlorine treatment proceeded driven by increasing steady state concentrations of ocl over time sun et al 2016 however a possible shift in the contributions of reactive species to contaminant degradation along the reaction time was not captured in previous studies of sunlight chlorine treatment this phenomenon warrants further study because the average sunlight exposure in engineered systems e g open channel disinfection units in wwtps or water treatment plants wtps or natural environments e g water bodies that receive disinfected wwtp effluent which is on the order of hours is much longer than the half life t1 2 of chlorine under sunlight exposure 10 min nowell and hoigne 1992 the objective of this study was to investigate the contaminant degradation kinetics and mechanism during sunlight photolysis in the presence of chlorine under environmentally relevant conditions in particular we focused on the effect of the evolution of reactive species on degrading contaminants in this study we examined the degradation of ketamine an environmentally persistent compound under simulated sunlight irradiation in the presence of low mg l levels of chlorine the kinetic model was also established to elucidate the formation and contribution of reactive species during sunlight chlorine 2 methods 2 1 photolysis experiments to initiate each experiment deionized water buffered with 5 mm phosphate at the desired ph was spiked with ketamine and sodium hypochlorite at target concentrations and decanted in round bottom quartz glass tubes 1 6 cm i d 13 5 cm depth volume 27 ml capped with quartz stoppers the photochemical experiments were conducted in a sunlight simulator suntest cps atlas chicago il usa at an irradiation intensity of 700 w m2 with a temperature thermostatted at 20 c the ph was adjusted using phosphate buffer sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid in different experiments samples were taken periodically and the residual chlorine was quenched immediately with an excess amount of quencher sodium thiosulfate or ascorbic acid was used to quench samples for target compound analyses and glycine was used to quench samples for chloride and chlorate analyses glycine rapidly reacts with hocl or ocl to form n chloroglycine avoiding cl formation as in the case of ascorbic acid or thiosulfate 2 2 analytical methods the concentrations of ketamine atenolol caffeine ibuprofen metoprolol and pentoxifylline were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms with an agilent 1200 liquid chromatograph agilent ca usa

zorbax c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 µm 2 3 kinetics model the kinetics model was implemented with kintecus 4 55 ianni 2019 this model contains 108 elementary reactions obtained from the literature or estimated by analogy with similar reactions table s4 while the model was based on previous models that were validated against experimental data from the uv h2o2 aop chuang et al 2016 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 and the uv chlorine aop chuang et al 2017 this model was refined with additional reactions as discussed below 3 results and discussions 3 1 ketamine degradation during sunlight chlorine fig 1 shows the time dependent concentrations of ketamine and chlorine in deionized water at ph 7 during sunlight irradiation with and without 1 0 mg l as cl2 free chlorine the degradation of ketamine attributable to direct photolysis and reacting with chlorine was 10 and 20 respectively over the 3 h experimental time scale fig 1 concurring with its low direct photolysis rate under sunlight irradiation the t1 2 was 21 6 2 6 h under 700 w m2 simulated sunlight lin et al 2014 however 3 h sunlight irradiation resulted in 87 degradation of 50 μg l ketamine with 1 0 mg l as cl2 chlorine highlighting the synergy of sunlight irradiation and chlorination interestingly after a 40 min reaction time at which the chlorine residual was below the 0 02 mg l as cl2 detection limit an additional 53 removal was observed from 14 µg l to 6 5 µg l the right figure in fig 1 for the following 140 min compared to only 3 5 removal for the no chlorine control over the same course of sunlight exposure note that the degradation of ketamine during chlorination alone sunlight irradiation alone and sunlight irradiation coupled with 1 mg l as cl2 after chlorine depletion i e after 40 min of reaction time fig 1 followed the pseudo first order model facilitating the comparison of rate constants for different degradation mechanisms the pseudo first order rate constant for ketamine degradation after 40 min of sunlight chlorine treatment 7 6 0 50 10 3 min 1 was more than an order of magnitude faster than sunlight photolysis alone 2 9 0 15 10 4 min 1 as discussed later this degradation is plausibly attributable to reactions with reactive species o3 chlorine oxides evolved during the photolysis of chlorine 3 2 reactivity of ketamine toward different reactive species at ph 7 0 where hocl and ocl coexist at a molar ratio of 3 4 1 the polychromatic sunlight irradiation of chlorine produces an array of primary reactive species these primary reactive species include oh and cl obtained via eq 3 which features a high quantum yield in the uv b range 311 nm φ 1 0 bulman et al 2019 and cl o o 1d and o 3p obtained via eqs 4 6 bulman et al 2019 reactions of primary reactive species with parent oxidants hocl or ocl generate secondary reactive species ocl eqs 8 9 among others 3 hocl hv oh cl 4 ocl hv o cl 5 ocl hv o 1d cl 6 ocl hv o 3p cl 7 o 3p o2 o3 8 oh cl hocl ocl h2o hcl 9 oh cl ocl ocl oh cl to elucidate the contribution of oh and cl on the degradation of ketamine the steady state concentration of oh and cl was experimentally measured by spiking 1 µm benzoic acid and 1 µm nitrobenzene into the system that contained 50 µg l ketamine and 1 mg l as cl2 chlorine text s3 as suggested by previous studies bulman et al 2019 fang et al 2014 sun et al 2016 note that the calculation was based on data obtained from the first 10 min of reaction time where the free chlorine concentration decay was 58 and thus it reflected the quasi steady state concentrations of radicals within the first ten minutes our experimental results indicated that the oh ss and cl ss were determined to be 4 7 10 14 m and 2 3 10 14 m respectively the k oh for ketamine is 4 43 109 m 1s 1 gu et al 2019 and the k oh for ketamine oh ss 2 1 10 4 s 1 accounted for 50 of the measured kobs for ketamine degradation 4 1 0 1 10 4 s 1 reflecting that the degradation of ketamine was driven oh at the beginning of the sunlight chlorine treatment moreover to isolate the contribution of reactive species other than oh and cl to the removal of ketamine sunlight chlorine experiments were first carried out in the presence of tert butyl alcohol t buoh as the oh cl quencher t buoh is two times more reactive with oh than with cl k oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 k cl 3 0 108 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2014b yet it exhibits relatively low reactivity with o 3p k 4 107 m 1 s 1 and o3 k 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 hoigne and bader 1983b t buoh also exhibits negligible photon absorbance at wavelengths 250 nm fig s2 when 25 mm t buoh was spiked into the systems containing 50 µg l ketamine 0 21 µm and 1 0 mg l as cl2 free chlorine in which t buoh scavenged 99 oh 99 cl 57 o 3p and negligible o3 although we can t know the accurate value of k cl and ko 3p of ketamine we assumed k cl and ko 3p of ketamine 1010 m 1 s 1 which approaches diffusion limit text s5 the degradation of ketamine after 40 min of reaction was reduced to 43 in contrast to 72 degradation in the system without spiked t buoh fig s3 note that while t buoh scavenges almost all oh and cl such that the formation of the secondary radicals e g cl2 ocl cloh should be halted the differences in degradation kinetics were likely attributable to o3 or the daughter radicals derived from the reactions between oh cl and t buoh our additional experiments suggest that o3 contributes to degradation particularly at the amine nhch3 functional group discussed in a later section 3 3 intermediates and reactive species during sunlight chlorine byproducts and or intermediates formed during the photolysis of chlorine may facilitate the formation of certain reactive species in the system apart from o3 eq 2 examples include cl leading to the formation of cl2 or cloh via eq 10 or 11 klaning and wolff 1985 mártire et al 2001 however cl2 or cloh had no significant effect to the degradation of ketamine text s6 on the other hand the self recombination of ocl a radical derived from the reactions between hocl ocl and oh cl eqs 8 9 produces cl2o2 eq 12 cl2o2 is rapidly hydrolyzed to clo2 eq 13 k 1 0 104 s 1 klaning and wolff 1985 mialocq et al 1973 subsequent reactions of oh with clo2 yield clo2 eq 14 alfassi et al 1988 and clo3 eq 16 alfassi et al 1988 some of these chlorine oxides feature high molar absorption coefficients at uva wavelengths i e 320 400 nm fig s2 such that their photosensitization may give rise to the formation of reactive species contributing to the degradation of ketamine compared to oh and cl the evolution of cl2 cloh o3 and chlorine oxides might be relevant to the degradation of ketamine at later stages of sunlight chlorine treatment when photolysis of chlorine liberates large amounts of intermediates byproducts 10 cl cl cl2 k 8 5 109 m

sunlight irradiation at ph 5 2 mm phosphate the 628 µm background cl concentration increased to 662 µm as 79 of hocl photolyzed corresponding to a 56 yield of cl the clo3 concentration did not significantly increase during this time fig s4 the relatively high background concentration of cl may be due to impurities in the chemicals used for buffer preparation in contrast when treating 73 µm ocl by maintaining the ph at 10 using 2 mm phosphate buffer with sunlight irradiation the yields were 80 for cl and 22 for clo3 fig s4 clo2 and clo2 were below the 0 3 µm detection limits in all cases presumably due to their high reactivity with radicals k oh is 7 109 m 1 s 1 for clo2 and 4 109 m 1 s 1 for clo2 eriksen et al 1981 klaning et al 1985 o3 formation in a sunlight chlorine system is directly linked to the product channel for o 3p research has shown that the φo 3p for aqueous ocl increases from 0 074 at 254 nm to 0 28 at 365 nm yet the φo 3p for aqueous hocl remains unclear at uva wavelengths bulman et al 2019 buxton and subnani 1972 bulman et al 2019 evaluated the product channel for o 3p during photolysis of free chlorine at 365 nm at ph 6 10 by determining cumulative o3 concentrations using cinnamic acid as a probe compound one cinnamic acid reacts with one o3 to generate one benzaldehyde their results indicated that the cumulative o3 concentrations when normalized by k obs for oxidant decay were 2 fold higher at ph 6 than at ph 10 suggesting the capability of hocl to form o 3p under uva irradiation this also suggests that sunlight photolysis of hocl may lead to more o3 formation than sunlight photolysis of ocl indeed when we measured the benzaldehyde concentration during sunlight chlorine treatment in the presence of 5 mm acetate at ph 5 or ph 10 the benzaldehyde yield calculated by benzaldehyde δ cl2 was 12 5 0 5 at ph 5 slightly higher than the value of 10 1 at ph 10 fig s5 note that during the experiments 5 mm acetate effectively scavenged both oh and cl but not o3 ko3 for acetate 3 10 5 m 1 s 1 which degraded benzaldehyde and catalyzed oxidant decay additional experiments were carried out to evaluate whether chlorine oxides i e clo2 clo2 clo3 or o3 with or without sunlight irradiation degrade ketamine treating 50 µg l 0 21 µm ketamine in deionized water buffered with 5 mm phosphate at ph 7 with 1 mg l 15 4 µm clo2 1 mg l 12 µm clo3 or 5 mg l as cl2 74 µm clo2 in the dark for up to 20 min caused negligible ketamine degradation treating 20 µg l ketamine with 0 096 mg l 2 µm o3 in the dark rapidly removed ketamine by 44 within the first 10 min with a concomitant o3 depletion of 80 fig 2 repeating these experiments with sunlight irradiation resulted in the synergistic removal of ketamine for three of the compounds clo2 clo2 o3 fig 2 a total of 40 of 50 μg l ketamine was degraded in 20 min during sunlight clo2 fig 2 in sunlight clo2 treatment of ketamine ketamine ketamine 0 50 μg l decreased by 28 over 1 min concurring with the 81 decrease in clo2 chlorine 0 5 mg l as cl2 fig 2 rapid depletion of oxidants was also observed in the case of sunlight o3 76 of 0 096 mg l o3 and 84 of 20 µg l ketamine decayed within 3 min fig 2 3 4 the importance of chlorine oxides and o3 kinetic modeling while our experiments confirmed that clo2 clo2 and o3 are capable of generating reactive species with sunlight irradiation we employed a kinetic model to evaluate their time dependent concentration levels during sunlight chlorine treatment the kinetic model was based on previous models that were validated against experimental data from the uv free chlorine aop and the uv clo2 aop chuang et al 2022 2017 zhang et al 2019 the model includes reactions associated with the formation and decomposition of clo2 clo3 and hocl ocl and an additional fifteen reactions related to the formation and decomposition of o3 were added table s4 eqs s99 113 fig 3 shows the kinetic model without incorporating the reactions associated with o3 reacting with ketamine and the photolysis of clo2 clo2 clo3 and o3 during sunlight chlorine ketamine 0 50 μg l 2 1 10 7 m chlorine 0 1 0 mg l as cl2 1 4 10 5 m o2 0 1 9 10 4 m 5 mm phosphate buffer initial ph 7 as shown in fig 3 chlorine was almost depleted after 40 min and clo3 gradually increased to 3 9 μm at 40 min model also indicated clo2 and clo2 concentrations at 3 5 to 0 96 nm and 0 45 to 0 12 nm respectively throughout sunlight chlorine treatment over 40 min owing to rapid reaction rates between oh and cl and clo2 k 7 109 m 1 s 1 or clo2 k 4 109 m 1 s 1 in contrast the o3 concentration gradually increased to 0 91 μm at 40 min reflecting its relatively low reactivity toward radicals indeed k oh for o3 was 1 1 108 m 1 s 1 40 fold lower than those for clo2 or clo2 when the photolysis of o3 and the reaction of o3 with ketamine whose rate constants were experimentally determined in this study text s11 were incorporated into the kinetics model the modeled concentrations remained comparable for chlorine clo3 0 to 3 9 μm clo2 3 5 to 0 98 nm and clo2 0 45 to 0 13 nm but were always below 0 10 µm for o3 throughout the 40 min course of sunlight chlorine treatment we also performed experiments with 20 µm cinnamic acid as the o3 probe compound to analyze the o3 concentration during sunlight chlorine at 1 mg l as cl2 our experimental measurements concurred with the low modeled concentrations of o3 fig 4 although the o3 concentrations were at sub µm levels in the sunlight chlorine systems we experimentally confirmed that these sub µm levels of o3 resulted in substantial removal of ketamine 70 of 20 µg l 84 nm ketamine was degraded within 60 s when applying 2 µm o3 with 5 mm phosphate buffered at ph 7 fig 2 once o3 is formed from the reaction of o 3p o2 in the sunlight chlorine system it may undergo photocatalytic decomposition to generate oh eqs 17 18 or react with hydroxide to generate o2 and oh eqs 19 25 for example photolysis of o3 at λ 411 nm generates o 1d anglada et al 2014 which reacts with water to form two oh eqs 15 16 on the other hand oh catalyzes o3 decomposition through the ho2 intermediate or the ho2 intermediate the reaction pathways demonstrate an overall stoichiometry of 3o3 to 2 oh for the ho2 intermediate pathways overall reaction 3o3 oh h 4o2 2 oh although oh scavenging by o3 may lower the observed yield of oh from o3 decay i e δ oh δ o3 this was confirmed by our experiments using terephthalate as a probe compound which reacts with oh to generate 2 hydroxyterephathate briefly aliquots of o3 stock solution 0 42 mm were added to solutions containing 10 µm terephthalate in 5 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7 to prepare initial o3 concentrations of 0 20 µm the o3 treated samples were held overnight such that no o3 residual was detected prior to the analysis of 2 hydroxyterephthalate and the results demonstrated decreasing trends for 2 hydroxyterephthalate and oh with increasing initial o3 concentration fig s9 17 o3 hv 411nm o2 o 1d 18 o 1d h2o 2 oh 19 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 k 70 m 1 s 1 20 o 3 o h o 2 h o 2 k 38 m 1 s 1 21 h o 2 o 3 o 2 oh o 2 k 5 5 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 22 h o 2 h o 2 p k a 4 8

importance of o3 and o3 derived oh in degrading ketamine without sunlight the o3 decay rate was dependent on the initial concentration at ph 7 while a t1 2 of 12 min was observed with an initial o3 concentration o3 ini of 2 6 mg l 54 µm fig s10 o3 self decay was 10 fold slower when o3 ini was 3 µm o3 dropped to 2 6 µm from 3 µm after 10 min fig s10 o3 decay became 28 fold faster with sunlight than without sunlight in experiments with the same o3 ini 2 3 µm fig s7 and s10 therefore these results suggest a negligible contribution of o3 self decay induced oh to ketamine degradation i e eqs 19 25 modeling with incorporation of the reaction of o3 with ketamine and the reaction of o3 photolysis further revealed the contributions of o3 and oh induced from the photolysis of o3 to the degradation of ketamine throughout sunlight chlorine treatment the results confirmed that 31 ketamine 5 5 was used for photolysis of o3 and 25 was used for o3 oxidation ketamine 0 50 µg l chlorine 0 1 0 mg l as cl2 was degraded by o3 and that o3 was the dominant reactive species after the depletion of chlorine in the sunlight chlorine system text s14 3 5 key reaction site the contribution of o3 in the later stage of sunlight chlorine depends on the chemical structure of the compound a ketamine molecule features a cl benzene ring a cyclohexanone and an aminomethyl group i e nhch3 fig s12 while cl benzene ko3 0 75 m 1 s 1 hoigne and bader 1983b and cyclohexanone have low reactivity toward o3 von gunten 2003 the high ko3 for dimethylamine nh ch3 2 ko3 1 9 107 m 1 s 1 hoigne and bader 1983a suggests that the aminomethyl group on ketamine is the reaction site for o3 indeed the application of 21 µm o3 to 0 21 µm ketamine with 10 mm t buoh at ph 3 5 in which ketamine primarily exists in protonated form pka for ketamine 7 5 resulted in negligible removal over 10 min fig s13 additionally we examined the degradation behaviors of five compounds atenolol caffeine metoprolol ibuprofen and pentoxifylline during sunlight chlorine treatment chlorine 0 1 0 mg l as cl2 with and without 25 mm t buoh at ph 7 these compounds are resistant to sunlight photolysis and chlorination fig s14 concurring with the observations for ketamine substantial removal 90 was found for two compounds that feature aminomethyl groups i e atenolol and metroprolol in the presence of the 25 mm tert butanol oh cl quencher compared to 0 removal for the other three compounds after 180 min of treatment fig 5 4 conclusion in this study oh was identified as the dominant radical in the initial stage of sunlight chlorine degradation of ketamine but byproducts and or intermediates such as clo2 clo2 and o3 during sunlight chlorine also facilitate the reaction in the system the results showed that 1 0 mg l clo2 and 5 0 mg l as cl2 clo2 can significantly degrade 40 and 28 of ketamine in 20 min and 1 min respectively under simulated sunlight however compared with o3 the clo2 and clo2 concentrations 0 12 0 45 and 0 96 3 5 nm respectively throughout sunlight chlorine at ph 7 chlorine 0 1 mg l as cl2 estimated by the kintecus simulation model were much lower than that of o3 the cumulative o3 concentration gradually increased to 0 91 μm moreover by using cinnamic acid as a probe o3 yields of 12 5 0 5 and 10 1 were detected at ph 5 and ph 10 in sunlight chlorine owing to the amount of o3 formed and the high reactivity of o3 with ketamine 44 of 20 μg l ketamine was degraded by 2 μm o3 without sunlight in 10 min 84 of 20 μg l ketamine was degraded by 2 μm o3 with sunlight in 3 min o3 become the dominant reactive species after the depletion of chlorine in the sunlight chlorine system additionally primary and secondary amine functional groups were demonstrated to be the reaction
