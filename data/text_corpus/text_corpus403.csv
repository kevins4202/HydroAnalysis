2015,flood damages are projected to increase with climate change due to intensification of extreme rainfalls with water scarcity also projected to increase due to longer periods of drought leading to less runoff from flood events in order to adapt to climate change precise and robust projections of flood events are required of a magnitude or rarity relevant to engineering design and water resources planning however due to the complexity of catchment specific processes which influence flood response many studies disagree on the direction and magnitude of the projected change some studies project increases in flood magnitude even above projected increases in rainfall maxima while other studies project decreases using a combination of continentally downscaled rainfall projections for australia and rainfall runoff models locally calibrated to rare floods using a novel objective function we show that projected changes in flooding do not follow projected changes in extreme rainfall with changes in flooding depending on region runoff mechanism and event severity decreases in frequent flooding up to the 1 in 5 annual exceedance probability are projected across the continent with increases only projected for frequent flooding in some tropical regions diverging from the projected increases in rainfall maxima across a majority of the continent for rare events of annual exceedance probability 1 in 50 the flood magnitude is projected to increase across the northern and eastern coasts by the end of the century commensurate with the median projected increase of 20 in rainfall maxima however decreases in both rainfall maxima and flooding are still projected for south western australia even for the rarest events the regional coherence of our results suggests the patterns in the projected changes may be applicable to other tropical temperate and arid regions around the world keywords climate change extreme rainfall flooding projections flood frequency

climate change are intensifying rainfall maxima fowler et al 2021a leading to increased rare flooding knox 1993 and greater economic losses wasko et al 2021c in addition under future warmer temperatures increasingly persistent dry periods between rainfall events chang et al 2016 are expected to decrease frequent flooding wasko et al 2021a threatening water security sharma et al 2018 and biodiversity diehl 2018 this is leading to a worst of both worlds dichotomy the small floods responsible for filling our water supplies are decreasing while the large flood events which pose a risk to life and infrastructure are increasing hence there is a pressing need to project future rainfall maxima and flood magnitudes for infrastructure design water resource management and planning fowler et al 2021b the primary driver of increases in rainfall maxima is the thermodynamic increase in atmospheric moisture saturation vapor pressure due to increases in temperature pendergrass 2018 secondary dynamical drivers related to the vertical motion of moisture can act to both increase and decrease rainfall maxima muller and takayabu 2020 muller et al 2011 for example atmospheric stability increases with increasing temperatures potentially decreasing rainfall maxima however latent heat release promotes atmospheric instability that can strengthen storms and increase peak rainfalls o gorman 2015 the thermodynamic effect of increasing temperatures is anticipated to increase annual maxima rainfalls globally with the secondary dynamic changes largely limited to lower latitudes emori and brown 2005 pfahl et al 2017 increases in flooding due to climate change are generally related to changes in saturation vapour pressure and temperature as temperatures increase so does the saturation water vapour of the atmosphere leading to all other things being equal greater precipitation maxima and hence greater runoff trenberth 1999 but this conceptual understanding neglects various other factors affecting flooding for rare floods in the order of the 1 in 100 annual exceedance probability aep we can expect changes in flooding to be dominated by changes in rainfall maxima bertola et al 2021 ivancic and shaw 2015 with this behaviour demonstrated in observational studies wasko and nathan 2019 wasko and sharma 2017a and projections brunner et al 2021 but for frequent flooding changes in antecedent moisture conditions can dominate shifts in flooding ho et al 2022 neri et al 2019 wasko et al 2020a moreover the pattern and shape of storms as well as interaction with catchment size all impact the flood response non linearly fowler et al 2021a johnson et al 2016 the result is mixed trends in flooding globally blöschl et al 2019 do et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2019 slater et al 2021 wasko et al 2021a and studies speculating on whether flood magnitudes will increase more or less than rainfall maxima in a future warmer climate quintero et al 2022 wasko et al 2019 yin et al 2018 across australia more stations show decreases in annual flow maxima than increases ishak et al 2013 wasko and nathan 2019 zhang et al 2016 while across the usa more sites show increases than decreases archfield et al 2016 lins and slack 1999 mallakpour and villarini 2015 slater and villarini 2016 changes are often regionally coherent for example increasing floods in north western europe have been associated with increasing autumn and winter rainfall while decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation have led to decreasing floods in southern europe blöschl et al 2019 across western and southern africa increased flooding has been observed since 1980 tied to changes in the namibia low level jet which transports moisture in south west africa with decreases prior to 1980 tramblay et al 2020 this spatial variability and mixed trends in observed flooding is generally in contrast to modelled projections where the 1 in 30 aep flood event is projected to increase across the globe with the exception of some parts of central europe south east australia and central south america dankers et al 2014 similarly the 1 in 100 aep flood event is also projected to increase across the world except in the central usa parts of central europe and western asia arnell and gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 compared to observed trends in floods simulated trends driven by climate forcings generally have a higher mean lower temporal variability and only account for 12 25 of the spatial variance of observed trends do et al 2020 the disparity between observed and simulated floods shows there exists large uncertainty in downscaled flood behaviour françois et al 2019 whitfield 2012 at least in part due to the biases that general circulation models gcms models exhibit in simulating extremes kim et al 2020 the projection of flooding using gcm model output in a chain of models approach hakala et al 2019 is widely accepted as future atmospheric conditions are physically modelled françois et al 2019 madsen et al 2014 in the chain of models approach gcm outputs are bias corrected and downscaled to create realistic inputs for impact models in this case hydrologic models the downscaled and bias corrected gcm projections are used to force physical or conceptual hydrologic models to simulate streamflow and consequently flood hazard however despite its popularity the chain of models framework is subject to uncertainties arising from each step of the modelling framework making it questionable whether the projections are applicable to water resources management and design guo et al 2017 kundzewicz and stakhiv 2010 indeed due to this uncertainty there remains a reluctance to adopt such approaches in formal flood guidance sharma et al 2021 an alternative method of projection can be to extrapolate historical trends as observed trends do not suffer from these uncertainties however due to the substantial variability noise in hydrologic time series finding a trend attributable to climate change often remains elusive gao et al 2022 hall et al 2014 villarini and wasko 2021 yang et al 2021 moreover there is no guarantee that past trends in flooding are indicative of the future ammar et al 2020 due to factors such as changes in catchment response stephens et al 2020 because of the high uncertainty in projections and the inability to extrapolate historical trends into the future the understanding of why floods are changing needs to be improved in order to confidently project future changes villarini and wasko 2021 historically observations of floods across the continent of australia have shown decreases in frequent flooding and increases in rare flooding wasko et al 2021a wasko and nathan 2019 in contrast floods have been projected to decrease across southern australia and increase in northern australia with these spatially diametric changes more evident for rarer events gu et al 2020 our aims here are hence threefold 1 to project rainfall and flood frequency across australia s diverse climate in the context of engineering design and water resources planning 2 improve our understanding of how changes in rainfall maxima relate to changes in flooding to explain why floods are changing across australia and 3 reconcile any possible differences between historical trends and projections of flooding 2 data and methods the aim of this manuscript is to project both rainfall and flood frequency across australia with reference to fig 1 we focused on two horizons 2050 and 2085 for two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 climate model data obtained from four gcms and four different bias correction methods was used to create time series of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet our impact model for projecting flood frequency was gr4j and was calibrated using observed data and an objective function focused on matching flood quantiles following calibration historical and future climate model simulations were downscaled and bias corrected to force the calibrated gr4j models and evaluated on flood frequency nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the trend in annual maxima finally projections of flood frequency were obtained for the two horizons and two rcps using the calibrated gr4j models and compared to the projected rainfall frequency the data and each step in this chain of models approach is detailed in fig 1 2 1 observations observed daily streamflow were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology s hydrologic reference stations hrs network the observed daily streamflow from the hrs network is compiled for the purpose of assessing long term climate change induced variability in streamflow and are considered the highest quality streamflow available for predominantly unimpacted catchments in australia bureau of meteorology 2020 the hrs have minimum record lengths of 30 years with less than 5 missing data missing data has been infilled by the australian bureau of meteorology using the gr4j model for each site infilled flow volumes contribute less than 10 of the total volume and flow volumes obtained by extrapolating rating curves contribute to less than 25 of the total volume amirthanathan et al 2023 zhang et al 2016 the hrs data consists of 467 catchments amirthanathan et al 2023 with streamflow data provided to the end of february 2019 the location of these gauges their catchment areas and record lengths and the natural resource management nrm regions that they are located in are presented in fig 2 the nrm regions are defined by catchments and bioregions of similar climatic conditions and hence are hydrologically similar in terms of runoff characteristics csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 the monsoonal north and wet tropics receive most of their rainfall in the austral summer months the wet tropics have a slightly different climate to the monsoonal north due to trade winds bringing moisture from the east the east coast and southern slopes mainly source moisture from the ocean to the east with extreme rainfall events linked largely to east coast low pressure systems holgate et al 2020 and both mean and maxima rainfall more seasonally uniform wasko et al 2020a the inland regions of the central slopes and murray basin are separated from the coastal east coast and southern slopes by a mountain range and receive less annual average rainfall than the coastal regions the southern and south western flatlands are characterized by dry summers and wet winters with moisture sources from the west the inland rangelands are largely arid desert and receive little rainfall two sites that will be referred to later are highlighted in fig 2 herbert river at abergowrie 116006b with a catchment area of 7487 km2 located in the wet tropics and reedy creek at woolshed 403221 with a catchment area of 205 5 km2 located in the murray basin these gauges were chosen to illustrate the results obtained for differing climatic regions and catchment areas daily catchment average observed rainfall for each of the hrs catchments was extracted from the australian water availability project awap using the r package awaper peterson et al 2020 awap is a high quality observed daily gridded rainfall on a grid size of 0 05 x0 05 latitude longitude or approximately 5 km 5 km jones et al 2009 derived from gauge data awap has been extensively evaluated for calculating catchment average extremes nathan et al 2016 nathan and mcmahon 2017 and documenting long term trends with climate change jones et al 2009 here we use the term rainfall to represent the total accumulated precipitation including rain snow hail and dew for consistency with the terminology used in derivation of the awap data set jones et al 2009 and because of the dominance of rainfall in precipitation in australia catchment averaged reference evapotranspiration is also obtained from australian bureau of meteorology where the pet is calculated using the penman equation penman 1948 with wind and temperature as inputs along with net radiation and vapor pressure deficit to calculate the terrestrial energy balance donohue et al 2010 2 2 projections projections of rainfall i e precipitation and pet are obtained from the bureau of meteorology s national hydrological projections service wilson et al 2022 that is part of the australian water outlook awo which provides continental scale projections of hydrological change it is not feasible to downscale and bias correct all gcms on a continental scale as a result four gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 project were bias corrected and downscaled using four different methods resulting in 16 projection members the four climate models used were access1 0 1 25 1 875 cnrm cm5 1 4 1 4 gfdl esm2m 2 0 2 5 and miroc5 1 4 1 4 with all gcm data from the first ensemble member r1i1p1f1 the guiding principles for selection of these models was modelling of key cloud features important for the southern hemisphere simulating key processes that influence australia s climate such as the el niño southern oscillation enso and representing a range of possible changes for example although access1 0 is the highest skill model for australia cnrm cm5 was included as a hot wet model gfdl esm2m as a hot dry model and miroc5 as a cool wet model full details of the model evaluation as well as models not subsequently chosen for downscaling and bias correction are provided in srikanthan et al 2022 each gcm was regridded from its native resolution to the resolution of awap before bias correction the statistical bias correction methods were isimip2b hempel et al 2013 a parametric quantile matching method which preserves the trend from the host gcm mrnbc mehrotra and sharma 2015 a multivariate recursive nested bias correction method which imparts observed distribution properties and persistence characteristics preserving relationships between variables and qme which is a quantile matching method but by using the most extreme values in the projected and observed data allows for bias corrected values to vary outside the observed range in order to preserve physical spatial dependence a fourth dynamical downscaling method ccam isimip2b utilised the regional climate model ccam at approximately a resolution of 50 km mcgregor and dix 2001 and the bias correction method isimip2b to assess the impact for each of the 16 projection members the following time horizons were simulated 1976 2005 representing a baseline referred to herein as historical scenario and 2006 2099 here we select 2036 2065 nominally centred on 2050 and 2070 2099 centred on 2085 for our projected periods and assume these periods to be quasi stationary schlef et al 2023 the hydrological projections dataset contains climate and hydrological projections for two emission scenarios representative concentration pathways 4 5 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 which correspond to radiative forcing of approximately 4 5 w m2 and greater than 8 5 w m2 for the year 2100 meinshausen et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 here we focus on rcp 8 5 as it best matches mid century projections based on current and stated policies schwalm et al 2020 we note that the australian water outlook provides projected streamflow using the australian water resources assessment landscape awra l model though these are not used directly here see text s1 further details of the downscaling and bias correction methodology can be found in wilson et al 2022 and srikanthan et al 2022 2 3 hydrologic modelling for simulating historical and projected streamflow we use the four parameter gr4j model perrin et al 2003 gr4j is a lumped conceptual soil moisture accounting model widely used for simulating observed runoff in large sample hydrology studies across the globe coron et al 2012 guo et al 2020 oudin et al 2008 gr4j consists of a single soil moisture store and uses pet and rainfall p as inputs to simulate streamflow on a dry day where rainfall is less than pet the proportion of pet that contributes to actual evapotranspiration is determined by the soil moisture accounting production store on a wet day where rainfall exceeds pet the net rainfall p minus pet replenishes the soil moisture accounting store with an actual evaporation rate calculated as a function of the soil moisture and the excess contributing to runoff production a unit hydrograph is used for runoff routing the four calibration parameters are the soil moisture store capacity the groundwater exchange rate the 1 day runoff production store capacity and the time base for the unit hydrograph as our interest is in rare floods a novel objective function d is maximised in calibration which minimises the difference in the observed and simulated quantiles the generalized extreme value gev distribution is used here to model the simulated quantiles from annual maxima coles 2001 as recommended in australia s flood guidance kuczera and franks 2019 and used globally smith et al 2015 gev quantiles are estimated in equation 1 1 g z exp 1 ε z μ σ 1 ε σ 0 ε z μ σ 0 ε 0 where z is the annual maxima and µ σ ε are the location scale and shape parameters here annual maxima are chosen for the extreme value analysis for consistency with the derivation of intensity frequency duration curves green et al 2019 and regional flood frequency estimates rahman et al 2019 that are used in practice in australia assuming the variance of the autocorrelation coefficient is normally distributed the lag 1 autocorrelation of the annual maxima was checked for statistical significance chatfield 1996 the number of sites found to have significant autocorrelation for both rainfall and streamflow annual maxima time series was less than the number of sites that could be expected to be significant by chance thereby confirming statistical independence for each catchment all available data were used in calibration shen et al 2022 the four parameters in the gr4j model were optimised using the objective function in equation 2 of the geometric mean of the ratios of simulated s and observed o flows for a range of annual exceedance percentiles p obtained from fitting a gev by l moments bezak et al 2014 hosking 2022 an additional term the ratio of the simulated to observed mean flow was added to the geometric mean to ensure extremes were not overfitted at the expense of average model performance 2 d 1 p r p 1 n 1 r p s p o p o p s p o p s p o p s p we used n 5 annual exceedance probabilities of 0 5 1 in 2 0 2 1 in 5 0 1 1 in 10 0 05 1 in 20 and 0 02 1 in 50 for calibration optimisation was performed using shuffled complex evolution andrews et al 2011 duan et al 1993 we note that australian rainfall and runoff ball et al 2019 australia s flood guidance uses the terms frequent to describe flood events that range in magnitude from the average annual maxima to the 1 in 10 aep and rare to describe flood events with aeps ranging between 1 in 10 aep to the 1 in 100 aep we adopt the same terminology here for both rainfall and streamflow maxima 2 4 evaluation for the purpose of impact assessments krysanova et al 2018 recommend assessing whether the model can reproduce the hydrological indicator of interest and any observed trends hence the performance of the hydrologic model at each catchment is evaluated using three measures 1 a comparison of the observed and simulated flood frequency curves 2 a daily nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and 3 a comparison of the sen s slope estimator for observed and simulated annual maxima streamflow the observed and simulated flood frequency curves are evaluated using a confidence interval range standardised bias rsb where the error ep for a given annual exceedance percentile is reported as a proportion of the confidence limits for the observed data as in equation 3 3 rsb p 100 e p c p 95 o p e p 0 100 e p o p c p 5 e p 0 e p s p o p the 90 confidence intervals c95 p c5 p are calculated using a parametric bootstrap with 1000 replicates a parametric bootstrap works on the principle that the fitted gev parameters are used to generate a random sample the same size as the data length and the parameters fitted to the generated random sample are then used as the replicate an rsb value of 100 implies that our simulation lies on the upper confidence interval 95th percentile and a value of 100 implies the simulated value is on the lower confidence interval 5th percentile a value of 0 means the simulation matches the observed we deem a value of between 100 and 100 to be acceptable as it represents a value within the statistical confidence limits note that the confidence intervals do not have to be symmetrical the daily nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is a measure of the proportion of explained variance relative to the 1 1 line and is presented in equation 4 an nse of zero indicates that the model simulation is only as accurate as the mean of the observed data with a value greater than zero indicating the model has skill in prediction and a value of one indicating a perfect prediction the nse is calculated for each daily observed o i and simulated s i flow as follows 4 nse 1 i o i s i 2 i o i o i 2 finally the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 is used to calculate the trend in the time series of annual maxima as per equation 5 the sen s slope estimator β is a non parametric estimator of the trend in a time series where the slope is the median slope between all the pairs of two dimensional data points x j y j 5 β m e d i a n y j y k x j x k 3 results we begin by reporting the performance of the hydrologic model calibration once satisfied the hydrologic models are fit for purpose we evaluate the 16 gcm bias correction downscaling pairs the gcm bias correction downscaling pairs that perform adequately are subsequently used for investigating projections of rainfall and flood frequency across australia 3 1 hydrologic model evaluation observed black and simulated grey flood frequency curves are presented for two example sites fig 3 calibrated using all of the available data shen et al 2022 for both catchments the observed and simulated flood frequency curves are almost identical we note that these two catchments represent two very different hydrological conditions herbert river at abergowrie fig 2a is a larger catchment 7487 km2 which experiences highly seasonal rainfall and streamflow maxima towards the end of the austral summer wasko et al 2020a reedy creek at woolshed fig 2b is a smaller catchment 2025 5 km2 where streamflow maxima are concentrated in the winter months despite the seasonality of rainfall maxima being approximately uniform wasko et al 2020a the flood frequency relationships at both these sites are modelled with minimal error highlighting the strength of the calibration approach targeting streamflow extremes the results obtained for these two examples are representative of the typical performance achieved in other nrm regions figure s2 to ensure the hydrologic models were not overfit to the extremes at the expense of average model performance we evaluate the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 using the daily observed and simulated streamflow for the analysis here we only retain catchment models with nse equal to or greater than 0 4 although this threshold may seem low it is consistent with similar large sample studies that have used a criterion of 0 5 roudier et al 2016 the nse for the 301 sites with nse 0 4 are presented in figure s3 there does not appear to be any systematic regional bias in the nse values though we note that models for drier regions are more difficult to calibrate as examples of the calculated nse station 116006b presented in fig 2a had a nse of 0 72 while station 403221 presented in fig 2b had a nse of 0 54 despite the lower nse value associated with the latter catchment there does not appear to be any pronounced degradation in the simulated flood frequency summary rsb statistics for the remaining 301 sites are presented in table 1 there did not appear to be any spatial bias in the rsb with region figure s4 across the range of aeps evaluated the simulated flood frequency is almost always within the confidence limits of the observed flood frequency even up to the 1 in 50 aep the median error is almost zero with no systematic evidence of underestimation or overestimation when we examine the 1st and 3rd quantiles the small positive bias of 2 1 for frequent 1 in 1 25 floods can be expected as our objective function focused on rarer events up to 1 in 50 finally as we are ultimately interested in understanding the change signal we present the observed and simulated trend in annual maxima streamflow for each of the 301 sites using the sen s slope fig 4 the correlation between the observed and simulated trends is 0 82 there is no evidence of any regional bias or a systematic over or under estimation of the trends a regional analysis of the correlations table 2 confirms this noting that the more arid southern and south west flatlands performed poorly by comparison we conclude that the flood frequency as well as the processes leading to changes in the flood frequency are being captured by the hydrologic models 3 2 evaluation of downscaling as large rainfalls are the primary driver of rare floods we focus our evaluation on 1 in 50 aep rainfall events the choice of the 1 in 50 aep represents a balance between focusing on rare events while minimizing the need to rely on statistical extrapolation of the fitted distributions fig 5 presents the rsb for the 1 in 50 aep downscaled rainfall and streamflow for the historical scenario each boxplot shows the rsb for the 301 catchments with nse 0 4 for one of the 16 gcm bias correction downscaling pairs examining the rainfall first the isimip2b bias correction method results in a systematic underestimation of the 1 in 50 aep while the mrnbc and qme methods show little systematic over or under estimation bias further the variability in the biases is much greater for the isimip2b method over the mrnbc and qme methods for the case of climate projections for australia from these selected gcms the bias correction method and not the gcm appears to be the key determining factor for whether downscaled projections are suitable for representing rare rainfall events for the reader s interest the 1 in 1 25 aep is presented in figure s5 for frequent events all the gcm bias correction downscaling pairs appear to be on average unbiased the downscaled and bias corrected historical gcm rainfalls are used in gr4j to produce baseline estimates of flooding these estimates are evaluated against the observed streamflow fig 5 the simulated biases from the calibration orange are presented in fig 5 as a reference for the 1 in 50 aep streamflow event there is little to no systematic over or under estimation bias gcms using isimip2b display greater variability in their biases than mrnbc and qme methods for frequent flooding the variability in the bias is greatly reduced and all methods of bias correction perform similarly figure s5 we note that although mean statistics and other variables such as temperature used in calculation of the pet were not evaluated here streamflow is the integration of the remaining hydrologic variables a comprehensive bias evaluation for both mean statistics and annual maxima across variables was performed in vogel et al 2022 consistent with the results presented here for extremes qme and mrnbc showed the smallest biases for annual maxima streamflow qme is a method developed specifically to reduce bias in extremes while mrnbc is the only method which corrects temporal auto correlation patterns suggesting persistence patterns play a key role in correctly simulating frequent and rare flood events hence these results along with the extensive evaluation presented in vogel et al 2022 provide confidence that both the mrnbc and qme bias correction approaches perform well for rare flooding the systematic biases in rare rainfalls using isimp2b prevent us from using these bias correction methods further we note that systematic biases presented here may not be relevant to the isimp2b method in general as its performance is comparable to the other bias correction methods for frequent events figure s5 however as our focus here is on rare events we proceed with the four gcm models using the mrnbc and qme bias correction methods 3 3 projections we first present projected rainfall and streamflow frequency curves fig 6 for the two example catchments shown in fig 2 to demonstrate how rainfall and flood frequency are responding to climate change on a catchment scale before presenting continent wide results fig 7 the rainfall frequency curves are fitted using the identical l moment methods used for fitting streamflow frequency curves as described in section 2 3 the projected rainfall frequency curves for herbert river at abergowrie 116006b in the tropical north of australia are shown in fig 6a for illustrative purposes this same figure is shown with delineated results from each of the gcm downscaling pairs in figure s6 rainfall maxima are projected to increase in this catchment with the greatest increases for the rarest events the greater the time horizon that is the greater the warming the more rainfall maxima increase with almost a doubling projected for the daily 1in 50 aep rainfall by the end of the century the flood frequency projections fig 6b follow a similar trend and almost look identical to the rainfall frequency projections the small decreases projected for frequent aeps rainfalls fig 6a appear to lead to small decreases in frequent aep flooding fig 6b for rarer aeps both rainfall and streamflow quantiles are projected to increase the greatest increase in flood frequency occurs for the most extreme events with an approximate doubling of the rarest flood event projected similar to the most extreme rainfall event with most gcm downscaling pairs in agreeance figure s6 for the temperate reedy creek at woolshed 403221 located in the south of the country rainfall maxima are also projected to increase with the greatest increases for the rarest events fig 6c but for this catchment projected flood frequency diverges from the projected rainfall frequency fig 6d and exhibits much greater variability figure s6 for the 2050 time horizon floods are projected to decrease across all aeps modelled for the 2085 time horizon the rainfall maxima appear to increase sufficiently to result in increases in the projected flooding there is a clear dichotomy between the flood and rainfall projections which is catchment dependent it would appear at least from these example results that compared to changes in the flood frequency rainfall projections appear to be more spatially universal we now explore whether the similarities and differences seen between the two catchments in fig 6 can be generalised to the remaining catchments that cover a range of climatic conditions and hydrologic responses fig 7 presents the median changes projected minus historical across australia using the 4 gcm models and qme and mrnbc bias scaling projections for 2085 rcp 8 5 for the interested reader model agreement is presented in figure s7 fig 7a presents the changes in the frequent aep of 1 in 1 25 rainfall maxima more stations show increases in frequent rainfall maxima than decreases but these increases are not universal across australia median change of approximately 8 increases are projected across the south east coast of australia but in the tropics there is little to no change in the south west of australia frequent rainfall maxima are projected to decrease comparing the projected change in rainfall fig 7a to flooding fig 7b for frequent events we can see a dichotomy between the direction of the projected change in streamflow compared to rainfall whereas for approximately 75 of catchments rainfall maxima are projected to increase fig 7a for 75 of catchments frequent flooding is projected to decrease fig 7b the direction and magnitude of the projected change in the 1 in 1 25 aep flood event varies considerably between regions and appears catchment specific despite projected increases in 1 in 1 25 aep rainfalls across the south east the trend in flood response is generally towards drying in the wet tropics north east australia there is some evidence that the direction of change in the flooding matches the rainfall change but to a greater extent there are both drying and wetting trends in both the rainfall maxima and flooding the only region that appears to have an overall wetting flood trend is the monsoonal north but even here the trend direction is mixed in the south west there is a strong drying trend for flooding at the 1 in 1 25 aep for the rarest events examined 1 in 50 aep fig 7c presents an almost universal wetting trend for rainfall maxima with an increase projected at 96 of sites the median projected increase is 20 the only exception to this universal wetting trend is the south west of australia there is an almost universal increase in flood magnitude for 1 in 50 aep flood events fig 7d with 83 of catchments projected to have increases the median projected increase in floods is similar in magnitude to the rainfall increase in the order of 20 the only exception remains in the south west of australia where decreases in flood magnitude even for the 1 in 50 aep flood event are projected despite projections of increased rainfall for some catchments in this region given the strong spatial dependence presented in fig 7 and variability in the projections with aep we present in fig 8 an aggregation of the median catchment projections for rcp 8 5 across the nrm regions shown in fig 2 the number in the brackets indicates the number of catchments in each region we note the central slopes 17 and rangelands 2 are omitted due to the small number of sites and large variability results for rcp 4 5 are presented in text s2 in the monsoonal north fig 8a there is large variability in the change in frequent floods compared to the change in rainfall demonstrating how catchment specific conditions play a large role in modulating the climate change impacts on flooding overall however there is little evidence that frequent rainfall maxima or flooding are projected to increase as we move from left to right along fig 8a from frequent to rare events rainfall maxima increases are greater and it appears that rare floods are projected to increase at a similar magnitude to the rare rainfall increases for the wet tropics fig 8b there is also strong evidence that catchments will experience increased rare flooding in line with increases in rare rainfall maxima and for frequent events the projected changes in rainfall are smaller in magnitude for the 1 in 1 25 aep rainfall maxima for the 2050 time horizon are projected to increase conversely the average 2085 rainfall maxima are projected to decrease and frequent flooding will decrease even further the extra warming is projected to decrease frequent flooding by the end of the century and increases in flood magnitude are only projected for events rarer than the 1 in 5 aep further south in the east coast nrm region fig 8c for 1 in 1 25 aep events there is no overall agreement in the direction of projected change in rainfall maxima however frequent floods are projected to decrease with greater decreases for the 2085 time horizon as compared to the 2050 time horizon for 1 in 5 aep events on the east coast there are universal increases projected for both rainfall maxima and flooding the southern slopes fig 8d located further south have similar flood projections to the east coast fig 8c with frequent flooding decreasing and rare flooding increasing for 2085 this is despite increases in rainfall maxima projected across all recurrence intervals here it appears that rainfall and floods occurring more frequently than the 1 in 20 aep diverge in terms of projected magnitude or even direction of change conversely flood events equal to or greater than the in 1 in 20 aep increase in line rainfall maxima results for the murray basin which represents a large growing region in south east australia are presented in fig 8e for both the 2050 and 2085 time horizons rainfall maxima are projected to increase by 20 on average across the different event frequencies but for the 2050 time horizon frequent flood magnitudes are projected on average to decrease although floods are projected to increase on average for aeps rarer than 1 in 5 the increases are still projected to be below those of rainfall maxima for 2085 this reduction in flooding is exacerbated increases are only seen on average above a 1 in 10 aep for the southern and south west flatlands fig 8f rainfall maxima are projected to increase for the 2050 time horizon with greater increases for more extreme the rainfall however increases in rainfall maxima are not projected for the 2085 time horizon floods are projected to decrease across all aeps in the southern and south west flatlands with greater decreases by the end of the century 4 discussion the results indicate that projected flood frequency curves diverge from rainfall frequency curves with differences more pronounced for more frequent aeps in the section that follows we discuss why this might be the case in order to better understand possible changes in flood drivers we first discuss physical reasons for the projected results and follow this by comparing the results to historical evidence and similar studies of rainfall maxima and flood projections this leads us to present the limitations of this study 4 1 explaining why flood frequency projections do not follow rainfall frequency projections to aid discussion we summarise the projections presented in fig 8 for the six nrm regions schematically in fig 9 for four key aeps 1 in 1 25 1 in 2 1 in 10 and 1 in 50 fig 9 allows easy reference to the spatial differences in the rainfall and streamflow maxima projections despite warming temperatures being projected across all of australia in the order of 3 5 6 5 c grose et al 2020 and warmer temperatures being associated with a greater moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere in many regions frequent rainfall maxima exhibit decreases this suggests that for frequent rainfall maxima within australia the dynamic component of change the change in atmospheric motion which decreases rainfall maxima likely outweighs the thermodynamic component the change in atmospheric moisture content which increases rainfall maxima rare rainfall events however are projected to increase across the continent of australia this greater increase in rarer rainfall events compared to frequent rainfall maxima is consistent with similar studies pendergrass 2018 pendergrass and hartmann 2014 as well as continuous rainfall simulation conditioned on temperature increases wasko and sharma 2017b this suggests for rare events the thermodynamic component of change likely outweighs the dynamic component the only exception is the south west of australia where the 1 in 50 aep rainfall maxima do not exhibit a strong increasing trend explaining why the south west of australia southern and south west flatlands do not show increases in rainfall maxima is not straightforward rainfall in the south west of australia is influenced by mid latitude fronts making it sensitive to shifts in atmospheric circulation hope 2006 risbey et al 2013 the decreases in rainfall maxima projected in the south west are generally at odds with increases in rainfall annual maxima rx1day projected by both cmip5 and cmip6 models grose et al 2020 but these projections have not undergone bias correction across australia the maximum length of dry spells are projected to increase and more so in the south west grose et al 2020 this coincides with observed decreases in the frequency of long duration rainfall events dey et al 2020 and decreases in mean annual rainfall wasko et al 2021b across southern parts of australia but these decreases in the frequency of events and mean annual rainfalls are observed across the entire southern part of the continent and not just the south west dey et al 2020 the primary difference between the south west and south east of australia is that the projected decreases in mean annual rainfall in the south west are much greater in excess of 30 by the end of the century under the high emissions scenario grose et al 2020 this is likely due to fewer troughs and more high pressure systems across the south west hope 2006 suggesting a large decrease in the occurrence of rainfall events leading to a decrease in the rainfall frequency curves at this location despite increases in rainfall maxima when it does rain for most catchments in southern australia the dominant flood generating mechanism is likely saturation excess with wet soil moisture conditions required for runoff but the reverse is more likely the case in the north with contribution from the infiltration excess runoff mechanism johnson et al 2016 wasko and guo 2022 we also know that mean rainfalls are projected to either not change or increase in the tropics with decreases projected in the extra tropics noting large uncertainty in projections for the tropics kim et al 2020 for frequent events flooding does appear to decrease as much in the tropical north as in the extra tropical south this may be because a flooding in the tropics is less linked to antecedent moisture conditions as the ratio of rainfall depth to soil moisture deficit is larger relative to extratropical regions and b antecedent soil moisture stores are not decreasing as much in the tropics due to increases in the mean annual rainfall indeed frequent flooding exhibits the largest decreases in the murray basin and south and southern and south west flatlands which experience a drier regime hence the change in flood response due to climate change is dependent on a the change in rainfall maxima b the dominant flood generating mechanism e g saturation excess vs infiltration excess and potential changes in the generating mechanism and c changes in the antecedent soil moisture conditions prior to the flood event for rare rainfall events the rainfall depth is such that the soil moisture conditions are likely to be saturated and the flood response is no longer dependent on changes in the antecedent moisture conditions brunner et al 2021 ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2019 the result is a projected increases in rare flood magnitudes largely country wide similar to that of the rainfall maxima in the murray basin the projected percentage increases in rare floods are still smaller than the projected increases in rainfall maxima possibly due to this being a very dry region experiencing large decreases in the antecedent soil moisture similarly in the southern and south west flatlands decreases in rare floods are projected possibly due to the decreases in antecedent soil moisture and the presence of deep lateritic soils that have the potential to absorb high rates of rainfall mckenzie et al 2000 4 2 comparison to historical trends and global scale projections given that long observational records were available in the calibration of the hydrologic models it is of interest to compare the observed trends in rainfall and streamflow maxima to those that are projected to see if historical trends are projected to continue into the future fig 10 presents a summary of observed trends in annual rainfall maxima and streamflow for the 301 catchments used in this study we note that as these are trends in annual maxima and not a shift in the frequency curves they represent an average change in magnitude rather than percentage change across all aeps the monsoonal north and wet tropics have experienced increases in rainfall and streamflow maxima with the increases in rainfall maxima exceeding streamflow maxima increases there are small increases in rainfall maxima in the east coast and southern slopes but overall flow maxima have decreased decreases are observed for flow annual maxima in the murray and in the southern and south west flatlands the observed trends presented here are broadly similar to previous studies which found increased annual maxima flooding in the northern parts of the country and decreases in the south ishak et al 2013 wasko and nathan 2019 zhang et al 2016 we note that a change in absolute terms may aggregate over catchments with different flood behaviour but focusing on percentage changes may present a large percentage change that may not be materially significant if the mean runoff is already low johnson et al 2016 as a result we show projected changes in absolute values in figure s8 as opposed to the percentage change values shown in fig 8 the observed trends are broadly similar to the projected trends greater increases in flooding are projected in the tropics than in the extra tropics and decreases in frequent flooding are both observed and projected in the murray basin and southern and south west flatlands it is thus evident that the future change signal is consistent with the direction of observed trends global hydrologic modelling efforts from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip have projected increases in the 1 in 30 aep flood in the tropics and decreases in the south of the country dankers et al 2014 this slightly contrasts with the results of hirabayashi et al 2013 who used discharge projections from 11 gcms with a global river routing model and concluded that increases in the frequency of the 100 year return period flood would occur across australia with the exception of the south west the results of hirabayashi et al 2013 are in greater agreement with our results that project increases in flood magnitude for rare events across australia with the exception of the southern and south west flatlands and are in agreement with projections from a majority of gcm driven global hydrologic models arnell and gosling 2016 a recent study focussing on australia used 5 cmip5 gcms and 8 global hydrologic models from isi mip gu et al 2020 figure s7 of gu et al 2020 presents changes in the 1 in 5 to 1 in 50 aep flood for the forty simulations for frequent floods decreases are projected across large parts of australia with some increases in the tropics but for rarer floods this signal is amplified and decreases or no change in flood magnitude is projected across the southern part of the country this contrasts with our results which only project decreases in the south west for rare floods and increases elsewhere we note that global assessments make simplifying assumptions and the hydrologic modelling can introduce additional uncertainty mishra et al 2020 whereas here our projections are based on locally calibrated models driven by downscaled climate projections specifically tailored to rare events 4 3 limitations and future work here we showed the projected changes in flood frequency curves do not follow projected changes in extreme rainfall suggesting that future changes in flood response will depend on changes in the antecedent moisture conditions prior to the flood event and the dominant runoff mechanism antecedent moisture conditions are projected to decrease across large parts of australia ho et al 2022 and this may be from declines in mean rainfalls and longer dry spells between events hettiarachchi et al 2022 meanwhile declines in rainfall frequency in the south west of australia are largely a result of changing atmospheric circulation hope 2006 australian rainfall variability particularly on the east coast is strongly associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso power et al 1999 pui et al 2012 wasko et al 2015 it is assumed here that the climate model projections simulate such changes but it is noted that projections of the future influence of enso remain uncertain dieppois et al 2021 here we used projections from cmip5 although cmip6 models show either an improvement or little change in simulating the enso over cmip5 the variability is larger than that in cmip5 models hence projections from both generation of models will likely to lead to similar results grose et al 2020 it is clear changes in interannual variability and long term persistence characteristics of rainfall need to be better understood to project future changes in flooding successfully aryal et al 2018 in addition any potential changes in runoff mechanism wasko 2022 and the soil moisture state chegwidden et al 2020 should also be investigated but this will require a paired sampling approach tarasova et al 2018 wasko and guo 2022 which is beyond the scope here our analysis focused on annual maxima to make inferences about changes in the rainfall and flood frequency in the context of engineering design we note that annual maxima were chosen on a calendar year basis for consistency with standard practice in the development of engineering guidance in australia green et al 2019 other possibilities exist for sampling data such as sampling on water year to ensure independence wasko et al 2020b or sampling peak over threshold time series which may improve flood frequency estimation particularly for more frequent events however a different sampling strategy is unlikely to change the results here as the focus remains on rarer events the chain of models approach which downscales and bias corrects gcm output to the local scale allows for flood producing variables such as precipitation to be physically modelled françois et al 2019 the shortcoming of such an approach is that dynamic feedbacks such as those between soil moisture and rainfall holgate et al 2019 are not modelled but are assumed to be included implicitly in the gcm modelling however such shortcomings can only be overcome with very complex land surface models conceptual rainfall runoff models like gr4j have been found to be biased when future conditions are drier compared to the calibration period whereas if the future is slightly wetter then model performance is generally minimally impacted it has been suggested that conceptual rainfall runoff models can generally be used for climate impact studies where the future mean annual rainfall is not more than 15 drier or 20 wetter than the mean annual rainfall in the model calibration period vaze et al 2010 but we note that this evaluation was for mean flows this suggests further research is required to assess model performance in a changing climate for flood projection finally the catchments have been assumed to be stationary despite the possibility of landscape changes occurring into the future pathiraja et al 2018 stephens et al 2021 but such considerations are beyond the scope of this manuscript we note that flood response is catchment specific sharma et al 2018 whitfield 2012 and care must be taken in applying the results here to other catchments however the regional coherence of our results suggest some of the conclusions presented here may be applicable to tropical temperate and arid regions around the world slater et al 2021 wasko et al 2021a 5 conclusions we began this manuscript with the aim of understanding how rainfall and flood frequency is projected to change across australia we presented a methodology using freely available data sets to calculate changes in flood frequency in a consistent and robust manner on a continental scale by the end of the century frequent rainfall maxima are projected to increase in the south east but decrease elsewhere for rare rainfall maxima increases of approximately 20 are projected continent wide frequent floods are projected to decrease across the continent with only rare floods increasing in line with rainfall maxima projections as the change in flood response due to climate change is dependent on a the change in rainfall maxima b the dominant flood mechanism and c any changes in the antecedent moisture conditions prior to the flood event we deduce that frequent floods are more likely to be a function of saturation excess and hence modulated by drying soils particularly in the southern temperate and arid regions of australia rare flooding however is less dependent on antecedent moisture conditions and hence is projected to increase in line with rainfall maxima projections these results which are broadly in line with observed trends but diverge from some previous studies allow us to make some more general conclusions 1 thermodynamic effects on increases in rainfall maxima only dominate for rare events with the dynamic component often dominant for frequent rainfall maxima consequently projections of rainfall maxima increases are only projected for the rarest of events 2 where drying soils are present and the flood generating mechanism is dominated by saturation excess frequent flooding is likely to decrease with increases in flooding only projected for rare events the aep at which floods are projected to increase rather than decrease varies with climatic region 3 future studies of flood frequency change should bias correct inputs for extremes as well as long term persistence and use these adjusted inputs in locally calibrated hydrological models due to the range of aeps studied the results presented here are likely to be of interest to both the scientific and engineering community the projection of increases in rare floods points to the increased risk to life from catastrophic flooding with climate change of flooding the projected decreases in frequent floods across tropical arid and temperate regions suggest decreases in water availability with climate change across many parts of the world future work will focus on understanding how the persistence characteristics of rainfall as well as the shape and duration of storms are projected to change and alter flood frequency declaration of competing

2015,flood damages are projected to increase with climate change due to intensification of extreme rainfalls with water scarcity also projected to increase due to longer periods of drought leading to less runoff from flood events in order to adapt to climate change precise and robust projections of flood events are required of a magnitude or rarity relevant to engineering design and water resources planning however due to the complexity of catchment specific processes which influence flood response many studies disagree on the direction and magnitude of the projected change some studies project increases in flood magnitude even above projected increases in rainfall maxima while other studies project decreases using a combination of continentally downscaled rainfall projections for australia and rainfall runoff models locally calibrated to rare floods using a novel objective function we show that projected changes in flooding do not follow projected changes in extreme rainfall with changes in flooding depending on region runoff mechanism and event severity decreases in frequent flooding up to the 1 in 5 annual exceedance probability are projected across the continent with increases only projected for frequent flooding in some tropical regions diverging from the projected increases in rainfall maxima across a majority of the continent for rare events of annual exceedance probability 1 in 50 the flood magnitude is projected to increase across the northern and eastern coasts by the end of the century commensurate with the median projected increase of 20 in rainfall maxima however decreases in both rainfall maxima and flooding are still projected for south western australia even for the rarest events the regional coherence of our results suggests the patterns in the projected changes may be applicable to other tropical temperate and arid regions around the world keywords climate change extreme rainfall flooding projections flood frequency climate modelling downscaling rainfall runoff modelling gr4j data availability all data is freely available from the links provided in the acknowledgements 1 introduction rising temperatures due to climate change are intensifying rainfall maxima fowler et al 2021a leading to increased rare flooding knox 1993 and greater economic losses wasko et al 2021c in addition under future warmer temperatures increasingly persistent dry periods between rainfall events chang et al 2016 are expected to decrease frequent flooding wasko et al 2021a threatening water security sharma et al 2018 and biodiversity diehl 2018 this is leading to a worst of both worlds dichotomy the small floods responsible for filling our water supplies are decreasing while the large flood events which pose a risk to life and infrastructure are increasing hence there is a pressing need to project future rainfall maxima and flood magnitudes for infrastructure design water resource management and planning fowler et al 2021b the primary driver of increases in rainfall maxima is the thermodynamic increase in atmospheric moisture saturation vapor pressure due to increases in temperature pendergrass 2018 secondary dynamical drivers related to the vertical motion of moisture can act to both increase and decrease rainfall maxima muller and takayabu 2020 muller et al 2011 for example atmospheric stability increases with increasing temperatures potentially decreasing rainfall maxima however latent heat release promotes atmospheric instability that can strengthen storms and increase peak rainfalls o gorman 2015 the thermodynamic effect of increasing temperatures is anticipated to increase annual maxima rainfalls globally with the secondary dynamic changes largely limited to lower latitudes emori and brown 2005 pfahl et al 2017 increases in flooding due to climate change are generally related to changes in saturation vapour pressure and temperature as temperatures increase so does the saturation water vapour of the atmosphere leading to all other things being equal greater precipitation maxima and hence greater runoff trenberth 1999 but this conceptual understanding neglects various other factors affecting flooding for rare floods in the order of the 1 in 100 annual exceedance probability aep we can expect changes in flooding to be dominated by changes in rainfall maxima bertola et al 2021 ivancic and shaw 2015 with this behaviour demonstrated in observational studies wasko and nathan 2019 wasko and sharma 2017a and projections brunner et al 2021 but for frequent flooding changes in antecedent moisture conditions can dominate shifts in flooding ho et al 2022 neri et al 2019 wasko et al 2020a moreover the pattern and shape of storms as well as interaction with catchment size all impact the flood response non linearly fowler et al 2021a johnson et al 2016 the result is mixed trends in flooding globally blöschl et al 2019 do et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2019 slater et al 2021 wasko et al 2021a and studies speculating on whether flood magnitudes will increase more or less than rainfall maxima in a future warmer climate quintero et al 2022 wasko et al 2019 yin et al 2018 across australia more stations show decreases in annual flow maxima than increases ishak et al 2013 wasko and nathan 2019 zhang et al 2016 while across the usa more sites show increases than decreases archfield et al 2016 lins and slack 1999 mallakpour and villarini 2015 slater and villarini 2016 changes are often regionally coherent for example increasing floods in north western europe have been associated with increasing autumn and winter rainfall while decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation have led to decreasing floods in southern europe blöschl et al 2019 across western and southern africa increased flooding has been observed since 1980 tied to changes in the namibia low level jet which transports moisture in south west africa with decreases prior to 1980 tramblay et al 2020 this spatial variability and mixed trends in observed flooding is generally in contrast to modelled projections where the 1 in 30 aep flood event is projected to increase across the globe with the exception of some parts of central europe south east australia and central south america dankers et al 2014 similarly the 1 in 100 aep flood event is also projected to increase across the world except in the central usa parts of central europe and western asia arnell and gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 compared to observed trends in floods simulated trends driven by climate forcings generally have a higher mean lower temporal variability and only account for 12 25 of the spatial variance of observed trends do et al 2020 the disparity between observed and simulated floods shows there exists large uncertainty in downscaled flood behaviour françois et al 2019 whitfield 2012 at least in part due to the biases that general circulation models gcms models exhibit in simulating extremes kim et al 2020 the projection of flooding using gcm model output in a chain of models approach hakala et al 2019 is widely accepted as future atmospheric conditions are physically modelled françois et al 2019 madsen et al 2014 in the chain of models approach gcm outputs are bias corrected and downscaled to create realistic inputs for impact models in this case hydrologic models the downscaled and bias corrected gcm projections are used to force physical or conceptual hydrologic models to simulate streamflow and consequently flood hazard however despite its popularity the chain of models framework is subject to uncertainties arising from each step of the modelling framework making it questionable whether the projections are applicable to water resources management and design guo et al 2017 kundzewicz and stakhiv 2010 indeed due to this uncertainty there remains a reluctance to adopt such approaches in formal flood guidance sharma et al 2021 an alternative method of projection can be to extrapolate historical trends as observed trends do not suffer from these uncertainties however due to the substantial variability noise in hydrologic time series finding a trend attributable to climate change often remains elusive gao et al 2022 hall et al 2014 villarini and wasko 2021 yang et al 2021 moreover there is no guarantee that past trends in flooding are indicative of the future ammar et al 2020 due to factors such as changes in catchment response stephens et al 2020 because of the high uncertainty in projections and the inability to extrapolate historical trends into the future the understanding of why floods are changing needs to be improved in order to confidently project future changes villarini and wasko 2021 historically observations of floods across the continent of australia have shown decreases in frequent flooding and increases in rare flooding wasko et al 2021a wasko and nathan 2019 in contrast floods have been projected to decrease across southern australia and increase in northern australia with these spatially diametric changes more evident for rarer events gu et al 2020 our aims here are hence threefold 1 to project rainfall and flood frequency across australia s diverse climate in the context of engineering design and water resources planning 2 improve our understanding of how changes in rainfall maxima relate to changes in flooding to explain why floods are changing across australia and 3 reconcile any possible differences between historical trends and projections of flooding 2 data and methods the aim of this manuscript is to project both rainfall and flood frequency across australia with reference to fig 1 we focused on two horizons 2050 and 2085 for two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 climate model data obtained from four gcms and four different bias correction methods was used to create time series of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet our impact model for projecting flood frequency was gr4j and was calibrated using observed data and an objective function focused on matching flood quantiles following calibration historical and future climate model simulations were downscaled and bias corrected to force the calibrated gr4j models and evaluated on flood frequency nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the trend in annual maxima finally projections of flood frequency were obtained for the two horizons and two rcps using the calibrated gr4j models and compared to the projected rainfall frequency the data and each step in this chain of models approach is detailed in fig 1 2 1 observations observed daily streamflow were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology s hydrologic reference stations hrs network the observed daily streamflow from the hrs network is compiled for the purpose of assessing long term climate change induced variability in streamflow and are considered the highest quality streamflow available for predominantly unimpacted catchments in australia bureau of meteorology 2020 the hrs have minimum record lengths of 30 years with less than 5 missing data missing data has been infilled by the australian bureau of meteorology using the gr4j model for each site infilled flow volumes contribute less than 10 of the total volume and flow volumes obtained by extrapolating rating curves contribute to less than 25 of the total volume amirthanathan et al 2023 zhang et al 2016 the hrs data consists of 467 catchments amirthanathan et al 2023 with streamflow data provided to the end of february 2019 the location of these gauges their catchment areas and record lengths and the natural resource management nrm regions that they are located in are presented in fig 2 the nrm regions are defined by catchments and bioregions of similar climatic conditions and hence are hydrologically similar in terms of runoff characteristics csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 the monsoonal north and wet tropics receive most of their rainfall in the austral summer months the wet tropics have a slightly different climate to the monsoonal north due to trade winds bringing moisture from the east the east coast and southern slopes mainly source moisture from the ocean to the east with extreme rainfall events linked largely to east coast low pressure systems holgate et al 2020 and both mean and maxima rainfall more seasonally uniform wasko et al 2020a the inland regions of the central slopes and murray basin are separated from the coastal east coast and southern slopes by a mountain range and receive less annual average rainfall than the coastal regions the southern and south western flatlands are characterized by dry summers and wet winters with moisture sources from the west the inland rangelands are largely arid desert and receive little rainfall two sites that will be referred to later are highlighted in fig 2 herbert river at abergowrie 116006b with a catchment area of 7487 km2 located in the wet tropics and reedy creek at woolshed 403221 with a catchment area of 205 5 km2 located in the murray basin these gauges were chosen to illustrate the results obtained for differing climatic regions and catchment areas daily catchment average observed rainfall for each of the hrs catchments was extracted from the australian water availability project awap using the r package awaper peterson et al 2020 awap is a high quality observed daily gridded rainfall on a grid size of 0 05 x0 05 latitude longitude or approximately 5 km 5 km jones et al 2009 derived from gauge data awap has been extensively evaluated for calculating catchment average extremes nathan et al 2016 nathan and mcmahon 2017 and documenting long term trends with climate change jones et al 2009 here we use the term rainfall to represent the total accumulated precipitation including rain snow hail and dew for consistency with the terminology used in derivation of the awap data set jones et al 2009 and because of the dominance of rainfall in precipitation in australia catchment averaged reference evapotranspiration is also obtained from australian bureau of meteorology where the pet is calculated using the penman equation penman 1948 with wind and temperature as inputs along with net radiation and vapor pressure deficit to calculate the terrestrial energy balance donohue et al 2010 2 2 projections projections of rainfall i e precipitation and pet are obtained from the bureau of meteorology s national hydrological projections service wilson et al 2022 that is part of the australian water outlook awo which provides continental scale projections of hydrological change it is not feasible to downscale and bias correct all gcms on a continental scale as a result four gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 project were bias corrected and downscaled using four different methods resulting in 16 projection members the four climate models used were access1 0 1 25 1 875 cnrm cm5 1 4 1 4 gfdl esm2m 2 0 2 5 and miroc5 1 4 1 4 with all gcm data from the first ensemble member r1i1p1f1 the guiding principles for selection of these models was modelling of key cloud features important for the southern hemisphere simulating key processes that influence australia s climate such as the el niño southern oscillation enso and representing a range of possible changes for example although access1 0 is the highest skill model for australia cnrm cm5 was included as a hot wet model gfdl esm2m as a hot dry model and miroc5 as a cool wet model full details of the model evaluation as well as models not subsequently chosen for downscaling and bias correction are provided in srikanthan et al 2022 each gcm was regridded from its native resolution to the resolution of awap before bias correction the statistical bias correction methods were isimip2b hempel et al 2013 a parametric quantile matching method which preserves the trend from the host gcm mrnbc mehrotra and sharma 2015 a multivariate recursive nested bias correction method which imparts observed distribution properties and persistence characteristics preserving relationships between variables and qme which is a quantile matching method but by using the most extreme values in the projected and observed data allows for bias corrected values to vary outside the observed range in order to preserve physical spatial dependence a fourth dynamical downscaling method ccam isimip2b utilised the regional climate model ccam at approximately a resolution of 50 km mcgregor and dix 2001 and the bias correction method isimip2b to assess the impact for each of the 16 projection members the following time horizons were simulated 1976 2005 representing a baseline referred to herein as historical scenario and 2006 2099 here we select 2036 2065 nominally centred on 2050 and 2070 2099 centred on 2085 for our projected periods and assume these periods to be quasi stationary schlef et al 2023 the hydrological projections dataset contains climate and hydrological projections for two emission scenarios representative concentration pathways 4 5 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 which correspond to radiative forcing of approximately 4 5 w m2 and greater than 8 5 w m2 for the year 2100 meinshausen et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 here we focus on rcp 8 5 as it best matches mid century projections based on current and stated policies schwalm et al 2020 we note that the australian water outlook provides projected streamflow using the australian water resources assessment landscape awra l model though these are not used directly here see text s1 further details of the downscaling and bias correction methodology can be found in wilson et al 2022 and srikanthan et al 2022 2 3 hydrologic modelling for simulating historical and projected streamflow we use the four parameter gr4j model perrin et al 2003 gr4j is a lumped conceptual soil moisture accounting model widely used for simulating observed runoff in large sample hydrology studies across the globe coron et al 2012 guo et al 2020 oudin et al 2008 gr4j consists of a single soil moisture store and uses pet and rainfall p as inputs to simulate streamflow on a dry day where rainfall is less than pet the proportion of pet that contributes to actual evapotranspiration is determined by the soil moisture accounting production store on a wet day where rainfall exceeds pet the net rainfall p minus pet replenishes the soil moisture accounting store with an actual evaporation rate calculated as a function of the soil moisture and the excess contributing to runoff production a unit hydrograph is used for runoff routing the four calibration parameters are the soil moisture store capacity the groundwater exchange rate the 1 day runoff production store capacity and the time base for the unit hydrograph as our interest is in rare floods a novel objective function d is maximised in calibration which minimises the difference in the observed and simulated quantiles the generalized extreme value gev distribution is used here to model the simulated quantiles from annual maxima coles 2001 as recommended in australia s flood guidance kuczera and franks 2019 and used globally smith et al 2015 gev quantiles are estimated in equation 1 1 g z exp 1 ε z μ σ 1 ε σ 0 ε z μ σ 0 ε 0 where z is the annual maxima and µ σ ε are the location scale and shape parameters here annual maxima are chosen for the extreme value analysis for consistency with the derivation of intensity frequency duration curves green et al 2019 and regional flood frequency estimates rahman et al 2019 that are used in practice in australia assuming the variance of the autocorrelation coefficient is normally distributed the lag 1 autocorrelation of the annual maxima was checked for statistical significance chatfield 1996 the number of sites found to have significant autocorrelation for both rainfall and streamflow annual maxima time series was less than the number of sites that could be expected to be significant by chance thereby confirming statistical independence for each catchment all available data were used in calibration shen et al 2022 the four parameters in the gr4j model were optimised using the objective function in equation 2 of the geometric mean of the ratios of simulated s and observed o flows for a range of annual exceedance percentiles p obtained from fitting a gev by l moments bezak et al 2014 hosking 2022 an additional term the ratio of the simulated to observed mean flow was added to the geometric mean to ensure extremes were not overfitted at the expense of average model performance 2 d 1 p r p 1 n 1 r p s p o p o p s p o p s p o p s p we used n 5 annual exceedance probabilities of 0 5 1 in 2 0 2 1 in 5 0 1 1 in 10 0 05 1 in 20 and 0 02 1 in 50 for calibration optimisation was performed using shuffled complex evolution andrews et al 2011 duan et al 1993 we note that australian rainfall and runoff ball et al 2019 australia s flood guidance uses the terms frequent to describe flood events that range in magnitude from the average annual maxima to the 1 in 10 aep and rare to describe flood events with aeps ranging between 1 in 10 aep to the 1 in 100 aep we adopt the same terminology here for both rainfall and streamflow maxima 2 4 evaluation for the purpose of impact assessments krysanova et al 2018 recommend assessing whether the model can reproduce the hydrological indicator of interest and any observed trends hence the performance of the hydrologic model at each catchment is evaluated using three measures 1 a comparison of the observed and simulated flood frequency curves 2 a daily nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and 3 a comparison of the sen s slope estimator for observed and simulated annual maxima streamflow the observed and simulated flood frequency curves are evaluated using a confidence interval range standardised bias rsb where the error ep for a given annual exceedance percentile is reported as a proportion of the confidence limits for the observed data as in equation 3 3 rsb p 100 e p c p 95 o p e p 0 100 e p o p c p 5 e p 0 e p s p o p the 90 confidence intervals c95 p c5 p are calculated using a parametric bootstrap with 1000 replicates a parametric bootstrap works on the principle that the fitted gev parameters are used to generate a random sample the same size as the data length and the parameters fitted to the generated random sample are then used as the replicate an rsb value of 100 implies that our simulation lies on the upper confidence interval 95th percentile and a value of 100 implies the simulated value is on the lower confidence interval 5th percentile a value of 0 means the simulation matches the observed we deem a value of between 100 and 100 to be acceptable as it represents a value within the statistical confidence limits note that the confidence intervals do not have to be symmetrical the daily nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is a measure of the proportion of explained variance relative to the 1 1 line and is presented in equation 4 an nse of zero indicates that the model simulation is only as accurate as the mean of the observed data with a value greater than zero indicating the model has skill in prediction and a value of one indicating a perfect prediction the nse is calculated for each daily observed o i and simulated s i flow as follows 4 nse 1 i o i s i 2 i o i o i 2 finally the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 is used to calculate the trend in the time series of annual maxima as per equation 5 the sen s slope estimator β is a non parametric estimator of the trend in a time series where the slope is the median slope between all the pairs of two dimensional data points x j y j 5 β m e d i a n y j y k x j x k 3 results we begin by reporting the performance of the hydrologic model calibration once satisfied the hydrologic models are fit for purpose we evaluate the 16 gcm bias correction downscaling pairs the gcm bias correction downscaling pairs that perform adequately are subsequently used for investigating projections of rainfall and flood frequency across australia 3 1 hydrologic model evaluation observed black and simulated grey flood frequency curves are presented for two example sites fig 3 calibrated using all of the available data shen et al 2022 for both catchments the observed and simulated flood frequency curves are almost identical we note that these two catchments represent two very different hydrological conditions herbert river at abergowrie fig 2a is a larger catchment 7487 km2 which experiences highly seasonal rainfall and streamflow maxima towards the end of the austral summer wasko et al 2020a reedy creek at woolshed fig 2b is a smaller catchment 2025 5 km2 where streamflow maxima are concentrated in the winter months despite the seasonality of rainfall maxima being approximately uniform wasko et al 2020a the flood frequency relationships at both these sites are modelled with minimal error highlighting the strength of the calibration approach targeting streamflow extremes the results obtained for these two examples are representative of the typical performance achieved in other nrm regions figure s2 to ensure the hydrologic models were not overfit to the extremes at the expense of average model performance we evaluate the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 using the daily observed and simulated streamflow for the analysis here we only retain catchment models with nse equal to or greater than 0 4 although this threshold may seem low it is consistent with similar large sample studies that have used a criterion of 0 5 roudier et al 2016 the nse for the 301 sites with nse 0 4 are presented in figure s3 there does not appear to be any systematic regional bias in the nse values though we note that models for drier regions are more difficult to calibrate as examples of the calculated nse station 116006b presented in fig 2a had a nse of 0 72 while station 403221 presented in fig 2b had a nse of 0 54 despite the lower nse value associated with the latter catchment there does not appear to be any pronounced degradation in the simulated flood frequency summary rsb statistics for the remaining 301 sites are presented in table 1 there did not appear to be any spatial bias in the rsb with region figure s4 across the range of aeps evaluated the simulated flood frequency is almost always within the confidence limits of the observed flood frequency even up to the 1 in 50 aep the median error is almost zero with no systematic evidence of underestimation or overestimation when we examine the 1st and 3rd quantiles the small positive bias of 2 1 for frequent 1 in 1 25 floods can be expected as our objective function focused on rarer events up to 1 in 50 finally as we are ultimately interested in understanding the change signal we present the observed and simulated trend in annual maxima streamflow for each of the 301 sites using the sen s slope fig 4 the correlation between the observed and simulated trends is 0 82 there is no evidence of any regional bias or a systematic over or under estimation of the trends a regional analysis of the correlations table 2 confirms this noting that the more arid southern and south west flatlands performed poorly by comparison we conclude that the flood frequency as well as the processes leading to changes in the flood frequency are being captured by the hydrologic models 3 2 evaluation of downscaling as large rainfalls are the primary driver of rare floods we focus our evaluation on 1 in 50 aep rainfall events the choice of the 1 in 50 aep represents a balance between focusing on rare events while minimizing the need to rely on statistical extrapolation of the fitted distributions fig 5 presents the rsb for the 1 in 50 aep downscaled rainfall and streamflow for the historical scenario each boxplot shows the rsb for the 301 catchments with nse 0 4 for one of the 16 gcm bias correction downscaling pairs examining the rainfall first the isimip2b bias correction method results in a systematic underestimation of the 1 in 50 aep while the mrnbc and qme methods show little systematic over or under estimation bias further the variability in the biases is much greater for the isimip2b method over the mrnbc and qme methods for the case of climate projections for australia from these selected gcms the bias correction method and not the gcm appears to be the key determining factor for whether downscaled projections are suitable for representing rare rainfall events for the reader s interest the 1 in 1 25 aep is presented in figure s5 for frequent events all the gcm bias correction downscaling pairs appear to be on average unbiased the downscaled and bias corrected historical gcm rainfalls are used in gr4j to produce baseline estimates of flooding these estimates are evaluated against the observed streamflow fig 5 the simulated biases from the calibration orange are presented in fig 5 as a reference for the 1 in 50 aep streamflow event there is little to no systematic over or under estimation bias gcms using isimip2b display greater variability in their biases than mrnbc and qme methods for frequent flooding the variability in the bias is greatly reduced and all methods of bias correction perform similarly figure s5 we note that although mean statistics and other variables such as temperature used in calculation of the pet were not evaluated here streamflow is the integration of the remaining hydrologic variables a comprehensive bias evaluation for both mean statistics and annual maxima across variables was performed in vogel et al 2022 consistent with the results presented here for extremes qme and mrnbc showed the smallest biases for annual maxima streamflow qme is a method developed specifically to reduce bias in extremes while mrnbc is the only method which corrects temporal auto correlation patterns suggesting persistence patterns play a key role in correctly simulating frequent and rare flood events hence these results along with the extensive evaluation presented in vogel et al 2022 provide confidence that both the mrnbc and qme bias correction approaches perform well for rare flooding the systematic biases in rare rainfalls using isimp2b prevent us from using these bias correction methods further we note that systematic biases presented here may not be relevant to the isimp2b method in general as its performance is comparable to the other bias correction methods for frequent events figure s5 however as our focus here is on rare events we proceed with the four gcm models using the mrnbc and qme bias correction methods 3 3 projections we first present projected rainfall and streamflow frequency curves fig 6 for the two example catchments shown in fig 2 to demonstrate how rainfall and flood frequency are responding to climate change on a catchment scale before presenting continent wide results fig 7 the rainfall frequency curves are fitted using the identical l moment methods used for fitting streamflow frequency curves as described in section 2 3 the projected rainfall frequency curves for herbert river at abergowrie 116006b in the tropical north of australia are shown in fig 6a for illustrative purposes this same figure is shown with delineated results from each of the gcm downscaling pairs in figure s6 rainfall maxima are projected to increase in this catchment with the greatest increases for the rarest events the greater the time horizon that is the greater the warming the more rainfall maxima increase with almost a doubling projected for the daily 1in 50 aep rainfall by the end of the century the flood frequency projections fig 6b follow a similar trend and almost look identical to the rainfall frequency projections the small decreases projected for frequent aeps rainfalls fig 6a appear to lead to small decreases in frequent aep flooding fig 6b for rarer aeps both rainfall and streamflow quantiles are projected to increase the greatest increase in flood frequency occurs for the most extreme events with an approximate doubling of the rarest flood event projected similar to the most extreme rainfall event with most gcm downscaling pairs in agreeance figure s6 for the temperate reedy creek at woolshed 403221 located in the south of the country rainfall maxima are also projected to increase with the greatest increases for the rarest events fig 6c but for this catchment projected flood frequency diverges from the projected rainfall frequency fig 6d and exhibits much greater variability figure s6 for the 2050 time horizon floods are projected to decrease across all aeps modelled for the 2085 time horizon the rainfall maxima appear to increase sufficiently to result in increases in the projected flooding there is a clear dichotomy between the flood and rainfall projections which is catchment dependent it would appear at least from these example results that compared to changes in the flood frequency rainfall projections appear to be more spatially universal we now explore whether the similarities and differences seen between the two catchments in fig 6 can be generalised to the remaining catchments that cover a range of climatic conditions and hydrologic responses fig 7 presents the median changes projected minus historical across australia using the 4 gcm models and qme and mrnbc bias scaling projections for 2085 rcp 8 5 for the interested reader model agreement is presented in figure s7 fig 7a presents the changes in the frequent aep of 1 in 1 25 rainfall maxima more stations show increases in frequent rainfall maxima than decreases but these increases are not universal across australia median change of approximately 8 increases are projected across the south east coast of australia but in the tropics there is little to no change in the south west of australia frequent rainfall maxima are projected to decrease comparing the projected change in rainfall fig 7a to flooding fig 7b for frequent events we can see a dichotomy between the direction of the projected change in streamflow compared to rainfall whereas for approximately 75 of catchments rainfall maxima are projected to increase fig 7a for 75 of catchments frequent flooding is projected to decrease fig 7b the direction and magnitude of the projected change in the 1 in 1 25 aep flood event varies considerably between regions and appears catchment specific despite projected increases in 1 in 1 25 aep rainfalls across the south east the trend in flood response is generally towards drying in the wet tropics north east australia there is some evidence that the direction of change in the flooding matches the rainfall change but to a greater extent there are both drying and wetting trends in both the rainfall maxima and flooding the only region that appears to have an overall wetting flood trend is the monsoonal north but even here the trend direction is mixed in the south west there is a strong drying trend for flooding at the 1 in 1 25 aep for the rarest events examined 1 in 50 aep fig 7c presents an almost universal wetting trend for rainfall maxima with an increase projected at 96 of sites the median projected increase is 20 the only exception to this universal wetting trend is the south west of australia there is an almost universal increase in flood magnitude for 1 in 50 aep flood events fig 7d with 83 of catchments projected to have increases the median projected increase in floods is similar in magnitude to the rainfall increase in the order of 20 the only exception remains in the south west of australia where decreases in flood magnitude even for the 1 in 50 aep flood event are projected despite projections of increased rainfall for some catchments in this region given the strong spatial dependence presented in fig 7 and variability in the projections with aep we present in fig 8 an aggregation of the median catchment projections for rcp 8 5 across the nrm regions shown in fig 2 the number in the brackets indicates the number of catchments in each region we note the central slopes 17 and rangelands 2 are omitted due to the small number of sites and large variability results for rcp 4 5 are presented in text s2 in the monsoonal north fig 8a there is large variability in the change in frequent floods compared to the change in rainfall demonstrating how catchment specific conditions play a large role in modulating the climate change impacts on flooding overall however there is little evidence that frequent rainfall maxima or flooding are projected to increase as we move from left to right along fig 8a from frequent to rare events rainfall maxima increases are greater and it appears that rare floods are projected to increase at a similar magnitude to the rare rainfall increases for the wet tropics fig 8b there is also strong evidence that catchments will experience increased rare flooding in line with increases in rare rainfall maxima and for frequent events the projected changes in rainfall are smaller in magnitude for the 1 in 1 25 aep rainfall maxima for the 2050 time horizon are projected to increase conversely the average 2085 rainfall maxima are projected to decrease and frequent flooding will decrease even further the extra warming is projected to decrease frequent flooding by the end of the century and increases in flood magnitude are only projected for events rarer than the 1 in 5 aep further south in the east coast nrm region fig 8c for 1 in 1 25 aep events there is no overall agreement in the direction of projected change in rainfall maxima however frequent floods are projected to decrease with greater decreases for the 2085 time horizon as compared to the 2050 time horizon for 1 in 5 aep events on the east coast there are universal increases projected for both rainfall maxima and flooding the southern slopes fig 8d located further south have similar flood projections to the east coast fig 8c with frequent flooding decreasing and rare flooding increasing for 2085 this is despite increases in rainfall maxima projected across all recurrence intervals here it appears that rainfall and floods occurring more frequently than the 1 in 20 aep diverge in terms of projected magnitude or even direction of change conversely flood events equal to or greater than the in 1 in 20 aep increase in line rainfall maxima results for the murray basin which represents a large growing region in south east australia are presented in fig 8e for both the 2050 and 2085 time horizons rainfall maxima are projected to increase by 20 on average across the different event frequencies but for the 2050 time horizon frequent flood magnitudes are projected on average to decrease although floods are projected to increase on average for aeps rarer than 1 in 5 the increases are still projected to be below those of rainfall maxima for 2085 this reduction in flooding is exacerbated increases are only seen on average above a 1 in 10 aep for the southern and south west flatlands fig 8f rainfall maxima are projected to increase for the 2050 time horizon with greater increases for more extreme the rainfall however increases in rainfall maxima are not projected for the 2085 time horizon floods are projected to decrease across all aeps in the southern and south west flatlands with greater decreases by the end of the century 4 discussion the results indicate that projected flood frequency curves diverge from rainfall frequency curves with differences more pronounced for more frequent aeps in the section that follows we discuss why this might be the case in order to better understand possible changes in flood drivers we first discuss physical reasons for the projected results and follow this by comparing the results to historical evidence and similar studies of rainfall maxima and flood projections this leads us to present the limitations of this study 4 1 explaining why flood frequency projections do not follow rainfall frequency projections to aid discussion we summarise the projections presented in fig 8 for the six nrm regions schematically in fig 9 for four key aeps 1 in 1 25 1 in 2 1 in 10 and 1 in 50 fig 9 allows easy reference to the spatial differences in the rainfall and streamflow maxima projections despite warming temperatures being projected across all of australia in the order of 3 5 6 5 c grose et al 2020 and warmer temperatures being associated with a greater moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere in many regions frequent rainfall maxima exhibit decreases this suggests that for frequent rainfall maxima within australia the dynamic component of change the change in atmospheric motion which decreases rainfall maxima likely outweighs the thermodynamic component the change in atmospheric moisture content which increases rainfall maxima rare rainfall events however are projected to increase across the continent of australia this greater increase in rarer rainfall events compared to frequent rainfall maxima is consistent with similar studies pendergrass 2018 pendergrass and hartmann 2014 as well as continuous rainfall simulation conditioned on temperature increases wasko and sharma 2017b this suggests for rare events the thermodynamic component of change likely outweighs the dynamic component the only exception is the south west of australia where the 1 in 50 aep rainfall maxima do not exhibit a strong increasing trend explaining why the south west of australia southern and south west flatlands do not show increases in rainfall maxima is not straightforward rainfall in the south west of australia is influenced by mid latitude fronts making it sensitive to shifts in atmospheric circulation hope 2006 risbey et al 2013 the decreases in rainfall maxima projected in the south west are generally at odds with increases in rainfall annual maxima rx1day projected by both cmip5 and cmip6 models grose et al 2020 but these projections have not undergone bias correction across australia the maximum length of dry spells are projected to increase and more so in the south west grose et al 2020 this coincides with observed decreases in the frequency of long duration rainfall events dey et al 2020 and decreases in mean annual rainfall wasko et al 2021b across southern parts of australia but these decreases in the frequency of events and mean annual rainfalls are observed across the entire southern part of the continent and not just the south west dey et al 2020 the primary difference between the south west and south east of australia is that the projected decreases in mean annual rainfall in the south west are much greater in excess of 30 by the end of the century under the high emissions scenario grose et al 2020 this is likely due to fewer troughs and more high pressure systems across the south west hope 2006 suggesting a large decrease in the occurrence of rainfall events leading to a decrease in the rainfall frequency curves at this location despite increases in rainfall maxima when it does rain for most catchments in southern australia the dominant flood generating mechanism is likely saturation excess with wet soil moisture conditions required for runoff but the reverse is more likely the case in the north with contribution from the infiltration excess runoff mechanism johnson et al 2016 wasko and guo 2022 we also know that mean rainfalls are projected to either not change or increase in the tropics with decreases projected in the extra tropics noting large uncertainty in projections for the tropics kim et al 2020 for frequent events flooding does appear to decrease as much in the tropical north as in the extra tropical south this may be because a flooding in the tropics is less linked to antecedent moisture conditions as the ratio of rainfall depth to soil moisture deficit is larger relative to extratropical regions and b antecedent soil moisture stores are not decreasing as much in the tropics due to increases in the mean annual rainfall indeed frequent flooding exhibits the largest decreases in the murray basin and south and southern and south west flatlands which experience a drier regime hence the change in flood response due to climate change is dependent on a the change in rainfall maxima b the dominant flood generating mechanism e g saturation excess vs infiltration excess and potential changes in the generating mechanism and c changes in the antecedent soil moisture conditions prior to the flood event for rare rainfall events the rainfall depth is such that the soil moisture conditions are likely to be saturated and the flood response is no longer dependent on changes in the antecedent moisture conditions brunner et al 2021 ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2019 the result is a projected increases in rare flood magnitudes largely country wide similar to that of the rainfall maxima in the murray basin the projected percentage increases in rare floods are still smaller than the projected increases in rainfall maxima possibly due to this being a very dry region experiencing large decreases in the antecedent soil moisture similarly in the southern and south west flatlands decreases in rare floods are projected possibly due to the decreases in antecedent soil moisture and the presence of deep lateritic soils that have the potential to absorb high rates of rainfall mckenzie et al 2000 4 2 comparison to historical trends and global scale projections given that long observational records were available in the calibration of the hydrologic models it is of interest to compare the observed trends in rainfall and streamflow maxima to those that are projected to see if historical trends are projected to continue into the future fig 10 presents a summary of observed trends in annual rainfall maxima and streamflow for the 301 catchments used in this study we note that as these are trends in annual maxima and not a shift in the frequency curves they represent an average change in magnitude rather than percentage change across all aeps the monsoonal north and wet tropics have experienced increases in rainfall and streamflow maxima with the increases in rainfall maxima exceeding streamflow maxima increases there are small increases in rainfall maxima in the east coast and southern slopes but overall flow maxima have decreased decreases are observed for flow annual maxima in the murray and in the southern and south west flatlands the observed trends presented here are broadly similar to previous studies which found increased annual maxima flooding in the northern parts of the country and decreases in the south ishak et al 2013 wasko and nathan 2019 zhang et al 2016 we note that a change in absolute terms may aggregate over catchments with different flood behaviour but focusing on percentage changes may present a large percentage change that may not be materially significant if the mean runoff is already low johnson et al 2016 as a result we show projected changes in absolute values in figure s8 as opposed to the percentage change values shown in fig 8 the observed trends are broadly similar to the projected trends greater increases in flooding are projected in the tropics than in the extra tropics and decreases in frequent flooding are both observed and projected in the murray basin and southern and south west flatlands it is thus evident that the future change signal is consistent with the direction of observed trends global hydrologic modelling efforts from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip have projected increases in the 1 in 30 aep flood in the tropics and decreases in the south of the country dankers et al 2014 this slightly contrasts with the results of hirabayashi et al 2013 who used discharge projections from 11 gcms with a global river routing model and concluded that increases in the frequency of the 100 year return period flood would occur across australia with the exception of the south west the results of hirabayashi et al 2013 are in greater agreement with our results that project increases in flood magnitude for rare events across australia with the exception of the southern and south west flatlands and are in agreement with projections from a majority of gcm driven global hydrologic models arnell and gosling 2016 a recent study focussing on australia used 5 cmip5 gcms and 8 global hydrologic models from isi mip gu et al 2020 figure s7 of gu et al 2020 presents changes in the 1 in 5 to 1 in 50 aep flood for the forty simulations for frequent floods decreases are projected across large parts of australia with some increases in the tropics but for rarer floods this signal is amplified and decreases or no change in flood magnitude is projected across the southern part of the country this contrasts with our results which only project decreases in the south west for rare floods and increases elsewhere we note that global assessments make simplifying assumptions and the hydrologic modelling can introduce additional uncertainty mishra et al 2020 whereas here our projections are based on locally calibrated models driven by downscaled climate projections specifically tailored to rare events 4 3 limitations and future work here we showed the projected changes in flood frequency curves do not follow projected changes in extreme rainfall suggesting that future changes in flood response will depend on changes in the antecedent moisture conditions prior to the flood event and the dominant runoff mechanism antecedent moisture conditions are projected to decrease across large parts of australia ho et al 2022 and this may be from declines in mean rainfalls and longer dry spells between events hettiarachchi et al 2022 meanwhile declines in rainfall frequency in the south west of australia are largely a result of changing atmospheric circulation hope 2006 australian rainfall variability particularly on the east coast is strongly associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso power et al 1999 pui et al 2012 wasko et al 2015 it is assumed here that the climate model projections simulate such changes but it is noted that projections of the future influence of enso remain uncertain dieppois et al 2021 here we used projections from cmip5 although cmip6 models show either an improvement or little change in simulating the enso over cmip5 the variability is larger than that in cmip5 models hence projections from both generation of models will likely to lead to similar results grose et al 2020 it is clear changes in interannual variability and long term persistence characteristics of rainfall need to be better understood to project future changes in flooding successfully aryal et al 2018 in addition any potential changes in runoff mechanism wasko 2022 and the soil moisture state chegwidden et al 2020 should also be investigated but this will require a paired sampling approach tarasova et al 2018 wasko and guo 2022 which is beyond the scope here our analysis focused on annual maxima to make inferences about changes in the rainfall and flood frequency in the context of engineering design we note that annual maxima were chosen on a calendar year basis for consistency with standard practice in the development of engineering guidance in australia green et al 2019 other possibilities exist for sampling data such as sampling on water year to ensure independence wasko et al 2020b or sampling peak over threshold time series which may improve flood frequency estimation particularly for more frequent events however a different sampling strategy is unlikely to change the results here as the focus remains on rarer events the chain of models approach which downscales and bias corrects gcm output to the local scale allows for flood producing variables such as precipitation to be physically modelled françois et al 2019 the shortcoming of such an approach is that dynamic feedbacks such as those between soil moisture and rainfall holgate et al 2019 are not modelled but are assumed to be included implicitly in the gcm modelling however such shortcomings can only be overcome with very complex land surface models conceptual rainfall runoff models like gr4j have been found to be biased when future conditions are drier compared to the calibration period whereas if the future is slightly wetter then model performance is generally minimally impacted it has been suggested that conceptual rainfall runoff models can generally be used for climate impact studies where the future mean annual rainfall is not more than 15 drier or 20 wetter than the mean annual rainfall in the model calibration period vaze et al 2010 but we note that this evaluation was for mean flows this suggests further research is required to assess model performance in a changing climate for flood projection finally the catchments have been assumed to be stationary despite the possibility of landscape changes occurring into the future pathiraja et al 2018 stephens et al 2021 but such considerations are beyond the scope of this manuscript we note that flood response is catchment specific sharma et al 2018 whitfield 2012 and care must be taken in applying the results here to other catchments however the regional coherence of our results suggest some of the conclusions presented here may be applicable to tropical temperate and arid regions around the world slater et al 2021 wasko et al 2021a 5 conclusions we began this manuscript with the aim of understanding how rainfall and flood frequency is projected to change across australia we presented a methodology using freely available data sets to calculate changes in flood frequency in a consistent and robust manner on a continental scale by the end of the century frequent rainfall maxima are projected to increase in the south east but decrease elsewhere for rare rainfall maxima increases of approximately 20 are projected continent wide frequent floods are projected to decrease across the continent with only rare floods increasing in line with rainfall maxima projections as the change in flood response due to climate change is dependent on a the change in rainfall maxima b the dominant flood mechanism and c any changes in the antecedent moisture conditions prior to the flood event we deduce that frequent floods are more likely to be a function of saturation excess and hence modulated by drying soils particularly in the southern temperate and arid regions of australia rare flooding however is less dependent on antecedent moisture conditions and hence is projected to increase in line with rainfall maxima projections these results which are broadly in line with observed trends but diverge from some previous studies allow us to make some more general conclusions 1 thermodynamic effects on increases in rainfall maxima only dominate for rare events with the dynamic component often dominant for frequent rainfall maxima consequently projections of rainfall maxima increases are only projected for the rarest of events 2 where drying soils are present and the flood generating mechanism is dominated by saturation excess frequent flooding is likely to decrease with increases in flooding only projected for rare events the aep at which floods are projected to increase rather than decrease varies with climatic region 3 future studies of flood frequency change should bias correct inputs for extremes as well as long term persistence and use these adjusted inputs in locally calibrated hydrological models due to the range of aeps studied the results presented here are likely to be of interest to both the scientific and engineering community the projection of increases in rare floods points to the increased risk to life from catastrophic flooding with climate change of flooding the projected decreases in frequent floods across tropical arid and temperate regions suggest decreases in water availability with climate change across many parts of the world future work will focus on understanding how the persistence characteristics of rainfall as well as the shape and duration of storms are projected to change and alter flood frequency declaration of competing

2016,a coupled unsaturated saturated model for groundwater flow in a riparian zone is established to evaluate the impacts of unsaturated zone on groundwater flow and aquifer river interactions during a flood event the semi analytical solutions for hydraulic head and discharge are obtained by the laplace fourier transform and verified with comsol multiphysics the results show that the groundwater flow induced by a flood wave is significantly influenced by the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d in the moisture characteristic curve the larger the value of κ d the stronger the water storage capacity of unsaturated zones leading to smaller fluctuations of the hydraulic head and higher water amount exchanging between an aquifer and river the present solution approaches to the solution for an unconfined aquifer when κ d 100 and approaches to the solution of confined aquifers when κ d 0 01 a thicker unsaturated zone causes less hydraulic head change and slower head recession after a flood wave passes the traditional solution for an unconfined aquifer tends to underestimate the hydraulic head and overestimate the water exchange between the aquifer and river because it neglects the water retention of the unsaturated zone the solution is applied to field data and it improves the prediction of hydraulic heads over a previous solution keywords groundwater flood event unsaturated zone analytical solution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction riparian zones as the interface of the terrestrial aquatic continuum are important in sustaining environmental flows and promoting biogeochemical activities due to the contrasting difference between river and groundwater mcclain et al 2003 meals et al 2010 brunner et al 2012 the groundwater level in a riparian zone is closely related to the river flow condition for example dam controlled or rainfall induced flooding can cause a rapid increase of groundwater level and thus change the redox condition of the riparian aquifer the transition of redox condition can affect multiple biogeochemical processes such as riverbank denitrification shuai et al 2017 numerous studies have investigated the hydraulic condition influenced by surface water and groundwater interaction in riparian zone e g cooper and rorabaugh 1963 vivoni et al 2006 liang and zhang 2013 liang et al 2018a zhang et al 2022 pinder and sauer 1971 developed a coupled model consisting of a one dimensional river and a two dimensional aquifer they found that the storage function of the riverbank deferred the arrival of the flood peak and lowered the discharge of the flood peak however they imposed non flow conditions on all model boundaries which is not always feasible hunt et al 1990 used the convolution integral technique to derive an approximate solution of the riverbank storage which obtained the same results as pinder and sauer 1971 akesson et al 2015 established a coupled analytical model to evaluate the groundwater river interactions caused by flood waves in a homogeneous aquifer liang and zhang 2013 developed a cross section model to investigate impacts of the heterogenous conductivity on the exchanges between the unconfined aquifer and river caused by the flood event a horizontal two dimensional model for groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer was developed by gomez velez 2017 which mainly focused on residence times and hyporheic flux exchanges the studies mentioned above focus more on the water movement perpendicular to the river neglecting groundwater flow along the river flow direction however the groundwater may flow in parallel with river channels with the forces of flood wave in river channels rutschmann and hager 1996 liang et al 2018 on the other hand a number of researchers have recognized that the unsaturated zone may have a nonnegligible impacts on the groundwater river interaction in the riparian zone gillham 1984 pointed out that the unsaturated zone could be ignored only when its thickness is relatively small parlange and brutsaert 1987 found that the thickness of the vadose zone affected the specific yield and in turn affected the movement of groundwater paniconi 2003 and cartwright et al 2005 found that the retention capacity of the unsaturated zone reduced the magnitude of the groundwater levels fluctuations hilberts et al 2007 developed a hillslope storage boussinesq model hsb by considering the vertically unsaturated flow which is used to quantify groundwater flow in a hillslope aquifer kong et al 2016 modified the hsb model by considering the lateral flow in the unsaturated zone which indicated that the lateral flow in the vadose zone may affect the drainage process significantly liang et al 2017b proposed a model of coupled unsaturated saturated flow to interpret the effects of the unsaturated flow on base flow recession their study identified that the constitutive exponent of unsaturated zone has a nonnegligible impact on the slope recession hydrographs all of the research above emphasized the importance of the unsaturated zone indicating the necessity of considering the vadose zone while simulating the response of groundwater to the flood event to the best knowledge of the authors however an analytical solution describing flows induced by the flood event in the saturated zone coupled with the vadose zone has not been reported before such a solution is very useful when quantifying the aquifer river interactions to flood events that take into account the effects of the unsaturated zone in this study a coupled saturated unsaturated flow model is developed to explore the groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer induced by the flood wave in the river channel the water flow in the aquifer is governed by a three dimensional groundwater flow equation and the unsaturated flow is governed by a one dimensionally linearized richards equation a diffusive type hydrograph is adopted to describe the flood event the semi analytical solutions for the groundwater levels and exchange fluxes are derived using the laplace fourier transform method the semi analytical solution is verified with the numerical simulation the effects of unsaturated zone are demonstrated by comparing the present solution with the unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer models the present solution is also applied to the field data the mathematical models and the solutions are presented in sections 2 and 3 respectively and the validation of the solution is presented in section 4 the results and discussions are presented in section 5 and the summary are drawn in the section 6 2 conceptual and mathematical model the conceptual model of water flow in an unsaturated saturated zone induced by fluctuated river stages is illustrated in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate is located at the initial water table near the river the x axis is perpendicular to the river channel and points to the surface water drainage divide the y axis is parallel to the river channel and points towards downstream and the z axis is vertical upward the base of the aquifer saturated zone is impermeable the aquifer is fully penetrated by the river without barriers the aquifer is homogeneous anisotropic and slightly compressible the governing equation for groundwater flow in the saturated zone can be written as 1a k x 2 h x 2 k y 2 h y 2 k z 2 h z 2 s s h t h s z ξ 1b h x y z 0 0 1c h 0 y z t f y t 1d h x y z t x x l h x y z t z z h s 0 1e h x y z t y 0 where h is the hydraulic head in the aquifer l k x k y and k z represent the hydraulic conductivity in the x y and z directions lt 1 s s is the specific storage l 1 l is the distance between the river and the watershed divide l ξ is the location of the moving water table h s is the location of the aquifer base l f y t is the river stage that depends on the y and is time varying l the temporal fluctuation of river stage along the river channel is caused by flood events which could be approximated by a diffusive function chanson 2004 intaraprasong and zhan 2009 liang et al 2018a in this study the diffusive type wave function used in the previous studies is adopted to describe the river hydrograph caused by the flood event 2 f y t α d r t exp y v t 2 4 d r t where α is a constant that is relative to the peak of the river stage l 2 d r represents the diffusion coefficient of the flood wave l 2 t 1 v is the velocity of the flood wave lt 1 equation 2 suggests that the flood event is assumed initiating at y 0 it should be noted that we assume that the groundwater discharge does not affect the river stage which requires that the river discharge is much larger than the groundwater discharge this situation is usually satisfied because when flood waves pass through a river the groundwater discharge is much smaller than the river discharge the water flow in the unsaturated zone is mainly forced by the fluctuating water table that is caused by the flood wave therefore the unsaturated flow is dominated by the vertical flow which can be approximately described by the one dimensional richards equation 3a k z z k θ u z c θ u t ξ z h u 3b u z t z z h u 0 where k θ is the relative hydraulic conductivity u is the total head of the unsaturated zone l θ is the volumetric water content c θ d θ d ψ is the specific moisture capacity l 1 ψ is the pressure head of the unsaturated zone l h u is the elevation of ground surface top of unsaturated zone l it should be noted in equation 3b that a nonflow condition is imposed at the ground surface implying that the infiltration and evaporation are neglected the reason is that the flood wave signal in aquifer usually propagates over much short periods in relative to the periods of the infiltration and the evaporation the gardner kozeny model gardner 1958 is commonly adopted to quantify the hydraulic properties of the unsaturated zone because it is amendable to analytical treatment kroszynski and dagan 1975 mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 moreover several previous studies demonstrated that the gardner kozeny model and the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 is equivalent and transportable ghezzehei et al 2007 mishra and neuman 2010 liang et al 2022 the latter model is widely used to describe the hydraulic properties of the unsaturated zone therefore the gardner kozeny model gardner 1958 is adopted by this study 4a θ ψ θ r θ s θ r e κ ψ ψ a ψ ψ a 4b c ψ d θ d ψ s y κ e κ ψ ψ a ψ ψ a 4c k ψ e κ ψ ψ a ψ ψ a where θ r and θ s are the residual and the saturated water contents respectively s y θ s θ r is the specific yield or the drainable porosity κ is the constitutive exponent l 1 which account for the retention capacity and the permeability of the unsaturated zone ψ a is the pressure head required for air to enter a saturated medium l the unsaturated and saturated flow are coupled by the continuity of the hydraulic head and the normal flux across the water table which are presented by the following equations 5a h x y z t u z t z ξ 5b h x y z t z u z t z z ξ the nonlinear richards equation 3 bounded by a moving water table 4 is difficult to solve analytically to get the analytical solution of equation 3 the common strategy is to linearize the nonlinear equations 3 5 by adopting the perturbation method kroszynski and dagan 1975 with the assumption of small changes in hydraulic heads compared to the aquifer thickness the details of the linearization process were presented in several previous papers kroszynski and dagan 1975 mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 liang et al 2022 the governing equation 3 is linearized by the perturbation method and its linearized form can be written as 6 k z z k 0 z u z c 0 z u t 0 z h u where k 0 z and c 0 z are the zero order approximations of the k ψ and the c ψ at the hydrostatic water content of θ 0 respectively which can be described by the modified gardner kozeny model liang et al 2017a liang et al 2017b mishra and neuman 2010 7a c 0 z s y κ e x p κ z 7b k 0 z e x p κ z following the linearized treatment the moving water table is assumed to be fixed at the initial water table i e ξ 0 and the continuity conditions 5 reduces to 8a h x y z t u z t z 0 8b h x y z t z u z t z z 0 it should be noted that following the linearized treatment h s and h u will denote the thickness of saturated and unsaturated zones respectively this linearized richards equation has been widely adopted to quantify the unsaturated saturated flow in the previous studies mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 mishra and neuman 2010 liang et al 2017a liang et al 2017b lin et al 2017 chang et al 2018 liang et al 2018b liang et al 2018c qi et al 2020 liang et al 2022 these studies suggested that the linearized richards equation can well reproduce groundwater flow in unsaturated saturated zones moreover liang et al 2022 recently demonstrated that the linearized richards equation with the corresponding modified gardner kozeny model agree well with the nonlinear richards equation 3 solutions 3 1 dimensionless transformation for the convenience

analytically into the time domain the numerical inverse laplace transform is commonly adopted to evaluate the semi analytical solutions the common numerical inverse laplace methods include the zakian algorithm zakian 1969 fourier series algorithm dubner and abate 1968 stehfest algorithm stehfest 1970 crump algorithm crump 1976 talbot method talbot 1979 and de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 in these methods the de hoog algorithm is adopted widely to treat the problem of groundwater flow moreover the de hoog algorithm provides a very high accuracy when dealing with groundwater flow induced by the fluctuating aquifer recharge liang et al 2017b and stream stages zhang et al 2022 therefore the de hoog algorithm is adopted in this study to invert the laplace domain solutions into the time domain in addition the solutions 13a 14a 16a 20a and 21 all involve the integrations that are difficult to be evaluated analytically owing to the complicated integrands these integrations are evaluated numerically using the global adaptive quadrature algorithm which is implemented by a matlab function integral 4 comparison with numerical solution the validity of the solution 13a should be verified because evaluating this solution involves numerical inverse laplace transformation and numerical integration comparing with the numerical solution is an alternative strategy to test the validity of the analytical solution when a benchmark analytical solution is unavailable a good agreement between the two solutions appears that the analytical solution is reliable in this study the benchmark analytical solution to the present model is unavailable therefore the validity of the solution 13a is verified by comparing it with the numerical solutions first we compare the present solution 13a with solutions of the equations 10 12 solved numerically using comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa for the numerical model the infinite region in y d direction is replaced with a finite region at 10 y d 35 for practical operability for this geometric size the impact of the boundaries is negligible because the flood wave does not propagate to these boundaries in the simulating period to achieve appropriate discretization of the numerical model we set the maximum and minimum dimensionless element sizes 0 08 and 0 0164 respectively and the element growth rate is no more than 1 3 the total number of elements is 1143939 the simulation period is t d 5 the time steps start at δ t d 0 001 and the time steps exponentially it should be noted that to investigate the effects of the discretization of grid and time on the numerical results we have compared the current model to a model with a finer discretization of grid and time and no difference is between the results of them therefore we choose the current model for the numerical modelling for the calculation efficiency the model parameters are α d 0 05 p 10 d d 0 1 k yd 1 k zd 1 0 h ud 0 05 and h sd 0 2 fig 2 illustrates the comparisons of the hydraulic head of the solution 13a solid curves to that of the numerical solution circle symbols for different times locations and κ d fig 2 shows that the present solution 13a agrees with the numerical model very well at the different time locations and the parameter κ d of unsaturated zone second we compare the numerical solutions of the nonlinear richards equation to the present solution 13a equation 13a is the solution of the saturated flow equation 10a coupling with the linearized richards equation 11a to test the validity of this linearized solution we compare it with the solution of the saturated flow equation 10a coupling with the nonlinear richards equation that is solved numerically using the comsol multiphysics as well the nonlinear solution is also displayed in fig 2 dotted curves fig 2 shows that the present solution slightly deviates from the nonlinear solution for a given κ d 0 01 when the observation point is far away from the river fig 2a and 2b to further inspect this deviation fig 3 presents the contours of hydraulic heads in the x y plane at three different times t d 1 5 2 0 a n d 2 5 where the parameters are the same as used in fig 2 fig 3 clearly displays that the linear solution present solution agrees well with the nonlinear solution in the most regions while some mild deviations exist in the upper right corner of the contours this deviation is interpreted as implying that we linearized the governing equations using the perturbation method which requires that the changes in hydraulic heads are relatively small compared to the aquifer thickness therefore the present solution will deviate from the nonlinear solution more significantly near the peak of hydraulic heads we also investigated this deviation with the different κ d values in fig 2d it shows that the linear solution slightly underestimates the landward propagation of the flood signal as compared to the nonlinear solution when κ d is large the reason for this could be that the linear solution fixes the interface between unsaturated and saturated zones at its initial position whereas the nonlinear solution releases this limitation resulting in the linear solution underestimating hydraulic heads when the water table rises sufficiently particularly in an unsaturated zone with a large κ d the physical properties of the κ d will be discussed in the following section in short the comparisons illustrated in both figs 2 and 3 indicate that despite moderate differences the present linearized solution agrees with the nonlinear numerical solution in all their essential features meaning that the present solution 13a could be an approximate solution of the nonlinear governing equations 5 results and discussions 5 1 impacts of unsaturated zones on hydraulic heads the characteristics of unsaturated zones are mainly determined by the constitutive exponent κ d and the unsaturated zone thickness h ud firstly we explore the impacts of κ d on the responses of groundwater levels to the flood wave to clearly demonstrate the effects of unsaturated zones we compare the present solution 13a with the solution of the unconfined aquifer 16a and the solution of confined aquifer 18a it should be noted that the confined flow described by the solution 18a is horizontally two dimensional to compare these solutions to each other we integrated vertically the dimensionless hydraulic head of the solutions 13a and 16a by 23 h a x d y d t d 1 h sd h sd 0 h x d y d z d t d d z d the parameter values are α d 0 05 p 10 d d 0 1 k yd 1 0 k zd 1 0 h ud 0 05 h sd 0 2 fig 4 displays the vertically averaged heads against the time for the different κ d at three locations x d 0 01 0 05 a n d 0 1 where y d 1 fig 4 compares the present solution with the solutions of the unconfined and confined aquifers it shows that the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d has a nonnegligible impact on the response of groundwater levels to the flood wave a larger κ d results in a lower amplitude of groundwater level fluctuations the present solution is nearly the same as the solution of the unconfined aquifer when κ d 100 dotted curve and it deviates from the solution of the unconfined aquifer but approaches the solution of the confined aquifer when κ d is close to 0 01 dashed curve the similar observations have been recognized in the previous studies about the unsaturated saturated flow induced by pumping and slug tests tartakovsky and neuman 2007 liang et al 2018c we interpret this result to imply that for a smaller κ d the unsaturated zone may have the finer soils the unsaturated zone has a larger retention capacity near the water table which make it difficult for water to flow through the interface between the unsaturated and saturated zones causing the higher hydraulic head during its rising phase and the lower hydraulic head during its dropping phase in this situation κ d 0 01 the hydraulic property of the upper boundary of the saturated zone is close to the non flow which causes the groundwater flow in the saturated zone to behave the water flow in a confined aquifer when κ d is larger the coarser soils in the unsaturated zone however the unsaturated zone has a larger storage capacity and a higher permeability which further facilitate to water flow into or drainage from the unsaturated zone leading to the lower hydraulic heads in the saturated zone to further demonstrate the impacts of κ d fig 5 displays the hydraulic heads versus t d for the different κ d at three aquifer depths z d 0 0 05 a n d 0 2 where x d 0 01 a n d y d 1 it shows that the effects of κ d dramatically decline with depth as expected becoming negligible at the aquifer base z d 0 2 because this location is so distant from the unsaturated zone additionally for the different depths the present solution also generally falls between the solutions of the confined and unconfined aquifers but due to vertical head differences the present solution at κ d 0 01 slightly departs from the confined aquifer and substantially departs from the unconfined aquifer at κ d 100 fig 5a which is different from that in fig 4 fig 4 also shows that the difference between these curves increases with distance to the river suggesting that the effect of unsaturated zone on hydraulic heads is more pronounced when the observation point is away from the river this phenomenon is illustrated more clearly in fig 6 which shows the variations in the vertically averaged head against x d for different κ d at three times t d with a given y d 1 where the parameter values are the same as in fig 4 it clearly shows that the influence of the unsaturated zone increases with the distance from the river we interpret this result to imply that the signal of a flood wave in aquifers will be attenuated with the distance from the river the unsaturated zone has a significant impact on signal attenuation an unsaturated zone of large storage capacity large κ d will enhance flood signal attenuation whereas an unsaturated zone of large retention capacity small κ d will promote signal propagation the comparisons shown in figs 4 and 6 suggest that the unconfined solution may underestimate the hydraulic heads because it ignores the water holding properties of the unsaturated zone to further demonstrate the effect of the unsaturated zone we respectively display the contour of hydraulic heads in horizontal fig 7 and vertical fig 8 directions under a flood wave at different κ d fig 7 shows that for a smaller κ d the flood wave affect a larger area of the aquifer especially in the x direction indicating that the wave signal laterally propagates longer distances in aquifers fig 7 shows that when κ d is small water flows almost horizontally in the aquifer whereas when κ d is large water flows vertically upwards it is because the unsaturated zone with smaller κ d has a larger retention capacity near the water table which impedes groundwater flow into the unsaturated zone upwards which in turn drives the wave signal propagation laterally within the aquifer conversely for a larger κ d the wave signal spread over a smaller area of the aquifer because more groundwater infiltrates upwards into the unsaturated zone second we investigate the effects of the dimensionless thickness of unsaturated zone h ud fig 9 depicts the changes of the vertically averaged heads against time for different h ud at three locations x d 0 01 0 05 a n d 0 1 where y d 1 where κ d 1 and the other parameter values are the same as in fig 4 the unsaturated thickness h ud also has a nonnegligible impact on the responses of hydraulic heads to the flood wave the large h ud results in the less hydraulic head change and slow head recession after a flood wave passes moreover when h ud 0 the present solution red curve approaches the confined solution dashed curve and gradually closes to the unconfined solution dotted curve with h ud increases for a very thick unsaturated zone h ud 1 0 however the present solution approaches its asymptotic value that is substantially different from the solution of the unconfined aquifer because this asymptotic value is mainly determined by a fixed κ d of 1 0 when the h ud is very large we interpret this result to imply that for a very small h ud the water table approaches the ground surface that is imposed a nonflow boundary causing the present solution to behave similarly to the confined solution for a larger h ud the unsaturated zone has a larger storage capacity which significantly dampens the fluctuations of the groundwater levels causing the present solution to behave similarly to the unconfined solution fig 9 also show that the effect of unsaturated thickness is negligible when the observation point is very close to the river x d 0 01 while its effect is significantly pronounced when the observation point is far away from the river which is consistent to the impact of the κ d to further investigate the impact of the unsaturated thickness fig 10 depicts the changes of hydraulic heads h d at z d 0 i e water table versus time for different h ud at three locations x d 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 where y d 1 it demonstrates that the effect of unsaturated thickness on h d is more substantial than that of h a however when the observation point is far from the river the effect of unsaturated thickness on h d remains more pronounced as it does for h a 5 2 effects of unsaturated zone on exchange fluxes of aquifer river in this section we investigate how the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d impacts exchange fluxes between the aquifer and the river we compare the present solution 20 with the solution of unconfined aquifer without unsaturated zones 21 and the solution of confined aquifer 22 fig 11 displays the changes of the lateral discharge along the stream with y d for different κ d at a specific time t d 1 the parameter values are α d 0 05 p 10 d d 0 1 k yd 1 0 k zd 1 0 h ud 0 05 and h sd 0 2 fig 9 also compares the present solution solid curves with the solutions of unconfined dotted curve and confined dashed curve aquifers it shows that the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d has a substantial impact on the discharges during a flood wave larger κ d leads to the higher exchange fluxes between the aquifer and the river the present solution of discharge is close to the solution of the unconfined aquifer when κ d 100 dotted curve and gradually deviates from the unconfined solution but approaches the confined solution when κ d decreases to 0 01 dashed curve as mentioned earlier for a smaller κ d the unsaturated zone has a larger retention capacity which impedes water flow into or drainage from the unsaturated zone the enhanced retention in the unsaturated zone when κ d is small reduces the flow exchange between the aquifer and the river resulting in lower flood wave induced water fluxes between the river and the riparian aquifer when κ d is larger however the unsaturated zone has a higher permeability and a larger storage capacity which further facilitate water to flow into or drainage from the unsaturated zone such an effect leads to the larger amount of the exchange fluxes of the aquifer river it is interesting to note that the exchange fluxes predicted by the solution of unconfined aquifers are the largest it implies that the solution of the unconfined aquifer without the unsaturated zone tend to overestimate the amount of the water exchange of the aquifer river when the saturated zone has a small κ d as is well known the rising river stage caused by the flood wave will reverse the groundwater flow direction in the riverbank which cause the river water to infiltrate into the aquifer during the rising river stage as the flood peak passes away the river stage will drop leading to that the river water that pervious infiltrated into the riparian aquifer will eventually discharge back to the river here we refer to this process as return flow liang et al 2018a identified that the return flow decreases as a power law of time which is differ to the base flow recession that decreases exponentially with time the return flow of power law implies that the river water in the riparian aquifer will discharge back to the river for a long time fig 9 shows that the unsaturated zone has a nonnegligible impacts on the exchanging fluxes between the aquifer river that in turn affects the return flow to clearly illustrate the effects of the unsaturated zone on the return flow we plotted the total groundwater discharge q d against t d with a specific y d 5 for the log log scale for a given river channel length the total discharge increases at the beginning and goes down when the flood peak passes the unsaturated zone has a significantly impacts on the form of return flow for a large κ d the return flow decreases as a power law of time which is same as the solution of the unconfined aquifer dotted curves in fig 12 however as κ d decreases the return flow gradually deviates from the power law form and approaches the exponential form this observation implies that when the unsaturated zone has a large storage capacity large κ d the infiltrated river water will stay in the aquifer for a long time and the discharge process will be sustained for a long period of time as well conversely when the unsaturated zone has a large retention capacity small κ d the river water in the riparian aquifer will quickly discharge back into the river after the flood event and the aquifer will behave as a confined aquifer dashed curves in fig 12 5 3 application in this section we apply the analytical solution 13a on the field data which were tested by the previous solution liang et al 2018a we compare the solution 13a with the solution of liang et al 2018a that neglects the unsaturated flow and the vertically flow component in the aquifer in this field case the hourly groundwater levels in two observation wells in the riparian zone of walnut creek at iowa usa were observed walnut creek responds rapidly to flood events due to its flashy discharge which ranges from 0 002 m 3 s to 13 9 m 3 s at the downstream gaging station schilling 2000 the alluvial stratigraphy of floodplain is dominated by silt and clay 60 80 with minor amounts of thin sands and gravelly channel deposits schilling et al 2013 the two wells pasture 2 1 and woods 2 1 are installed in the unconfined aquifer of the floodplain the distance from pasture 2 1 and woods 2 1 to the river channel is 1 m and 6 m respectively woods 2 1 is downstream of pasture 2 1 and is 970 m away from pasture 2 1 the details of the field are presented in the previous studies schilling et al 2004 2006 schilling and zhang 2012 liang et al 2018 based on the previous investigations on hydrogeological conditions the aquifer parameters can be summarized as follows the aquifer is assumed to be isotropic with the hydraulic conductivity 1 0 m d the average unsaturated and saturated zone thickness are 3 m and 10 m respectively the distance between the river channel and the groundwater divide is 175 m the specific yield is 0 1 and the specific storage is 1 10 5 m 1 the constitutive exponent of the unsaturated zone and the parameters of the flood wave are identified by fitting the present solution with the observation data first we fit the observed water levels in the upstream well pasture 2 1 red circles in fig 13 using the solution 13a the κ v d r α and the time of the peak stage t m are estimated by the levenberg marquardt method then the water levels in the woods 2 1 well are predicted using the solution 13a by the estimated parameters which is obtained by fitting the pasture 2 1 data fig 13 presents the comparison of the observed water levels in two wells with the calculated water levels using the solution 13a and the solution of liang et al 2018a the constitutive exponent of the unsaturated zone is set to be 0 1 m 1 the estimated parameters of flood waves are summarized in table 1 for the pasture 2 1 both the present and liang et al s solutions generally agree with the observation data except for the substantial underestimation of the hydraulic heads during the recession period it indicates that the two solutions can reproduce the rapid rise of groundwater levels by responding to the flood events but is unable to predict the slow recession processes for the woods 2 1 well however the two solutions partly match the observed water levels at early time but they perform poorly at the later time the main reason is that the water levels in the woods 2 1 are not fitted by adjusting the model parameters instead it is fitted with the calculated water levels using the estimated parameters which is obtained by fitting the pasture 2 1 data a few other factors such as the low permeability riverbed the presence of a seepage face in the aquifer river interface the partially penetrating river the lagging response of river stage to a flood event and the sinuous river channel may influence the analytical solution s performance in predicting the observation data the effects of these factors have been discussed in previous study liang et al 2018 in addition to these factors the previous study has shown that the aquifer at this site has layered heterogeneous structures schilling et al 2006 which may cause the analytical solution based on the assumption of a homogeneous aquifer to fail to reproduce water level fluctuations as well comparing to the liang et al s solution the present solution preforms slightly better predication on hydraulic heads for all three flood events which obtains a smaller root mean square error rmse than that of the solution of liang et al 2018a table 1 in addition the present solution has a capacity to estimate the constitutive exponent κ of unsaturated zone by fitting the observed groundwater levels it is notable that the present solution improves on the liang et al s solution to get a slightly better fit on the observation data we interpret this result to imply that both observation wells are very close to the river 1 m for the pasture 2 1well and 6 m for the woods 2 1well for this situation the influence of the unsaturated zone is relatively small which is clearly demonstrated in figs 4 and 6 finally it should be noted that despite the substantial difference the present solution agrees with the observation data in all their essential features meaning that the solution 13a can predict the response of the groundwater levels at the rising stage and the peak during flood events by specifically considering the effect of the unsaturated zone 6 summary and conclusions in this paper a coupled saturated unsaturated flow model is developed to explore the effect of unsaturated zone on the response of groundwater in an unconfined aquifer to a flood wave in the river channel the semi analytical solutions for the groundwater level and exchange flux are derived with the laplace fourier transform the solutions are tested with numerical simulations and an existing analytical solution and is applied to field data several significant results are summarized as follows 1 both the constitutive exponent κ d and unsaturated zone thickness have significant impacts on the response of hydraulic heads to a flood wave the larger κ d leads to a lower amplitude for the fluctuations of hydraulic head the present solution approaches to the solution for an unconfined aquifer when κ d is large and to the solution for a confined aquifer as κ d is small increasing the thickness results in smaller hydraulic heads and a slow head recession after a flood wave passes 2 the unsaturated zone has a significant impact on flood signal propagation in aquifers the unconfined solution without considering unsaturated zones may underestimate the hydraulic heads when the observation point is away from the river 3 the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d has significant impacts on the discharge of an aquifer smaller κ d results in lower water exchanging between the aquifer and river induced by a flood wave the unconfined solution tends to overestimate the water exchange between the aquifer and river when the saturated zone has a small κ d 4 the solution derived in this study reproduces the responses of the water levels in the observation wells in the walnut creek watershed of iowa to flood events in comparison to the previous solution which did not consider unsaturated zones the present solution performs relatively better hydraulic head predication though the improvement is marginal and it also has a capacity to estimate the constitutive exponent κ of unsaturated zone credit authorship

2016,a coupled unsaturated saturated model for groundwater flow in a riparian zone is established to evaluate the impacts of unsaturated zone on groundwater flow and aquifer river interactions during a flood event the semi analytical solutions for hydraulic head and discharge are obtained by the laplace fourier transform and verified with comsol multiphysics the results show that the groundwater flow induced by a flood wave is significantly influenced by the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d in the moisture characteristic curve the larger the value of κ d the stronger the water storage capacity of unsaturated zones leading to smaller fluctuations of the hydraulic head and higher water amount exchanging between an aquifer and river the present solution approaches to the solution for an unconfined aquifer when κ d 100 and approaches to the solution of confined aquifers when κ d 0 01 a thicker unsaturated zone causes less hydraulic head change and slower head recession after a flood wave passes the traditional solution for an unconfined aquifer tends to underestimate the hydraulic head and overestimate the water exchange between the aquifer and river because it neglects the water retention of the unsaturated zone the solution is applied to field data and it improves the prediction of hydraulic heads over a previous solution keywords groundwater flood event unsaturated zone analytical solution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction riparian zones as the interface of the terrestrial aquatic continuum are important in sustaining environmental flows and promoting biogeochemical activities due to the contrasting difference between river and groundwater mcclain et al 2003 meals et al 2010 brunner et al 2012 the groundwater level in a riparian zone is closely related to the river flow condition for example dam controlled or rainfall induced flooding can cause a rapid increase of groundwater level and thus change the redox condition of the riparian aquifer the transition of redox condition can affect multiple biogeochemical processes such as riverbank denitrification shuai et al 2017 numerous studies have investigated the hydraulic condition influenced by surface water and groundwater interaction in riparian zone e g cooper and rorabaugh 1963 vivoni et al 2006 liang and zhang 2013 liang et al 2018a zhang et al 2022 pinder and sauer 1971 developed a coupled model consisting of a one dimensional river and a two dimensional aquifer they found that the storage function of the riverbank deferred the arrival of the flood peak and lowered the discharge of the flood peak however they imposed non flow conditions on all model boundaries which is not always feasible hunt et al 1990 used the convolution integral technique to derive an approximate solution of the riverbank storage which obtained the same results as pinder and sauer 1971 akesson et al 2015 established a coupled analytical model to evaluate the groundwater river interactions caused by flood waves in a homogeneous aquifer liang and zhang 2013 developed a cross section model to investigate impacts of the heterogenous conductivity on the exchanges between the unconfined aquifer and river caused by the flood event a horizontal two dimensional model for groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer was developed by gomez velez 2017 which mainly focused on residence times and hyporheic flux exchanges the studies mentioned above focus more on the water movement perpendicular to the river neglecting groundwater flow along the river flow direction however the groundwater may flow in parallel with river channels with the forces of flood wave in river channels rutschmann and hager 1996 liang et al 2018 on the other hand a number of researchers have recognized that the unsaturated zone may have a nonnegligible impacts on the groundwater river interaction in the riparian zone gillham 1984 pointed out that the unsaturated zone could be ignored only when its thickness is relatively small parlange and brutsaert 1987 found that the thickness of the vadose zone affected the specific yield and in turn affected the movement of groundwater paniconi 2003 and cartwright et al 2005 found that the retention capacity of the unsaturated zone reduced the magnitude of the groundwater levels fluctuations hilberts et al 2007 developed a hillslope storage boussinesq model hsb by considering the vertically unsaturated flow which is used to quantify groundwater flow in a hillslope aquifer kong et al 2016 modified the hsb model by considering the lateral flow in the unsaturated zone which indicated that the lateral flow in the vadose zone may affect the drainage process significantly liang et al 2017b proposed a model of coupled unsaturated saturated flow to interpret the effects of the unsaturated flow on base flow recession their study identified that the constitutive exponent of unsaturated zone has a nonnegligible impact on the slope recession hydrographs all of the research above emphasized the importance of the unsaturated zone indicating the necessity of considering the vadose zone while simulating the response of groundwater to the flood event to the best knowledge of the authors however an analytical solution describing flows induced by the flood event in the saturated zone coupled with the vadose zone has not been reported before such a solution is very useful when quantifying the aquifer river interactions to flood events that take into account the effects of the unsaturated zone in this study a coupled saturated unsaturated flow model is developed to explore the groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer induced by the flood wave in the river channel the water flow in the aquifer is governed by a three dimensional groundwater flow equation and the unsaturated flow is governed by a one dimensionally linearized richards equation a diffusive type hydrograph is adopted to describe the flood event the semi analytical solutions for the groundwater levels and exchange fluxes are derived using the laplace fourier transform method the semi analytical solution is verified with the numerical simulation the effects of unsaturated zone are demonstrated by comparing the present solution with the unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer models the present solution is also applied to the field data the mathematical models and the solutions are presented in sections 2 and 3 respectively and the validation of the solution is presented in section 4 the results and discussions are presented in section 5 and the summary are drawn in the section 6 2 conceptual and mathematical model the conceptual model of water flow in an unsaturated saturated zone induced by fluctuated river stages is illustrated in fig 1 the origin of the coordinate is located at the initial water table near the river the x axis is perpendicular to the river channel and points to the surface water drainage divide the y axis is parallel to the river channel and points towards downstream and the z axis is vertical upward the base of the aquifer saturated zone is impermeable the aquifer is fully penetrated by the river without barriers the aquifer is homogeneous anisotropic and slightly compressible the governing equation for groundwater flow in the saturated zone can be written as 1a k x 2 h x 2 k y 2 h y 2 k z 2 h z 2 s s h t h s z ξ 1b h x y z 0 0 1c h 0 y z t f y t 1d h x y z t x x l h x y z t z z h s 0 1e h x y z t y 0 where h is the hydraulic head in the aquifer l k x k y and k z represent the hydraulic conductivity in the x y and z directions lt 1 s s is the specific storage l 1 l is the distance between the river and the watershed divide l ξ is the location of the moving water table h s is the location of the aquifer base l f y t is the river stage that depends on the y and is time varying l the temporal fluctuation of river stage along the river channel is caused by flood events which could be approximated by a diffusive function chanson 2004 intaraprasong and zhan 2009 liang et al 2018a in this study the diffusive type wave function used in the previous studies is adopted to describe the river hydrograph caused by the flood event 2 f y t α d r t exp y v t 2 4 d r t where α is a constant that is relative to the peak of the river stage l 2 d r represents the diffusion coefficient of the flood wave l 2 t 1 v is the velocity of the flood wave lt 1 equation 2 suggests that the flood event is assumed initiating at y 0 it should be noted that we assume that the groundwater discharge does not affect the river stage which requires that the river discharge is much larger than the groundwater discharge this situation is usually satisfied because when flood waves pass through a river the groundwater discharge is much smaller than the river discharge the water flow in the unsaturated zone is mainly forced by the fluctuating water table that is caused by the flood wave therefore the unsaturated flow is dominated by the vertical flow which can be approximately described by the one dimensional richards equation 3a k z z k θ u z c θ u t ξ z h u 3b u z t z z h u 0 where k θ is the relative hydraulic conductivity u is the total head of the unsaturated zone l θ is the volumetric water content c θ d θ d ψ is the specific moisture capacity l 1 ψ is the pressure head of the unsaturated zone l h u is the elevation of ground surface top of unsaturated zone l it should be noted in equation 3b that a nonflow condition is imposed at the ground surface implying that the infiltration and evaporation are neglected the reason is that the flood wave signal in aquifer usually propagates over much short periods in relative to the periods of the infiltration and the evaporation the gardner kozeny model gardner 1958 is commonly adopted to quantify the hydraulic properties of the unsaturated zone because it is amendable to analytical treatment kroszynski and dagan 1975 mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 moreover several previous studies demonstrated that the gardner kozeny model and the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 is equivalent and transportable ghezzehei et al 2007 mishra and neuman 2010 liang et al 2022 the latter model is widely used to describe the hydraulic properties of the unsaturated zone therefore the gardner kozeny model gardner 1958 is adopted by this study 4a θ ψ θ r θ s θ r e κ ψ ψ a ψ ψ a 4b c ψ d θ d ψ s y κ e κ ψ ψ a ψ ψ a 4c k ψ e κ ψ ψ a ψ ψ a where θ r and θ s are the residual and the saturated water contents respectively s y θ s θ r is the specific yield or the drainable porosity κ is the constitutive exponent l 1 which account for the retention capacity and the permeability of the unsaturated zone ψ a is the pressure head required for air to enter a saturated medium l the unsaturated and saturated flow are coupled by the continuity of the hydraulic head and the normal flux across the water table which are presented by the following equations 5a h x y z t u z t z ξ 5b h x y z t z u z t z z ξ the nonlinear richards equation 3 bounded by a moving water table 4 is difficult to solve analytically to get the analytical solution of equation 3 the common strategy is to linearize the nonlinear equations 3 5 by adopting the perturbation method kroszynski and dagan 1975 with the assumption of small changes in hydraulic heads compared to the aquifer thickness the details of the linearization process were presented in several previous papers kroszynski and dagan 1975 mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 liang et al 2022 the governing equation 3 is linearized by the perturbation method and its linearized form can be written as 6 k z z k 0 z u z c 0 z u t 0 z h u where k 0 z and c 0 z are the zero order approximations of the k ψ and the c ψ at the hydrostatic water content of θ 0 respectively which can be described by the modified gardner kozeny model liang et al 2017a liang et al 2017b mishra and neuman 2010 7a c 0 z s y κ e x p κ z 7b k 0 z e x p κ z following the linearized treatment the moving water table is assumed to be fixed at the initial water table i e ξ 0 and the continuity conditions 5 reduces to 8a h x y z t u z t z 0 8b h x y z t z u z t z z 0 it should be noted that following the linearized treatment h s and h u will denote the thickness of saturated and unsaturated zones respectively this linearized richards equation has been widely adopted to quantify the unsaturated saturated flow in the previous studies mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 mishra and neuman 2010 liang et al 2017a liang et al 2017b lin et al 2017 chang et al 2018 liang et al 2018b liang et al 2018c qi et al 2020 liang et al 2022 these studies suggested that the linearized richards equation can well reproduce groundwater flow in unsaturated saturated zones moreover liang et al 2022 recently demonstrated that the linearized richards equation with the corresponding modified gardner kozeny model agree well with the nonlinear richards equation 3 solutions 3 1 dimensionless transformation for the convenience

presented in the supporting information s1 for the unconfined aquifer without considering the influence of unsaturated zone the upper boundary of the aquifer can be described by the free water table

the groundwater flow can be described by the following equation malama et al 2011 neuman 1972 zhan and zlotnik 2002 zhang et al 2022 17 2 h d x d 2 k yd 2 h d y d 2 h d t d h sd z d 0 the analytical

analytically into the time domain the numerical inverse laplace transform is commonly adopted to evaluate the semi analytical solutions the common numerical inverse laplace methods include the zakian algorithm zakian 1969 fourier series algorithm dubner and abate 1968 stehfest algorithm stehfest 1970 crump algorithm crump 1976 talbot method talbot 1979 and de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 in these methods the de hoog algorithm is adopted widely to treat the problem of groundwater flow moreover the de hoog algorithm provides a very high accuracy when dealing with groundwater flow induced by the fluctuating aquifer recharge liang et al 2017b and stream stages zhang et al 2022 therefore the de hoog algorithm is adopted in this study to invert the laplace domain solutions into the time domain in addition the solutions 13a 14a 16a 20a and 21 all involve the integrations that are difficult to be evaluated analytically owing to the complicated integrands these integrations are evaluated numerically using the global adaptive quadrature algorithm which is implemented by a matlab function integral 4 comparison with numerical solution the validity of the solution 13a should be verified because evaluating this solution involves numerical inverse laplace transformation and numerical integration comparing with the numerical solution is an alternative strategy to test the validity of the analytical solution when a benchmark analytical solution is unavailable a good agreement between the two solutions appears that the analytical solution is reliable in this study the benchmark analytical solution to the present model is unavailable therefore the validity of the solution 13a is verified by comparing it with the numerical solutions first we compare the present solution 13a with solutions of the equations 10 12 solved numerically using comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa for the numerical model the infinite region in y d direction is replaced with a finite region at 10 y d 35 for practical operability for this geometric size the impact of the boundaries is negligible because the flood wave does not propagate to these boundaries in the simulating period to achieve appropriate discretization of the numerical model we set the maximum and minimum dimensionless element sizes 0 08 and 0 0164 respectively and the element growth rate is no more than 1 3 the total number of elements is 1143939 the simulation period is t d 5 the time steps start at δ t d 0 001 and the time steps exponentially it should be noted that to investigate the effects of the discretization of grid and time on the numerical results we have compared the current model to a model with a finer discretization of grid and time and no difference is between the results of them therefore we choose the current model for the numerical modelling for the calculation efficiency the model parameters are α d 0 05 p 10 d d 0 1 k yd 1 k zd 1 0 h ud 0 05 and h sd 0 2 fig 2 illustrates the comparisons of the hydraulic head of the solution 13a solid curves to that of the numerical solution circle symbols for different times locations and κ d fig 2 shows that the present solution 13a agrees with the numerical model very well at the different time locations and the parameter κ d of unsaturated zone second we compare the numerical solutions of the nonlinear richards equation to the present solution 13a equation 13a is the solution of the saturated flow equation 10a coupling with the linearized richards equation 11a to test the validity of this linearized solution we compare it with the solution of the saturated flow equation 10a coupling with the nonlinear richards equation that is solved numerically using the comsol multiphysics as well the nonlinear solution is also displayed in fig 2 dotted curves fig 2 shows that the present solution slightly deviates from the nonlinear solution for a given κ d 0 01 when the observation point is far away from the river fig 2a and 2b to further inspect this deviation fig 3 presents the contours of hydraulic heads in the x y plane at three different times t d 1 5 2 0 a n d 2 5 where the parameters are the same as used in fig 2 fig 3 clearly displays that the linear solution present solution agrees well with the nonlinear solution in the most regions while some mild deviations exist in the upper right corner of the contours this deviation is interpreted as implying that we linearized the governing equations using the perturbation method which requires that the changes in hydraulic heads are relatively small compared to the aquifer thickness therefore the present solution will deviate from the nonlinear solution more significantly near the peak of hydraulic heads we also investigated this deviation with the different κ d values in fig 2d it shows that the linear solution slightly underestimates the landward propagation of the flood signal as compared to the nonlinear solution when κ d is large the reason for this could be that the linear solution fixes the interface between unsaturated and saturated zones at its initial position whereas the nonlinear solution releases this limitation resulting in the linear solution underestimating hydraulic heads when the water table rises sufficiently particularly in an unsaturated zone with a large κ d the physical properties of the κ d will be discussed in the following section in short the comparisons illustrated in both figs 2 and 3 indicate that despite moderate differences the present linearized solution agrees with the nonlinear numerical solution in all their essential features meaning that the present solution 13a could be an approximate solution of the nonlinear governing equations 5 results and discussions 5 1 impacts of unsaturated zones on hydraulic heads the characteristics of unsaturated zones are mainly determined by the constitutive exponent κ d and the unsaturated zone thickness h ud firstly we explore the impacts of κ d on the responses of groundwater levels to the flood wave to clearly demonstrate the effects of unsaturated zones we compare the present solution 13a with the solution of the unconfined aquifer 16a and the solution of confined aquifer 18a it should be noted that the confined flow described by the solution 18a is horizontally two dimensional to compare these solutions to each other we integrated vertically the dimensionless hydraulic head of the solutions 13a and 16a by 23 h a x d y d t d 1 h sd h sd 0 h x d y d z d t d d z d the parameter values are α d 0 05 p 10 d d 0 1 k yd 1 0 k zd 1 0 h ud 0 05 h sd 0 2 fig 4 displays the vertically averaged heads against the time for the different κ d at three locations x d 0 01 0 05 a n d 0 1 where y d 1 fig 4 compares the present solution with the solutions of the unconfined and confined aquifers it shows that the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d has a nonnegligible impact on the response of groundwater levels to the flood wave a larger κ d results in a lower amplitude of groundwater level fluctuations the present solution is nearly the same as the solution of the unconfined aquifer when κ d 100 dotted curve and it deviates from the solution of the unconfined aquifer but approaches the solution of the confined aquifer when κ d is close to 0 01 dashed curve the similar observations have been recognized in the previous studies about the unsaturated saturated flow induced by pumping and slug tests tartakovsky and neuman 2007 liang et al 2018c we interpret this result to imply that for a smaller κ d the unsaturated zone may have the finer soils the unsaturated zone has a larger retention capacity near the water table which make it difficult for water to flow through the interface between the unsaturated and saturated zones causing the higher hydraulic head during its rising phase and the lower hydraulic head during its dropping phase in this situation κ d 0 01 the hydraulic property of the upper boundary of the saturated zone is close to the non flow which causes the groundwater flow in the saturated zone to behave the water flow in a confined aquifer when κ d is larger the coarser soils in the unsaturated zone however the unsaturated zone has a larger storage capacity and a higher permeability which further facilitate to water flow into or drainage from the unsaturated zone leading to the lower hydraulic heads in the saturated zone to further demonstrate the impacts of κ d fig 5 displays the hydraulic heads versus t d for the different κ d at three aquifer depths z d 0 0 05 a n d 0 2 where x d 0 01 a n d y d 1 it shows that the effects of κ d dramatically decline with depth as expected becoming negligible at the aquifer base z d 0 2 because this location is so distant from the unsaturated zone additionally for the different depths the present solution also generally falls between the solutions of the confined and unconfined aquifers but due to vertical head differences the present solution at κ d 0 01 slightly departs from the confined aquifer and substantially departs from the unconfined aquifer at κ d 100 fig 5a which is different from that in fig 4 fig 4 also shows that the difference between these curves increases with distance to the river suggesting that the effect of unsaturated zone on hydraulic heads is more pronounced when the observation point is away from the river this phenomenon is illustrated more clearly in fig 6 which shows the variations in the vertically averaged head against x d for different κ d at three times t d with a given y d 1 where the parameter values are the same as in fig 4 it clearly shows that the influence of the unsaturated zone increases with the distance from the river we interpret this result to imply that the signal of a flood wave in aquifers will be attenuated with the distance from the river the unsaturated zone has a significant impact on signal attenuation an unsaturated zone of large storage capacity large κ d will enhance flood signal attenuation whereas an unsaturated zone of large retention capacity small κ d will promote signal propagation the comparisons shown in figs 4 and 6 suggest that the unconfined solution may underestimate the hydraulic heads because it ignores the water holding properties of the unsaturated zone to further demonstrate the effect of the unsaturated zone we respectively display the contour of hydraulic heads in horizontal fig 7 and vertical fig 8 directions under a flood wave at different κ d fig 7 shows that for a smaller κ d the flood wave affect a larger area of the aquifer especially in the x direction indicating that the wave signal laterally propagates longer distances in aquifers fig 7 shows that when κ d is small water flows almost horizontally in the aquifer whereas when κ d is large water flows vertically upwards it is because the unsaturated zone with smaller κ d has a larger retention capacity near the water table which impedes groundwater flow into the unsaturated zone upwards which in turn drives the wave signal propagation laterally within the aquifer conversely for a larger κ d the wave signal spread over a smaller area of the aquifer because more groundwater infiltrates upwards into the unsaturated zone second we investigate the effects of the dimensionless thickness of unsaturated zone h ud fig 9 depicts the changes of the vertically averaged heads against time for different h ud at three locations x d 0 01 0 05 a n d 0 1 where y d 1 where κ d 1 and the other parameter values are the same as in fig 4 the unsaturated thickness h ud also has a nonnegligible impact on the responses of hydraulic heads to the flood wave the large h ud results in the less hydraulic head change and slow head recession after a flood wave passes moreover when h ud 0 the present solution red curve approaches the confined solution dashed curve and gradually closes to the unconfined solution dotted curve with h ud increases for a very thick unsaturated zone h ud 1 0 however the present solution approaches its asymptotic value that is substantially different from the solution of the unconfined aquifer because this asymptotic value is mainly determined by a fixed κ d of 1 0 when the h ud is very large we interpret this result to imply that for a very small h ud the water table approaches the ground surface that is imposed a nonflow boundary causing the present solution to behave similarly to the confined solution for a larger h ud the unsaturated zone has a larger storage capacity which significantly dampens the fluctuations of the groundwater levels causing the present solution to behave similarly to the unconfined solution fig 9 also show that the effect of unsaturated thickness is negligible when the observation point is very close to the river x d 0 01 while its effect is significantly pronounced when the observation point is far away from the river which is consistent to the impact of the κ d to further investigate the impact of the unsaturated thickness fig 10 depicts the changes of hydraulic heads h d at z d 0 i e water table versus time for different h ud at three locations x d 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 where y d 1 it demonstrates that the effect of unsaturated thickness on h d is more substantial than that of h a however when the observation point is far from the river the effect of unsaturated thickness on h d remains more pronounced as it does for h a 5 2 effects of unsaturated zone on exchange fluxes of aquifer river in this section we investigate how the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d impacts exchange fluxes between the aquifer and the river we compare the present solution 20 with the solution of unconfined aquifer without unsaturated zones 21 and the solution of confined aquifer 22 fig 11 displays the changes of the lateral discharge along the stream with y d for different κ d at a specific time t d 1 the parameter values are α d 0 05 p 10 d d 0 1 k yd 1 0 k zd 1 0 h ud 0 05 and h sd 0 2 fig 9 also compares the present solution solid curves with the solutions of unconfined dotted curve and confined dashed curve aquifers it shows that the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d has a substantial impact on the discharges during a flood wave larger κ d leads to the higher exchange fluxes between the aquifer and the river the present solution of discharge is close to the solution of the unconfined aquifer when κ d 100 dotted curve and gradually deviates from the unconfined solution but approaches the confined solution when κ d decreases to 0 01 dashed curve as mentioned earlier for a smaller κ d the unsaturated zone has a larger retention capacity which impedes water flow into or drainage from the unsaturated zone the enhanced retention in the unsaturated zone when κ d is small reduces the flow exchange between the aquifer and the river resulting in lower flood wave induced water fluxes between the river and the riparian aquifer when κ d is larger however the unsaturated zone has a higher permeability and a larger storage capacity which further facilitate water to flow into or drainage from the unsaturated zone such an effect leads to the larger amount of the exchange fluxes of the aquifer river it is interesting to note that the exchange fluxes predicted by the solution of unconfined aquifers are the largest it implies that the solution of the unconfined aquifer without the unsaturated zone tend to overestimate the amount of the water exchange of the aquifer river when the saturated zone has a small κ d as is well known the rising river stage caused by the flood wave will reverse the groundwater flow direction in the riverbank which cause the river water to infiltrate into the aquifer during the rising river stage as the flood peak passes away the river stage will drop leading to that the river water that pervious infiltrated into the riparian aquifer will eventually discharge back to the river here we refer to this process as return flow liang et al 2018a identified that the return flow decreases as a power law of time which is differ to the base flow recession that decreases exponentially with time the return flow of power law implies that the river water in the riparian aquifer will discharge back to the river for a long time fig 9 shows that the unsaturated zone has a nonnegligible impacts on the exchanging fluxes between the aquifer river that in turn affects the return flow to clearly illustrate the effects of the unsaturated zone on the return flow we plotted the total groundwater discharge q d against t d with a specific y d 5 for the log log scale for a given river channel length the total discharge increases at the beginning and goes down when the flood peak passes the unsaturated zone has a significantly impacts on the form of return flow for a large κ d the return flow decreases as a power law of time which is same as the solution of the unconfined aquifer dotted curves in fig 12 however as κ d decreases the return flow gradually deviates from the power law form and approaches the exponential form this observation implies that when the unsaturated zone has a large storage capacity large κ d the infiltrated river water will stay in the aquifer for a long time and the discharge process will be sustained for a long period of time as well conversely when the unsaturated zone has a large retention capacity small κ d the river water in the riparian aquifer will quickly discharge back into the river after the flood event and the aquifer will behave as a confined aquifer dashed curves in fig 12 5 3 application in this section we apply the analytical solution 13a on the field data which were tested by the previous solution liang et al 2018a we compare the solution 13a with the solution of liang et al 2018a that neglects the unsaturated flow and the vertically flow component in the aquifer in this field case the hourly groundwater levels in two observation wells in the riparian zone of walnut creek at iowa usa were observed walnut creek responds rapidly to flood events due to its flashy discharge which ranges from 0 002 m 3 s to 13 9 m 3 s at the downstream gaging station schilling 2000 the alluvial stratigraphy of floodplain is dominated by silt and clay 60 80 with minor amounts of thin sands and gravelly channel deposits schilling et al 2013 the two wells pasture 2 1 and woods 2 1 are installed in the unconfined aquifer of the floodplain the distance from pasture 2 1 and woods 2 1 to the river channel is 1 m and 6 m respectively woods 2 1 is downstream of pasture 2 1 and is 970 m away from pasture 2 1 the details of the field are presented in the previous studies schilling et al 2004 2006 schilling and zhang 2012 liang et al 2018 based on the previous investigations on hydrogeological conditions the aquifer parameters can be summarized as follows the aquifer is assumed to be isotropic with the hydraulic conductivity 1 0 m d the average unsaturated and saturated zone thickness are 3 m and 10 m respectively the distance between the river channel and the groundwater divide is 175 m the specific yield is 0 1 and the specific storage is 1 10 5 m 1 the constitutive exponent of the unsaturated zone and the parameters of the flood wave are identified by fitting the present solution with the observation data first we fit the observed water levels in the upstream well pasture 2 1 red circles in fig 13 using the solution 13a the κ v d r α and the time of the peak stage t m are estimated by the levenberg marquardt method then the water levels in the woods 2 1 well are predicted using the solution 13a by the estimated parameters which is obtained by fitting the pasture 2 1 data fig 13 presents the comparison of the observed water levels in two wells with the calculated water levels using the solution 13a and the solution of liang et al 2018a the constitutive exponent of the unsaturated zone is set to be 0 1 m 1 the estimated parameters of flood waves are summarized in table 1 for the pasture 2 1 both the present and liang et al s solutions generally agree with the observation data except for the substantial underestimation of the hydraulic heads during the recession period it indicates that the two solutions can reproduce the rapid rise of groundwater levels by responding to the flood events but is unable to predict the slow recession processes for the woods 2 1 well however the two solutions partly match the observed water levels at early time but they perform poorly at the later time the main reason is that the water levels in the woods 2 1 are not fitted by adjusting the model parameters instead it is fitted with the calculated water levels using the estimated parameters which is obtained by fitting the pasture 2 1 data a few other factors such as the low permeability riverbed the presence of a seepage face in the aquifer river interface the partially penetrating river the lagging response of river stage to a flood event and the sinuous river channel may influence the analytical solution s performance in predicting the observation data the effects of these factors have been discussed in previous study liang et al 2018 in addition to these factors the previous study has shown that the aquifer at this site has layered heterogeneous structures schilling et al 2006 which may cause the analytical solution based on the assumption of a homogeneous aquifer to fail to reproduce water level fluctuations as well comparing to the liang et al s solution the present solution preforms slightly better predication on hydraulic heads for all three flood events which obtains a smaller root mean square error rmse than that of the solution of liang et al 2018a table 1 in addition the present solution has a capacity to estimate the constitutive exponent κ of unsaturated zone by fitting the observed groundwater levels it is notable that the present solution improves on the liang et al s solution to get a slightly better fit on the observation data we interpret this result to imply that both observation wells are very close to the river 1 m for the pasture 2 1well and 6 m for the woods 2 1well for this situation the influence of the unsaturated zone is relatively small which is clearly demonstrated in figs 4 and 6 finally it should be noted that despite the substantial difference the present solution agrees with the observation data in all their essential features meaning that the solution 13a can predict the response of the groundwater levels at the rising stage and the peak during flood events by specifically considering the effect of the unsaturated zone 6 summary and conclusions in this paper a coupled saturated unsaturated flow model is developed to explore the effect of unsaturated zone on the response of groundwater in an unconfined aquifer to a flood wave in the river channel the semi analytical solutions for the groundwater level and exchange flux are derived with the laplace fourier transform the solutions are tested with numerical simulations and an existing analytical solution and is applied to field data several significant results are summarized as follows 1 both the constitutive exponent κ d and unsaturated zone thickness have significant impacts on the response of hydraulic heads to a flood wave the larger κ d leads to a lower amplitude for the fluctuations of hydraulic head the present solution approaches to the solution for an unconfined aquifer when κ d is large and to the solution for a confined aquifer as κ d is small increasing the thickness results in smaller hydraulic heads and a slow head recession after a flood wave passes 2 the unsaturated zone has a significant impact on flood signal propagation in aquifers the unconfined solution without considering unsaturated zones may underestimate the hydraulic heads when the observation point is away from the river 3 the dimensionless constitutive exponent κ d has significant impacts on the discharge of an aquifer smaller κ d results in lower water exchanging between the aquifer and river induced by a flood wave the unconfined solution tends to overestimate the water exchange between the aquifer and river when the saturated zone has a small κ d 4 the solution derived in this study reproduces the responses of the water levels in the observation wells in the walnut creek watershed of iowa to flood events in comparison to the previous solution which did not consider unsaturated zones the present solution performs relatively better hydraulic head predication though the improvement is marginal and it also has a capacity to estimate the constitutive exponent κ of unsaturated zone credit authorship

2017,despite a proven record of accurate floodplain mapping complex hydrodynamic models lack efficiency due to their data intensive approach and high computation time as fast computing low complexity alternatives topography based hydrogeomorphic approaches are being increasingly used in recent times yet there is little evidence to suggest whether and to what extent such topography based approaches simply relying on digital elevation models dems can effectively delineate floodplains flood hazard zones in data scarce highly complex mountainous terrains we fill this knowledge gap by conducting a floodplain mapping comparative assessment with three topography based approaches along a 56 km river reach in the north west himalayas beas river india specifically we generated floodplain extent using height above the nearest drainage hand topographic wetness index twi and slope position sp and estimated their relative differences compared to a reference inundation extent simulated by mike11 hydrodynamic model the unique feature of our study was an extensive field survey to collect longitudinal and cross sectional elevation data across 223 locations which allowed us to verify vertical accuracy across multiple alternative dems and subsequently improve the selected dem via bathymetry integration statistical measures estimating the degree of consistency across three topography based approaches suggested that hand and twi produce more reasonable floodplain maps than sp hand based floodplain demonstrated greater agreement with the model simulated reference map twi showed moderate predictability with a tendency of underestimating floodplains sp was largely inconsistent demarcating floodplains in areas where the hydrodynamic model found uplands and vice versa our study can offer critical insights to support floodplain hydrological biological and habitat studies across the world s developing countries where locally relevant delineation of floodplains remains challenging due to data scarcity keywords dem floodplain hydrodynamic modeling height above the nearest drainage slope position topographic wetness index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased frequency of river flooding in the last decade prompted a surge of floodplain mapping endeavors bates et al 2018 maidment et al 2016 some of these endeavors led to the development of floodplain maps at an unprecedented spatial coverage e g global floodplain maps by nardi et al 2019 and resolution e g 30 m united states floodplain maps by wing et al 2017 despite revolutionizing large scale research and planning for flood risk mitigation efficacy of these floodplain maps in the world s data scarce regions remains a long standing concern dottori et al 2016 shastry and durand 2019 problem sourcing suggest that most of the current global floodplain maps are based on 1d 2d hydrodynamic model simulations assuming a synthetic flood with a pre defined return period dottori et al 2016 sampson et al 2015 wing et al 2017 inarguably data scarce regions lack input datasets that are fundamental to such a model configuration including long term peak annual discharge to set up upstream boundary conditions roughness coefficients to mediate downstream flood propagation and channel geometry to represent floodplain storage capacity grimaldi et al 2021 malgwi et al 2020 merwade et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 2020 schumann 2019 besides these common data scarcity issues some of the world s most flood prone basins also have trans boundary geopolitical data sharing constraints barua et al 2019 which further complicates the development and evaluation of a reliable large scale floodplain mapping endeavor these challenges have stimulated an emerging trend of identifying floodplains directly from the globally available digital elevation model dem topography datasets e g di baldassarre et al 2020 manfreda et al 2014 nardi et al 2019 samela et al 2016 topography based floodplain mapping approaches enforce the principle that floodplains are the accumulated memories of the past flood events nardi et al 2006 the memories of the floodplain footprint remain embedded within dems annis et al 2019 and as such floodplains can be distinguished from uplands using appropriate terrain analysis of the dem without requiring complex hydrodynamic simulations on one hand this principle led to hydrogeomorphic terrain analyses that map floodplains by capturing morphological information associated with riverine water driven erosion and deposition processes e g nardi et al 2013 2018 while on the other hand it led to simple geomorphic terrain analyses that extract topographic indices variables e g amatulli et al 2018 2020 indicating riverine water dominated zones hereafter the so called low complexity floodplain mapping paradigm afshari et al 2018 diehl et al 2021 because of their effectiveness in fast floodplain mapping over large data scarce areas the benefits of these topography based floodplain mapping approaches can go beyond typical flood management potentially enhancing interdisciplinary research on river floodplain connectivity hauer et al 2016 aquatic habitat driscoll and hauer 2019 biogeochemical cycling tolar et al 2020 and anthropogenic alterations rajib et al 2021 for example topography based floodplain geomorphology and hydrologic connectivity metrics have been used to conduct suitability analysis of alligator gar habitat van der most and hudson 2018 understand the biological and physical processes and from thereon assess ecological diversity within river systems blettler et al 2016 richards et al 2002 knox et al 2022 used topography based floodplain extent datasets to understand the impact of artificial levees i e anthropogenic alterations on natural floodplain functions nonetheless development and evaluation of topographic indices in general can enhance geoscience in multiple directions including research on the spatial variation of soil properties vegetation patterns and forest site quality moore et al 1991 1993 whelan and gandolfi 2002 florinsky et al 2004 zinko et al 2005 household disease outbreak risks cohen et al 2010 and landscape classification drǎguţ and blaschke 2006 de reu et al 2013 among others our review of literature reveals a recent uprise in the number of flood research and operational projects using the low complexity topographic indices especially height above the nearest drainage hand topographic wetness index and slope position sp afshari et al 2018 amellah et al 2022 annis et al 2019 diehl et al 2021 huang 2022 johnson et al 2019 rathjens et al 2016 speckhann et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a do these increasingly used topographic indices produce an identical floodplain extent for a given dem how well do these approaches replicate floodplain maps simulated by a hydrodynamic model below we disentangle how previous research has answered these questions thus justifying the need and new contribution of our study research performing the inter comparison of different topography based floodplain mapping approaches are still in infancy the study by rathjens et al 2016 is perhaps the only one to date comparing twi and sp floodplain maps however in data rich us watersheds on the contrary comparison of a topography based approach with traditional hydrodynamic model simulations and off the shelf model simulated reference maps is more frequent in the literature although sp is yet to be compared against a hydrodynamic model twi and hand have received greater community attention in this regard for example aksoy et al 2016 applied twi and hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras 1d model in mediterranean watersheds based on some qualitative interpretation the authors concluded that both approaches can generate similar floodplain maps also see amellah et al 2022 afshari et al 2018 performed a rigorous quantitative comparison between hand and hec ras 2d model considering different combinations of terrain profile land use and stream orders in us watersheds which confirmed that hand floodplain maps can considerably replicate hydrodynamic model simulations overall there are studies comparing topography based floodplain mapping approaches with global scale hydrodynamic models however their assessments are mostly limited to large basins e g lindersson et al 2021 showed such a global comparison at large basin scales with mean basin area of 33 000 km2 previous studies performing watershed or river reach scale inter comparison of topography based floodplain mapping approaches and their cross verifications with hydrodynamic models were in regions with mild topographic variations and rich data availability e g afshari et al 2018 clubb et al 2017 rathjens et al 2016 similar studies in the world s data scarce regions e g aksoy et al 2016 amellah et al 2022 remain very limited more specifically there has not been any study that explored the efficacy of hand twi and sp based floodplain mapping in data scarce complex mountainous terrains and that too at fine spatial scales e g river reach scales our study aims to fill these knowledge gaps by conducting an extensive field survey and a floodplain mapping comparative assessment in the himalayas the specific objective of our study is to identify whether hand twi and sp are suitable for producing reasonably accurate floodplain extent maps in poorly gauged himalayan watersheds considering a northern himalayan watershed as the testbed we compared the floodplain maps derived from hand twi and sp and therefore quantified their respective differences relative to the maps simulated by mike 11 hydrodynamic model with this methodological design and associated findings our study can offer critical insights to scientists and practitioners who frequently deal with inadequate estimates of flood risk and resilience across the world s developing countries 2 topography based approaches for floodplain mapping hand twi and sp table 1 shows the basic mathematical formulation for the three topography based floodplain mapping approaches used in this study what follows is the detailed description for each of these approaches 2 1 height above the nearest drainage hand the hand represents the newer generation of topography based approach for floodplain mapping originally developed by rennó et al 2008 and later enhanced by zheng et al 2016 hand of a dem grid cell is defined as the elevation difference between a specific cell and its nearest drainage cell within the same watershed table 1 all cells in a watershed having a value smaller than specific hand value are treated as inundated therefore hand offers a parsimonious approach of directly relating the river stage data with the corresponding floodplain extent classification of hand based on certain thresholds of stage height can also help to delineate floodplains with different probabilities of flood occurrences this has led to the frequent use of hand approach in recent floodplain mapping studies see e g afshari et al 2018 zheng et al 2016 2018a maidment et al 2016 nobre et al 2016 2 2 topographic wetness index twi twi represents the hydrologic behaviour of watersheds in terms of area and local slope a older generation topography based feature indicator beven and kirkby 1979 mathematically twi is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of specific watershed area as and local slope s tangent tan b table 1 as is the upslope contributing area flow accumulation per unit contour length orthogonal to flow direction while b accounts for the required gravitational flow for floodwave propagation quinn et al 1995 therefore the greater the twi value of a dem grid cell the greater is the likelihood for that cell to accumulate water inundation while the accuracy of b can vary depending on the spatial resolution of underlying dem irfan ashraf et al 2012 warren et al 2004 the accuracy of as is sensitive to the method used in delineating flow direction e g deterministic 8 node d8 deterministic infinite d and multiple flow direction mfd o callaghan and mark 1984 erskine et al 2006 freeman 1991 sørensen et al 2006 tarboton 1997 rampi et al 2014 showed superior accuracy of mfd over d8 and d methods 2 3 slope position sp the sp approach distinguishes floodplain from upland based on the relative position of every dem grid cell with respect to the nearest stream and ridge conceptually this approach is a modified form of topographic position index tpi where tpi of a cell is a measure of elevation difference between the cell s elevation and an average elevation of all surrounding cells in a predetermined neighbourhood convolution mask see table 1 de reu et al 2013 rathjens et al 2016 tpi values are normalised from 1 to 1 a positive tpi value indicate that the corresponding cell is located higher than its average surroundings de reu et al 2013 weiss 2001 a zero tpi is feasible when the cell is in a flat terrain or at a uniformly sloping landscape to distinguish these variable scenarios one needs to run convolution masks over the entire dem dataset through an iterative process see e g moving window of neighbourhood analysis grohmann and riccomini 2009 therefore the physical consistency of tpi is largely affected by the spatial scale of the convolution mask used the sp approach on the contrary eliminates this scale dependency by calculating the nearest stream and ridge for every dem cell usda forest service 2020 rathjens et al 2016 table 1 sp value ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 being the ridge and 0 being the valley bottom 3 study area the north west himalayas we conducted this study in the north west himalayas

the himalayan ecosystem nmshe as one of the eight national priorities allen et al 2018 subsequently the indian institute of remote sensing at the indian space research organisation developed a comprehensive framework of integrated process based modeling and geospatial techniques for flood prone area identification and flood risk assessment in the nwh region e g dhote et al 2018 our floodplain mapping experiment was a part of this framework in our experiment we used the 3250 km2 beas river basin in himachal pradesh as a test bed fig 1a b we specifically focused on the 55 6 km beas river from manali near vashisht to bhuntar hereafter the main river reach along with its confluence with the parvati river just upstream of the basin outlet at bhuntar fig 1b the basin lacks hydrologic data required for flood prediction and inundation mapping there are only three gauge stations that provide long term river discharge and or stage height data indicating a vast data scarce landscape fig 1b the topography of the beas river basin varies from 1005 m to 6549 m above sea level while the dominant land covers are forest and agriculture there are several urban areas within the floodplain developed over the years for tourism and business purposes fig 1c d the basin receives 70 of its average annual precipitation during monsoon jun oct imd 2016 however contrary to the decreasing annual trend increasing monsoon precipitation concentration has been evident in the last several decades yin et al 2016 which confirms the increased likelihood of extreme flood events despite such widely perceived flood risks previous studies focusing on the beas river basin or the himalayan region in general were limited to hydroclimatic trend analyses long term glacio hydrological change assessments and policy frameworks for climate change adaptation strategies see e g adeloye and dau 2019 allen et al 2018 li et al 2019 soundharajan et al 2016 yin et al 2016 in the present work we conducted an extensive field survey developed a robust hydrodynamic model and thereby performed a comparative assessment to understand the efficacy of topography based floodplain mapping as a fast and efficient approach of flood risk assessments in the data scarce himalayan region 4 methodology the methodology of our study is outlined in fig 2 briefly we conducted four tasks i collect input data from open geodata sources and field surveys ii create reference flood inundation extents using a process based hydrodynamic model iii apply three topography based floodplain mapping approaches and iv evaluate whether and to what extent the topography based floodplain maps are comparable to the maps generated through process based modeling 4 1 input data 4 1 1 digital elevation models dems a dem is the only geospatial input required for floodplain mapping using topography based approaches to select the most optimal dem for this study we obtained dems with varying horizontal spatial resolutions from four publicly accessible sources table 2 i 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm ii 30 m advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster iii radiometrically terrain corrected rtc product of 12 5 m advanced land observing satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar and iv 30 m cartosat in addition we also procured a 10 m resolution commercial version of the cartosat dem while the srtm aster and alos palsar dems have global coverage the availability of cartosat dems is limited only to india 4 1 2 ground control point survey for assessing dem accuracy we conducted a field survey to set 17 ground control points gcps and thereby assess the relative vertical accuracies across of all five dems we conducted this survey during a low flow condition in april 2017 using trimble r7 global navigation satellite system differential global positioning system dgps the 17 gcps were spatially distributed along the 55 6 km main river reach figs 3 and 4 the 12 5 m alos palsar dem had the best vertical accuracy in terms of the least root mean square error rmse across gcps see table 2 we found that the vertical accuracies of srtm and aster dems rmse 30 m table 2 were relatively poor compared to what had been reported in the recent global dem intercomparison studies e g hawker et al 2019 uuemaa et al 2020 this may be due to the highly complex mountainous terrains of our study area the himalayas which was not a part of any global dem intercomparison studies mentioned above although the 10 m cartosat dem seemed to be the best available dem for our study area in terms of horizontal resolution its rmse was 5 higher than that in the 12 5 m also palsar dem thus confirming why horizontal resolution alone cannot indicate dem quality in mountainous watersheds therefore considering both spatial resolution and vertical accuracy we selected the alos palsar dem as the optimal dem for floodplain mapping in our study area 4 1 3 floodplain bathymetry survey we surveyed 11 cross sections along the 55 6 km main river reach using leica tps1200 total station figs 3 and 4 the starting point of each cross section was established as a dgps station which allowed us to convert total station points into gcps thus by integrating data from two instruments we collected 223 gcps providing adequate elevation data to construct floodplain bathymetry as precisely as possible further discussed in section 4 2 note to ensure consistency with our modeling experiment we objectively set gcps within the potential 100 year floodplain extent the 100 year extent was identified through a series of satellite imagery and communications with local stakeholders about high water marks the cross section at chainage 5800 m and the longitudinal profile of the main river channel is shown in fig 4b and c respectively 4 1 4 river stage discharge data we collected both discharge and stage height data from the bhakra beas management board for the three gauge stations i e manali beas river bhuntar beas river and near bhuntar before confluence parvati river shown in fig 1b specifically we collected 39 years of daily observations from 1980 to 2018 4 1 5 land use data we obtained a 1 250000 resolution land use data from the indian space research organisation international geosphere biosphere programme isro igbp nrsc 2008 this land use dataset is divided into 10 generic classes fig 1c such that it can reasonably capture surface roughness variabilities a common parameter required for process based hydrodynamic flood modeling 4 2 creating a reference floodplain map with hydrodynamic model simulations we used a widely used process based hydrodynamic model mike11 dhi 2014a dhote et al 2019 to simulate floodplain extents the model applies 1 d saint venant equation in each of the dem grid cells approximate surface roughness from land use and correspondingly simulate floodplain flow dynamics and inundation because topography based floodplain mapping was our main goal the use of hydrodynamic model in this study was limited only to simulate a reference floodplain map the simulated reference map was used here as a baseline to show the relative differences across three topography based floodplain mapping approaches therefore detail discussion on the model processes parameter sensitivities and output uncertainties is not within the scope of this study in the following we outline the key steps involved in our hydrodynamic model setup 1 we generated a river network using arcgis by performing flow direction flow accumulation analysis on the dem next we extracted river cross sections from the dem using mike hydro which is a geoprocessing tool associated with the mike suite of models dhi 2014b we varied the lengths of these cross sections so that they were long enough to map the channel as well as the floodplain on both sides of the channel specifically we extracted cross sections at every 350 m spacing along the entire main river reach from manali to bhuntar fig 4a in the following step we first corrected 11 of these cross sections by directly assimilating the elevation values obtained from a prior bathymetry survey section 4 1 3 and subsequently interpolating the modified bathymetry across all intermediate cross sections this resulted into a hybrid dem that is reasonably representative of the floodplain geometry see e g afshari et al 2018 dhote et al 2021 2 we set discharge data as the upstream boundary conditions at every headwater node of the river network however the observational datasets available in our study area note only three gauge stations fig 1b were inadequate to set such boundary conditions considering the importance of locally relevant upstream boundary conditions on the accuracy of model simulated flood maps rajib et al 2020 we therefore used a relative contribution approach to produce reasonable discharge estimates for ungauged rainfed tributaries headwater nodes between manali and bhuntar specifically this approach estimated the discharge contributed by a headwater node by multiplying the discharge data at the watershed outlet with a corresponding drainage area ratio sub watershed area of the headwater node total watershed area e g afshari et al 2018 emerson et al 2005 gianfagna et al 2015 3 to estimate a flood discharge with a specific probability of occurrence in our case a 100 year return period flood event we performed flood frequency analyses using the available gauge station datasets since the estimated flood discharge varies with the mathematical equation used in probability distribution kidson and richards 2005 lawrence 2020 parkes and demeritt 2016 we applied three distribution functions including the gumbel s extreme value distribution log pearson type iii distribution and log normal distribution kamal et al 2017 our flood frequency analyses showed a standard deviation of 110 275 m3 s in the estimated 100 year flood discharges across three gauge stations which were respectively 492 m3 s 1034 m3 s and 3025 m3 s at upstream manali tributary before confluence with the main river reach and the outlet see fig 1 following the same relative contribution approach as described above also see parsimonious regionalization of flood frequencies by merz and blöschl 2005 we assigned a 100 year flood discharge value to each of the ungauged headwater stream nodes by linearly rescaling the 100 year flood discharge at the basin outlet with the node s corresponding drainage area ratio 4 we created a lookup table of surface roughness coefficient manning s n based on the literature specifically focusing on mixed land use watersheds with complex terrains and high gradient river reaches jarrett 1985 yochum et al 2014 we then used the lookup table in arcgis to assign class specific n values to our land use land cover data 5 we set up mike11 only for the 55 6 km main river reach constrained with discharge data as upstream boundary conditions and a stage discharge rating curve at the basin outlet as downstream boundary condition revisit fig 1b we ran the model in three phases calibration validation and 100 year flood simulation in the calibration phase we set boundary conditions with daily observations for the 2005 monsoon season june september ran multiple sets of simulations by spatially varying the main river manning s n in successive iterations e g rajib et al 2020 and calculated the goodness of fit between simulated and observed stage heights at the basin outlet for each combination of n values we used root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the goodness of fit criteria we selected the most optimal combination of n values hence the calibrated model producing the lowest rmse and highest nse between simulated and observed stage heights at the basin outlet we performed an independent validation by setting up the boundary conditions for a period not included in the calibration phase june to september 2010 and subsequently measured the accuracy of stage height simulations using rmse and nse finally we ran the model in steady state mode with the 100 year boundary conditions see above to simulate a corresponding 100 year flood inundation extent 4 3 creating floodplain maps with hand twi and sp at the core of topography based floodplain mapping there remains the fundamental assumption of a virtual breakline that dissects a watershed into domains of hydrogeomorphic features such as low lying river corridors and the surrounding upland di baldassarre et al 2020 nardi et al 2019 to date no consensus exists on how to select such a breakline also known as thresholding depending on the intended purpose of the resultant floodplain map the thresholding approach varies for example maidment et al 2016 and zheng et al 2018a b equipped hand approach for near real time flood inundation mapping by extracting a threshold flood stage from the corresponding model simulated stage discharge rating curve set at every stream node on the contrary afshari et al 2018 used the stage discharge rating curve to generate 10 year 100 year and 500 year flood stages at selected gauge stations and used those values as hand thresholds for generating the corresponding flood inundation extents what is common in these examples is the presence of abundant gauge data and or model simulations that allow thresholding of topography based floodplain mapping approaches in a spatially explicit manner these examples of thresholding are not applicable to data scarce complex terrain watersheds following previous studies we could leverage the hydrodynamic model to generate simulated flood stage thresholds yet such model driven thresholding would contradict the main goal of this study i e to explore the opportunities and challenges of low complexity floodplain mapping using globally available dems as the only input we addressed this limitation by proposing a gcp based thresholding approach which requires field visit freely available satellite imagery and local knowledge of previous extreme events there is no need of permanent gauging stations floodplain bathymetry roughness coefficients etc as in case of hydrodynamic modeling correspondingly we used the bathymetry integrated hybrid dem to generate reference floodplain only see section 4 2 and not for topography based approaches we therefore extracted the hand twi and sp value from the dem for each of the 223 gcps see sections 4 1 2 4 1 3 fig 4a and subsequently took the average value e g average of 223 hand values as the corresponding flood threshold because we purposefully chose gcps within a potential 100 year floodplain based on local expert knowledge and qualitative understanding from satellite imagery our gcp average thresholding allowed us to assume reasonable physical consistency between a topography based map and a real life 100 year inundation extent nonetheless this methodology of thresholding hand twi and sp does not confirm a specific probability of flood occurrence also see e g di baldassarre et al 2020 nardi et al 2019 annis et al 2019 4 4 comparison of floodplain maps we quantified the relative differences across hand twi and sp based floodplain maps using a spatial error matrix this matrix is essentially an array that expresses the number of grid cells assigned to a particular category in a topography based map e g floodplain or upland in fig 5 relative to the category suggested by a reference map in our case generated from model simulations the outcomes from this matrix are five statistical indices overall agreement oa user s agreement ua producer s agreement pa critical success index csi and kappa coefficient k all explaining the level of consistency between two spatial datasets in terms of true positives tp true negatives tn false positives fp and false negatives fn fig 5 also see lunetta et al 1991 oa alone does not explain how well our topography based approaches can identify the floodplain this is mainly because oa is calculated as the percentage of grid cells regardless of floodplain or upland that are consistent between two maps ua as shown in fig 5 measures the number of grid cells consistently identified as floodplain across the two maps compared to the sum of floodplain cells only in the topography based map pa is a relatively conservative index measuring the number of grid cells consistently identified as floodplain across the two maps compared to the sum of floodplain cells only in the reference map csi is an advancement over the oa as it gets rid of the tn and considers cells classified correctly as floodplain only tp and false alarms fp fn k provides a difference measurement between the observed consistency of the two maps and consistency that is contributed by chance lunetta et al 1991 therefore a k value of 0 8 may be interpreted as 80 better identification of floodplains through a topography based approach than what would be expected by a random assignment of grid cells as floodplain or upland 5 results and discussion 5 1 evaluation of reference floodplain map the calibration and validation results at daily time scale respectively for the 2005 and 2010 monsoon season june september suggested a high performance hydrodynamic model using a hybrid dem that is representative of the floodplain bathymetry revisit sections 4 1 3 and 4 2 allowed us to iterate only the main river s manning s n yet achieve high accuracy in model simulations fig 6 a shows the variation of model performance i e rmse between observed and simulated stage height at the basin outlet with different n values the simulated daily stage height at the basin outlet corresponding the optimized n value i e 0 035 produced minimal rmse 0 09 and high nse 0 95 regardless of the calibration and validation periods fig 6b d this high accuracy in stage height simulation implied high accuracy in the corresponding simulations of floodplain extents 5 2 evaluation of topography based floodplain maps the relative differences measured using various statistical indices suggested that hand twi and sp approaches perform differently we found ample evidence to confirm that in our study area floodplain maps generated from hand and twi are more reliable than those from sp fig 7 below summarizes the distribution of error in km2 units tp tn fp and fn and the corresponding statistical indices ua pa csi and k for each of the three topography based approaches the overall high values of ua pa csi and k indicate a relatively better efficacy of hand approach compared to twi and sp in the case of twi based floodplain map the statistical indices implied moderate performance with an underestimation tendency relative to the reference map however we noted large inconsistencies in sp based floodplain map with a very low ua 0 35 and a very high pa value 0 73 this low ua in sp approach especially indicated a high error of commission meaning in simple words the sp based floodplain demarcated floodplains in areas where a hydrodynamic model found uplands and vice versa the better performance of hand and twi over sp in floodplain mapping is further supported by figs 8 10 at three evaluation sites with increasing upstream drainage areas along the main river reach the relatively greater reliability of the hand approach in floodplain delineation can be attributed to its potential of representing relative gravitational potential of the area it is based on the hypothesis that area near the stream must be permanently saturated governed by local topography irrespective of its height from the dem s datum sea level nobre et al 2011 in general floodplain extent depends on the river stage of the extreme flood event and hand raster efficiently relates the river stage with the dem as hand converts dem into a normalized altitude raster it provides hydrologically relevant information e g inundation extent saturation zones for landscape classification here floodplain however hand overestimated the floodplain extent relative to the reference map especially in the downstream areas see fig 9a and fig 10a this is due to the spatially explicit role of river network in hand calculation a densified river network in the watershed may produce relatively narrower range of hand values disregarding the lower order reaches would therefore widen the range of hand values maidment et al 2016 zheng et al 2018a subsequently for a given threshold a wider range of hand values would result into a wider floodplain extent in twi approach the consistently underestimated floodplain extent throughout the main river reach is largely attributed to twi s dependency on local slope calculation of local slope is sensitive to dem s horizontal resolution and vertical accuracy especially in high relief areas pourali et al 2016 as such local slope may not adequately represent concave or convex topographic reliefs which are frequent in mountainous watersheds hjerdt et al 2004 misrepresentation of specific upslope area for dem cells in the valley floor böhner and selige 2006 is another factor contributing to twi s underestimation problem in our study area using an exponent with the specific area parameter could improve twi s floodplain delineation see manfreda et al 2011 yet such an approach would require some level of parameter calibration based on local conditions manfreda and sole 2013 notwithstanding these limitations twi maps appear to be dendritic capturing smaller streams without any discontinuity twi was also able to follow the twisting of rivers and detect the confluence point in sp approach dependency on nearest stream and ridge elevation values table 1 makes it highly susceptible to dem s horizontal resolution thus producing patches of small valleys on a large hilltop or patches of small hills or ridges in a large valley this explains the disconnect sporadic and unrealistic longitudinal orientation of the sp based floodplain especially in upstream areas fig 8c fig 9c and fig 10c although these analyses suggest a relatively poor performance of the sp approach some of its limitations in floodplain mapping may be resolved using very high resolution dems note in all these assessments we considered the model simulated 100 year floodplain as a reference baseline although the counterpart topography based maps were not associated with a specific probability of flooding therefore our results do not infer the relative accuracy between a topography based floodplain map and a model simulated floodplain map our results rather identify the extent to which hand twi and sp based floodplain maps were different from each other by separately comparing them against a fixed baseline i e consistency check clearly this makes our findings independent of a specific flood magnitude and probability our results confirm that topography based approaches mediated by a kind of supervised classification thresholding can map floodplains in data scarce complex terrain basins because thresholding is a key step for these approaches to find the floodplain upland breakline it is important to recognize what alternatives do researchers and practitioners have for selecting a reasonable threshold while some studies have previously used gauged and or simulated stage height data as thresholds e g afshari et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a we argued why that would disavow the practical applicability of using topography based approaches in data scarce regions see our discussion in section 4 3 we therefore leveraged ground control points gcps open source satellite imagery and stakeholder communications to construct a reasonable threshold for our study area where setting up gcps deem challenging note it requires field surveying historical non structural high water marks e g debris lines erosion lines tree trunks along with high resolution satellite based observations of recurring surface water inundation extents could be used to approximate potential flood hazard zones see e g asfpm 2014 koenig et al 2016 malgwi et al 2021 shastry and durand 2019 and subsequently guide the thresholding process through some parsimonious spatial interpolation extrapolation across watershed scales structural high water marks e g bridge piers building damages levee tops could also be used to identify range of possible flood elevations hence the thresholds nevertheless topography based floodplain mapping is by default sensitive to dem s horizontal resolution and or vertical accuracy although we performed a systematic experiment on dem quality based on multiple freely available and commercial dem datasets and therefore picked one that seemed to have the best quality for our study area see table 2 running such experiments is time labour and cost intensive gradual globalization of cost effective high quality dems from airborne insar as opposed to the standard lidar technology may eventually address this gap simpson et al 2015 6 summary the present study explores the efficacy of three different topography based approaches for floodplain mapping on regional scale in a data scarce complex terrain taking a 55 6 km reach of beas river in the north west himalayan region as a testbed we showed whether and to what extent height above the nearest drainage hand topographic wetness index twi and slope position sp can delineate floodplains as compared to a process based hydrodynamic model mike 11 hand based floodplain demonstrated greater agreement with the model simulated reference map twi showed moderate predictability with a tendency of underestimating floodplains sp was largely inconsistent with hand and twi finding floodplains in areas where the hydrodynamic model found uplands and vice versa hand s relatively superior performance can be attributed to its implicit ability to understand flood relevant hydrologic information such as saturation zone the explicit role of river network is however a deterring factor that makes hand calculations highly subjective while the dependency on local slope imposes some inaccuracy in the twi approach twi based floodplain map showed some unique potentials by capturing floodplains along smaller streams twisting rivers and near the confluence without discontinuity dependency on nearest stream and ridge elevation values makes sp highly susceptible to dem s horizontal resolution a limitation that may be minimized by using very high resolution dems because topography based approaches are sensitive to the input dem a dem with coarse horizontal resolution and poor vertical accuracy can very well be misinterpreting the consistency across hand twi and sp based floodplains we minimized the likelihood of such misinterpretations by selecting the best available dem and subsequently reconstructing the dem via an extensive bathymetry survey our dem selection was based on a field experiment that allowed us to compare the vertical accuracy of four alternative dems we improved the accuracy of our simulated reference map and hence the accuracy of our assessments by collecting longitudinal and cross sectional elevation data across 223 locations and subsequently developing a bathymetry integrated hybrid dem to feed the hydrodynamic model we further increased the accuracy of our simulated reference map by using a rigorous procedure for setting up the upstream boundary conditions and subsequent calibrations at the watershed outlet while our findings confirm the efficacy of topography based floodplain mapping approaches in data scarce complex terrain regions questions remain on their mode of execution we think that the definition of a threshold to find the floodplain upland breakline imparts the most significant limitation on these approaches from the execution standpoint related to this thresholding problem the spatial scale of execution large versus small watersheds is another critical yet overlooked factor that can affect the predictability of topography based floodplain maps specifically those derived through hand and twi researchers and floodplain managers should be aware of these limitations in situations where they have to rely solely on topography based approaches for floodplain mapping when the collection of ground control points gcps as shown in our study is infeasible the use of freely available satellite imagery high water marks and local experiences could ease the burden of defining a reasonable threshold nonetheless with the increasing availability of globally available geospatial data resources the future of low complexity topography based approaches as fast floodplain mapping tools seems very bright being efficient alternatives to hydrodynamic floodplain extent simulations these topography based approaches can open up new opportunities for interdisciplinary floodplain ecosystem and

2017,despite a proven record of accurate floodplain mapping complex hydrodynamic models lack efficiency due to their data intensive approach and high computation time as fast computing low complexity alternatives topography based hydrogeomorphic approaches are being increasingly used in recent times yet there is little evidence to suggest whether and to what extent such topography based approaches simply relying on digital elevation models dems can effectively delineate floodplains flood hazard zones in data scarce highly complex mountainous terrains we fill this knowledge gap by conducting a floodplain mapping comparative assessment with three topography based approaches along a 56 km river reach in the north west himalayas beas river india specifically we generated floodplain extent using height above the nearest drainage hand topographic wetness index twi and slope position sp and estimated their relative differences compared to a reference inundation extent simulated by mike11 hydrodynamic model the unique feature of our study was an extensive field survey to collect longitudinal and cross sectional elevation data across 223 locations which allowed us to verify vertical accuracy across multiple alternative dems and subsequently improve the selected dem via bathymetry integration statistical measures estimating the degree of consistency across three topography based approaches suggested that hand and twi produce more reasonable floodplain maps than sp hand based floodplain demonstrated greater agreement with the model simulated reference map twi showed moderate predictability with a tendency of underestimating floodplains sp was largely inconsistent demarcating floodplains in areas where the hydrodynamic model found uplands and vice versa our study can offer critical insights to support floodplain hydrological biological and habitat studies across the world s developing countries where locally relevant delineation of floodplains remains challenging due to data scarcity keywords dem floodplain hydrodynamic modeling height above the nearest drainage slope position topographic wetness index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increased frequency of river flooding in the last decade prompted a surge of floodplain mapping endeavors bates et al 2018 maidment et al 2016 some of these endeavors led to the development of floodplain maps at an unprecedented spatial coverage e g global floodplain maps by nardi et al 2019 and resolution e g 30 m united states floodplain maps by wing et al 2017 despite revolutionizing large scale research and planning for flood risk mitigation efficacy of these floodplain maps in the world s data scarce regions remains a long standing concern dottori et al 2016 shastry and durand 2019 problem sourcing suggest that most of the current global floodplain maps are based on 1d 2d hydrodynamic model simulations assuming a synthetic flood with a pre defined return period dottori et al 2016 sampson et al 2015 wing et al 2017 inarguably data scarce regions lack input datasets that are fundamental to such a model configuration including long term peak annual discharge to set up upstream boundary conditions roughness coefficients to mediate downstream flood propagation and channel geometry to represent floodplain storage capacity grimaldi et al 2021 malgwi et al 2020 merwade et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 2020 schumann 2019 besides these common data scarcity issues some of the world s most flood prone basins also have trans boundary geopolitical data sharing constraints barua et al 2019 which further complicates the development and evaluation of a reliable large scale floodplain mapping endeavor these challenges have stimulated an emerging trend of identifying floodplains directly from the globally available digital elevation model dem topography datasets e g di baldassarre et al 2020 manfreda et al 2014 nardi et al 2019 samela et al 2016 topography based floodplain mapping approaches enforce the principle that floodplains are the accumulated memories of the past flood events nardi et al 2006 the memories of the floodplain footprint remain embedded within dems annis et al 2019 and as such floodplains can be distinguished from uplands using appropriate terrain analysis of the dem without requiring complex hydrodynamic simulations on one hand this principle led to hydrogeomorphic terrain analyses that map floodplains by capturing morphological information associated with riverine water driven erosion and deposition processes e g nardi et al 2013 2018 while on the other hand it led to simple geomorphic terrain analyses that extract topographic indices variables e g amatulli et al 2018 2020 indicating riverine water dominated zones hereafter the so called low complexity floodplain mapping paradigm afshari et al 2018 diehl et al 2021 because of their effectiveness in fast floodplain mapping over large data scarce areas the benefits of these topography based floodplain mapping approaches can go beyond typical flood management potentially enhancing interdisciplinary research on river floodplain connectivity hauer et al 2016 aquatic habitat driscoll and hauer 2019 biogeochemical cycling tolar et al 2020 and anthropogenic alterations rajib et al 2021 for example topography based floodplain geomorphology and hydrologic connectivity metrics have been used to conduct suitability analysis of alligator gar habitat van der most and hudson 2018 understand the biological and physical processes and from thereon assess ecological diversity within river systems blettler et al 2016 richards et al 2002 knox et al 2022 used topography based floodplain extent datasets to understand the impact of artificial levees i e anthropogenic alterations on natural floodplain functions nonetheless development and evaluation of topographic indices in general can enhance geoscience in multiple directions including research on the spatial variation of soil properties vegetation patterns and forest site quality moore et al 1991 1993 whelan and gandolfi 2002 florinsky et al 2004 zinko et al 2005 household disease outbreak risks cohen et al 2010 and landscape classification drǎguţ and blaschke 2006 de reu et al 2013 among others our review of literature reveals a recent uprise in the number of flood research and operational projects using the low complexity topographic indices especially height above the nearest drainage hand topographic wetness index and slope position sp afshari et al 2018 amellah et al 2022 annis et al 2019 diehl et al 2021 huang 2022 johnson et al 2019 rathjens et al 2016 speckhann et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a do these increasingly used topographic indices produce an identical floodplain extent for a given dem how well do these approaches replicate floodplain maps simulated by a hydrodynamic model below we disentangle how previous research has answered these questions thus justifying the need and new contribution of our study research performing the inter comparison of different topography based floodplain mapping approaches are still in infancy the study by rathjens et al 2016 is perhaps the only one to date comparing twi and sp floodplain maps however in data rich us watersheds on the contrary comparison of a topography based approach with traditional hydrodynamic model simulations and off the shelf model simulated reference maps is more frequent in the literature although sp is yet to be compared against a hydrodynamic model twi and hand have received greater community attention in this regard for example aksoy et al 2016 applied twi and hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras 1d model in mediterranean watersheds based on some qualitative interpretation the authors concluded that both approaches can generate similar floodplain maps also see amellah et al 2022 afshari et al 2018 performed a rigorous quantitative comparison between hand and hec ras 2d model considering different combinations of terrain profile land use and stream orders in us watersheds which confirmed that hand floodplain maps can considerably replicate hydrodynamic model simulations overall there are studies comparing topography based floodplain mapping approaches with global scale hydrodynamic models however their assessments are mostly limited to large basins e g lindersson et al 2021 showed such a global comparison at large basin scales with mean basin area of 33 000 km2 previous studies performing watershed or river reach scale inter comparison of topography based floodplain mapping approaches and their cross verifications with hydrodynamic models were in regions with mild topographic variations and rich data availability e g afshari et al 2018 clubb et al 2017 rathjens et al 2016 similar studies in the world s data scarce regions e g aksoy et al 2016 amellah et al 2022 remain very limited more specifically there has not been any study that explored the efficacy of hand twi and sp based floodplain mapping in data scarce complex mountainous terrains and that too at fine spatial scales e g river reach scales our study aims to fill these knowledge gaps by conducting an extensive field survey and a floodplain mapping comparative assessment in the himalayas the specific objective of our study is to identify whether hand twi and sp are suitable for producing reasonably accurate floodplain extent maps in poorly gauged himalayan watersheds considering a northern himalayan watershed as the testbed we compared the floodplain maps derived from hand twi and sp and therefore quantified their respective differences relative to the maps simulated by mike 11 hydrodynamic model with this methodological design and associated findings our study can offer critical insights to scientists and practitioners who frequently deal with inadequate estimates of flood risk and resilience across the world s developing countries 2 topography based approaches for floodplain mapping hand twi and sp table 1 shows the basic mathematical formulation for the three topography based floodplain mapping approaches used in this study what follows is the detailed description for each of these approaches 2 1 height above the nearest drainage hand the hand represents the newer generation of topography based approach for floodplain mapping originally developed by rennó et al 2008 and later enhanced by zheng et al 2016 hand of a dem grid cell is defined as the elevation difference between a specific cell and its nearest drainage cell within the same watershed table 1 all cells in a watershed having a value smaller than specific hand value are treated as inundated therefore hand offers a parsimonious approach of directly relating the river stage data with the corresponding floodplain extent classification of hand based on certain thresholds of stage height can also help to delineate floodplains with different probabilities of flood occurrences this has led to the frequent use of hand approach in recent floodplain mapping studies see e g afshari et al 2018 zheng et al 2016 2018a maidment et al 2016 nobre et al 2016 2 2 topographic wetness index twi twi represents the hydrologic behaviour of watersheds in terms of area and local slope a older generation topography based feature indicator beven and kirkby 1979 mathematically twi is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of specific watershed area as and local slope s tangent tan b table 1 as is the upslope contributing area flow accumulation per unit contour length orthogonal to flow direction while b accounts for the required gravitational flow for floodwave propagation quinn et al 1995 therefore the greater the twi value of a dem grid cell the greater is the likelihood for that cell to accumulate water inundation while the accuracy of b can vary depending on the spatial resolution of underlying dem irfan ashraf et al

distinguishes floodplain from upland based on the relative position of every dem grid cell with respect to the nearest stream and ridge conceptually this approach is a modified form of topographic position index tpi where tpi of a cell is a measure of elevation difference between the cell s elevation and an average elevation of all surrounding cells in a predetermined neighbourhood convolution mask see table 1 de reu et al 2013 rathjens et al 2016 tpi values are normalised from 1 to 1 a positive tpi value indicate that the corresponding cell is located higher than its average surroundings de reu et al 2013 weiss 2001 a zero tpi is feasible when the cell is in a flat terrain or at a uniformly sloping landscape to distinguish these variable scenarios one needs to run convolution masks over the entire dem dataset through an iterative process see e g moving window of neighbourhood analysis grohmann and riccomini 2009 therefore the physical consistency of tpi is largely affected by the spatial scale of the convolution mask used the sp approach on the contrary eliminates this scale dependency by calculating the nearest stream and ridge for every dem cell usda forest service 2020 rathjens et al 2016 table 1 sp value ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 being the ridge and 0 being the valley bottom 3 study area the north west himalayas we conducted this study in the north west himalayas of the indian himalayan region ihr fig 1 the north west himalayas nwh is home to multiple river systems e g beas jhelum satluj upper ganga providing ecosystem services to millions of people living in four indian states and union territories himachal pradesh uttarakhand jammu and kashmir and ladakh in recent decades the nwh river systems have become the hotspots of precipitation snowmelt flash floods and glacier lake outburst floods glofs most of which are often accompanied by landslides allen et al 2016a sati and gahalaut 2013 schmidt et al 2020 veh et al 2020 singh et al 2021 geoscientists found these extreme floods linked to exuberating landscape topographic variations besides the commonly known natural and anthropogenic stressors of climate and land use changes allen et al 2016b 2018 dimri et al 2017 dhote et al 2018 thakur et al 2019 considering these challenges the 2008 indian national action plan on climate change napcc included the national mission for sustaining the himalayan ecosystem nmshe as one of the eight national priorities allen et al 2018 subsequently the indian institute of remote sensing at the indian space research organisation developed a comprehensive framework of integrated process based modeling and geospatial techniques for flood prone area identification and flood risk assessment in the nwh region e g dhote et al 2018 our floodplain mapping experiment was a part of this framework in our experiment we used the 3250 km2 beas river basin in himachal pradesh as a test bed fig 1a b we specifically focused on the 55 6 km beas river from manali near vashisht to bhuntar hereafter the main river reach along with its confluence with the parvati river just upstream of the basin outlet at bhuntar fig 1b the basin lacks hydrologic data required for flood prediction and inundation mapping there are only three gauge stations that provide long term river discharge and or stage height data indicating a vast data scarce landscape fig 1b the topography of the beas river basin varies from 1005 m to 6549 m above sea level while the dominant land covers are forest and agriculture there are several urban areas within the floodplain developed over the years for tourism and business purposes fig 1c d the basin receives 70 of its average annual precipitation during monsoon jun oct imd 2016 however contrary to the decreasing annual trend increasing monsoon precipitation concentration has been evident in the last several decades yin et al 2016 which confirms the increased likelihood of extreme flood events despite such widely perceived flood risks previous studies focusing on the beas river basin or the himalayan region in general were limited to hydroclimatic trend analyses long term glacio hydrological change assessments and policy frameworks for climate change adaptation strategies see e g adeloye and dau 2019 allen et al 2018 li et al 2019 soundharajan et al 2016 yin et al 2016 in the present work we conducted an extensive field survey developed a robust hydrodynamic model and thereby performed a comparative assessment to understand the efficacy of topography based floodplain mapping as a fast and efficient approach of flood risk assessments in the data scarce himalayan region 4 methodology the methodology of our study is outlined in fig 2 briefly we conducted four tasks i collect input data from open geodata sources and field surveys ii create reference flood inundation extents using a process based hydrodynamic model iii apply three topography based floodplain mapping approaches and iv evaluate whether and to what extent the topography based floodplain maps are comparable to the maps generated through process based modeling 4 1 input data 4 1 1 digital elevation models dems a dem is the only geospatial input required for floodplain mapping using topography based approaches to select the most optimal dem for this study we obtained dems with varying horizontal spatial resolutions from four publicly accessible sources table 2 i 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm ii 30 m advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster iii radiometrically terrain corrected rtc product of 12 5 m advanced land observing satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar alos palsar and iv 30 m cartosat in addition we also procured a 10 m resolution commercial version of the cartosat dem while the srtm aster and alos palsar dems have global coverage the availability of cartosat dems is limited only to india 4 1 2 ground control point survey for assessing dem accuracy we conducted a field survey to set 17 ground control points gcps and thereby assess the relative vertical accuracies across of all five dems we conducted this survey during a low flow condition in april 2017 using trimble r7 global navigation satellite system differential global positioning system dgps the 17 gcps were spatially distributed along the 55 6 km main river reach figs 3 and 4 the 12 5 m alos palsar dem had the best vertical accuracy in terms of the least root mean square error rmse across gcps see table 2 we found that the vertical accuracies of srtm and aster dems rmse 30 m table 2 were relatively poor compared to what had been reported in the recent global dem intercomparison studies e g hawker et al 2019 uuemaa et al 2020 this may be due to the highly complex mountainous terrains of our study area the himalayas which was not a part of any global dem intercomparison studies mentioned above although the 10 m cartosat dem seemed to be the best available dem for our study area in terms of horizontal resolution its rmse was 5 higher than that in the 12 5 m also palsar dem thus confirming why horizontal resolution alone cannot indicate dem quality in mountainous watersheds therefore considering both spatial resolution and vertical accuracy we selected the alos palsar dem as the optimal dem for floodplain mapping in our study area 4 1 3 floodplain bathymetry survey we surveyed 11 cross sections along the 55 6 km main river reach using leica tps1200 total station figs 3 and 4 the starting point of each cross section was established as a dgps station which allowed us to convert total station points into gcps thus by integrating data from two instruments we collected 223 gcps providing adequate elevation data to construct floodplain bathymetry as precisely as possible further discussed in section 4 2 note to ensure consistency with our modeling experiment we objectively set gcps within the potential 100 year floodplain extent the 100 year extent was identified through a series of satellite imagery and communications with local stakeholders about high water marks the cross section at chainage 5800 m and the longitudinal profile of the main river channel is shown in fig 4b and c respectively 4 1 4 river stage discharge data we collected both discharge and stage height data from the bhakra beas management board for the three gauge stations i e manali beas river bhuntar beas river and near bhuntar before confluence parvati river shown in fig 1b specifically we collected 39 years of daily observations from 1980 to 2018 4 1 5 land use data we obtained a 1 250000 resolution land use data from the indian space research organisation international geosphere biosphere programme isro igbp nrsc 2008 this land use dataset is divided into 10 generic classes fig 1c such that it can reasonably capture surface roughness variabilities a common parameter required for process based hydrodynamic flood modeling 4 2 creating a reference floodplain map with hydrodynamic model simulations we used a widely used process based hydrodynamic model mike11 dhi 2014a dhote et al 2019 to simulate floodplain extents the model applies 1 d saint venant equation in each of the dem grid cells approximate surface roughness from land use and correspondingly simulate floodplain flow dynamics and inundation because topography based floodplain mapping was our main goal the use of hydrodynamic model in this study was limited only to simulate a reference floodplain map the simulated reference map was used here as a baseline to show the relative differences across three topography based floodplain mapping approaches therefore detail discussion on the model processes parameter sensitivities and output uncertainties is not within the scope of this study in the following we outline the key steps involved in our hydrodynamic model setup 1 we generated a river network using arcgis by performing flow direction flow accumulation analysis on the dem next we extracted river cross sections from the dem using mike hydro which is a geoprocessing tool associated with the mike suite of models dhi 2014b we varied the lengths of these cross sections so that they were long enough to map the channel as well as the floodplain on both sides of the channel specifically we extracted cross sections at every 350 m spacing along the entire main river reach from manali to bhuntar fig 4a in the following step we first corrected 11 of these cross sections by directly assimilating the elevation values obtained from a prior bathymetry survey section 4 1 3 and subsequently interpolating the modified bathymetry across all intermediate cross sections this resulted into a hybrid dem that is reasonably representative of the floodplain geometry see e g afshari et al 2018 dhote et al 2021 2 we set discharge data as the upstream boundary conditions at every headwater node of the river network however the observational datasets available in our study area note only three gauge stations fig 1b were inadequate to set such boundary conditions considering the importance of locally relevant upstream boundary conditions on the accuracy of model simulated flood maps rajib et al 2020 we therefore used a relative contribution approach to produce reasonable discharge estimates for ungauged rainfed tributaries headwater nodes between manali and bhuntar specifically this approach estimated the discharge contributed by a headwater node by multiplying the discharge data at the watershed outlet with a corresponding drainage area ratio sub watershed area of the headwater node total watershed area e g afshari et al 2018 emerson et al 2005 gianfagna et al 2015 3 to estimate a flood discharge with a specific probability of occurrence in our case a 100 year return period flood event we performed flood frequency analyses using the available gauge station datasets since the estimated flood discharge varies with the mathematical equation used in probability distribution kidson and richards 2005 lawrence 2020 parkes and demeritt 2016 we applied three distribution functions including the gumbel s extreme value distribution log pearson type iii distribution and log normal distribution kamal et al 2017 our flood frequency analyses showed a standard deviation of 110 275 m3 s in the estimated 100 year flood discharges across three gauge stations which were respectively 492 m3 s 1034 m3 s and 3025 m3 s at upstream manali tributary before confluence with the main river reach and the outlet see fig 1 following the same relative contribution approach as described above also see parsimonious regionalization of flood frequencies by merz and blöschl 2005 we assigned a 100 year flood discharge value to each of the ungauged headwater stream nodes by linearly rescaling the 100 year flood discharge at the basin outlet with the node s corresponding drainage area ratio 4 we created a lookup table of surface roughness coefficient manning s n based on the literature specifically focusing on mixed land use watersheds with complex terrains and high gradient river reaches jarrett 1985 yochum et al 2014 we then used the lookup table in arcgis to assign class specific n values to our land use land cover data 5 we set up mike11 only for the 55 6 km main river reach constrained with discharge data as upstream boundary conditions and a stage discharge rating curve at the basin outlet as downstream boundary condition revisit fig 1b we ran the model in three phases calibration validation and 100 year flood simulation in the calibration phase we set boundary conditions with daily observations for the 2005 monsoon season june september ran multiple sets of simulations by spatially varying the main river manning s n in successive iterations e g rajib et al 2020 and calculated the goodness of fit between simulated and observed stage heights at the basin outlet for each combination of n values we used root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse as the goodness of fit criteria we selected the most optimal combination of n values hence the calibrated model producing the lowest rmse and highest nse between simulated and observed stage heights at the basin outlet we performed an independent validation by setting up the boundary conditions for a period not included in the calibration phase june to september 2010 and subsequently measured the accuracy of stage height simulations using rmse and nse finally we ran the model in steady state mode with the 100 year boundary conditions see above to simulate a corresponding 100 year flood inundation extent 4 3 creating floodplain maps with hand twi and sp at the core of topography based floodplain mapping there remains the fundamental assumption of a virtual breakline that dissects a watershed into domains of hydrogeomorphic features such as low lying river corridors and the surrounding upland di baldassarre et al 2020 nardi et al 2019 to date no consensus exists on how to select such a breakline also known as thresholding depending on the intended purpose of the resultant floodplain map the thresholding approach varies for example maidment et al 2016 and zheng et al 2018a b equipped hand approach for near real time flood inundation mapping by extracting a threshold flood stage from the corresponding model simulated stage discharge rating curve set at every stream node on the contrary afshari et al 2018 used the stage discharge rating curve to generate 10 year 100 year and 500 year flood stages at selected gauge stations and used those values as hand thresholds for generating the corresponding flood inundation extents what is common in these examples is the presence of abundant gauge data and or model simulations that allow thresholding of topography based floodplain mapping approaches in a spatially explicit manner these examples of thresholding are not applicable to data scarce complex terrain watersheds following previous studies we could leverage the hydrodynamic model to generate simulated flood stage thresholds yet such model driven thresholding would contradict the main goal of this study i e to explore the opportunities and challenges of low complexity floodplain mapping using globally available dems as the only input we addressed this limitation by proposing a gcp based thresholding approach which requires field visit freely available satellite imagery and local knowledge of previous extreme events there is no need of permanent gauging stations floodplain bathymetry roughness coefficients etc as in case of hydrodynamic modeling correspondingly we used the bathymetry integrated hybrid dem to generate reference floodplain only see section 4 2 and not for topography based approaches we therefore extracted the hand twi and sp value from the dem for each of the 223 gcps see sections 4 1 2 4 1 3 fig 4a and subsequently took the average value e g average of 223 hand values as the corresponding flood threshold because we purposefully chose gcps within a potential 100 year floodplain based on local expert knowledge and qualitative understanding from satellite imagery our gcp average thresholding allowed us to assume reasonable physical consistency between a topography based map and a real life 100 year inundation extent nonetheless this methodology of thresholding hand twi and sp does not confirm a specific probability of flood occurrence also see e g di baldassarre et al 2020 nardi et al 2019 annis et al 2019 4 4 comparison of floodplain maps we quantified the relative differences across hand twi and sp based floodplain maps using a spatial error matrix this matrix is essentially an array that expresses the number of grid cells assigned to a particular category in a topography based map e g floodplain or upland in fig 5 relative to the category suggested by a reference map in our case generated from model simulations the outcomes from this matrix are five statistical indices overall agreement oa user s agreement ua producer s agreement pa critical success index csi and kappa coefficient k all explaining the level of consistency between two spatial datasets in terms of true positives tp true negatives tn false positives fp and false negatives fn fig 5 also see lunetta et al 1991 oa alone does not explain how well our topography based approaches can identify the floodplain this is mainly because oa is calculated as the percentage of grid cells regardless of floodplain or upland that are consistent between two maps ua as shown in fig 5 measures the number of grid cells consistently identified as floodplain across the two maps compared to the sum of floodplain cells only in the topography based map pa is a relatively conservative index measuring the number of grid cells consistently identified as floodplain across the two maps compared to the sum of floodplain cells only in the reference map csi is an advancement over the oa as it gets rid of the tn and considers cells classified correctly as floodplain only tp and false alarms fp fn k provides a difference measurement between the observed consistency of the two maps and consistency that is contributed by chance lunetta et al 1991 therefore a k value of 0 8 may be interpreted as 80 better identification of floodplains through a topography based approach than what would be expected by a random assignment of grid cells as floodplain or upland 5 results and discussion 5 1 evaluation of reference floodplain map the calibration and validation results at daily time scale respectively for the 2005 and 2010 monsoon season june september suggested a high performance hydrodynamic model using a hybrid dem that is representative of the floodplain bathymetry revisit sections 4 1 3 and 4 2 allowed us to iterate only the main river s manning s n yet achieve high accuracy in model simulations fig 6 a shows the variation of model performance i e rmse between observed and simulated stage height at the basin outlet with different n values the simulated daily stage height at the basin outlet corresponding the optimized n value i e 0 035 produced minimal rmse 0 09 and high nse 0 95 regardless of the calibration and validation periods fig 6b d this high accuracy in stage height simulation implied high accuracy in the corresponding simulations of floodplain extents 5 2 evaluation of topography based floodplain maps the relative differences measured using various statistical indices suggested that hand twi and sp approaches perform differently we found ample evidence to confirm that in our study area floodplain maps generated from hand and twi are more reliable than those from sp fig 7 below summarizes the distribution of error in km2 units tp tn fp and fn and the corresponding statistical indices ua pa csi and k for each of the three topography based approaches the overall high values of ua pa csi and k indicate a relatively better efficacy of hand approach compared to twi and sp in the case of twi based floodplain map the statistical indices implied moderate performance with an underestimation tendency relative to the reference map however we noted large inconsistencies in sp based floodplain map with a very low ua 0 35 and a very high pa value 0 73 this low ua in sp approach especially indicated a high error of commission meaning in simple words the sp based floodplain demarcated floodplains in areas where a hydrodynamic model found uplands and vice versa the better performance of hand and twi over sp in floodplain mapping is further supported by figs 8 10 at three evaluation sites with increasing upstream drainage areas along the main river reach the relatively greater reliability of the hand approach in floodplain delineation can be attributed to its potential of representing relative gravitational potential of the area it is based on the hypothesis that area near the stream must be permanently saturated governed by local topography irrespective of its height from the dem s datum sea level nobre et al 2011 in general floodplain extent depends on the river stage of the extreme flood event and hand raster efficiently relates the river stage with the dem as hand converts dem into a normalized altitude raster it provides hydrologically relevant information e g inundation extent saturation zones for landscape classification here floodplain however hand overestimated the floodplain extent relative to the reference map especially in the downstream areas see fig 9a and fig 10a this is due to the spatially explicit role of river network in hand calculation a densified river network in the watershed may produce relatively narrower range of hand values disregarding the lower order reaches would therefore widen the range of hand values maidment et al 2016 zheng et al 2018a subsequently for a given threshold a wider range of hand values would result into a wider floodplain extent in twi approach the consistently underestimated floodplain extent throughout the main river reach is largely attributed to twi s dependency on local slope calculation of local slope is sensitive to dem s horizontal resolution and vertical accuracy especially in high relief areas pourali et al 2016 as such local slope may not adequately represent concave or convex topographic reliefs which are frequent in mountainous watersheds hjerdt et al 2004 misrepresentation of specific upslope area for dem cells in the valley floor böhner and selige 2006 is another factor contributing to twi s underestimation problem in our study area using an exponent with the specific area parameter could improve twi s floodplain delineation see manfreda et al 2011 yet such an approach would require some level of parameter calibration based on local conditions manfreda and sole 2013 notwithstanding these limitations twi maps appear to be dendritic capturing smaller streams without any discontinuity twi was also able to follow the twisting of rivers and detect the confluence point in sp approach dependency on nearest stream and ridge elevation values table 1 makes it highly susceptible to dem s horizontal resolution thus producing patches of small valleys on a large hilltop or patches of small hills or ridges in a large valley this explains the disconnect sporadic and unrealistic longitudinal orientation of the sp based floodplain especially in upstream areas fig 8c fig 9c and fig 10c although these analyses suggest a relatively poor performance of the sp approach some of its limitations in floodplain mapping may be resolved using very high resolution dems note in all these assessments we considered the model simulated 100 year floodplain as a reference baseline although the counterpart topography based maps were not associated with a specific probability of flooding therefore our results do not infer the relative accuracy between a topography based floodplain map and a model simulated floodplain map our results rather identify the extent to which hand twi and sp based floodplain maps were different from each other by separately comparing them against a fixed baseline i e consistency check clearly this makes our findings independent of a specific flood magnitude and probability our results confirm that topography based approaches mediated by a kind of supervised classification thresholding can map floodplains in data scarce complex terrain basins because thresholding is a key step for these approaches to find the floodplain upland breakline it is important to recognize what alternatives do researchers and practitioners have for selecting a reasonable threshold while some studies have previously used gauged and or simulated stage height data as thresholds e g afshari et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a we argued why that would disavow the practical applicability of using topography based approaches in data scarce regions see our discussion in section 4 3 we therefore leveraged ground control points gcps open source satellite imagery and stakeholder communications to construct a reasonable threshold for our study area where setting up gcps deem challenging note it requires field surveying historical non structural high water marks e g debris lines erosion lines tree trunks along with high resolution satellite based observations of recurring surface water inundation extents could be used to approximate potential flood hazard zones see e g asfpm 2014 koenig et al 2016 malgwi et al 2021 shastry and durand 2019 and subsequently guide the thresholding process through some parsimonious spatial interpolation extrapolation across watershed scales structural high water marks e g bridge piers building damages levee tops could also be used to identify range of possible flood elevations hence the thresholds nevertheless topography based floodplain mapping is by default sensitive to dem s horizontal resolution and or vertical accuracy although we performed a systematic experiment on dem quality based on multiple freely available and commercial dem datasets and therefore picked one that seemed to have the best quality for our study area see table 2 running such experiments is time labour and cost intensive gradual globalization of cost effective high quality dems from airborne insar as opposed to the standard lidar technology may eventually address this gap simpson et al 2015 6 summary the present study explores the efficacy of three different topography based approaches for floodplain mapping on regional scale in a data scarce complex terrain taking a 55 6 km reach of beas river in the north west himalayan region as a testbed we showed whether and to what extent height above the nearest drainage hand topographic wetness index twi and slope position sp can delineate floodplains as compared to a process based hydrodynamic model mike 11 hand based floodplain demonstrated greater agreement with the model simulated reference map twi showed moderate predictability with a tendency of underestimating floodplains sp was largely inconsistent with hand and twi finding floodplains in areas where the hydrodynamic model found uplands and vice versa hand s relatively superior performance can be attributed to its implicit ability to understand flood relevant hydrologic information such as saturation zone the explicit role of river network is however a deterring factor that makes hand calculations highly subjective while the dependency on local slope imposes some inaccuracy in the twi approach twi based floodplain map showed some unique potentials by capturing floodplains along smaller streams twisting rivers and near the confluence without discontinuity dependency on nearest stream and ridge elevation values makes sp highly susceptible to dem s horizontal resolution a limitation that may be minimized by using very high resolution dems because topography based approaches are sensitive to the input dem a dem with coarse horizontal resolution and poor vertical accuracy can very well be misinterpreting the consistency across hand twi and sp based floodplains we minimized the likelihood of such misinterpretations by selecting the best available dem and subsequently reconstructing the dem via an extensive bathymetry survey our dem selection was based on a field experiment that allowed us to compare the vertical accuracy of four alternative dems we improved the accuracy of our simulated reference map and hence the accuracy of our assessments by collecting longitudinal and cross sectional elevation data across 223 locations and subsequently developing a bathymetry integrated hybrid dem to feed the hydrodynamic model we further increased the accuracy of our simulated reference map by using a rigorous procedure for setting up the upstream boundary conditions and subsequent calibrations at the watershed outlet while our findings confirm the efficacy of topography based floodplain mapping approaches in data scarce complex terrain regions questions remain on their mode of execution we think that the definition of a threshold to find the floodplain upland breakline imparts the most significant limitation on these approaches from the execution standpoint related to this thresholding problem the spatial scale of execution large versus small watersheds is another critical yet overlooked factor that can affect the predictability of topography based floodplain maps specifically those derived through hand and twi researchers and floodplain managers should be aware of these limitations in situations where they have to rely solely on topography based approaches for floodplain mapping when the collection of ground control points gcps as shown in our study is infeasible the use of freely available satellite imagery high water marks and local experiences could ease the burden of defining a reasonable threshold nonetheless with the increasing availability of globally available geospatial data resources the future of low complexity topography based approaches as fast floodplain mapping tools seems very bright being efficient alternatives to hydrodynamic floodplain extent simulations these topography based approaches can open up new opportunities for interdisciplinary floodplain ecosystem and

2018,climate models consistently project that frequency severity and duration of hydroclimatic extremes will increase over this century under climate change urban flooding and runoff in general have become prominent issues for many cities and regions arising from a combination of altered precipitation patterns urban growth development in floodplains and increases in impervious surfaces in this study we first validate total grid cell level runoff from the fully coupled community earth system model cesm historical simulations against one observed runoff streamflow based dataset and one reanalysis dataset and further analyze both grid cell level runoff and urban subgrid runoff under future climate change scenarios we calculated global annual average of monthly runoff from the period 1986 1995 for the validation and calculated bias and correlation coefficients between cesm and each of the datasets additionally we analyzed future grid cell and urban runoff across three cmip6 coupled shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways 2 4 5 3 7 0 and 5 8 5 and evaluated changes between the future period of 2041 2050 and the same past period of 1986 1995 for each scenario results show spatial consistency and robustness between the cesm simulations and both datasets however there is some spatial inconsistency in the areas highlighted as major runoff producers such as the amazon basin and southeast asia as well as mountainous regions outside the united states grid cell level runoff and urban runoff projections suggest that future hydroclimatic conditions will vary depending on the climate scenario however certain locations such as madagascar indonesia and the himalayan mountain range consistently see decreases in both grid cell level runoff and urban runoff across all scenarios and locations such as nigeria and ecuador consistently see increases in both grid cell runoff and urban runoff across all scenarios our findings provide quantitative insights on hydrology representation in the global earth system model and advance the understanding of the impacts of large scale climate change on future local scale urban runoff

deaths and economic losses occurring due to flash floods than any other extreme weather hazard yin et al 2018 due to climate change and anthropogenic effects flash floods attributed to storm runoff extremes are projected to become more frequent and damaging yin et al 2018 global mean temperature increases have a drastic impact on the global hydrologic cycle across spatial and temporal scales labat et al 2004 barlage et al 2002 as global warming intensifies the hydrologic cycle global continental runoff increases due to more intense evaporation over oceans increases in continental precipitation and decreases in continental evaporation labat et al 2004 anthropogenic changes cause global increases in extreme events particularly stormwater runoff responses due to warming combined with land cover changes and land and water management yin et al 2018 land surface conditions play a major role in runoff generation with impervious concrete surfaces found in cities generating runoff quicker and in greater quantities than pervious land cover common to vegetated areas due to the loss of pervious surface a symptom common to urbanization the infiltration of rainwater into the soil is decreased which in turn leads to issues involving increased runoff and in more extreme cases increased urban flooding liu et al 2020 because runoff responses are proven to track with anthropogenic changes particularly in urban areas runoff is an important parameter to account for within global climate modeling and in urban studies however uncertainty surrounding runoff projections in climate modeling is high lehner et al 2019 emphasizing the need for validation of runoff against ground truth datasets according to the united nations the world s urban population is expected to increase from 55 to 68 by 2050 and in north america alone 82 of the population already lives in the urban environment united nations 2019 in the united states city infrastructure is continuing to age and the 2021

2018 cutter et al 2014 zheng et al 2021a zhao et al 2021 infrastructures are especially at risk from hydroclimatic extremes associated with climate change if they are stressed by age demand or are located near coastlines storm tracks rivers and arid areas of vegetation wilbanks and fernandez 2014 urban flooding has become a prominent issue for many cities arising from a combination of altered precipitation patterns urban growth development in floodplains and increases in impervious surfaces ashley et al 2005 climate models consistently project that frequency severity and duration of these extremes will increase markedly over this century under climate change horton et al 2016 ipcc 2014 there is a pressing need to advance fundamental understanding of how climate adaptation strategies deliver hydroclimatic benefits for cities under climate change coupled with urban development zhao 2018 krayenhoff et al 2018 however there is still uncertainty in accurately representing the hydrologic cycle in earth system models esms and global climate models gcms validation of hydrologic variables such as runoff modeled by the state of the art climate models provides an opportunity to gain insight for their improvement in representing hydrologic processes and the benchmark of the uncertainty in models future hydroclimatic projections more importantly most previous efforts to examine runoff have studied regional or non urban runoff rather than runoff in urban areas specifically niu et al 2005 xia et al 2012 oleson et al 2008b because the current esms or gcms almost universally lack a physical representation of urban areas zhao et al 2021 all these challenges highlight a critical need for urban specific hydrologic analysis in recent years more studies have started to acknowledge urban runoff particularly as awareness of urbanization s impact on the hydrologic cycle grows multiple studies link runoff with urban flooding and define urban flooding in part as a result of surface runoff over the city area kc et al 2021 li et al 2021 browne et al 2021 fang et al 2020 similar to the analysis presented here several recent studies have used representative concentration pathways rcps of future greenhouse gas emissions kiprotich et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 andimuthu et al 2019 or shared socioeconomic pathways ssps fang et al 2020 to drive their modeling of the hydrologic cycle and runoff in urban areas additionally both statistical modeling butcher et al 2021 andimuthu et al 2019 such as the use of intensity duration frequency idf curves and process based modeling approaches yang et al 2020 kc et al 2021 browne et al 2021 kiprotich et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 such as the use of climate models or hydrologic models have been used to represent runoff however the scale for these studies remains confined to specific weather stations butcher et al 2021 urban areas yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 kc et al 2021 browne et al 2021 andimuthu et al 2019 moghadas et al 2018 or watersheds including official metropolitan areas kiprotich et al 2021 several studies simulated runoff for historical periods yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 browne et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 while the others simulated both a historical period and future scenarios into the 2080s and 2090s butcher et al 2021 kc et al 2021 kiprotich et al 2021 andimuthu et al 2019 most of the studies reviewed here mention that their results can be applied to urban planning and stormwater management yang et al 2020 kc et al 2021 browne et al 2021 kiprotich et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 andimuthu et al 2019 while the others focus on how their results can be used to improve future hydrologic modeling butcher et al 2021 li et al 2021 research on urban specific runoff on a large scale is thus necessary providing a key motivation of this study in this study we evaluate the total grid cell level runoff output variable q r u n o f f from the community earth system model cesm coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 historical simulation runoff was analyzed because it represents a key hydrologic variable associated with human intervention and stormwater infrastructure previous studies have used large scale climate model projections of meteorological variables and downscaled to a watershed or basin scale using regional climate or hydrologic models shamir et al 2019 chen et al 2019 wu et al 2019 liu et al 2008 dibike and coulibaly 2005 this is a commonly used approach over limited regions at small scales due to its high computational cost to our knowledge there has not been an effort to evaluate cesm s total and urban runoff at the global scale previous studies have examined region specific subsurface runoff and total runoff from cesm xu and di vittorio 2021 wrzesien and pavelsky 2020 and others have used cesm s runoff output jahfer et al 2020 kooperman et al 2018 but not on a global scale we evaluated cesm cmip6 simulation against two observational based datasets the university of new hampshire global runoff data centre unh grdc dataset fekete et al 2002 and the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 dataset global modeling and assimilation office gmao 2015 by validating the hydrologic component of total runoff of cesm we provide insight into potential improvements in representing runoff and better understand the benchmark of runoff uncertainty in cesm s future hydroclimatic projections we then examine both the grid cell level runoff and the urban subgrid runoff predicted by cesm under three climate change scenarios of cmip6 to determine how climate change likely impacts both in the future each scenario represents a different level of mitigation and adaptation action taken and provides valuable information about potential future hydroclimatic changes in this study we only examine monthly averages of runoff to provide insight about cesm s modeling capability and larger urban hydrology trends due to the lack of short time scale daily or hourly runoff data from the official cesm cmip6 simulations however we do acknowledge the need to analyze finer scale storm events to inform stormwater management and call for future studies at very fine time resolutions the three objectives of this study were 1 to validate the cesm s modeled runoff against two observational based datasets to determine spatial and temporal accuracy of historical runoff simulations 2 to observe the total runoff changes associated with different climate change scenarios and 3 to examine the future urban specific runoff effects under various climate change scenarios to understand how large scale climate change impacts local scale urban runoff 2 methodology 2 1 cesm and simulations the community earth system model cesm danabasoglu et al 2020 is a fully coupled global scale climate model and is one of the models that participates in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 eyring et al 2016 it is hosted at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in conjunction with researchers in the earth system science community hurrell et al 2013 cesm synthesizes physical chemical and biological processes in the earth system and has seven major components that communicate through a coupler the atmosphere land land ice ocean sea ice river and wave model hurrell et al 2013 danabasoglu et al 2020 the land component of cesm is known as the community terrestrial systems model ctsm and formerly was known as the community land model clm ctsm focuses mainly on how terrestrial ecosystems and their various biological chemical and physical processes can affect climate and also be affected by climate grid cells in ctsm are composed of the five land units vegetated glacier crop lake and urban ctsm is of particular interest because it allows for direct study of how humans can affect global environmental change ctsm has been widely evaluated against both in situ and remote sensing observations around the globe oleson et al 2008a zhao et al 2014 demuzere et al 2017 the urban parameterization scheme embedded in ctsm clmu simulates local urban climate as an operational component of a global climate model oleson and feddema 2019 it models the radiation energy water and mass transfer between land and the lower atmosphere in urban environments oleson and feddema 2019 more details on how ctsm and clmu simulate the subsurface land atmosphere hydrologic processes can be found in lawrence et al 2018 and oleson et al 2008a respectively we used two sets of the official already completed cmip6 simulations for the purpose of this study the historical run for model validation and the future scenariomip runs o neill et al 2016 for examining future urban runoff the major reason that we chose cmip6 simulations is that these are open access community use simulations and are among those used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc for climate assessments ipcc 2014 masson delmotte et al 2021 the entire historical run is from 1850 to 2014 and future runs are from 2015 to 2100 under multiple rcp ssp scenarios all these simulations are fully coupled runs and at a spatial resolution of 0 9424 latitude 1 25 longitude for model setup cesm2 0 with clm5 0 embedded including the urban parameterization scheme was used all the simulation results can be accessed from the official cmip6 archive https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 or the ncar climate data gateway https www earthsystemgrid org 2 2 clmu and urban runoff grid cells in ctsm are composed of five subgrid units or land units vegetated glacier crop lake and urban each grid cell area is composed of different percentages of each land unit the model computes outputs for each subgrid and its allocated area and for some output variables will then complete an area weighted average across the whole grid cell for the purposes of this study we were specifically interested in the urban component of ctsm currently cesm is the only model with an urban land parameterization as part of its land model detailed enough for the purposes of this study zhao et al 2021 zheng et al 2021b embedded within clmu is a global urban surface dataset developed for global climate modeling which provides information on present day urban extent and properties for every grid cell containing an urban subgrid land unit information provided includes thermal radiative and morphological characteristics of urban areas zhao et al 2021 in the most recent update to clmu the urban land unit has been expanded to include three urban density classes known as tall building district tbd high density hd and medium density md oleson and feddema 2019 tbd represents an area of at least 1 km2 with buildings that are greater than or equal to ten stories tall and a very small pervious area typically 5 10 of the planned area hd represents industrial commercial or residential buildings that are three to ten stories tall and have a pervious fraction that falls between 5 25 md represents row houses or apartments that are one to three stories tall and have a higher pervious fraction ranging between 20 60 oleson and feddema 2019 each of these density classes operate independently in the grid cell oleson and feddema 2019 clmu s urban scheme is based on an urban canyon conceptual structure that is comprised of roof wall sunlit and shaded and canyon floor pervious and impervious facets oleson et al 2010 sufficient biophysical and hydrological processes are captured over these facets oleson et al 2010 oleson and feddema 2019 for example the pervious floor represents any surface that infiltrates water liquid water is allowed to pond on roofs and canyon floors which supports evaporation snowmelt water or water in excess of the maximum ponding depth on both roofs and floors runs off the evaporation for pervious canyon floor is parameterized by a bulk scheme in which evaporation is a function of the wetness of the entire soil column and water is removed from each soil layer a surface input dataset prescribing the thermal radiative morphological and hydrological characteristics of these facets for each grid cell in cesm is determined by satellite derived data jackson et al 2010 one major limitation of clmu is that the urban extent and properties are static at this time urbanization effects and urban expansion are not represented in these climate simulations however urban expansion effects on grid cell means are likely minimal due to the small fraction 2 of urban areas on the earth s surface even within grid cells housing larger cities zhao et al 2021 the nested hierarchy of subgrids for ctsm is shown in fig 1 with a particular focus on the urban hierarchy 2 3 validation of runoff modeling in cesm it would be ideal to directly validate the cesm modeled urban runoff against urban specific observations however urban runoff observations are extremely sparse essentially unattainable at the global scale therefore in this study we compare the grid cell mean runoff with the observational based datasets to evaluate the hydrology represented in cesm because the water balance and cycling are closely tracked in each landscape including the urban unit in the model oleson et al 2008a our evaluation even in the absence of measured runoff data at a global scale can provide indicative information and confidence in cesm s urban hydrologic modeling additionally grid level runoff itself is an important parameter to evaluate and can provide insight into the general state of the global hydrologic balance 2 3 1 dataset information the unh grdc dataset provided composite runoff synthesizing ground based runoff observations and a water balance model fekete et al 2002 while the merra 2 dataset provided total runoff including throughflow from a satellite model data assimilation system global modeling and assimilation office gmao 2015 pure observational runoff data at the global scale are often unavailable and we address this challenge by using two different datasets for validation despite the modeling component involved in each for the purposes of this analysis we evaluated the cmip6 historical simulation against the unh grdc dataset and the merra 2 dataset a summary of key parameters from each of the sources is provided in table 1 and more information on each can be found in the supplemental information section 2 3 2 model validation our first task was to aggregate the unh grdc and merra 2 datasets from their respective resolutions of 0 5 latitude 0 5 longitude and 0 5 latitude 0 625 longitude to the same degree system as the cesm simulations 0 9424 1 25 resolution to ensure appropriate and compatible comparison across the three datasets all the data processing was conducted using r in the ncar s high performance computing hpc cluster cheyenne we chose the ten year historical period of 1986 1995 covered in unh grdc as the period of focus for validation due to the need to validate the model with primarily observational data we calculated the monthly average for each calendar year of runoff across the 10 year period for each dataset we first calculated monthly averages of runoff for each grid cell further averaged those values over an annual basis and then calculated the mean across the 10 years this process was completed for all three datasets to determine the annual monthly average of runoff from 1986 1995 after calculating the annual monthly average of runoff from 1986 1995 we compared the annual monthly average from the cesm simulations against unh grdc and merra 2 to calculate bias at each grid cell indicating that bias was calculated for a variety of conditions and locations across the globe positive values in global bias indicated that cesm overestimated runoff compared to unh grdc or merra 2 while negative values indicated cesm underestimated runoff with respect to either unh grdc or merra 2 we generated basic summary statistics for both sets of global bias including global mean difference standard deviation and root mean square error calculated across the values in every grid cell two sets of these calculations were completed one for unh grdc versus cesm set of global bias and one for merra 2 versus cesm set of global bias for the final task in the validation process we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient across the 120 months in the 10 year period for each grid cell to determine the strength of the model on capturing temporal variation hereafter when we use the phrase correlation coefficient we are referring to the pearson correlation coefficient 2 4 future grid and urban subgrid runoff analysis after completing the validation of cesm s cmip6 historical simulation we analyzed how both total grid cell mean and urban subgrid runoff are projected to change in the future under different climate change scenarios for the purposes of this study three different future scenarios of cmip6 were examined ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 each future projection involved a shared socioeconomic pathway ssp and a representative concentration pathway rcp van vuuren et al 2011 ssp2 4 5 represents a middle of the road mitigated scenario with medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation with 4 5 wm 2 climate forcing by the end of the century ssp3 7 0 represents a regional rivalry scenario with high challenges to mitigation and adaptation with 7 0 wm 2 climate forcing ssp5 8 5 represents a fossil fueled development scenario with 8 5 wm 2 climate forcing where fossil fuels continue to be the dominant energy source o neill et al 2016 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 all contain projections for 2015 2100 an area weighted average of runoff was calculated across three different building densities tall building district tbd high density hd and medium density md note that the urban surface property data in clmu are static zhao et al 2021 thus implying that the urban water resources system itself is also static to determine grid cell runoff and urban runoff change for each scenario we again used the 1986 1995 period representing the past climate and 2041 2050 representing the future projected middle of the century climates we averaged the weighted monthly total and urban runoff across each grid cell for the past and future period for each scenario after calculating the averages for the past and future periods for each of the three scenarios the present period was subtracted from the future period for each scenario to quantify the change of average urban runoff if the difference for a grid cell was positive the average urban runoff is projected to increase under that scenario and if negative the average urban runoff is projected to decrease under that scenario for that location it was predicted that the higher emissions scenarios would have an average positive difference since literature implies that climate change intensifies the hydrologic cycle although intensification does not always lead to increased runoff labat et al 2004 in addition to examining the difference between the future and present scenarios we analyzed the impacts of built morphology on urban runoff only major metropolitan centers have a tbd density class associated with the city which meant that there were fewer grid cells that were utilized in the density analysis the md density class runoff average was subtracted from the tbd density class with positive difference values indicating that tbd produces more runoff and negative difference values indicating that md produces more runoff this calculation was completed for both the future and past climatic conditions for each scenario 3 results 3 1 runoff validation 3 1 1 annual average monthly runoff bias fig 2 a shows the annual average monthly bias between the cesm historical simulation and unh grdc for the 10 year period the annual monthly average of the runoff values were calculated via averaging runoff for each grid cell across the months of each calendar year in the 10 year period and then the 10 year averages were averaged to create an annual monthly average for both cesm and unh grdc the unh grdc average values of runoff were subtracted from the cesm average values to create the bias figure with positive values indicating an overbias from cesm and negative values indicating an underbias in general cesm reproduces both the magnitude and spatial variation of the observed runoff reasonably well notable areas of underbias are the amazon basin guatemala and the bangladesh myanmar border near the indian ocean which note underprediction values ranging from 100 200 mm month overbias can consistently be seen for prominent global mountain ranges such as the andes and the himalayas with a few locations in the himalayas showing close to 400 mm month overprediction and closer to the 200 300 mm month overprediction range in the andes suggesting topography induced bias errors in the simulated hydrology of cesm a slight overbias can also be observed in southeast asia particularly in indonesia ranging from 100 200 mm month overprediction the calculated global mean bias value for this comparison was a difference of 5 86 27 87 mm month mean and standard deviation calculated spatially over each cell for the entire earth and a root mean square error of 28 48 mm month cesm s global grid cell mean was 22 86 mm month and unh grdc s was 21 7 mm month a slight difference similar to fig 2 a fig 2 b illustrates the annual average monthly bias between the cesm historical simulation and merra 2 for the 10 year period for fig 2 b the merra 2 average values calculated in the same way as unh grdc and cesm were subtracted from the cesm average values with relation to merra 2 there is a more prominent overbias in southeast asia from cesm ranging from 100 300 mm month overprediction and the overbias from the andes and the himalayas is even more prevalent with more of the himalayas having close to 400 mm month overpredicted and more of the andes being in the 200 300 mm month overprediction range compared to the cesm and unh grdc comparison there are still pockets of underbias in the amazon basin but they are not as pronounced as in fig 2 a closer to the 0 100 mm month underprediction range the calculated global mean bias value for this comparison was a difference of 17 38 38 04 mm month mean and standard deviation calculated spatially over each cell for the entire earth and a root mean square error of 41 82 mm month merra 2 s global grid cell mean was 15 86 mm month a more pronounced difference from cesm s than unh grdc s the annual average bias shows spatial consistency between the cesm simulations and both the unh grdc composite runoff data and the merra 2 reanalysis data comparison between cesm and merra 2 suggests that cesm tends to calculate higher runoff values than does merra 2 as evidenced by the average global mean bias 17 38 mm month as well as the difference in each set s 95 confidence interval comparison between cesm and unh grdc suggests more consistency in runoff values between the two also evidenced by the average global mean bias 5 86 mm month and each set s 95 confidence interval but notes more underpredictions of runoff both comparisons showed there is a spatial inconsistency in the areas highlighted as major runoff producers namely the amazon basin and much of southeast asia both datasets note that cesm underestimates runoff in the amazon and overestimates runoff in southeast asia both comparisons also indicate an overbias as high as 400 mm month from cesm in the mountainous regions outside of the united states fig 3 illustrates the global runoff by month for each of the three datasets averaged over the 1986 1995 period similar to the bias analysis fig 3 indicates that merra 2 has a tendency to underpredict runoff compared to cesm fig 3 also shows that unh grdc and cesm track more closely with each other although cesm does slightly underpredict when compared with grdc both grdc and merra 2 place the global average peak of runoff as occurring in june while cesm places it in july the similarity of each curve does provide evidence that cesm is able to capture global average runoff seasonality 3 1 2 temporal variability the correlation coefficient values between cesm and unh grdc shown in fig 4 a range between 1 and 1 with no visibly apparent spatial pattern this lack of pattern suggests that cesm does not predict runoff values well for smaller temporal periods such as on a monthly basis particularly since many of the values are closer to zero indicating no or slight correlation for those grid cells across the 120 months only 1159 of the full 11 343 non na grid cells or 10 2 have values of 0 7 or higher meaning only 10 2 of the grid cells have a strong positive relationship across the 120 months additionally grid cells in northern africa the middle east parts of the united states and the eastern part of australia appear to be missing values because of a large number of missing na values in the unh grdc dataset the unh grdc dataset provided runoff values where data were available for that month and that particular year but was not able to provide a fully comprehensive record similar to fig 4 a the correlation coefficient values between cesm and merra 2 shown in fig 4 b do not have an apparent pattern and vary widely between 1 and 1 only 950 values of the 14 447 non na grid cells or 6 58 have values of 0 7 or higher even less than the evaluation between cesm and unh grdc this further suggests that cesm does not do well in its prediction of runoff values for smaller temporal periods but rather is more accurate with temporal averaging since merra 2 is not strictly an observational dataset and is heavily reliant on computation for its data it does not have the missing values issue that unh grdc does 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of future total runoff change for the next part of the analysis we examined grid cell level runoff change under three future climate change scenarios changes in grid cell runoff depended on the area of the world with some regions projected to get wetter i e increases in grid cell runoff compared to the past climate while some regions are projected to get drier i e decreases in grid cell runoff compared to the past climate as shown in fig 5 it should be noted that the changes in grid cell runoff are consistent across all scenarios although to varying degrees of intensity depending on the scenario across all scenarios grid cell runoff decreases through the majority of south america although most notably in the andes mountain range and parts of brazil and chile in ssp2 4 5 these decreases range from 30 60 mm month 30 45 mm month in ssp3 7 0 and 30 55 mm month in ssp 5 8 5 it also consistently decreases in madagascar parts of indonesia and in the himalayan mountain range in ssp2 4 5 these decreases range from 30 40 mm month 40 mm month for ssp 3 7 0 and from 20 42 mm month in ssp5 8 5 conversely consistent increases in runoff can be seen in northern brazil the coast of ecuador and columbia nigeria myanmar papua new guinea parts of north australia in ssp2 4 5 parts of china and the philippines in ssp2 4 5 notable increases in runoff in these areas range from 40 80 mm month 30 70 mm month for ssp3 7 0 and 40 80 mm month in ssp5 8 5 the increase in grid cell runoff globally can be best observed through ssp5 8 5 where the increases in grid cell runoff are larger and the decreases in runoff in most areas are less pronounced than in previous scenarios 3 3 spatiotemporal variations of urban runoff change for the final part of the analysis we examined urban runoff change under three future climate change scenarios similarly to changes in grid cell level runoff changes in urban subgrid runoff depended on the area of the world and the scenario as shown in fig 6 also similarly to the grid cell level runoff analysis it should be noted that the changes in urban runoff are consistent across all scenarios although to varying degrees of intensity depending on the scenario across all scenarios runoff decreases in urban areas in southern brazil east madagascar parts of indonesia and the himalayan mountain range in ssp2 4 5 these prominent decreases range from 30 50 mm month from 30 45 mm month in ssp3 7 0 and from 10 35 mm month in ssp5 8 5 additionally in ssp5 8 5 there are prominent decreases in parts of china thailand and vietnam around 25 mm month conversely across all scenarios urban runoff notably increases in parts of peru and ecuador nigeria bangladesh burma and papau new guinea these increases range from 30 70 mm month in ssp2 4 5 from 30 60 mm month in ssp3 7 0 and from 40 70 mm month in ssp5 8 5 leveraging the different density classes represented in clmu we further examined the impacts of urban morphology on the modeled urban runoff figs 7 and 8 illustrate that tbd always produces higher amounts of runoff than the smaller urban density class md regardless of time period or scenario likely due to the high amount of impervious surface attributed to the tbd class and the lower percentage of impervious surfaces associated with the md class this effect of morphology on urban runoff is also consistent with previous findings us epa 2008 2021 4 discussion one of the main challenges we faced in this study was the lack of observational runoff data both of the datasets used for validation involved a synthesis of observational data and model data whereas the ideal validation would have been completed against purely observational data available at a global scale however this is infeasible since the majority of the world s watersheds are ungauged runoff assessment must then be completed through analysis of other hydrologic variables or morphometric characteristics both methods used in past hydrologic studies as stressed in the hydrologic initiative predictions in ungauged basins pub from the international association of hydrological sciences iahs hrachowitz et al 2013 our results articulate a need for standardized ground truthed runoff data collection beyond streamflow gauging additionally a standardized definition of runoff is needed within the scientific community we attempted to find as compatible datasets as possible but the definitions of runoff for each set are slightly different and use different verbiage total runoff grid cell level in cesm was defined as the combination of surface runoff and subsurface runoff national center for atmospheric research 2020 while runoff from unh grdc was based heavily on surface observations with gaps being filled in with the water balance model fekete et al 2002 runoff from merra 2 was defined as surface runoff plus throughflow which is not defined in the nasa documentation but in other sources is noted to be lateral soil water flow band et al 1993 gelaro et al 2017 although throughflow and subsurface runoff are very similar their verbiage is not yet used interchangeably and cesm s definition of subsurface runoff accounts for several factors beyond lateral soil water flow a similar subsurface component is not explicitly included in unh grdc however in the water balance model used to develop unh grdc soil information and properties are included indicating that some consideration of subsurface runoff hydrology is incorporated particularly since unh grdc describes itself as a dataset of terrestrial runoff fekete et al 2002 additionally the bias analysis results from cesm led us to reflect on the location based or geographic biases in earth systems models notably cesm over predicted runoff at prominent world mountain ranges as well as in southeast asia and under predicted runoff in the amazon basin however this same mountainous bias did not appear in the rocky mountains in north america despite prior studies indicating that cesm struggles with runoff in regions with frozen soils oleson et al 2008b there have been more studies comparing actual catchments to hydrologic models completed in europe and north america teutschbein and seibert 2010 and the use of regional climate models in downscaling global climate projections has been established to be biased to the observed climatology of a given region muerth et al 2013 we compared the average grid cell topography i e altitude with both sets of bias results demonstrate a generally larger but inconsistent bias in areas of higher altitude fig s3 suggesting a topography induced representation issue in cesm the large vertical spread in each point shown in fig s3 indicates the influences of other factors on the model bias because the observational record is extensive in the united states and thereby cesm could be better parameterized and or constrained in the united states region the results suggest that there could be geographic bias in the hydrology of the model previous versions of cesm have also struggled with predicting runoff in the amazon basin noting insufficient precipitation from the atmospheric component of cesm exacerbation by unrealistic partitioning of evapotranspiration and deficiencies in runoff and soil water storage as the main reasons oleson et al 2008b additionally other studies completed on cmip6 s predicted precipitation notes bias in similar areas noted here such as southeast asia and equatorial amazonia tian and dong 2020 dong and dong 2021 because the amazon is highlighted as overpredicting runoff both against unh grdc and merra 2 this bias leads to questions regarding how much the model has improved in terms of hydrology for regions such as the amazon basin with high precipitation and high amounts of green cover although spatial consistency and robustness between total runoff from cesm and the two datasets are demonstrated there is still considerable uncertainty in total runoff simulations because there is a lack of urban specific runoff observations to constrain the model parameterization on urban hydrology the model likely has larger uncertainty in the urban component than the total runoff we cannot provide quantitative estimates on urban runoff uncertainty due to the absent urban observations however the cesm modeled urban runoff should be within reasonable uncertainty range this is because of the water balance in the model the total runoff shows reasonable agreement with observations based on the results described above other key variables relevant to the surface water balance such as precipitation evapotranspiration temperature humidity etc modeled by cesm have also been validated against ground based and or remote sensing observations in previous studies oleson et al 2008a zhao et al 2014 demuzere et al 2017 therefore the forced water balance in cesm would impose constraints on the estimated urban runoff our analysis of urban runoff across the three scenarios suggests that future hydrologic conditions in urban areas depend on the extent of implementation of strategies used to combat climate change even in the scenario that represents high mitigation and adaptation ssp 2 4 5 urban runoff is projected to increase in many areas globally very few locations remain consistent when compared with present conditions suggesting flooding potential cities should be aware that even with climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies in place the hydrologic conditions of their municipality are likely going to change into the midcentury and should plan accordingly the results of this study also corroborate previous findings indicating that with higher percentages of impervious surface more runoff is likely to be produced us epa 2021 the results particularly indicate that tbd and likely hd density classes present in cities will produce greater quantities of urban runoff in both the present climate as well as future climate conditions regardless of scenario this result is concerning as urbanization continues to rise worldwide especially with projections that by 2050 the majority of the world s population will be residing in urban areas united nations 2019 only very large cities have a tbd class component in cesm but more of the world s cities have an hd component and even the md component common to most cities in the model will likely produce more runoff than would be produced by the natural land cover this conclusion has important implications for urban planning and stormwater management constructing larger taller buildings especially in close relation to one another might not be the best strategy as the increased surface area on those buildings will likely generate more urban runoff however this issue becomes difficult with the push for greater urban densification to prevent sprawl and also achieve a more energy efficient environment samuelsson et al 2021 haaland and van den bosch 2015 based on the results presented here urban runoff in cities is already an issue with more runoff being generated by buildings with more impervious surfaces and is only going to worsen under climate change stormwater infrastructure across the united states is in poor condition american society of civil engineers 2021c and the prevalence of underperforming grey stormwater infrastructure in many cities worsens conditions measuring urban runoff and stormwater management within cities is challenging partially due to the presence of combined or separated sewer systems which in cities like chicago u s are not a source of runoff typically accounted for or measured zhu et al 2016 there is a need for better and more standardized monitoring of runoff within urban areas specifically for urban runoff observations in general and for monitoring that captures multiple aspects of runoff not just surface flow that directly flows into nearby bodies of water additionally stormwater infrastructure in general is in desperate need of update and reform which provides an opportunity to utilize solutions that are nature based or that provide more services than stormwater transport alone planning and policy measures provide opportunities to address urban runoff and proactively implement adaptation strategies for the future because climate change and the dynamics of urban areas are complex adaptation is not likely to be a simple task and will require detailed analyses across socioeconomic environmental and engineered dimensions 5 conclusions the results of our work indicate that cesm s hydrologic modeling capabilities regarding runoff are spatially robust or perform reasonably well under a range of climate conditions borgomeo et al 2018 when averaged across an annual time period cesm s simulations correlated well with unh grdc and merra 2 but there are still prominent areas where cesm struggles with both overprediction and underprediction cesm requires further work to better handle areas of high precipitation and mountainous regions particularly on shorter temporal scales since there is both overprediction and underprediction occurring in areas that have previously been noted as needing improvement the amazon basin was noted as an area with underbias when compared to both unh grdc and merra 2 and most of southeast asia the himalayas and the andes consistently had runoff overprediction occurring by cesm when compared to unh grdc and merra 2 overall cesm s modeling of grid cell level runoff is suitable when averaged over greater temporal periods yielding results largely consistent with both unh grdc and merra 2 however correlation coefficient analysis revealed that on a month by month basis or a shorter temporal period cesm is not as strong in accurately capturing the short term temporal variability our analysis of grid cell level runoff illustrates that with the higher emissions scenarios the change in runoff in many locations increases compared to lower emissions scenarios this result implies that with more dramatic climate change more grid cell runoff will be generated globally however some areas will still experience drying while others will observe major increases in runoff the areas that will experience either drying or wetting are consistent across each scenario with varying degrees of intensity dependent upon the scenario our analysis of future weighted urban runoff shows that similar to grid cell level runoff future urban hydroclimatic conditions will vary depending on the level of intensity of climate change and location as with the grid cell runoff analysis the changes in urban runoff in almost all locations in the higher emissions scenarios increase when compared to lower emissions scenarios with higher emissions scenarios global urban runoff is predicted to increase overall however some urban areas will likely experience extreme drying while others observe major increases in urban runoff cesm also indicates that the tall building district tbd produces the most runoff of the urban density classes implying that cities with an existing or expanding tbd class component are likely to be higher producers of runoff regardless of scenario the results of this study indicate that cesm modeled runoff averaged annually over the calendar year is robust and can provide key insight in future projections of runoff additionally through the analysis of future grid cell level runoff and urban runoff the importance of climate strategy implementation becomes apparent as each future scenario s grid cell level runoff and urban runoff changes varied depending on the development pathway taken this finding reinforces the notion that current governance responses to climate change will dramatically impact both what earth s climate will look like by the middle of the century and how humans will respond to a changing world credit authorship contribution statement laura c gray collected and analyzed data implemented the model performed the validation contributed to writing lei zhao

2018,climate models consistently project that frequency severity and duration of hydroclimatic extremes will increase over this century under climate change urban flooding and runoff in general have become prominent issues for many cities and regions arising from a combination of altered precipitation patterns urban growth development in floodplains and increases in impervious surfaces in this study we first validate total grid cell level runoff from the fully coupled community earth system model cesm historical simulations against one observed runoff streamflow based dataset and one reanalysis dataset and further analyze both grid cell level runoff and urban subgrid runoff under future climate change scenarios we calculated global annual average of monthly runoff from the period 1986 1995 for the validation and calculated bias and correlation coefficients between cesm and each of the datasets additionally we analyzed future grid cell and urban runoff across three cmip6 coupled shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways 2 4 5 3 7 0 and 5 8 5 and evaluated changes between the future period of 2041 2050 and the same past period of 1986 1995 for each scenario results show spatial consistency and robustness between the cesm simulations and both datasets however there is some spatial inconsistency in the areas highlighted as major runoff producers such as the amazon basin and southeast asia as well as mountainous regions outside the united states grid cell level runoff and urban runoff projections suggest that future hydroclimatic conditions will vary depending on the climate scenario however certain locations such as madagascar indonesia and the himalayan mountain range consistently see decreases in both grid cell level runoff and urban runoff across all scenarios and locations such as nigeria and ecuador consistently see increases in both grid cell runoff and urban runoff across all scenarios our findings provide quantitative insights on hydrology representation in the global earth system model and advance the understanding of the impacts of large scale climate change on future local scale urban runoff

deaths and economic losses occurring due to flash floods than any other extreme weather hazard yin et al 2018 due to climate change and anthropogenic effects flash floods attributed to storm runoff extremes are projected to become more frequent and damaging yin et al 2018 global mean temperature increases have a drastic impact on the global hydrologic cycle across spatial and temporal scales labat et al 2004 barlage et al 2002 as global warming intensifies the hydrologic cycle global continental runoff increases due to more intense evaporation over oceans increases in continental precipitation and decreases in continental evaporation labat et al 2004 anthropogenic changes cause global increases in extreme events particularly stormwater runoff responses due to warming combined with land cover changes and land and water management yin et al 2018 land surface conditions play a major role in runoff generation with impervious concrete surfaces found in cities generating runoff quicker and in greater quantities than pervious land cover common to vegetated areas due to the loss of pervious surface a symptom common to urbanization the infiltration of rainwater into the soil is decreased which in turn leads to issues involving increased runoff and in more extreme cases increased urban flooding liu et al 2020 because runoff responses are proven to track with anthropogenic changes particularly in urban areas runoff is an important parameter to account for within global climate modeling and in urban studies however uncertainty surrounding runoff projections in climate modeling is high lehner et al 2019 emphasizing the need for validation of runoff against ground truth datasets according to the united nations the world s urban population is expected to increase from 55 to 68 by 2050 and in north america alone 82 of the population already lives in the urban environment united nations 2019 in the united states city infrastructure is continuing to age and the 2021 report from the american society of civil engineers assigned u s infrastructure an overall grade of c or mediocre needs attention american society of civil engineers 2021b a most infrastructure shows general signs of deterioration with some elements showing major deficiencies in functionality and increasing vulnerability to risk american society of civil engineers 2021b stormwater infrastructure received a grade of d with the report citing an annual 8 billion in federal funding needed to bring current stormwater infrastructure up to standard american society of civil engineers 2021c more people are moving from rural to urban areas further stressing cities and creating a variety of challenges urban environments are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts zhao 2018 zhao et al 2018 cutter et al 2014 zheng et al 2021a zhao et al 2021 infrastructures are especially at risk from hydroclimatic extremes associated with climate change if they are stressed by age demand or are located near coastlines storm tracks rivers and arid areas of vegetation wilbanks and fernandez 2014 urban flooding has become a prominent issue for many cities arising from a combination of altered precipitation patterns urban growth development in floodplains and increases in impervious surfaces ashley et al 2005 climate models consistently project that frequency severity and duration of these extremes will increase markedly over this century under climate change horton et al 2016 ipcc 2014 there is a pressing need to advance fundamental understanding of how climate adaptation strategies deliver hydroclimatic benefits for cities under climate change coupled with urban development zhao 2018 krayenhoff et al 2018 however there is still uncertainty in accurately representing the hydrologic cycle in earth system models esms and global climate models gcms validation of hydrologic variables such as runoff modeled by the state of the art climate models provides an opportunity to gain insight for their improvement in representing hydrologic processes and the benchmark of the uncertainty in models future hydroclimatic projections more importantly most previous efforts to examine runoff have studied regional or non urban runoff rather than runoff in urban areas specifically niu et al 2005 xia et al 2012 oleson et al 2008b because the current esms or gcms almost universally lack a physical representation of urban areas zhao et al 2021 all these challenges highlight a critical need for urban specific hydrologic analysis in recent years more studies have started to acknowledge urban runoff particularly as awareness of urbanization s impact on the hydrologic cycle grows multiple studies link runoff with urban flooding and define urban flooding in part as a result of surface runoff over the city area kc et al 2021 li et al 2021 browne et al 2021 fang et al 2020 similar to the analysis presented here several recent studies have used representative concentration pathways rcps of future greenhouse gas emissions kiprotich et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 andimuthu et al 2019 or shared socioeconomic pathways ssps fang et al 2020 to drive their modeling of the hydrologic cycle and runoff in urban areas additionally both statistical modeling butcher et al 2021 andimuthu et al 2019 such as the use of intensity duration frequency idf curves and process based modeling approaches yang et al 2020 kc et al 2021 browne et al 2021 kiprotich et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 such as the use of climate models or hydrologic models have been used to represent runoff however the scale for these studies remains confined to specific weather stations butcher et al 2021 urban areas yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 kc et al 2021 browne et al 2021 andimuthu et al 2019 moghadas et al 2018 or watersheds including official metropolitan areas kiprotich et al 2021 several studies simulated runoff for historical periods yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 browne et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 while the others simulated both a historical period and future scenarios into the 2080s and 2090s butcher et al 2021 kc et al 2021 kiprotich et al 2021 andimuthu et al 2019 most of the studies reviewed here mention that their results can be applied to urban planning and stormwater management yang et al 2020 kc et al 2021 browne et al 2021 kiprotich et al 2021 moghadas et al 2018 andimuthu et al 2019 while the others focus on how their results can be used to improve future hydrologic modeling butcher et al 2021 li et al 2021 research on urban specific runoff on a large scale is thus necessary providing a key motivation of this study in this study we evaluate the total grid cell level runoff output variable q r u n o f f from the community earth system model cesm coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 historical simulation runoff was analyzed because it represents a key hydrologic variable associated with human intervention and stormwater infrastructure previous studies have used large scale climate model projections of meteorological variables and downscaled to a watershed or basin scale using regional climate or hydrologic models shamir et al 2019 chen et al 2019 wu et al 2019 liu et al 2008 dibike and coulibaly 2005 this is a commonly used approach over limited regions at small scales due to its high computational cost to our knowledge there has not been an effort to evaluate cesm s total and urban runoff at the global scale previous studies have examined region specific subsurface runoff and total runoff from cesm xu and di vittorio 2021 wrzesien and pavelsky 2020 and others have used cesm s runoff output jahfer et al 2020 kooperman et al 2018 but not on a global scale we evaluated cesm cmip6 simulation against two observational based datasets the university of new hampshire global runoff data centre unh grdc dataset fekete et al 2002 and the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 dataset global modeling and assimilation office gmao 2015 by validating the hydrologic component of total runoff of cesm we provide insight into potential improvements in representing runoff and better understand the benchmark of runoff uncertainty in cesm s future hydroclimatic projections we then examine both the grid cell level runoff and the urban subgrid runoff predicted by cesm under three climate change scenarios of cmip6 to determine how climate change likely impacts both in the future each scenario represents a different level of mitigation and adaptation action taken and provides valuable information about potential future hydroclimatic changes in this study we only examine monthly averages of runoff to provide insight about cesm s modeling capability and larger urban hydrology trends due to the lack of short time scale daily or hourly runoff data from the official cesm cmip6 simulations however we do acknowledge the need to analyze finer scale storm events to inform stormwater management and call for future studies at very fine time resolutions the three objectives of this study were 1 to validate the cesm s modeled runoff against two observational based datasets to determine spatial and temporal accuracy of historical runoff simulations 2 to observe the total runoff changes associated with different climate change scenarios and 3 to examine the future urban specific runoff effects under various climate change scenarios to understand how large scale climate change impacts local scale urban runoff 2 methodology 2 1 cesm and simulations the community earth system model cesm danabasoglu et al 2020 is a fully coupled global scale climate model and is one of the models that participates in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 eyring et al 2016 it is hosted at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in conjunction with researchers in the earth system science community hurrell et al 2013 cesm synthesizes physical chemical and biological processes in the earth system and has seven major components that communicate through a coupler the atmosphere land land ice ocean sea ice river and wave model hurrell et al 2013 danabasoglu et al 2020 the land component of cesm is known as the community terrestrial systems model ctsm and formerly was known as the community land model clm ctsm focuses mainly on how terrestrial ecosystems and their various biological chemical and physical processes can affect climate and also be affected by climate grid cells in ctsm are composed of the five land units vegetated glacier crop lake and urban ctsm is of particular interest because it allows for direct study of how humans can affect global environmental change ctsm has been widely evaluated against both in situ and remote sensing observations around the globe oleson et al 2008a zhao et al 2014 demuzere et al 2017 the urban parameterization scheme embedded in ctsm clmu simulates local urban climate as an operational component of a global climate model oleson and feddema 2019 it models the radiation energy water and mass transfer between land and the lower atmosphere in urban environments oleson and feddema 2019 more details on how ctsm and clmu simulate the subsurface land atmosphere hydrologic processes can be found in lawrence et al 2018 and oleson et al 2008a respectively we used two sets of the official already completed cmip6 simulations for the purpose of this study the historical run for model validation and the future scenariomip runs o neill et al 2016 for examining future urban runoff the major reason that we chose cmip6 simulations is that these are open access community use simulations and are among those used by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc for climate assessments ipcc 2014 masson delmotte et al 2021 the entire historical run is from 1850 to 2014 and future runs are from 2015 to 2100 under multiple rcp ssp scenarios all these simulations are fully coupled runs and at a spatial resolution of 0 9424 latitude 1 25 longitude for model setup cesm2 0 with clm5 0 embedded including the urban parameterization scheme was used all the simulation results can be accessed from the official cmip6 archive https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 or the ncar climate data gateway https www earthsystemgrid org 2 2 clmu and urban runoff grid cells in ctsm are composed of five subgrid units or land units vegetated glacier crop lake and urban each grid cell area is composed of different percentages of each land unit the model computes outputs for each subgrid and its allocated area and for some output variables will then complete an area weighted average across the whole grid cell for the purposes of this study we were specifically interested in the urban component of ctsm currently cesm is the only model with an urban land parameterization as part of its land model detailed enough for the purposes of this study zhao et al 2021 zheng et al 2021b embedded within clmu is a global urban surface dataset developed for global climate modeling which provides information on present day urban extent and properties for every grid cell containing an urban subgrid land unit information provided includes thermal radiative and morphological characteristics of urban areas zhao et al 2021 in the most recent update to clmu the urban land unit has been expanded to include three urban density classes known as tall building district tbd high density hd and medium density md oleson and feddema 2019 tbd represents an area of at least 1 km2 with buildings that are greater than or equal to ten stories tall and a very small pervious area typically 5 10 of the planned area hd represents industrial commercial or residential buildings that are three to ten stories tall and have a pervious fraction that falls between 5 25 md represents row houses or apartments that are one to three stories tall and have a higher pervious fraction ranging between 20 60 oleson and feddema 2019 each of these density classes operate independently in the grid cell oleson and feddema 2019 clmu s urban scheme is based on an urban canyon conceptual structure that is comprised of roof wall sunlit and shaded and canyon floor pervious and impervious facets oleson et al 2010 sufficient biophysical and hydrological processes are captured over these facets oleson et al 2010 oleson and feddema 2019 for example the pervious floor represents any surface that infiltrates water liquid water is allowed to pond on roofs and canyon floors which supports evaporation snowmelt water or water in excess of the maximum ponding depth on both roofs and floors runs off the evaporation for pervious canyon floor is parameterized by a bulk scheme in which evaporation is a function of the wetness of the entire soil column and water is removed from each soil layer a surface input dataset prescribing the thermal radiative morphological and hydrological characteristics of these facets for each grid cell in cesm is determined by satellite derived data jackson et al 2010 one major limitation of clmu is that the urban extent and properties are static at this time urbanization effects and urban expansion are not represented in these climate simulations however urban expansion effects on grid cell means are likely minimal due to the small fraction 2 of urban areas on the earth s surface even within grid cells housing larger cities zhao et al 2021 the nested hierarchy of subgrids for ctsm is shown in fig 1 with a particular focus on the urban hierarchy 2 3 validation of runoff modeling in cesm it would be ideal to directly validate the cesm modeled urban runoff against urban specific observations however urban runoff observations are extremely sparse essentially unattainable at the global scale therefore in this study we compare the grid cell mean runoff with the observational based datasets to evaluate the hydrology represented in cesm because the water balance and cycling are closely tracked in each landscape including the urban unit in the model oleson et al 2008a our evaluation even in the absence of measured runoff data at a global scale can provide indicative information and confidence in cesm s urban hydrologic modeling additionally grid level runoff itself is an important parameter to evaluate and can provide insight into the general state of the global hydrologic balance 2 3 1 dataset information the unh grdc dataset provided composite runoff synthesizing ground based runoff observations and a water balance model fekete et al 2002 while the merra 2 dataset provided total runoff including throughflow from a satellite model data assimilation system global modeling and assimilation office gmao 2015 pure observational runoff data at the global scale are often unavailable and we address this challenge by using two different datasets for validation despite the modeling component involved in each for the purposes of this analysis we evaluated the cmip6 historical simulation against the unh grdc dataset and the merra 2 dataset a summary of key parameters from each of the sources is provided in table 1 and more information on each can be found in the supplemental information section 2 3 2 model validation our first task was to aggregate the unh grdc and merra 2 datasets from their respective resolutions of 0 5 latitude 0 5 longitude and 0 5 latitude 0 625 longitude to the same degree system as the cesm simulations 0 9424 1 25 resolution to ensure appropriate and compatible comparison across the three datasets all the data processing was conducted using r in the ncar s high performance computing hpc cluster cheyenne we chose the ten year historical period of 1986 1995 covered in unh grdc as the period of focus for validation due to the need to validate the model with primarily observational data we calculated the monthly average for each calendar year of runoff across the 10 year period for each dataset we first calculated monthly averages of runoff for each grid cell further averaged those values over an annual basis and then calculated the mean across the 10 years this process was completed for all three datasets to determine the annual monthly average of runoff from 1986 1995 after calculating the annual monthly average of runoff from 1986 1995 we compared the annual monthly average from the cesm simulations against unh grdc and merra 2 to calculate bias at each grid cell indicating that bias was calculated for a variety of conditions and locations across the globe positive values in global bias indicated that cesm overestimated runoff compared to unh grdc or merra 2 while negative values indicated cesm underestimated runoff with respect to either unh grdc or merra 2 we generated basic summary statistics for both sets of global bias including global mean difference standard deviation and root mean square error calculated across the values in every grid cell two sets of these calculations were completed one for unh grdc versus cesm set of global bias and one for merra 2 versus cesm set of global bias for the final task in the validation process we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient across the 120 months in the 10 year period for each grid cell to determine the strength of the model on capturing temporal variation hereafter when we use the phrase correlation coefficient we are referring to the pearson correlation coefficient 2 4 future grid and urban subgrid runoff analysis after completing the validation of cesm s cmip6 historical simulation we analyzed how both total grid cell mean and urban subgrid runoff are projected to change in the future under different climate change scenarios for the purposes of this study three different future scenarios of cmip6 were examined ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 each future projection involved a shared socioeconomic pathway ssp and a representative concentration pathway rcp van vuuren et al 2011 ssp2 4 5 represents a middle of the road mitigated scenario with medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation with 4 5 wm 2 climate forcing by the end of the century ssp3 7 0 represents a regional rivalry scenario with high challenges to mitigation and adaptation with 7 0 wm 2 climate forcing ssp5 8 5 represents a fossil fueled development scenario with 8 5 wm 2 climate forcing where fossil fuels continue to be the dominant energy source o neill et al 2016 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 all contain projections for 2015 2100 an area weighted average of runoff was calculated across three different building densities tall building district tbd high density hd and medium density md note that the urban surface property data in clmu are static zhao et al 2021 thus implying that the urban water resources system itself is also static to determine grid cell runoff and urban runoff change for each scenario we again used the 1986 1995 period representing the past climate and 2041 2050 representing the future projected middle of the century climates we averaged the weighted monthly total and urban runoff across each grid cell for the past and future period for each scenario after calculating the averages for the past and future periods for each of the three scenarios the present period was subtracted from the future period for each scenario to quantify the change of average urban runoff if the difference for a grid cell was positive the average urban runoff is projected to increase under that scenario and if negative the average urban runoff is projected to decrease under that scenario for that location it was predicted that the higher emissions scenarios would have an average positive difference since literature implies that climate change intensifies the hydrologic cycle although intensification does not always lead to increased runoff labat et al 2004 in addition to examining the difference between the future and present scenarios we analyzed the impacts of built morphology on urban runoff only major metropolitan centers have a tbd density class associated with the city which meant that there were fewer grid cells that were utilized in the density analysis the md density class runoff average was subtracted from the tbd density class with positive difference values indicating that tbd produces more runoff and negative difference values indicating that md produces more runoff this calculation was completed for both the future and past climatic conditions for each scenario 3 results 3 1 runoff validation 3 1 1 annual average monthly runoff bias fig 2 a shows the annual average monthly bias between the cesm historical simulation and unh grdc for the 10 year period the annual monthly average of the runoff values were calculated via averaging runoff for each grid cell across the months of each calendar year in the 10 year period and then the 10 year averages were averaged to create an annual monthly average for both cesm and unh grdc the unh grdc average values of runoff were subtracted from the cesm average values to create the bias figure with positive values indicating an overbias from cesm and negative values indicating an underbias in general cesm reproduces both the magnitude and spatial variation of the observed runoff reasonably well notable areas of underbias are the amazon basin guatemala and the bangladesh myanmar border near the indian ocean which note underprediction values ranging from 100 200 mm month overbias can consistently be seen for prominent global mountain ranges such as the andes and the himalayas with a few locations in the himalayas showing close to 400 mm month overprediction and closer to the 200 300 mm month overprediction range in the andes suggesting topography induced bias errors in the simulated hydrology of cesm a slight overbias can also be observed in southeast asia particularly in indonesia ranging from 100 200 mm month overprediction the calculated global mean bias value for this comparison was a difference of 5 86 27 87 mm month mean and standard deviation calculated spatially over each cell for the entire earth and a root mean square error of 28 48 mm month cesm s global grid cell mean was 22 86 mm month and unh grdc s was 21 7 mm month a slight difference similar to fig 2 a fig 2 b illustrates the annual average monthly bias between the cesm historical simulation and merra 2 for the 10 year period for fig 2 b the merra 2 average values calculated in the same way as unh grdc and cesm were subtracted from the cesm average values with relation to merra 2 there is a more prominent overbias in southeast asia from cesm ranging from 100 300 mm month overprediction and the overbias from the andes and the himalayas is even more prevalent with more of the himalayas having close to 400 mm month overpredicted and more of the andes being in the 200 300 mm month overprediction range compared to the cesm and unh grdc comparison there are still pockets of underbias in the amazon basin but they are not as pronounced as in fig 2 a closer to the 0 100 mm month underprediction range the calculated global mean bias value for this comparison was a difference of 17 38 38 04 mm month mean and standard deviation calculated spatially over each cell for the entire earth and a root mean square error of 41 82 mm month merra 2 s global grid cell mean was 15 86 mm month a more pronounced difference from cesm s than unh grdc s the annual average bias shows spatial consistency between the cesm simulations and both the unh grdc composite runoff data and the merra 2 reanalysis data comparison between cesm and merra 2 suggests that cesm tends to calculate higher runoff values than does merra 2 as evidenced by the average global mean bias 17 38 mm month as well as the difference in each set s 95 confidence interval comparison between cesm and unh grdc suggests more consistency in runoff values between the two also evidenced by the average global mean bias 5 86 mm month and each set s 95 confidence interval but notes more underpredictions of runoff both comparisons showed there is a spatial inconsistency in the areas highlighted as major runoff producers namely the amazon basin and much of southeast asia both datasets note that cesm underestimates runoff in the amazon and overestimates runoff in southeast asia both comparisons also indicate an overbias as high as 400 mm month from cesm in the mountainous regions outside of the united states fig 3 illustrates the global runoff by month for each of the three datasets averaged over the 1986 1995 period similar to the bias analysis fig 3 indicates that merra 2 has a tendency to underpredict runoff compared to cesm fig 3 also shows that unh grdc and cesm track more closely with each other although cesm does slightly underpredict when compared with grdc both grdc and merra 2 place the global average peak of runoff as occurring in june while cesm places it in july the similarity of each curve does provide evidence that cesm is able to capture global average runoff seasonality 3 1 2 temporal variability the correlation coefficient values between cesm and unh grdc shown in fig 4 a range between 1 and 1 with no visibly apparent spatial pattern this lack of pattern suggests that cesm does not predict runoff values well for smaller temporal periods such as on a monthly basis particularly since many of the values are closer to zero indicating no or slight correlation for those grid cells across the 120 months only 1159 of the full 11 343 non na grid cells or 10 2 have values of 0 7 or higher meaning only 10 2 of the grid cells have a strong positive relationship across the 120 months additionally grid cells in northern africa the middle east parts of the united states and the eastern part of australia appear to be missing values because of a large number of missing na values in the unh grdc dataset the unh grdc dataset provided runoff values where data were available for that month and that particular year but was not able to provide a fully comprehensive record similar to fig 4 a the correlation coefficient values between cesm and merra 2 shown in fig 4 b do not have an apparent pattern and vary widely between 1 and 1 only 950 values of the 14 447 non na grid cells or 6 58 have values of 0 7 or higher even less than the evaluation between cesm and unh grdc this further suggests that cesm does not do well in its prediction of runoff values for smaller temporal periods but rather is more accurate with temporal averaging since merra 2 is not strictly an observational dataset and is heavily reliant on computation for its data it does not have the missing values issue that unh grdc does 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of future total runoff change for the next part of the analysis we examined grid cell level runoff change under three future climate change scenarios changes in grid cell runoff depended on the area of the world with some regions projected to get wetter i e increases in grid cell runoff compared to the past climate while some regions are projected to get drier i e decreases in grid cell runoff compared to the past climate as shown in fig 5 it should be noted that the changes in grid cell runoff are consistent across all scenarios although to varying degrees of intensity depending on the scenario across all scenarios grid cell runoff decreases through the majority of south america although most notably in the andes mountain range and parts of brazil and chile in ssp2 4 5 these decreases range from 30 60 mm month 30 45 mm month in ssp3 7 0 and 30 55 mm month in ssp 5 8 5 it also consistently decreases in madagascar parts of indonesia and in the himalayan mountain range in ssp2 4 5 these decreases range from 30 40 mm month 40 mm month for ssp 3 7 0 and from 20 42 mm month in ssp5 8 5 conversely consistent increases in runoff can be seen in northern brazil the coast of ecuador and columbia nigeria myanmar papua new guinea parts of north australia in ssp2 4 5 parts of china and the philippines in ssp2 4 5 notable increases in runoff in these areas range from 40 80 mm month 30 70 mm month for ssp3 7 0 and 40 80 mm month in ssp5 8 5 the increase in grid cell runoff globally can be best observed through ssp5 8 5 where the increases in grid cell runoff are larger and the decreases in runoff in most areas are less pronounced than in previous scenarios 3 3 spatiotemporal variations of urban runoff change for the final part of the analysis we examined urban runoff change under three future climate change scenarios similarly to changes in grid cell level runoff changes in urban subgrid runoff depended on the area of the world and the scenario as shown in fig 6 also similarly to the grid cell level runoff analysis it should be noted that the changes in urban runoff are consistent across all scenarios although to varying degrees of intensity depending on the scenario across all scenarios runoff decreases in urban areas in southern brazil east madagascar parts of indonesia and the himalayan mountain range in ssp2 4 5 these prominent decreases range from 30 50 mm month from 30 45 mm month in ssp3 7 0 and from 10 35 mm month in ssp5 8 5 additionally in ssp5 8 5 there are prominent decreases in parts of china thailand and vietnam around 25 mm month conversely across all scenarios urban runoff notably increases in parts of peru and ecuador nigeria bangladesh burma and papau new guinea these increases range from 30 70 mm month in ssp2 4 5 from 30 60 mm month in ssp3 7 0 and from 40 70 mm month in ssp5 8 5 leveraging the different density classes represented in clmu we further examined the impacts of urban morphology on the modeled urban runoff figs 7 and 8 illustrate that tbd always produces higher amounts of runoff than the smaller urban density class md regardless of time period or scenario likely due to the high amount of impervious surface attributed to the tbd class and the lower percentage of impervious surfaces associated with the md class this effect of morphology on urban runoff is also consistent with previous findings us epa 2008 2021 4 discussion one of the main challenges we faced in this study was the lack of observational runoff data both of the datasets used for validation involved a synthesis of observational data and model data whereas the ideal validation would have been completed against purely observational data available at a global scale however this is infeasible since the majority of the world s watersheds are ungauged runoff assessment must then be completed through analysis of other hydrologic variables or morphometric characteristics both methods used in past hydrologic studies as stressed in the hydrologic initiative predictions in ungauged basins pub from the international association of hydrological sciences iahs hrachowitz et al 2013 our results articulate a need for standardized ground truthed runoff data collection beyond streamflow gauging additionally a standardized definition of runoff is needed within the scientific community we attempted to find as compatible datasets as possible but the definitions of runoff for each set are slightly different and use different verbiage total runoff grid cell level in cesm was defined as the combination of surface runoff and subsurface runoff national center for atmospheric research 2020 while runoff from unh grdc was based heavily on surface observations with gaps being filled in with the water balance model fekete et al 2002 runoff from merra 2 was defined as surface runoff plus throughflow which is not defined in the nasa documentation but in other sources is noted to be lateral soil water flow band et al 1993 gelaro et al 2017 although throughflow and subsurface runoff are very similar their verbiage is not yet used interchangeably and cesm s definition of subsurface runoff accounts for several factors beyond lateral soil water flow a similar subsurface component is not explicitly included in unh grdc however in the water balance model used to develop unh grdc soil information and properties are included indicating that some consideration of subsurface runoff hydrology is incorporated particularly since unh grdc describes itself as a dataset of terrestrial runoff fekete et al 2002 additionally the bias analysis results from cesm led us to reflect on the location based or geographic biases in earth systems models notably cesm over predicted runoff at prominent world mountain ranges as well as in southeast asia and under predicted runoff in the amazon basin however this same mountainous bias did not appear in the rocky mountains in north america despite prior studies indicating that cesm struggles with runoff in regions with frozen soils oleson et al 2008b there have been more studies comparing actual catchments to hydrologic models completed in europe and north america teutschbein and seibert 2010 and the use of regional climate models in downscaling global climate projections has been established to be biased to the observed climatology of a given region muerth et al 2013 we compared the average grid cell topography i e altitude with both sets of bias results demonstrate a generally larger but inconsistent bias in areas of higher altitude fig s3 suggesting a topography induced representation issue in cesm the large vertical spread in each point shown in fig s3 indicates the influences of other factors on the model bias because the observational record is extensive in the united states and thereby cesm could be better parameterized and or constrained in the united states region the results suggest that there could be geographic bias in the hydrology of the model previous versions of cesm have also struggled with predicting runoff in the amazon basin noting insufficient precipitation from the atmospheric component of cesm exacerbation by unrealistic partitioning of evapotranspiration and deficiencies in runoff and soil water storage as the main reasons oleson et al 2008b additionally other studies completed on cmip6 s predicted precipitation notes bias in similar areas noted here such as southeast asia and equatorial amazonia tian and dong 2020 dong and dong 2021 because the amazon is highlighted as overpredicting runoff both against unh grdc and merra 2 this bias leads to questions regarding how much the model has improved in terms of hydrology for regions such as the amazon basin with high precipitation and high amounts of green cover although spatial consistency and robustness between total runoff from cesm and the two datasets are demonstrated there is still considerable uncertainty in total runoff simulations because there is a lack of urban specific runoff observations to constrain the model parameterization on urban hydrology the model likely has larger uncertainty in the urban component than the total runoff we cannot provide quantitative estimates on urban runoff uncertainty due to the absent urban observations however the cesm modeled urban runoff should be within reasonable uncertainty range this is because of the water balance in the model the total runoff shows reasonable agreement with observations based on the results described above other key variables relevant to the surface water balance such as precipitation evapotranspiration temperature humidity etc modeled by cesm have also been validated against ground based and or remote sensing observations in previous studies oleson et al 2008a zhao et al 2014 demuzere et al 2017 therefore the forced water balance in cesm would impose constraints on the estimated urban runoff our analysis of urban runoff across the three scenarios suggests that future hydrologic conditions in urban areas depend on the extent of implementation of strategies used to combat climate change even in the scenario that represents high mitigation and adaptation ssp 2 4 5 urban runoff is projected to increase in many areas globally very few locations remain consistent when compared with present conditions suggesting flooding potential cities should be aware that even with climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies in place the hydrologic conditions of their municipality are likely going to change into the midcentury and should plan accordingly the results of this study also corroborate previous findings indicating that with higher percentages of impervious surface more runoff is likely to be produced us epa 2021 the results particularly indicate that tbd and likely hd density classes present in cities will produce greater quantities of urban runoff in both the present climate as well as future climate conditions regardless of scenario this result is concerning as urbanization continues to rise worldwide especially with projections that by 2050 the majority of the world s population will be residing in urban areas united nations 2019 only very large cities have a tbd class component in cesm but more of the world s cities have an hd component and even the md component common to most cities in the model will likely produce more runoff than would be produced by the natural land cover this conclusion has important implications for urban planning and stormwater management constructing larger taller buildings especially in close relation to one another might not be the best strategy as the increased surface area on those buildings will likely generate more urban runoff however this issue becomes difficult with the push for greater urban densification to prevent sprawl and also achieve a more energy efficient environment samuelsson et al 2021 haaland and van den bosch 2015 based on the results presented here urban runoff in cities is already an issue with more runoff being generated by buildings with more impervious surfaces and is only going to worsen under climate change stormwater infrastructure across the united states is in poor condition american society of civil engineers 2021c and the prevalence of underperforming grey stormwater infrastructure in many cities worsens conditions measuring urban runoff and stormwater management within cities is challenging partially due to the presence of combined or separated sewer systems which in cities like chicago u s are not a source of runoff typically accounted for or measured zhu et al 2016 there is a need for better and more standardized monitoring of runoff within urban areas specifically for urban runoff observations in general and for monitoring that captures multiple aspects of runoff not just surface flow that directly flows into nearby bodies of water additionally stormwater infrastructure in general is in desperate need of update and reform which provides an opportunity to utilize solutions that are nature based or that provide more services than stormwater transport alone planning and policy measures provide opportunities to address urban runoff and proactively implement adaptation strategies for the future because climate change and the dynamics of urban areas are complex adaptation is not likely to be a simple task and will require detailed analyses across socioeconomic environmental and engineered dimensions 5 conclusions the results of our work indicate that cesm s hydrologic modeling capabilities regarding runoff are spatially robust or perform reasonably well under a range of climate conditions borgomeo et al 2018 when averaged across an annual time period cesm s simulations correlated well with unh grdc and merra 2 but there are still prominent areas where cesm struggles with both overprediction and underprediction cesm requires further work to better handle areas of high precipitation and mountainous regions particularly on shorter temporal scales since there is both overprediction and underprediction occurring in areas that have previously been noted as needing improvement the amazon basin was noted as an area with underbias when compared to both unh grdc and merra 2 and most of southeast asia the himalayas and the andes consistently had runoff overprediction occurring by cesm when compared to unh grdc and merra 2 overall cesm s modeling of grid cell level runoff is suitable when averaged over greater temporal periods yielding results largely consistent with both unh grdc and merra 2 however correlation coefficient analysis revealed that on a month by month basis or a shorter temporal period cesm is not as strong in accurately capturing the short term temporal variability our analysis of grid cell level runoff illustrates that with the higher emissions scenarios the change in runoff in many locations increases compared to lower emissions scenarios this result implies that with more dramatic climate change more grid cell runoff will be generated globally however some areas will still experience drying while others will observe major increases in runoff the areas that will experience either drying or wetting are consistent across each scenario with varying degrees of intensity dependent upon the scenario our analysis of future weighted urban runoff shows that similar to grid cell level runoff future urban hydroclimatic conditions will vary depending on the level of intensity of climate change and location as with the grid cell runoff analysis the changes in urban runoff in almost all locations in the higher emissions scenarios increase when compared to lower emissions scenarios with higher emissions scenarios global urban runoff is predicted to increase overall however some urban areas will likely experience extreme drying while others observe major increases in urban runoff cesm also indicates that the tall building district tbd produces the most runoff of the urban density classes implying that cities with an existing or expanding tbd class component are likely to be higher producers of runoff regardless of scenario the results of this study indicate that cesm modeled runoff averaged annually over the calendar year is robust and can provide key insight in future projections of runoff additionally through the analysis of future grid cell level runoff and urban runoff the importance of climate strategy implementation becomes apparent as each future scenario s grid cell level runoff and urban runoff changes varied depending on the development pathway taken this finding reinforces the notion that current governance responses to climate change will dramatically impact both what earth s climate will look like by the middle of the century and how humans will respond to a changing world credit authorship contribution statement laura c gray collected and analyzed data implemented the model performed the validation contributed to writing lei zhao

2019,proximity to rivers and flat areas are two of the main factors that determine the location of human settlements despite empirical relationships between human settlements river dynamics and the corresponding landforms the underlying mechanism remains speculative here we present the first millennium scale quantitative temporal analysis of human population dynamics and its relationship with river location and landforms in imperial china across four dynasties han 2 ce tang 742 ce song 1102 ce and ming 1522 ce over the last 2000 years our results show less human reliance measured by the number of people living close to a water course on rivers for people living in lowland areas which we interpret to be related to flood risk and the availability of groundwater from alluvial aquifers distant from rivers used for agriculture conversely people living in mountainous and hilly areas appear to have a stronger reliance on rivers in imperial china specifically behind the strong variations of human river relation across millennia we infer a general principle highlighting the role of landforms in human river interactions these results shed light on how geomorphology shape settlement and urban patterns with important implications for sustainable lifeways in riverine environments keywords human settlement reliance on rivers landforms population migration imperial china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction near river regions are generally considered to be good locations for human settlements as they offer access to water resources and agricultural cultivation and in the modern world opportunities to connect with ecological corridors fang et al 2018 zingraff hamed et al 2021 anderson et al 2019 to a large extent historical and prehistoric growth of riverine communities are consistent with this perception macklin and lewin 2015 with great ancient potamic civilizations of china egypt india pakistan and iraq developing along major rivers however humans frequently changed their settlement location as confirmed for instance by a series of massive migrations in europe and mediterranean region in early middle ages müller et al 2011 similarly in imperial china the early chinese civilization center shifted from yellow river basin to yangtze river basin between the han 2 ce to song 2 ce dynasty tackett 2018 von glahn 2016 and then northwards in ming 1522 ce dynasty because of migration durand 2011 as illustrated by the relocation in northern china of the capital city bai and jia 2019 key research questions arise does this migration change the physical spatial relationship between human settlements and their water resources what is the controlling factor in this dynamic relationship the evolution of spatial patterns between human settlements and river system have been explored yet focusing on the modern era a recent study of the distance between settlements and nearby rivers revealed that in 2007 more than 50 of the world s population lived within 3 km from surface freshwater with a higher density of population near the river networks kummu et al 2011 climate urbanization and socio economic development lead to some regional variations which are also reflected in another study based on nighttime light data from 1992 to 2013 demonstrating the increasing human concentration near rivers over time ceola et al 2015 another study showed that in the us people settled closer to major rivers before the industrial revolution but moved farther away from them afterwards because of the greater utilization of groundwater made people less reliant on rivers since industrialization fang and jawitz 2019 when extending the analysis to the millennial scale hydromorphology and catchment geomorphology appear to have shaped settlement patterns as shown by studies of the alluvial archaeological record worldwide macklin and lewin 2015 regional research showed that changes in the distribution of prehistoric human settlements in china are aligned with the geomorphic evolution of fluvial system lu et al 2017 however the limited availability of long term data constraints further exploration particularly on a quantitative basis although global and regional population datasets from the historical periods have been reconstructed klein goldewijk et al 2010 fang and jawitz 2018 voutilainen et al 2020 spatially explicit and high resolution population data over millennial time periods is scarce which limits the analysis of relationships between hydromorphology and human settlement pattern to understand the interactions and the co evolution between human settlement rivers and the geomorphic environment we presented here the first examination of long term and large scale population dynamics with respect to rivers and landforms in imperial china first we retrieved millennial length population data and territory data fig s1 during four periods 2 ce han dynasty 742 ce tang dynasty 1102 ce song dynasty and 1522 ce ming dynasty for the imperial china over the last 2000 years from the center for geographic analysis at harvard university second we selected our study area fig 1 a on the basis of the same consistent territorial area in all four dynastic periods shuo and ma 2020 wu et al 2019a yuan kang 2012 we then used the river network from hydrorivers lehner and grill 2013 and yellow river avulsion data wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2011 to define classes of euclidean distance to rivers further we combined the population and river network data to assess the population distribution in different classes of distance to rivers which results in deriving the geographic dg and human dh distance to rivers namely river attractiveness defined as the slope of the linear regression between human density and distance to rivers finally we applied landform stratification fig 1b from the world ecological facets landform classes karagulle et al 2017 and overlap with population distribution to understand how this may have influenced the relationship between rivers and population density in imperial china 2 data and methods 2 1 reconstruction of historical population data in imperial china we used the web crawler the code in the supplementary data source to acquire the population and territory data from chinaxmap https worldmap harvard edu maps chinax which offered historical map layers for china provided by the center for geographic analysis at harvard university it digitalized the territory and ancient population distribution of china in different dynasties from bielenstein 1987 who drew population maps based on national enumerations with subtotals for administrative units from han shu han dynasty 2 ce chiu t ang shu tang dynasty 742 ce sung shih song dynasty 1102 ce and ming shi lu ming dynasty 1522 ce specifically bielenstein 1987 recorded the households and individuals for each commandery and listed the numbers and names of the subordinate prefectures through a critical examination of the texts and the statistics for those prefectures that no longer exist or that have changed their names the author identified the emplacements of the ancient prefectures on a modern topographic map by each commandery then the required number of points representing towns with 35 000 people each were placed within these areas guided by the sites of the prefectures and the topography of the area to ensure the accuracy of the location the population distribution and the territory across four dynasties are shown in fig s1 the average distance between towns is around 1 km in population cluster areas supplementary data source 2 2 river network data sources for the river network data we used the hydrorivers https www hydrosheds org products hydrorivers dataset which extracted from the gridded hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 core layers at 15 arc second approximately 500 m at the equator resolution with a catchment area of at least 10 km2 or an average river flow of at least 0 1 m3 sec or both hydrorivers includes a range of attribute information such as the river length the stream order and an estimate of long term average discharge lehner and grill 2013 we extracted the river network with stream order strahler order and applied to the study area fig 1a a stream order threshold equal to 4 is selected here to delineate the river network fig 1a where river discharge is assumed to be sufficient for human water use and transportation purposes padowski and jawitz 2012 fang and jawitz 2019 our study area includes the haihe yellow huaihe yangtze southeast and pearl river basins fig 1a whose boundary is obtained from the national earth system science data center https gre geodata cn the yellow river is the mother river to the nation also known as the cradles of chinese civilization and it went through artificial avulsions many times due to various historical reasons we embed this information in our analysis by deriving the avulsion data in each dynasty across the study period from chinaxmap https worldmap harvard edu maps chinax 2 3 topographic data sources for the landform data we used the world ecological facets landform classes https www arcgis com home item html id cd817a746aa7437cbd72a6d39cdb4559 provided by esri and identified large recognizable features such as plains hills mountains and tablelands i e plateau as shown in fig 1b for each dynasty we overlap the landform type with the capital location to identify the capital location and the corresponding landform the capitals in han and tang located in plain areas within the in yellow river basin chang an and then moved to southern china lin an in mountainous areas across the southeast river basins during the song dynasty the capital was firstly founded in nanjing yangtze river basin in ming dynasty but then moved to beijing the capital in contemporary china across plain areas within the haihe river basin and the relocation of capitals also greatly influence population distribution in ming dynasty the transition of capitals reflected the political and socio economic center transfer in imperial china across 2000 years furthermore to identify floodplain areas and then further explore the population distribution pattern therein the gfplain250m dataset a global dataset of earth s floodplains at 250 m resolution was employed nardi et al 2019 2 4 geographic versus human distance to rivers analysis we firstly extracted the river network with stream orders 4 in study area and converted it to a raster format with 1 km resolution next we calculated the geographic euclidean distance from any grid cell classified as land to the closest river for each dynasty at least 92 of the study area was within 50 km of a river so we classified the distance into 51 classes 1 km wide fig s2 and table s1 we identified the geographic distance to the river dg as 50 of the cumulative land area fig 2 b then we overlaid population data in each class of land distance to water computed the relative percentage and identified the human distance to a river dh as 50 of the cumulative population fig 2b the ratio between dh and dg is used to indicate if people live closer to dh dg 1 or farther from dh dg 1 rivers kummu et al 2011 fang and jawitz 2019 this methodology was applied both to the whole study area and to each river basin separately to identify how geomorphology can control and drive different patterns of geographic and human distance to rivers we integrated our analysis by using different stratification of landforms and calculating the relative land area and population in each category 2 5 human reliance on rivers we computed the normalized population density by generalizing the population density persons km 2 of the study area to the range 0 1 based on min max feature scaling and the equation is the following 1 x x x min x max x min we selected the minimum and maximum value based on the population distribution across four dynasties and then analyzed how normalized population density in different dynasties varies as a function of distance to rivers we performed a linear regression and used the slope km 1 as an indicator of human reliance on rivers the positive negative trend indicates a relatively smaller larger reliance on rivers with r2 and p value being tested human reliance on rivers is assessed both across the whole study area and within each river basin also here the role of landforms was assessed by considering the temporal evolution of population distribution in different landforms and comparing with the human reliance on rivers across four dynasties 3 results and discussion 3 1 landforms shape the interaction between rivers and human settlement patterns to investigate human reliance on rivers and its dynamics in imperial china we first assessed the spatial and temporal distribution of population as influenced by the geographical location of rivers from the relative distribution of population as perh in table s2 within 50 km from rivers we computed the human distance to rivers dh which represents the distance for 50 of the cumulative population fig 2a for han dynasty 2 ce and fig s2 for the remaining three dynasties to establish if people live close to or far from rivers we also need to compare human distance to rivers dh against geographic distance to the river dg results from the four dynasties show that the overall dh dg 0 94 0 10 i e the smaller the ratio the larger concentration of human settlements close to rivers values of dh dg during the han dynasty 2 ce is higher than 1 fig 2b and fig s3 while lower than 1 in the tang song and ming dynasties these results reveal that people tend to settle closer to rivers after han dynasty additionally the smaller of the ratio the closer of settling closer to rivers and this pattern is particularly evident during the song dynasty i e with the lowest dh dg ratio our findings are consistent with previous independent results from the scientific literature focusing on other regions of the world for example the modern era analysis shows that dh dg value is between 0 8 and 1 3 for different regions of the world and most of regions is 1 in 2007 kummu et al 2011 another regional analysis of the conterminous us in 2010 fang and jawitz 2019 showed that the dh dg 1 for all regions we can infer that with the development of society and population migration people tend to choose settlement locations that are close to rivers to demonstrate the landform impact on population distance to rivers we assessed the relationship between landform types i e plains hills mountains and tablelands and population distribution pattern with respect to distance to rivers in each km fig 3 we found that plains account for around 20 of the study area fig 3a d yellow background but held 70 and 60 of the population fig 3a and b red line during han 2 ce and tang 742 ce dynasties and did not show an obvious tendency of living closer or farther from rivers a different pattern emerged in the song 1102 ce and ming 1522 ce dynasties fig 3c and d where the population percentage within 20 km from rivers in mountainous areas was larger than in the plains however it is worth noting that the majority of people living further from the river 20 km was located in the plains we used a conceptual framework to illustrate fig 3e and f and focused on the population in plains and mountains because 90 of population distributed in these two landforms from this analysis we can conclude that whether the majority of population live in plains han and tang dynasties or mountainous areas song and ming dynasties the higher proportion of population still distributed in plains when distance to rivers increases the physical map with population distribution and capitals fig 3g j in different dynasties with hotspot regions demonstrated the transition of people moved from northern plains in han and tang dynasties to southern mountains in song dynasty to further testify if people in plains live farther from rivers we calculated the geographic distance dg and the human distance dh to rivers in different landforms across four dynasties accordingly table 2 from the comparison of dh dg values we consistently find the largest values across plains regardless the dynasty period which confirms once more that people settled farther to rivers in plain areas 3 2 landform regulate human reliance on rivers in large scale dynamics we analyzed the temporal changes of population density persons km 2 computed as normalized values with respect to the absolute maximum density observed during the ming dynasty 1522 ce across classes of distance to rivers fig 4 in the han dynasty 2 ce an overall positive correlation emerged that is a higher population density with increasing distance away from rivers in the tang dynasty 742 ce population densities did not appear to relate to proximity to rivers fig 4a conversely in the song 1102 ce and ming 1522 ce dynasties higher normalized population densities are found closer to rivers fig 4b this indicates that between the han and the song dynasties people moved closer to rivers i e the slope decreased whereas from the song to the ming dynasty people moved slightly farther from rivers i e the slope slightly increased though still being negative fig 4c nevertheless when focusing on a shorter distance range to rivers 0 20 km all four dynasties show a consistent increase in population densities closer to rivers for a distance to rivers larger than 20 km we found an increasing population away from rivers only during the han dynasty to further explore this pattern we investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of population distribution within 20 50 km distance to rivers and found that the majority of the population was distributed in the plains fig s4 to evaluate how landform type influenced the temporal relationship between settlement patterns and proximity to rivers we analyzed the normalized population density within each landform type we found that the change in the sign of the relationship between human settlement and distance to rivers fig 4c matches the relative change of population distribution in plains across the four dynasties fig 4d from the han to song dynasty the population density in plains decreased while from the song to ming dynasty it increased again the dynamics of human reliance on rivers and the changes of normalized population in different landforms can be seen in table 3 several factors are likely to explain why people lived on plains tended to be located farther away from major rivers first floodplains nardi et al 2019 constitute a considerable proportion of landform elements designated in this study as plains were subjected to more frequent seasonal flooding because of the relatively limited flood protection infrastructure in imperial china communities tended to live farther away from major rivers fig s5 specifically focusing on the change of population density in floodplains second migration significantly affected population distribution for example in han and tang dynasties during which the political and economic center was in the north fig 3g and h tackett 2018 the majority of people migrated northward whereas in song dynasty specifically a crucial period in china history refer to as the tang song transition von glahn 2016 due to climate change fan 2015 lee zhang 2010 feng et al 2019 and frequent wars zhang et al 2007 chen 2015 zhang et al 2021b a massive number of farmers moved to the south to survive however in ming dynasty the forced immigration organized by officials durand 2011 and the relocated capital bai and jia 2019 tackett 2018 to the north plains reversed the situation and human reliance on rivers slightly decreased further hydraulic engineering to use groundwater resources could help to mitigate the reliance on rivers for those people who lived on plains zhou 2021 wu et al 2019b but this strategy is difficult for those living on other landform types the groundwater exploitation and hydraulic projects were mostly located in lower yellow river area yu et al 2021 liu et al 2011 and yangtze delta liu et al 2017 lastly differences in river network density and landform types between the northern and southern parts of china is likely to have been an important factor influencing human river relationships in the northern region the river network is sparser and plains dominate whereas the southern chinese landscape is more mountainous and has higher river network densities 3 3 interaction between human reliance on rivers and landforms at the river basin scale we investigated population densities across classes of distance to rivers at the catchment scale in the yellow haihe and huaihe river basins located in the northern part of the study area and in the yangtze pearl and southeast river basins located in the southern region fig 1a as reported in table 1 the geographic dg and human distance to rivers dh revealed that in river basins with a lower area of plains people tend to live near rivers dh dg 1 conversely in the huaihe river basin where plains constitute 71 of the land area i e the largest percentage across all six basins people live relatively far from rivers dh dg 1 we also calculated the interaction between population density and distance to rivers tables s3 and s4 across the four dynasties in each river basin fig s6 we found a consistent negative trend in all catchments except for the huaihe river basin fig s6c it further provided the evidence that people do not exhibit the tendency to settle near rivers in areas mostly covered by plains a similar independent finding across the us fang and jawitz 2019 also supports this result in regions mostly constituted of plains i e south atlantic gulf upper and lower mississippi and pacific northwest people preferred to live farther from rivers fang and jawitz 2019 fig 4e to explain how landforms play a driving role in controlling human reliance on rivers we evaluated changes of population density on landforms and settlement close to water courses across four dynasties in the northern river basins i e yellow haihe and huaihe river basins because 1 95 population was located in these areas during the han and tang dynasties 2 the climate background precipitation and temperature from the centennial to the millennial scale is considered to be representative for the entire northern china during the last 2200 years li et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a the results revealed that in the huaihe river basin fig 5 c from the han to song dynasty people settled closer to rivers fig 5f as the population in plains decreased fig 5i while from the song to ming dynasty they moved away from rivers as the population increased the same mechanism applies to the other two river basins fig 5d and e g and h which implies the underlying rule that the human distance to rivers is profoundly influenced by landforms see the details in table s2 3 4 limitations and implications this study shows that landforms play a profound role in regard to rivers and population density in imperial china and highlights that people in lowland areas exhibit less reliance on rivers there are however two limitations to this first large scale and long term analysis of human river environment interactions that should be acknowledged first our spatial analysis of population distribution is based on subordinate prefectures of data in imperial china and there are inevitable limitations on the availability of ancient documents nevertheless population data presented in this study is the most reliable and comprehensive currently available second the assumption that the change in the geomorphic evolution of all river systems over the last 2000 years is negligible may be unrealistic to support this assumption the comparative analysis regarding human water distance between contemporary yellow river data and available historical yellow river avulsions data fig 1 the most significant avulsions because of many big artificial works on the river course shows that there is no significant difference on population reliance on rivers fig s7 therefore the long term impact of yellow river avulsion on population river interaction is relatively small comparatively the impact of morphology and riparian communities changes on otherrivers within a dynasty duration can also beneglectedin this study the finding in this study suggests that the historical river civilization of china has been largely affected by natural factors while people are learning how to avoid the adverse impact from nature and how to benefit from ongoing geomorphic contexts by improving understanding of human water interrelationships our research sheds light on the interaction between the hydro geomorphological environment and human settlements which is essential for sustainable water management strategies for different landforms human settlements in hilly and mountainous regions typically located in less developed areas rely more on nearby rivers for domestic water use even in present days one fourth world s population does not have easy access to clean drinking water and nearly half the world s population lacks of adequate sanitation as in the who definition drinking water still requires miles of travel for nearly a billion people today who unicef 2020 therefore safe wash water sanitation and hygiene should be urgently concerned for people living on plains additional big challenges are emerging in regard to the water supply pressure resulted from the rapidly increasing

2019,proximity to rivers and flat areas are two of the main factors that determine the location of human settlements despite empirical relationships between human settlements river dynamics and the corresponding landforms the underlying mechanism remains speculative here we present the first millennium scale quantitative temporal analysis of human population dynamics and its relationship with river location and landforms in imperial china across four dynasties han 2 ce tang 742 ce song 1102 ce and ming 1522 ce over the last 2000 years our results show less human reliance measured by the number of people living close to a water course on rivers for people living in lowland areas which we interpret to be related to flood risk and the availability of groundwater from alluvial aquifers distant from rivers used for agriculture conversely people living in mountainous and hilly areas appear to have a stronger reliance on rivers in imperial china specifically behind the strong variations of human river relation across millennia we infer a general principle highlighting the role of landforms in human river interactions these results shed light on how geomorphology shape settlement and urban patterns with important implications for sustainable lifeways in riverine environments keywords human settlement reliance on rivers landforms population migration imperial china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction near river regions are generally considered to be good locations for human settlements as they offer access to water resources and agricultural cultivation and in the modern world opportunities to connect with ecological corridors fang et al 2018 zingraff hamed et al 2021 anderson et al 2019 to a large extent historical and prehistoric growth of riverine communities are consistent with this perception macklin and lewin 2015 with great ancient potamic civilizations of china egypt india pakistan and iraq developing along major rivers however humans frequently changed their settlement location as confirmed for instance by a series of massive migrations in europe and mediterranean region in early middle ages müller et al 2011 similarly in imperial china the early chinese civilization center shifted from yellow river basin to yangtze river basin between the han 2 ce to song 2 ce dynasty tackett 2018 von glahn 2016 and then northwards in ming 1522 ce dynasty because of migration durand 2011 as illustrated by the relocation in northern china of the capital city bai and jia 2019 key research questions arise does this migration change the physical spatial relationship between human settlements and their water resources what is the controlling factor in this dynamic relationship the evolution of spatial patterns between human settlements and river system have been explored yet focusing on the modern era a recent study of the distance between settlements and nearby rivers revealed that in 2007 more than 50 of the world s population lived within 3 km from surface freshwater with a higher density of population near the river networks kummu et al 2011 climate urbanization and socio economic development lead to some regional variations which are also reflected in another study based on nighttime light data from 1992 to 2013 demonstrating the increasing human concentration near rivers over time ceola et al 2015 another study showed that in the us people settled closer to major rivers before the industrial revolution but moved farther away from them afterwards because of the greater utilization of groundwater made people less reliant on rivers since industrialization fang and jawitz 2019 when extending the analysis to the millennial scale hydromorphology and catchment geomorphology appear to have shaped settlement patterns as shown by studies of the alluvial archaeological record worldwide macklin and lewin 2015 regional research showed that changes in the distribution of prehistoric human settlements in china are aligned with the geomorphic evolution of fluvial system lu et al 2017 however the limited availability of long term data constraints further exploration particularly on a quantitative basis although global and regional population datasets from the historical periods have been reconstructed klein goldewijk et al 2010 fang and jawitz 2018 voutilainen et al 2020 spatially explicit and high resolution population data over millennial time periods is scarce which limits the analysis of relationships between hydromorphology and human settlement pattern to understand the interactions and the co evolution between human settlement rivers and the geomorphic environment we presented here the first examination of long term and large scale population dynamics with respect to rivers and landforms in imperial china first we retrieved millennial length population data and territory data fig s1 during four periods 2 ce han dynasty 742 ce tang dynasty 1102 ce song dynasty and 1522 ce ming dynasty for the imperial china over the last 2000 years from the center for geographic analysis at harvard university second we selected our study area fig 1 a on the basis of the same consistent territorial area in all four dynastic periods shuo and ma 2020 wu et al 2019a yuan kang 2012 we then used the river network from hydrorivers lehner and grill 2013 and yellow river avulsion data wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2011 to define classes of euclidean distance to rivers further we combined the population and river network data to assess the population distribution in different classes of distance to rivers which results in deriving the geographic dg and human dh distance to rivers namely river attractiveness defined as the slope of the linear regression between human density and distance to rivers finally we applied landform stratification fig 1b from the world ecological facets landform classes karagulle et al 2017 and overlap with population distribution to understand how this may have influenced the relationship between rivers and population density in imperial china 2 data and methods 2 1 reconstruction of historical population data in imperial china we used the web crawler the code in the supplementary data source to acquire the population and territory data from chinaxmap https worldmap harvard edu maps chinax which offered historical map layers for china provided by the center for geographic analysis at harvard university it digitalized the territory and ancient population distribution of china in different dynasties from bielenstein 1987 who drew population maps based on national enumerations with subtotals for administrative units from han shu han dynasty 2 ce chiu t ang shu tang dynasty 742 ce sung shih song dynasty 1102 ce and ming shi lu ming dynasty 1522 ce specifically bielenstein 1987 recorded the households and individuals for each commandery and listed the numbers and names of the subordinate prefectures through a critical examination of the texts and the statistics for those prefectures that no longer exist or that have changed their names the author identified the emplacements of the ancient prefectures on a modern topographic map by each commandery then the required number of points representing towns with 35 000 people each were placed within these areas guided by the sites of the prefectures and the topography of the area to ensure the accuracy of the location the population distribution and the territory across four dynasties are shown in fig s1 the average distance between towns is around 1 km in population cluster areas supplementary data source 2 2 river network data sources for the river network data we used the hydrorivers https www hydrosheds org products hydrorivers dataset which extracted from the gridded hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 core layers at 15 arc second approximately 500 m at the equator resolution with a catchment area of at least 10 km2 or an average river flow of at least 0 1 m3 sec or both hydrorivers includes a range of attribute information such as the river length the stream order and an estimate of long term average discharge lehner and grill 2013 we extracted the river network with stream order strahler order and applied to the study area fig 1a a stream order threshold equal to 4 is selected here to delineate the river network fig 1a where river discharge is assumed to be sufficient for human water use and transportation purposes padowski and jawitz 2012 fang and jawitz 2019 our study area includes the haihe yellow huaihe yangtze southeast and pearl river basins fig 1a whose boundary is obtained from the national earth system science data center https gre geodata cn the yellow river is the mother river to the nation also known as the cradles of chinese civilization and it went through artificial avulsions many times due to various historical reasons we embed this information in our analysis by deriving the avulsion data in each dynasty across the study period from chinaxmap https worldmap harvard edu maps chinax 2 3 topographic data sources for the landform data we used the world ecological facets landform classes https www arcgis com home item html id cd817a746aa7437cbd72a6d39cdb4559 provided by esri and identified large recognizable features such as plains hills mountains and tablelands i e plateau as shown in fig 1b for each dynasty we overlap the landform type with the capital location to identify the capital location and the corresponding landform the capitals in han and tang located in plain areas within the in yellow river basin chang an and then moved to southern china lin an in mountainous areas across the southeast river basins during the song dynasty the capital was firstly founded in nanjing yangtze river basin in ming dynasty but then moved to beijing the capital in contemporary china across plain areas within the haihe river basin and the relocation of capitals also greatly influence population distribution in ming dynasty the transition of capitals reflected the political and socio economic center transfer in imperial china across 2000 years furthermore to identify floodplain areas and then further explore the population distribution pattern therein the gfplain250m dataset a global dataset of earth s floodplains at 250 m resolution was employed nardi et al 2019 2 4 geographic versus human distance to rivers analysis we firstly extracted the river network with stream orders 4 in study area and converted it to a raster format with 1 km resolution next we calculated the geographic euclidean distance from any grid cell classified as land to the closest river for each dynasty at least 92 of the study area was within 50 km of a river so we classified the distance into 51 classes 1 km wide fig s2 and table s1 we identified the geographic distance to the river dg as 50 of the cumulative land area fig 2 b then we overlaid population data in each class of land distance to water computed the relative percentage and identified the human distance to a river dh as 50 of the cumulative population fig 2b the ratio between dh and dg is used to indicate if people live closer to dh dg 1 or farther from dh dg 1 rivers kummu et al 2011 fang and jawitz 2019 this methodology was applied both to the whole study area and to each river basin separately to identify how geomorphology can control and drive different patterns of geographic and human distance to rivers we integrated our analysis by using different stratification of landforms and calculating the relative land area and population in each category 2 5 human reliance on rivers we computed the normalized population density by generalizing the population density persons km 2 of the study area to the range 0 1 based on min max feature scaling and the equation is the following 1 x x x min x max x min we selected the minimum and maximum value based on the population distribution across four dynasties and then analyzed how normalized population density in different dynasties varies as a function of distance to rivers we performed a linear regression and used the slope km 1 as an indicator of human reliance on rivers the positive negative trend indicates a relatively smaller larger reliance on rivers with r2 and p value being tested human reliance on rivers is assessed both across the whole study area and within each river basin also here the role of landforms was assessed by considering the temporal evolution of population distribution in different landforms and comparing with the human reliance on rivers across four dynasties 3 results and discussion 3 1 landforms shape the interaction between rivers and human settlement patterns to investigate human reliance on rivers and its dynamics in imperial china we first assessed the spatial and temporal distribution of population as influenced by the geographical location of rivers from the relative distribution of population as perh in table s2 within 50 km from rivers we computed the human distance to rivers dh which represents the distance for 50 of the cumulative population fig 2a for han dynasty 2 ce and fig s2 for the remaining three dynasties to establish if people live close to or far from rivers we also need to compare human distance to rivers dh against geographic distance to the river dg results from the four dynasties show that the overall dh dg 0 94 0 10 i e the smaller the ratio the larger concentration of human settlements close to rivers values of dh dg during the han dynasty 2 ce is higher than 1 fig 2b and fig s3 while lower than 1 in the tang song and ming dynasties these results reveal that people tend to settle closer to rivers after han dynasty additionally the smaller of the ratio the closer of settling closer to rivers and this pattern is particularly evident during the song dynasty i e with the lowest dh dg ratio our findings are consistent with previous independent results from the scientific literature focusing on other regions of the world for example the modern era analysis shows that dh dg value is between 0 8 and 1 3 for different regions of the world and most of regions is 1 in 2007 kummu et al 2011 another regional analysis of the conterminous us in 2010 fang and jawitz 2019 showed that the dh dg 1 for all regions we can infer that with the development of society and population migration people tend to choose settlement locations that are close to rivers to demonstrate the landform impact on population distance to rivers we assessed the relationship between landform types i e plains hills mountains and tablelands and population distribution pattern with respect to distance to rivers in each km fig 3 we found that plains account for around 20 of the study area fig 3a d yellow background but held 70 and 60 of the population fig 3a and b red line during han 2 ce and tang 742 ce dynasties and did not show an obvious tendency of living closer or farther from rivers a different pattern emerged in the song 1102 ce and ming 1522 ce dynasties fig 3c and d where the population percentage within 20 km from rivers in mountainous areas was larger than in the plains however it is worth noting that the majority of people living further from the river 20 km was located in the plains we used a conceptual framework to illustrate fig 3e and f and focused on the population in plains and mountains because 90 of population distributed in these two landforms from this analysis we can conclude that whether the majority of population live in plains han and tang dynasties or mountainous areas song and ming dynasties the higher proportion of population still distributed in plains when distance to rivers increases the physical map with population distribution and capitals fig 3g j in different dynasties with hotspot regions demonstrated the transition of people moved from northern plains in han and tang dynasties to southern mountains in song dynasty to further testify if people in plains live farther from rivers we calculated the geographic distance dg and the human distance dh to rivers in different landforms across four dynasties accordingly table 2 from the comparison of dh dg values we consistently find the largest values across plains regardless the dynasty period which confirms once more that people settled farther to rivers in plain areas 3 2 landform regulate human reliance on rivers in large scale dynamics we analyzed the temporal changes of population density persons km 2 computed as normalized values with respect to the absolute maximum density observed during the ming dynasty 1522 ce across classes of distance to rivers fig 4 in the han dynasty 2 ce an overall positive correlation emerged that is a higher population density with increasing distance away from rivers in the tang dynasty 742 ce population densities did not appear to relate to proximity to rivers fig 4a conversely in the song 1102 ce and ming 1522 ce dynasties higher normalized population densities are found closer to rivers fig 4b this indicates that between the han and the song dynasties people moved closer to rivers i e the slope decreased whereas from the song to the ming dynasty people moved slightly farther from rivers i e the slope slightly increased though still being negative fig 4c nevertheless when focusing on a shorter distance range to rivers 0 20 km all four dynasties show a consistent increase in population densities closer to rivers for a distance to rivers larger than 20 km we found an increasing population away from rivers only during the han dynasty to further explore this pattern we investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of population distribution within 20 50 km distance to rivers and found that the majority of the population was distributed in the plains fig s4 to evaluate how landform type influenced the temporal relationship between settlement patterns and proximity to rivers we analyzed the normalized population density within each landform type we found that the change in the sign of the relationship between human settlement and distance to rivers fig 4c matches the relative change of population distribution in plains across the four dynasties fig 4d from the han to song dynasty the population density in plains decreased while from the song to ming dynasty it increased again the dynamics of human reliance on rivers and the changes of normalized population in different landforms can be seen in table 3 several factors are likely to explain why people lived on plains tended to be located farther away from major rivers first floodplains nardi et al 2019 constitute a considerable proportion of landform elements designated in this study as plains were subjected to more frequent seasonal flooding because of the relatively limited flood protection infrastructure in imperial china communities tended to live farther away from major rivers fig s5 specifically focusing on the change of population density in floodplains second migration significantly affected population distribution for example in han and tang dynasties during which the political and economic center was in the north fig 3g and h tackett 2018 the majority of people migrated northward whereas in song dynasty specifically a crucial period in china history refer to as the tang song transition von glahn 2016 due to climate change fan 2015 lee zhang 2010 feng et al 2019 and frequent wars zhang et al 2007 chen 2015 zhang et al 2021b a massive number of farmers moved to the south to survive however in ming dynasty the forced immigration organized by officials durand 2011 and the relocated capital bai and jia 2019 tackett 2018 to the north plains reversed the situation and human reliance on rivers slightly decreased further hydraulic engineering to use groundwater resources could help to mitigate the reliance on rivers for those people who lived on plains zhou 2021 wu et al 2019b but this strategy is difficult for those living on other landform types the groundwater exploitation and hydraulic projects were mostly located in lower yellow river area yu et al 2021 liu et al 2011 and yangtze delta liu et al 2017 lastly differences in river network density and landform types between the northern and southern parts of china is likely to have been an important factor influencing human river relationships in the northern region the river network is sparser and plains dominate whereas the southern chinese landscape is more mountainous and has higher river network densities 3 3 interaction between human reliance on rivers and landforms at the river basin scale we investigated population densities across classes of distance to rivers at the catchment scale in the yellow haihe and huaihe river basins located in the northern part of the study area and in the yangtze pearl and southeast river basins located in the southern region fig 1a as reported in table 1 the geographic dg and human distance to rivers dh revealed that in river basins with a lower area of plains people tend to live near rivers dh dg 1 conversely in the huaihe river basin where plains constitute 71 of the land area i e the largest percentage across all six basins people live relatively far from rivers dh dg 1 we also calculated the interaction between population density and distance to rivers tables s3 and s4 across the four dynasties in each river basin fig s6 we found a consistent negative trend in all catchments except for the huaihe river basin fig s6c it further provided the evidence that people do not exhibit the tendency to settle near rivers in areas mostly covered by plains a similar independent finding across the us fang and jawitz 2019 also supports this result in regions mostly constituted of plains i e south atlantic gulf upper and lower mississippi and pacific northwest people preferred to live farther from rivers fang and jawitz 2019 fig 4e to explain how landforms play a driving role in controlling human reliance on rivers we evaluated changes of population density on landforms and settlement close to water courses across four dynasties in the northern river basins i e yellow haihe and huaihe river basins because 1 95 population was located in these areas during the han and tang dynasties 2 the climate background precipitation and temperature from the centennial to the millennial scale is considered to be representative for the entire northern china during the last 2200 years li et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a the results revealed that in the huaihe river basin fig 5 c from the han to song dynasty people settled closer to rivers fig 5f as the population in plains decreased fig 5i while from the song to ming dynasty they moved away from rivers as the population increased the same mechanism applies to the other two river basins fig 5d and e g and h which implies the underlying rule that the human distance to rivers is profoundly influenced by landforms see the details in table s2 3 4 limitations and implications this study shows that landforms play a profound role in regard to rivers and population density in imperial china and highlights that people in lowland areas exhibit less reliance on rivers there are however two limitations to this first large scale and long term analysis of human river environment interactions that should be acknowledged first our spatial analysis of population distribution is based on subordinate prefectures of data in imperial china and there are inevitable limitations on the availability of ancient documents nevertheless population data presented in this study is the most reliable and comprehensive currently available second the assumption that the change in the geomorphic evolution of all river systems over the last 2000 years is negligible may be unrealistic to support this assumption the comparative analysis regarding human water distance between contemporary yellow river data and available historical yellow river avulsions data fig 1 the most significant avulsions because of many big artificial works on the river course shows that there is no significant difference on population reliance on rivers fig s7 therefore the long term impact of yellow river avulsion on population river interaction is relatively small comparatively the impact of morphology and riparian communities changes on otherrivers within a dynasty duration can also beneglectedin this study the finding in this study suggests that the historical river civilization of china has been largely affected by natural factors while people are learning how to avoid the adverse impact from nature and how to benefit from ongoing geomorphic contexts by improving understanding of human water interrelationships our research sheds light on the interaction between the hydro geomorphological environment and human settlements which is essential for sustainable water management strategies for different landforms human settlements in hilly and mountainous regions typically located in less developed areas rely more on nearby rivers for domestic water use even in present days one fourth world s population does not have easy access to clean drinking water and nearly half the world s population lacks of adequate sanitation as in the who definition drinking water still requires miles of travel for nearly a billion people today who unicef 2020 therefore safe wash water sanitation and hygiene should be urgently concerned for people living on plains additional big challenges are emerging in regard to the water supply pressure resulted from the rapidly increasing population in large cities i e the percentage of the global population living in urban areas has increased from around 16 in 1900 to 55 in 2020 un habitat 2020 first dam construction and groundwater pumping for water supply purposes may trigger geological hazards huang and jin 2018 teatini et al 2006 second in flood prone areas the flooding risk may cause catastrophic socio economic losses due to the increased population exposure ceola et al 2014 for example the disastrous flood in henan province in china in august 2021 caused home and assets loss for more than 14 million people and severe damage in 500 thousand hectare agricultural land which account for in total 17 billion dollars loss estimated cai et al 2021 therefore implementing countermeasures for flooding and more efficient ways to manage water resources such as harvesting and utilizing rainwater is pressing concern for people in plains 4 conclusions this study provides a spatial and temporal evolution of human population density and distribution in imperial china and its corresponding changes to the proximity to rivers and the occupation of different landforms we found that over the last 2000 years people moved closer to han to song dynasties and then farther away ming dynasty from rivers furthermore people in plain area tend to live at a greater distance from rivers compared to other landforms even though the human movement is partially ascribed to other factors such as wars zhang et al 2021b climate change zhang et al 2007 feng et al 2019 floods zhang 2009 economic advancement and politics tackett 2018
