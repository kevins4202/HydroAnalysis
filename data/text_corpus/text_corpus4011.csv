20055,wetlands are under severe threat due to anthropogenic activities and pollutants many pollutants such as heavy metals may accumulate to a hazardous level in the present study scylla serrata the mud crab and associated sediments were collected from three sites of ashtamudi lake the ramsar site to investigate the bioaccumulation of heavy metals cadmium chromium copper lead and zinc elemental analysis in the sediment sample showed that cadmium and chromium were found to be above usepa and ccme limits and copper was found to be above ccme limit on site 1 in site 2 chromium was found to be above usepa and ccme limits in all the three sites lead and zinc are below the permissible limit bioaccumulation status of heavy metals in the muscle of scylla serrata with respect to the sites are in the order of site 1 site 2 site the heavy metals cadmium chromium and lead were found to be above the permissible limit in site 1 and site 2 whereas copper and zinc concentrations in the muscle of crab from ashtamudi wetland are below levels of concern for human consumption a number of histological alterations such as splitting of muscle fibres focal area of necrosis and muscular oedema were noticed in the samples the result clearly indicates the fact that s serrata undergoes intensified stress when exposed to heavy metal contamination knowledge of metal concentrations in shell fish and fin fish are important both with respect to nature management and human consumption of fish keywords wetlands pollutants heavy metal crab bioaccumulation necrosis 1 introduction metals are continually released into aquatic ecosystems from natural to anthropogenic sources and they cause serious threats because of their toxicity bioaccumulation long persistence and biomagnification in the food chain erdoĝrul and ates 2006 the pollution of brackish waters with an extensive range of heavy metals has become a matter of significant concern over the last new decades because of the damage caused to the aquatic life metals like copper zinc and chromium are essential metals since they play an important role in biological system while cadmium and lead are nonessential metals as they have no identified role in biological systems when metals enter the aquatic ecosystems they upset the ecological environment and their ability to bioaccumulation may cause stress on fish and aquatic fauna olmedo et al 2013 mohammed ali 2016 reported studies from the field and laboratory experiments showed that the accumulation of metals in tissues are mainly dependent upon water metal concentrations exposure period and type of tissue bochenek et al 2008 mansouri et al 2011 in aquatic systems fish samples are observed as one of the most indicative organisms for the evaluation of metal pollution erdoĝrul and ates 2006 fish accumulates substantial amounts of metals in its tissues especially in muscles and thus represents a major dietary source for humans and eventually affects their health sarkar et al 2016 dural et al 2006 fish contamination with metals was reported as a result of pollution of water with municipal solid waste industrial effluents and fertilizers containing metals dural et al 2006 contaminants in fish pose risks to human consumers as well as to piscivorous wildlife and are considered as a pathway for the transfer of heavy metals to higher trophic levels sanchari 2017 benthic crustaceans such as crabs with detritus feeding habits may be sensitive to metal pollution because their life in the bottom sediments where chemical contaminants are mainly stored to some extent crabs can fulfill the main requirements of bioindicators such as being relatively sedentary easy to identify abundant long lived available for sampling all the year round and getting a wide distribution rainbow 1995 jake van 2010 the pollution load of heavy metals in sediments of ashtamudi estuarine system has been extensively studied and reported by nagendra et al 2017 sherly et al 2015 and suma et al 2012 histological lesions can be used as indicators to identify the effects of various chemical contaminations on organisms such as fin fishes and shellfishes and are reliable tools in controlled experiments and field studies lee et al 2012 histological analysis plays a pivotal role in determining the ultra structure alterations that may occur in the tissues of organisms due to the toxicity of

the changjiang river estuary sun and wang 2003 the observed concentration of heavy metals accumulation in muscles of the present study was found to be lower when compared with the above studies whereas when compared with international standard site 1 and site 2 showed the concentrations of the heavy metals cadmium chromium and lead above the permissible limit table 4 economic development and anthropogenic activities have significantly contributed to the worldwide deterioration in water quality saiful islam et al 2015 simul bhuyan et al 2019 balkis et al 2010 mokaddes et al 2013 result of statistical analysis confirms bioaccumulation status of heavy metals in the muscles of scylla serrata one way analysis of variance anova showed that selected heavy metals such as cadmium f 17 820 chromium f 130 748 copper f 119 606 lead f 58 955 and zinc f 52 526 were found to be different in their values with respect to the sites and showed significance at 1 level p 0 01 the results of the fisher s lsd least significant difference post hoc multiple comparisons further reveal that site 1 and 2 significantly differ from site 3 with respect to the accumulation of heavy metal cadmium with respect to copper and lead at site 1 significantly differ with site 2 and 3 whereas for chromium and zinc all the three sites were found to be significantly differing among each other table 3 generally bottom dwelling crabs are suitable to accumulate more heavy metals factors such as age sex size tissue type feeding habits and growth rate could also affect the addition of heavy metal in crabs jennings and rainbow 1979 turoczy et al 2001 mohapatra et al 2009 in the present study the levels of metals in sediments were different at each sampling site sediment forms a major source of heavy metals and also food source for many benthic organisms zhang et al 2014 thus feeding habits might be an important factor affecting the bioaccumulation of heavy metals liu et al 2017 it is believed that the crabs are capable of modifiable concentrations of essential metals in the body but are unable to regulate the levels of nonessential metals rainbow 1985 mohapatra et al 2009 the results further confirm the pollution status of the lake and accordingly the study sites can be classified in the hierarchical order as more polluted site 1 less polluted site 2 least polluted site 3 it has been found that the concentrations of the heavy metals raised coastal ecosystems due to the release of industrial waste and agricultural activities in order to ensure public health and safety standard an evaluation of heavy metal pollution status of the tissues of edible aquatic organisms is very essential nasyitah et al 2018 rumisha et al 2016 many researchers have emphasized the bioaccumulation status of heavy metal pollution load in the tissues of shellfishes from polluted regions of the lakes from different part of the world noor and asmat 2017 nascimento et al 2017 umunnakwe and ogamba 2013 kaoud and eldahshan 2010 the pattern of heavy metal accumulation in the tiger prawn penaeus monodon from different regions of ashtamudi also revealed the presence of heavy metal like cadmium chromium copper zinc and lead sherly and lekshmi 2017 the cadmium chromium and lead concentrations in the muscle of crab from two sites of ashtamudi wetland are above the levels of concern for human consumption as defined by the fao 1984 2012 the studied crab species in this wetland system are being exploited for human consumption in indigenous market as well as export market in the present study muscle tissues of crab species were analyzed because these concentrations provide information on the potential risk to the crab themselves or to other organisms that consume them especially humans heavy metals like chromium and cadmium which were found to be above the permissible limit in the sediment sample were also reflect in the muscle of the crab in higher concentrations metal concentrations in the tissue of fish varies significantly among different studies may be due to differences in metal concentrations and chemical characteristics of water from which fish were sampled metabolism ecological requirements and feeding types of fishes and also the season in which studies were carried out canli and atli 2003 erdoĝrul and ates 2006 the principle pathways for metal uptake found to be highly variable over the range of metals contaminant levels specific ecological situation and fish species studied thus the metal concentrations in fish tissue may appear to be the result of a complex interaction of many factors alam et al 2002 3 3 histological analysis a number of histological alterations which deviate from the normal structural patterns were noticed in the muscle of scylla serrata collected from the polluted regions of the lake under transmission electron microscopic investigation tem muscles of s serrata collected from site 3 revealed a normal histological architecture made up of muscle cells containing contractile filaments the thread like myosin filaments and proteins in the muscle tissue form a sheath of multi nucleate cells which assemble into fibers called myofibrils fig 2 a muscle of s serrata collected from site 1 showed several structural changes under tem analysis oedema hyaline degeneration and splitting of muscle fibers fig 2b appearance of granular materials fig 2c focal areas of necrosis and hyaline degeneration were also noticed fig 2d loss of normal state of myofibrils with appearance of dark circular patches was other predominant observations fig 2e muscle of s serrata from site 2 also reveals many abnormal features like fragmentation of muscle fibers haemocytic intrusion fig 2f vacuolar degeneration fig 2g hyaline degeneration with appearance of dark patches fig 2h and atrophy fig 2i many structural alterations such as atrophy vacuolization extensive necrosis and disrupted muscle bundles were observed in the muscle of s serrata due to the effect of heavy metals like cu pb zn cd collected from pulicat lake lourduraj et al 2014 loosely packed and disintegrated muscle fibres were noticed in the selected fish species glenn et al 2013 the heavy metals cd and pb caused similar type of alternations in liver gills and kidney of leuciobarbus xanthopterus sanaa 2020 morphological alterations caused by heavy metal pollution on gills and fins were noticed in tiger prawns penaeus monodon and etroplus suratensis collected from the polluted regions of ashtamudi lake sherly et al 2015 sherly and lekshmi 2017 zn accumulation resulted in significant alternations in the structure of the muscle such as disintegration of myofibrils vacuolation in myofibrils necrosis atrophy in mud crab scylla serrata ramya et al 2019 4 conclusion growing pressure of anthropogenic influences continuously threatened the life of aquatic organisms inhabiting in the water system which further leads to many toxic effects on them bioaccumulation status of heavy metals in the muscle of scylla serrata with respect to site is in the order of site1 site2 site 3 the shell fishes inhabiting in the polluted regions are more prone to heavy metal accumulation and subsequent alterations in its histological structure if the discharge of aquatic pollutants into the water bodies goes on at an elevated level it will seriously affects the survival of the aquatic organisms knowledge of metal concentrations in shell fishes and fin fishes are important for both with respect to nature management and human consumption through the consumption of the affected shellfishes pollutants can even reach higher organisms including humans the future of mankind is inevitably linked to the protection of ecosystems

as 6 958 0 701 mg kg dw whereas all other heavy metal were found to be below detectable limit table 3 concentrations of cu zn and cd in the crab tissues from the mangrove wetlands in qi ao island south china ranged from 36 to 528 44 to 280 59 to 781 and 2 0 to 24 mg kg dw zaiwan et al 2019 it was stated that the levels of cu and zn in s dehaani 69 128 mg kg for cu and 44 102 mg kg for zn from the changjiang river estuary sun and wang 2003 the observed concentration of heavy metals accumulation in muscles of the present study was found to be lower when compared with the above studies whereas when compared with international standard site 1 and site 2 showed the concentrations of the heavy metals cadmium chromium and lead above the permissible limit table 4 economic development and anthropogenic activities have significantly contributed to the worldwide deterioration in water quality saiful islam et al 2015 simul bhuyan et al 2019 balkis et al 2010 mokaddes et al 2013 result of statistical analysis confirms bioaccumulation status of heavy metals in the muscles of scylla serrata one way analysis of variance anova showed that selected heavy metals such as cadmium f 17 820 chromium f 130 748 copper f 119 606 lead f 58 955 and zinc f 52 526 were found to be different in their values with respect to the sites and showed significance at 1 level p 0 01 the results of the fisher s lsd least significant difference post hoc multiple comparisons further reveal that site 1 and 2 significantly differ from site 3 with respect to the accumulation of heavy metal cadmium with respect to copper and lead at site 1 significantly differ with site 2 and 3 whereas for chromium and zinc all the three sites were found to be significantly differing among each other table 3 generally bottom dwelling crabs are suitable to accumulate more heavy metals factors such as age sex size tissue type feeding habits and growth rate could also affect the addition of heavy metal in crabs jennings and rainbow 1979 turoczy et al 2001 mohapatra et al 2009 in the present study the levels of metals in sediments were different at each sampling site sediment forms a major source of heavy metals and also food source for many benthic organisms zhang et al 2014 thus feeding habits might be an important factor affecting the bioaccumulation of heavy metals liu et al 2017 it is believed that the crabs are capable of modifiable concentrations of essential metals in the body but are unable to regulate the levels of nonessential metals rainbow 1985 mohapatra et al 2009 the results further confirm the pollution status of the lake and accordingly the study sites can be classified in the hierarchical order as more polluted site 1 less polluted site 2 least polluted site 3 it has been found that the concentrations of the heavy metals raised coastal ecosystems due to the release of industrial waste and agricultural activities in order to ensure public health and safety standard an evaluation of heavy metal pollution status of the tissues of edible aquatic organisms is very essential nasyitah et al 2018 rumisha et al 2016 many researchers have emphasized the bioaccumulation status of heavy metal pollution load in the tissues of shellfishes from polluted regions of the lakes from different part of the world noor and asmat 2017 nascimento et al 2017 umunnakwe and ogamba 2013 kaoud and eldahshan 2010 the pattern of heavy metal accumulation in the tiger prawn penaeus monodon from different regions of ashtamudi also revealed the presence of heavy metal like cadmium chromium copper zinc and lead sherly and lekshmi 2017 the cadmium chromium and lead concentrations in the muscle of crab from two sites of ashtamudi wetland are above the levels of concern for human consumption as defined by the fao 1984 2012 the studied crab species in this wetland system are being exploited for human consumption in indigenous market as well as export market in the present study muscle tissues of crab species were analyzed because these concentrations provide information on the potential risk to the crab themselves or to other organisms that consume them especially humans heavy metals like chromium and cadmium which were found to be above the permissible limit in the sediment sample were also reflect in the muscle of the crab in higher concentrations metal concentrations in the tissue of fish varies significantly among different studies may be due to differences in metal concentrations and chemical characteristics of water from which fish were sampled metabolism ecological requirements and feeding types of fishes and also the season in which studies were carried out canli and atli 2003 erdoĝrul and ates 2006 the principle pathways for metal uptake found to be highly variable over the range of metals contaminant levels specific ecological situation and fish species studied thus the metal concentrations in fish tissue may appear to be the result of a complex interaction of many factors alam et al 2002 3 3 histological analysis a number of histological alterations which deviate from the normal structural patterns were noticed in the muscle of scylla serrata collected from the polluted regions of the lake under transmission electron microscopic investigation tem muscles of s serrata collected from site 3 revealed a normal histological architecture made up of muscle cells containing contractile filaments the thread like myosin filaments and proteins in the muscle tissue form a sheath of multi nucleate cells which assemble into fibers called myofibrils fig 2 a muscle of s serrata collected from site 1 showed several structural changes under tem analysis oedema hyaline degeneration and splitting of muscle fibers fig 2b appearance of granular materials fig 2c focal areas of necrosis and hyaline degeneration were also noticed fig 2d loss of normal state of myofibrils with appearance of dark circular patches was other predominant observations fig 2e muscle of s serrata from site 2 also reveals many abnormal features like fragmentation of muscle fibers haemocytic intrusion fig 2f vacuolar degeneration fig 2g hyaline degeneration with appearance of dark patches fig 2h and atrophy fig 2i many structural alterations such as atrophy vacuolization extensive necrosis and disrupted muscle bundles were observed in the muscle of s serrata due to the effect of heavy metals like cu pb zn cd collected from pulicat lake lourduraj et al 2014 loosely packed and disintegrated muscle fibres were noticed in the selected fish species glenn et al 2013 the heavy metals cd and pb caused similar type of alternations in liver gills and kidney of leuciobarbus xanthopterus sanaa 2020 morphological alterations caused by heavy metal pollution on gills and fins were noticed in tiger prawns penaeus monodon and etroplus suratensis collected from the polluted regions of ashtamudi lake sherly et al 2015 sherly and lekshmi 2017 zn accumulation resulted in significant alternations in the structure of the muscle such as disintegration of myofibrils vacuolation in myofibrils necrosis atrophy in mud crab scylla serrata ramya et al 2019 4 conclusion growing pressure of anthropogenic influences continuously threatened the life of aquatic organisms inhabiting in the water system which further leads to many toxic effects on them bioaccumulation status of heavy metals in the muscle of scylla serrata with respect to site is in the order of site1 site2 site 3 the shell fishes inhabiting in the polluted regions are more prone to heavy metal accumulation and subsequent alterations in its histological structure if the discharge of aquatic pollutants into the water bodies goes on at an elevated level it will seriously affects the survival of the aquatic organisms knowledge of metal concentrations in shell fishes and fin fishes are important for both with respect to nature management and human consumption through the consumption of the affected shellfishes pollutants can even reach higher organisms including humans the future of mankind is inevitably linked to the protection of ecosystems

molecular formula is c28h31cin2o3 and molecular weight is 479 02 g mol 1 it is purchased from sd fine chem limited preparation of stock solution 1 0 g of rhodamine 6g was dissolved in one liter of distilled water the prepared solution of rd6g has ph 4 7 so it was adjusted to ph 8 using 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 n naoh the constant ph 5 was maintained throughout all experiments adsorbent preparation litchi chinensis fruit was purchased from local market in kadapa andhra pradesh india the litchi fruits peel which was a waste is used for the preparation of adsorbent the obtained peel was washed with distilled water thrice to remove dust particles and dried it in hot air oven at 75 c for 48 hrs the peel was grinded and sieved with 100 µm sieve finally the dried powered was used as an adsorbent batch adsorption the batch adsorption study was conducted in 250 ml conical flasks filled with 50 ml of adsorbate at different initial concentrations of 20 50 mg l for r6g dose of 300 mg was added into the solution and agitated at 180 rpm using rotary shaker the solution was separated from the adsorbent by the centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 20 min the absorbance of dye was measured by a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer lab india uv 3000 at 528 nm for rd6g see fig 1 result and discussion instrumentation sem micrographs were compared with rd6g dye loaded litchi chinensis adsorbent the micrographs showed litchi chinensis peel powder surface have rough and porous before adsorption so here is a good possibility for the dye to be absorbed into these pores after adsorption the surface becomes smooth and surface of the adsorbent has covered with dye molecules these differences in the pores and surface irregularities of adsorbent due to the presence of dye molecules fig 2 a b the edx spectra revealed the presence of carbon c oxygen o2 magnesium mg and potassium k on both loaded as well as unloaded surface of the adsorbent samples which may play a possible role in the process of adsorption of dye molecules fig 3 a b the availability and active participation of the functional groups on the surface of the litchi chinensis peel were determined by ftir spectral studies fig 4 a b the band at 3654 and 1639 cm 1 are correspond to the oh bond vibrations the peaks at 2934 cm 1 represents the stretching of ch bonds in the ch2 and ch3 groups and the peaks at 2132 cm 1 designates the presence of the co2 in the surroundings of the sample which can be nullify by baseline correction the band at 1737 cm 1 was assigned for the co bending vibrations in the cooh carboxylic

co bonds the ch bond shift was observed from 2850 to 2844 cm 1 due to the transmittance changes which indicate the occurrence of methoxyl group as a result of the removal of lignin and lipids adeleke et al 2019 these observations were depicted that the oh carboxyl and carbonyl groups played influencing role in the adsorption and showed the profound effects on the surface modification on the litchi chinensis peel with rd6g the fig 5 a b represent two diffractogram where loaded litchi chinensis adsorbent was compared with raw adsorbent the attainment of differential peaks with spinal structures corresponds to the successful grafting of dye molecules on the surface of the adsorbent before adsorption the obtained sharp peak 2θ at the intensity of 22 079 and 24 433 22 212 and 24 433 are referred to the presence of rhd6g dye molecules fig 5a b hence it can be obtained that this was due to the adsorption occurred onto the surface of the litchi chinensis peel powder effect of dye initial concentration and contact time the adsorption of rd6g by litchi chinensis peel powder in time with the initial concentration was studied the experimental results described that adsorption of dye onto the adsorbent material increased with time and the equilibrium was found to be 20 30 40 and 60 min for 20 30 40 and 50 mg l of dye concentration respectively while the uptake was increased at equilibrium from 3 0 mg g to 5 8 mg g with an increase of concentration from 20 mg l to 50 mg l fig 6 these findings are in accordance with the results observed by magnetic grapheme oxide gautam et al 2020 when the efficiency of the rd6g adsorption on to the magnetic graphene oxide rapidly increased in the initial stage of contact time and remained unchanged after 30 min of adsorption bhullar et al 2018 has observed that 60 of rd6g dye removal was achieved in first hour of the experiment by composite hydrogel then after the removal became slow and took 8 hrs to reach 90 of dye removal this might be because of the freely available active sites at in the initial stages of adsorption while as time increases after 60 min the adsorption became resistance due to low binding sites similar findings are noticed in trichoderma harzianum mycelia waste sadhasivam et al 2007 centella asiatica nirmala et al 2016 effect of adsorbent dose on removal of rhodamine 6 g adsorption investigations were arrangement with various amounts of litchi chinensis peel powder 100 200 300 400 and 500 mg 50 ml and rd6g concentration 20 to 50 mg l the percent removal of rd6g increased with the increase in adsorbent dose and reached a persistent value after a particular adsorbent dose fig 7 a larger mass of litchi chinensis could adsorb larger amount of rd6g because of the availability of extra surface area of the adsorbent maximum removal of rd6g were found to be around 93 83 for the litchi chinensis for the initial concentration of 20 mg l similar results are also observed in biopolymer based composite hydrogel navneet and kaur 2017 litchi chinensis sirisha et al 2019 effect of temperature in this study it was examined that temperature effects on interaction of adsorbent and adsorbate the amount of dye removal at equilibrium increased from 3 02 mg g to 3 036 mg g for rd6g with the slightly increase in dye concentration at different temperature 320 400 and 50 c fig 8 adsorption kinetic studies the adsorption kinetics data which were obtained from the experiments were analyzed in terms of pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models results obtained from the calculations table 1 reveal that the correlation coefficient r2 values for the pseudo second order model 0 999 0 999 0 999 and 0 999 were larger in comparison to the r2 from the first order model 0 835 0 864 0 940 and 0 942 and the estimated qe values are observed to be in good agreement with experimental values of the adsorbent qe fig 9 the usability of this model suggest that the rate limiting step may be chemisorption involving valancy forces via sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and adsorbate ho and mckay 1998 this is in accord once with the studies of rd6g adsorption onto candle shoot virendra singh and vaish 2018 clitoria fairchildiana cf pods as low cost adsorbent silva et al 2020 graphite nagaraju sykam et al 2019 and magnetic graphene oxide gautam et al 2020 rh6g of pseudo second order kinetic model equation can be represented by the following equation 1 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order sorption mg g qe is the amount of rh6g adsorbed at equilibrium and t is time required adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm demonstrates the particular relation between the concentration of adsorbate and its degree of collection onto adsorbent surface at constant temperature entire experiments were carried out at room temperature 32 c the basic assumption of adsorption isotherm is that every adsorption site is equivalent and the binding ability of a particle is independent of whether or not adjacent sites are occupied shukla and pai 2005 navneet and kaur 2017 three isotherm models were used to fit the adsorption data i e langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich dr these parameters are tabulated table 2 langmuir isotherm expressed monolayer adsorption on to surface this model suppose adsorbate molecules can only gathers on one localized site without lateral interaction between the adsorbed molecules even on the nearby sites as well it gathers no further adsorption that can occur after equilibrium langmuir isotherm recommended the adsorption is favorable or not using the dimensionless constant separation factor rl value indicates adsorption isotherm is favorable unfavorable or linear adsorption rh6g shows very well fitted to the langmuir isotherm model fig 10 and its equation can be explained by the following equation 2 c e q e 1 q 0 b c e q 0 where ce is the equilibrium concentration of rd6g dye in the solution mg l qe is the amount of dye adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent mg g litchi peel q0 is the amount of adsorption capacity mg g b is a constant that relates to the heat of adsorption l mg freundlich isotherm used to illuminates the adsorption characteristics for the heterogeneous system dubinin radushkevich isotherm explains the adsorption mechanism with energy distribution onto a surface this is in accord to studies of rd6g adsorption onto acid treated banana peel oyekanmi et al 2019 candle shoot singh and vaish 2018 znfe2o4 nano composite konicki et al 2017 some adsorbents of adsorption capacities of rd6g are reported table 3 effectct of ph adsorption studies adsorption and desorption is the most important parameter effect of initial solution ph was investigated using various ph values in the range of 2 9 the initial rd6g dye concentration of 20 and 30 mg l and the removal rate decreased from 90 9 to 86 3 for 30 mg l of rd6g concentration for litchi chinensis the adsorption of cationic dye percent removal of ph 8 shows the higher percent removal compared to other ph fig 11 the solutions of ph were adjusted to the required ph by adding drops of 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl the zero point charge phzpc of litchi chinensis was found to be 7 0 the adsorption sites on the adsorbent less than ph 7 0 is positive in nature and greater than 7 0 is negative in nature with decrease of the solution ph positive surface charge molecules of litchi chinensis get attracted with negative charge of rd6g molecules under electrostatic force of attraction and it favors greater adsorption of rd6g similar findings are seen in clitoria fairchildiana cf pods as low cost adsorbent silva et al 2020 litchi chinensis peel is a novel treatment hinge et al 2016 sirisha et al 2019 desorption studies desorption studies show that recycling of the spent adsorbent and the recovery of the rd6g would make the treatment process more economical in complete desorption of rd6g at different concentration suggests that the chemisorptions was the major mode of adsorption similar results are observed in sapindus emarginatus jasper and sumithra 2020 litchi chinensis sirisha et al 2019 magnetic iron oxide ranjbari et al 2015 studies of thermodynamics of adsorption thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption of rd6g on litchi chinensis calculated by the following equation table 4 3 δ g r t ln k c where r is gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the temperature in k 4 log k c δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 r t the values of δho and δso were determined from the slope and intercept of van t hoff plots log kcvs 1 t negative values of δho suggest the exothermic nature of adsorption and δgo 40 kj mol 1 indicate spontaneous and favorable nature of adsorption and beneficial activity under the experimental conditions it involved in physical adsorption the positive value of δso with litchi chinensis indicates increased randomness at the solid solution interface similar findings are seen in water treatment sludge rashed et al 2016 clitoria fairchildiana cf pods as low cost adsorbent silva et al 2020 olive tree pruning waste anastopoulos et al 2018 conclusion the study noticed that litchi chinensis acts as a good adsorbent for the removal of rd6g from aqueous solutions the adsorption kinetics data followed pseudo second order kinetic model with high correlation coefficient almost reaching a unit value for rd6g the removal as a result increases with increase in adsorbent dosage the optimum operational ph was evaluated as 5 0 of rd6g the use of waste litchi chinensis peel can be successfully taken in treating large amount of dye wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

be because of the freely available active sites at in the initial stages of adsorption while as time increases after 60 min the adsorption became resistance due to low binding sites similar findings are noticed in trichoderma harzianum mycelia waste sadhasivam et al 2007 centella asiatica nirmala et al 2016 effect of adsorbent dose on removal of rhodamine 6 g adsorption investigations were arrangement with various amounts of litchi chinensis peel powder 100 200 300 400 and 500 mg 50 ml and rd6g concentration 20 to 50 mg l the percent removal of rd6g increased with the increase in adsorbent dose and reached a persistent value after a particular adsorbent dose fig 7 a larger mass of litchi chinensis could adsorb larger amount of rd6g because of the availability of extra surface area of the adsorbent maximum removal of rd6g were found to be around 93 83 for the litchi chinensis for the initial concentration of 20 mg l similar results are also observed in biopolymer based composite hydrogel navneet and kaur 2017 litchi chinensis sirisha et al 2019 effect of temperature in this study it was examined that temperature effects on interaction of adsorbent and adsorbate the amount of dye removal at equilibrium increased from 3 02 mg g to 3 036 mg g for rd6g with the slightly increase in dye concentration at different temperature 320 400 and 50 c fig 8 adsorption kinetic studies the adsorption kinetics data which were obtained from the experiments were analyzed in terms of pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models results obtained from the calculations table 1 reveal that the correlation coefficient r2 values for the pseudo second order model 0 999 0 999 0 999 and 0 999 were larger in comparison to the r2 from the first order model 0 835 0 864 0 940 and 0 942 and the estimated qe values are observed to be in good agreement with experimental values of the adsorbent qe fig 9 the usability of this model suggest that the rate limiting step may be chemisorption involving valancy forces via sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and adsorbate ho and mckay 1998 this is in accord once with the studies of rd6g adsorption onto candle shoot virendra singh and vaish 2018 clitoria fairchildiana cf pods as low cost adsorbent silva et al 2020 graphite nagaraju sykam et al 2019 and magnetic graphene oxide gautam et al 2020 rh6g of pseudo second order kinetic model equation can be represented by the following equation 1 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order sorption mg g qe is the amount of rh6g adsorbed at equilibrium and t is time required adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm demonstrates the particular relation between the concentration of adsorbate and its degree of collection onto adsorbent surface at constant temperature entire experiments were carried out at room temperature 32 c the basic assumption of adsorption isotherm is that every adsorption site is equivalent and the binding ability of a particle is independent of whether or not adjacent sites are occupied shukla and pai 2005 navneet and kaur 2017 three isotherm models were used to fit the adsorption data i e langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich dr these parameters are tabulated table 2 langmuir isotherm expressed monolayer adsorption on to surface this model suppose adsorbate molecules can only gathers on one localized site without lateral interaction between the adsorbed molecules even on the nearby sites as well it gathers no further adsorption that can occur after equilibrium langmuir isotherm recommended the adsorption is favorable or not using the dimensionless constant separation factor rl value indicates adsorption isotherm is favorable unfavorable or linear adsorption rh6g shows very well fitted to the langmuir isotherm model fig 10 and its equation can be explained by the following equation 2 c e q e 1 q 0 b c e q 0 where ce is the equilibrium concentration of rd6g dye in the solution mg l qe is the amount of dye adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent mg g litchi peel q0 is the amount of adsorption capacity mg g b is a constant that relates to the heat of adsorption l mg freundlich isotherm used to illuminates the adsorption characteristics for the heterogeneous system dubinin radushkevich isotherm explains the adsorption mechanism with energy distribution onto a surface this is in accord to studies of rd6g adsorption onto acid treated banana peel oyekanmi et al 2019 candle shoot singh and vaish 2018 znfe2o4 nano composite konicki et al 2017 some adsorbents of adsorption capacities of rd6g are reported table 3 effectct of ph adsorption studies adsorption and desorption is the most important parameter effect of initial solution ph was investigated using various ph values in the range of 2 9 the initial rd6g dye concentration of 20 and 30 mg l and the removal rate decreased from 90 9 to 86 3 for 30 mg l of rd6g concentration for litchi chinensis the adsorption of cationic dye percent removal of ph 8 shows the higher percent removal compared to other ph fig 11 the solutions of ph were adjusted to the required ph by adding drops of 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl the zero point charge phzpc of litchi chinensis was found to be 7 0 the adsorption sites on the adsorbent less than ph 7 0 is positive in nature and greater than 7 0 is negative in nature with decrease of the solution ph positive surface charge molecules of litchi chinensis get attracted with negative charge of rd6g molecules under electrostatic force of attraction and it favors greater adsorption of rd6g similar findings are seen in clitoria fairchildiana cf pods as low cost adsorbent silva et al 2020 litchi chinensis peel is a novel treatment hinge et al 2016 sirisha et al 2019 desorption studies desorption studies show that recycling of the spent adsorbent and the recovery of the rd6g would make the treatment process more economical in complete desorption of rd6g at different concentration suggests that the chemisorptions was the major mode of adsorption similar results are observed in sapindus emarginatus jasper and sumithra 2020 litchi chinensis sirisha et al 2019 magnetic iron oxide ranjbari et al 2015 studies of thermodynamics of adsorption thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption of rd6g on litchi chinensis calculated by the following equation table 4 3 δ g r t ln k c where r is gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the temperature in k 4 log k c δ s 2 303 r δ h 2 303 r t the values of δho and δso were determined from the slope and intercept of van t hoff plots log kcvs 1 t negative values of δho suggest the exothermic nature of adsorption and δgo 40 kj mol 1 indicate spontaneous and favorable nature of adsorption and beneficial activity under the experimental conditions it involved in physical adsorption the positive value of δso with litchi chinensis indicates increased randomness at the solid solution interface similar findings are seen in water treatment sludge rashed et al 2016 clitoria fairchildiana cf pods as low cost adsorbent silva et al 2020 olive tree pruning waste anastopoulos et al 2018 conclusion the study noticed that litchi chinensis acts as a good adsorbent for the removal of rd6g from aqueous solutions the adsorption kinetics data followed pseudo second order kinetic model with high correlation coefficient almost reaching a unit value for rd6g the removal as a result increases with increase in adsorbent dosage the optimum operational ph was evaluated as 5 0 of rd6g the use of waste litchi chinensis peel can be successfully taken in treating large amount of dye wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

in improving our understanding on the impact of natural and human activities on houston watersheds keywords heavy metals land cover change nutrient pollution spatial distribution socio economic characteristics 1 introduction heavy metals and metalloids are naturally occurring elements having a high atomic weight and a density greater than 5 0 g cm 3 tchounwou et al 2012 the various anthropogenic sources of heavy metals as well as their toxic persistent and bio accumulative nature raises concern over the potential effects on human health and the environment factors influencing toxicity are dependent on the dose route of exposure chemical species and the age gender genetics and nutritional status of exposed individuals ali et al 2019 because of their high degree of toxicity pb cd hg cr and as are listed as priority pollutants by the environmental protection agency epa wuana and okieimen 2011 heavy metals can enter water bodies by industrial and consumer waste or through leaching of metals from soil and releasing them into streams lakes rivers and groundwater to a lesser extent they enter our bodies via food drinking water and air tchounwou et al 2012 heavy metal sources include mining and petrochemical industries industrial production untreated sewage sludge and varied other sources such as metal piping traffic and combustion by products from coal burning power stations dibofori orji et al 2019 it is therefore important to assess and monitor the concentrations of potentially toxic heavy metals in various environmental media this study provides an analysis of the occurrence of heavy metals in soil and water measured over two different time periods across different watersheds in southeastern texas water is designated as the life blood of the biosphere because its properties contribute to the suitability of earth as an environment for life ali et al 2019 heavy metals are one of the most hazardous pollutants in water and have been found in various water bodies such as lakes zeng and wu 2013 rivers and reservoirs xia et al 2018 resulting in deterioration of water quality they can be observed in the dissolved phase shotyk et al 2017 suspended particle phase rügner et al 2019 and sedimentary phases li et al 2019a li et al 2019b in water systems the dissolved phase heavy metals are generally more toxic than the other two phases shotyk et al 2017 soil is the most critical interface in an ecosystem as it can be a source of pollution to surface water ground water sediment and living organisms xu et al 2013 major sources of soil heavy metal pollution include industrial and municipal effluent fertilizers and pesticides heavy metal sources have different characteristics and patterns of contaminations depending on the land use patterns gaw et al 2006 soil type as well as its physical and chemical parameters can also affect levels of elemental concentrations significantly comprehensive understanding of factors that affect heavy metal residues in soils will help in understanding the fate of metals in soils and in the examination of possible methods of remediation of contaminated soils the texas commission on environmental quality tceq has developed water quality criteria in the texas surface water quality standards tswqs for metals tceq 2021 the tswqs establish explicit goals for the quality of streams

consistent with the sustainable economic development of the state land cover is the surface components of land on earth such as vegetation water soil living organisms and other structural features created by human activities gao and o neill 2020 land cover change lcc is one of the most observable rapid irreversible and impactful changes occurring in urban and suburban watersheds urbanization deforestation mining extensive agricultural practices and economic growth are the main influences on land cover conversions popov et al 2021 the need has arisen to manage the urban environment sustainably because of rapid population growth and the increased ability to access and utilize natural resources gao and o neill 2020 the rates and trends of lcc are factors affecting discharge and water quality in watersheds these changes can affect stream flow surface runoff infiltration rate ground water recharge and water quality popov et al 2021 surface runoff is a major source of water pollution especially during severe storm events water runs along land surfaces picking up litter chemicals fertilizers and other toxic substances that can harm an entire ecosystem there are several factors contributing to the amount of runoff in an area including rainfall amount vegetation soil type shape and size of catchment and land use usgs 2019 the decrease in vegetative surfaces results in high surface runoff and low water retention in watersheds sulamo et al 2021 vegetative surfaces can slow down the flow of runoff and allow more time for infiltration into the soil therefore studying the impacts of land cover change is crucial to solving a variety of problems including the design of hydraulic structures urban and highway drainage flood control planning source pollution and the evaluation of other environmental impacts sulamo et al 2021 significant increase in urban impervious surfaces along with reduction of vegetative surfaces was seen in brays buffalo and greens bayou watersheds of houston bukunmi omidiran and sridhar 2021 sridhar et al 2020 the goal of this research is to comprehensively assess land cover changes and development density in correlation with nutrient and metal pollution in surface soils and water of sims and vince bayou watersheds the specific objectives are to 1 determine nutrient and heavy metal concentrations in soil and water samples

watersheds 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study areas this study was conducted in the humid subtropical climate region of greater houston located in southeast texas two urban watersheds sims bayou watershed sbw and vince bayou watershed vbw were assessed to determine the level of heavy metal contamination amount of land cover change socio economic dynamics and human health risk from heavy metal exposure the sbw and vbw fig 1 are highly developed urban watersheds located in the southern region of harris county hcfcd 2021 the sbw covers approximately 243 square kilometers and has two major streams sims and berry bayous this watershed has a long history of flooding where structural flooding has damaged many homes along sims bayou and its tributaries during numerous storm events hcfcd 2020a the vbw covers about 41 4 square kilometers and includes two main streams vince bayou and little vince bayou the existing floodplains of this watershed has produced out of bank flooding conditions under many severe storm events hcfcd 2020b the typical flora of the sbw and vbw include several mature stands of coastal floodplain hardwood forests along with woody shrubs and smaller trees serving as understory the tree canopy provides shelter for various wading birds and raptors while the thickets and tall grasses provide habitat for songbirds migrating warblers and sparrows hcfcd 2020a 2020b the weedy habitat provides cover for caterpillars and adult butterflies 2 2 data collection and analysis soil and water samples were collected in fall of 2020 and spring of 2021from

6 of residents were identified as black 29 0 hispanic residents 25 6 white residents 2 5 asian residents and 0 3 all other races fig 7 however according to the 2020 census sbw experienced a significant shift in racial diversity by census year 2020 hispanic residents accounted for 56 5 of the total population while asian and all other race residents slightly increased to 2 6 and 1 7 respectively fig 7 however there was a decrease in both black 33 6 and white 5 5 residents in the watershed the median household income for the watershed increased from 24 531 in 1990 to 47 188 in

texas median income for both years 3 1 5 health risk assessment of heavy metals in surface soils three major exposure pathways are considered for the human health risk assessment including ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation results of the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks posed by six priority heavy metals cd cr cu ni pb and zn are shown in table 7 hazard index hi values were 1 for both sims and vince bayou soils indicating no significant risk of non carcinogenic effects however the lcr and tlcr values for cd cr and ni were greater than 1x10 4 indicating risks for carcinogenic effects via ingestion carcinogenic health risks were found for sb and vb in soils collected from sbw health risks values for cd cr and ni at the downstream sb2 2 location were 1 61 to 2

exceeded their corresponding background values found in texas specific soil tceq 1999 for most of the samples collected the concentrations for cr were also at levels that can affect soil invertebrates and or terrestrial plants the cr concentrations 19 4 35 8 mg kg 1 in soil samples collected from the downstream sb2 2 location for sb and the midstream vb5 1 location for vb were significantly higher soil cr concentrations above 1 mg kg 1 for plants can cause harmful effects tceq 2021 in plants cr can induce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation thereby causing severe damage to cell membranes asati 2016 the spatial distribution of heavy metals in water and soil sample collected from sb were highest at the midstream sb16 9 location which closely correlated with the numerous upstream municipal solid waste sites and wastewater outfalls higher heavy metal and nutrient concentrations in soil samples collected from vb was at the midstream vb5 1 location compared to other locations 4 2 land cover change analysis and socio economic dynamics over the last four decades the most significant changes occurred within the regions classified as high and low vegetative surfaces in the landcover class of high vegetative surface the area decreased by 71 7 in sbw while vbw experienced a 73 2 decrease non vegetative surfaces increased in both sbw and vbw by 60 3 and 35 7 respectively the increase in the impervious surfaces are a result of intensive residential development and the extension of road networks within these watersheds the u s census data manson et al 2021 revealed a boom in population for each watershed from 1990 to 2020 the largest population increase occurred in the sbw with 27 9 while vbw increased by 9 1 both watersheds have shown a gradual large scale emigration of white residents leading to racial or ethnic shifts for example white residents in the vbw decreased from 63 9 in census year 1990 to 15 0 by 2020 and sbw decreased from 25 6 to 5 5 these watersheds have a majority minority population as of census year 2020 in urban areas problems such as overcrowding ethnocultural diversity and physical deterioration of areas with large dense populations are thought to contribute to the emigration of white residents i e white flight or exodus kye 2018 income levels for residents in these urban watersheds were at or below the median income reported for texas residents as of census year 2020 4 3 risk assessment analysis children under the age of 6 years are most susceptible to long term cancer risks from heavy metal exposure cui et al 2018 other harmful effects include mental retardation neurocognitive disorders behavioral disorders respiratory problems and cardiovascular diseases osman et al 2019 the health risk assessment revealed that cancer risks at sbw and vbw exceeded the acceptable level 1x10 4 for children from ingestion of soil contaminated with cd cr and ni risk levels for soil samples collected at vbw range from 1 21x10 4 to 2 44x10 4 and at sbw risk range from 1 04x10 4 to 2 15x10 4 health risks from exposure to cd include renal damage osteoporosis pediatric cancer cardiovascular diseases and stunted growth osman et al 2019 health effects from ingestion of cr include cancer and adverse gastrointestinal hematological immune kidney and liver effects osman et al 2019 the most common effect from ni exposure is allergic reactions individual that are highly sensitive to ni may experience an allergic reaction after consuming food or water or breathe dust containing ni atsdr 2005 5 conclusion our chemical analysis revealed that the cu ni pb zn p and n in water samples collected from sb and vb were found to be at levels that can pose a threat for aquatic organisms higher metal concentrations in water samples were found in sb compared to concentrations found in vb in soil samples cr cu ni pb and zn were significantly enriched compared to the background levels occurring naturally in texas soils particularly in the sb intense urbanization and industrialization in both watersheds have contributed to the deterioration of soil and water quality overall land cover change patterns were similar for both watersheds with vegetative surfaces decreasing significantly while impervious surfaces increased over the past three decades the increase in impervious surfaces correlated with rapid population growth indicating urban expansion throughout the region land cover changes was significant with sbw having the higher conversion of vegetative surfaces compared to vbw both watersheds experienced extensive population growth with sbw adding 3111 residents per year and vbw adding 336 residents per year over a 30 year period from 1990 to 2020 the watersheds were shown to have mostly minority residents who earn less than the median household income reported for the state of texas human health risk assessments were calculated to determine the individuals most at risk from exposure to heavy metal pollution results revealed that cd cr and ni being the primary metals of concern for children under age 6 years health risks were found to be higher in vb compared to the risk revealed

20057,intense urbanization and increased industrialization in urban and suburban watersheds result in the decrease of vegetation and increase in impermeable surfaces contributing to the decline of soil and water quality the goal of this study is to investigate the impact of urbanization and industrialization on urban watersheds the specific objectives are to 1 determine nutrient and heavy metal concentrations in soil and water samples along sims bayou sb and vince bayou vb 2 analyze land cover changes over the last 3 decades in each watershed and 3 evaluate socio economic characteristics and human health risks within these watersheds triplicate soil and water samples were collected from downstream midstream and upstream locations during the fall and spring seasons along both bayous the samples were analyzed to determine elemental concentrations using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms and total carbon and nitrogen tcn analyzer landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli tirs images were used to derive thematic land cover maps using erdas imagine v16 5 software the elemental concentrations were interpolated to spatial maps for distribution analysis using esri arcgis 10 8 software the chemical analysis of water samples collected from sb and vb revealed that the n p cu ni pb and zn concentrations were found at elevated levels that can pose threat for aquatic organisms among soil samples the concentrations of cr cu ni pb and zn exceeded the levels of soil background concentrations of texas land cover change patterns were similar for both watersheds with high vegetative surfaces decreasing and low vegetative surfaces increasing significantly over the past three decades both watersheds experienced an increase in total population with sb watershed increasing 27 9 and vb watershed increasing 9 1 from 1990 to 2020 health risk assessments revealed risks for cd cr and ni in soil via ingestion for children under age 6 in both bayous this research is critical in improving our understanding on the impact of natural and human activities on houston watersheds keywords heavy metals land cover change nutrient pollution spatial distribution socio economic characteristics 1 introduction heavy metals and metalloids are naturally occurring elements having a high atomic weight and a density greater than 5 0 g cm 3 tchounwou et al 2012 the various anthropogenic sources of heavy metals as well as their toxic persistent and bio accumulative nature raises concern over the potential effects on human health and the environment factors influencing toxicity are dependent on the dose route of exposure chemical species and the age gender genetics and nutritional status of exposed individuals ali et al 2019 because of their high degree of toxicity pb cd hg cr and as are listed as priority pollutants by the environmental protection agency epa wuana and okieimen 2011 heavy metals can enter water bodies by industrial and consumer waste or through leaching of metals from soil and releasing them into streams lakes rivers and groundwater to a lesser extent they enter our bodies via food drinking water and air tchounwou et al 2012 heavy metal sources include mining and petrochemical industries industrial production untreated sewage sludge and varied other sources such as metal piping traffic and combustion by products from coal burning power stations dibofori orji et al 2019 it is therefore important to assess and monitor the concentrations of potentially toxic heavy metals in various environmental media this study provides an analysis of the occurrence of heavy metals in soil and water measured over two different time periods across different watersheds in southeastern texas water is designated as the life blood of the biosphere because its properties contribute to the suitability of earth as an environment for life ali et al 2019 heavy metals are one of the most hazardous pollutants in water and have been found in various water bodies such as lakes zeng and wu 2013 rivers and reservoirs xia et al 2018 resulting in deterioration of water quality they can be observed in the dissolved phase shotyk et al 2017 suspended particle phase rügner et al 2019 and sedimentary phases li et al 2019a li et al 2019b in water systems the dissolved phase heavy metals are generally more toxic than the other two phases shotyk et al 2017 soil is the most critical interface in an ecosystem as it can be a source of pollution to surface water ground water sediment and living organisms xu et al 2013 major sources of soil heavy metal pollution include industrial and municipal effluent fertilizers and pesticides heavy metal sources have different characteristics and patterns of contaminations depending on the land use patterns gaw et al 2006 soil type as well as its physical and chemical parameters can also affect levels of elemental concentrations significantly comprehensive understanding of factors that affect heavy metal residues in soils will help in understanding the fate of metals in soils and in the examination of possible methods of remediation of contaminated soils the texas commission on environmental quality tceq has developed water quality criteria in the texas surface water quality standards tswqs for metals tceq 2021 the tswqs establish explicit goals for the quality of streams rivers lakes and bayous throughout the state standards are developed to maintain the quality of surface waters in texas so that it supports public health recreation and protects aquatic life consistent with the sustainable economic development of the state land cover is the surface components of land on earth such as vegetation water soil living organisms and other structural features created by human activities gao and o neill 2020 land cover change lcc is one of the most observable rapid irreversible and impactful changes occurring in urban and suburban watersheds urbanization deforestation mining extensive agricultural practices and economic growth are the main influences on land cover conversions popov et al 2021 the need has arisen to manage the urban environment sustainably because of rapid population growth and the increased ability to access and utilize natural resources gao and o neill 2020 the rates and trends of lcc are factors affecting discharge and water quality in watersheds these changes can affect stream flow surface runoff infiltration rate ground water recharge and water quality popov et al 2021 surface runoff is a major source of water pollution especially during severe storm events water runs along land surfaces picking up litter chemicals fertilizers and other toxic substances that can harm an entire ecosystem there are several factors contributing to the amount of runoff in an area including rainfall amount vegetation soil type shape and size of catchment and land use usgs 2019 the decrease in vegetative surfaces results in high surface runoff and low water retention in watersheds sulamo et al 2021 vegetative surfaces can slow down the flow of runoff and allow more time for infiltration into the soil therefore studying the impacts of land cover change is crucial to solving a variety of problems including the design of hydraulic structures urban and highway drainage flood control planning source pollution and the evaluation of other environmental impacts sulamo et al 2021 significant increase in urban impervious surfaces along with reduction of vegetative surfaces was seen in brays buffalo and greens bayou watersheds of houston bukunmi omidiran and sridhar 2021 sridhar et al 2020 the goal of this research is to comprehensively assess land cover changes and development density in correlation with nutrient and metal pollution in surface soils and water of sims and vince bayou watersheds the specific objectives are to 1 determine nutrient and heavy metal concentrations in soil and water samples along sims bayou sb and vince bayou vb 2 analyze land cover changes over the last 3 decades in each watershed and 3 evaluate socio economic characteristics and human health risks within these watersheds 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study areas this study was conducted in the humid subtropical climate region of greater houston located in southeast texas two urban watersheds sims bayou watershed sbw and vince bayou watershed vbw were assessed to determine the level of heavy metal contamination amount of land cover change socio economic dynamics and human health risk from heavy metal exposure the sbw and vbw fig 1 are highly developed urban watersheds located in the southern region of harris county hcfcd 2021 the sbw covers approximately 243 square kilometers and has two major streams sims and berry bayous this watershed has a long history of flooding where structural flooding has damaged many homes along sims bayou and its tributaries during numerous storm events hcfcd 2020a the vbw covers about 41 4 square kilometers and includes two main streams vince bayou and little vince bayou the existing floodplains of this watershed has produced out of bank flooding conditions under many severe storm events hcfcd 2020b the typical flora of the sbw and vbw include several mature stands of coastal floodplain hardwood forests along with woody shrubs and smaller trees serving as understory the tree canopy provides shelter for various wading birds and raptors while the thickets and tall grasses provide habitat for songbirds migrating warblers and sparrows hcfcd 2020a 2020b the weedy habitat provides cover for caterpillars and adult butterflies 2 2 data collection and analysis soil and water samples were collected in fall of 2020 and spring of 2021from three separate locations along sims and vince bayous samples were identified by an abbreviated bayou name followed by its distance in kilometers from mouth of the bayou the downstream midstream and upstream locations for sims bayou sb and vince bayou vb were labeled as sb2 2 sb16 9 sb36 1 and vb0 9 vb5 1 vb6 4 respectively soil and water samples were collected in triplicate from each sample locations and the geographic coordinates were recorded using a portable gps device sample preparation and analysis followed methods 3051a and 3015a epa 2020 results obtained from the water and soil sample analysis were compared with ecological screening benchmarks tceq 2021 and nutrient criteria of rivers streams epa 2021b to identify chemicals of concern land cover change analysis provides valuable information for studying topographic changes for rapidly growing metropolitan areas landsat satellite imageries were selected for the periods of 1984 1994 2004 2014 and 2020 for the land cover change analysis the details of the downloaded satellite imagery are given in table 1 images for the study areas were orthorectified to a universal transverse mercator projection using datum wgs world geodetic system 84 zone 15 n using erdas imagine v16 5 software prior to classification the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is essential in identifying the vegetation cover in remotely sensed data obtained from space borne sensors usgs 2021 this index is helpful in the analysis of spatial and temporal changes in vegetation coverage ndvi is expressed as ndvi band 4 band 3 band 4 band 3 for landsat tm images and ndvi band 5 band 4 band 5 band 4 for landsat oli images the ndvi values ranging from 1 to 1 was used to reclassify the imagery and divide into water no vegetation low vegetation and high vegetation classes as shown in table 2 maximum likelihood and supervised classification algorithm based on the ndvi threshold method was used to generate land cover thematic maps the classification results were evaluated using accuracy assessment reference data including google earth images true and false color combination images and base knowledge of the study areas were used for verification purposes and to generate a classification error matrix the land cover maps were evaluated for overall accuracy kappa coefficient producer and user s accuracies social demographic and economic dynamics plays a vital role in spatial and temporal land use and land cover conversions land use and land cover conversions are necessary and important for continued economic development and social progress therefore population data was collected for census years 1990 and 2020 to assess the socio environmental interactions related to urbanization various health problems in urban areas arise from environmental conditions so it is crucial to monitor environmental hazards and human health outcomes health risks of heavy metals in soil from sbw and vbw via ingestion

few in the western region as shown in fig 7 there are significantly smaller populated areas in the central region of the watershed for census year 1990 the racial composition in the sbw shows that 42 6 of residents were identified as black 29 0 hispanic residents 25 6 white residents 2 5 asian residents and 0 3 all other races fig 7 however according to the 2020 census sbw experienced a significant shift in racial diversity by census year 2020 hispanic residents accounted for 56 5 of the total population while asian and all other race residents slightly increased to 2 6 and 1 7 respectively fig 7 however there was a decrease in both black 33 6 and white 5 5 residents in the watershed the median household income for the watershed increased from 24 531 in 1990 to 47 188 in

elevated toxins and bacterial growth that are harmful to humans encounter the polluted water consume tainted fish shellfish or drink contaminated water epa 2021a in soil samples cr cu ni pb and zn exceeded their corresponding background values found in texas specific soil tceq 1999 for most of the samples collected the concentrations for cr were also at levels that can affect soil invertebrates and or terrestrial plants the cr concentrations 19 4 35 8 mg kg 1 in soil samples collected from the downstream sb2 2 location for sb and the midstream vb5 1 location for vb were significantly higher soil cr concentrations above 1 mg kg 1 for plants can cause harmful effects tceq 2021 in plants cr can induce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation thereby causing severe damage to cell membranes asati 2016 the spatial distribution of heavy metals in water and soil sample collected from sb were highest at the midstream sb16 9 location which closely correlated with the numerous upstream municipal solid waste sites and wastewater outfalls higher heavy metal and nutrient concentrations in soil samples collected from vb was at the midstream vb5 1 location compared to other locations 4 2 land cover change analysis and socio economic dynamics over the last four decades the most significant changes occurred within the regions classified as high and low vegetative surfaces in the landcover class of high vegetative surface the area decreased by 71 7 in sbw while vbw experienced a 73 2 decrease non vegetative surfaces increased in both sbw and vbw by 60 3 and 35 7 respectively the increase in the impervious surfaces are a result of intensive residential development and the extension of road networks within these watersheds the u s census data manson et al 2021 revealed a boom in population for each watershed from 1990 to 2020 the largest population increase occurred in the sbw with 27 9 while vbw increased by 9 1 both watersheds have shown a gradual large scale emigration of white residents leading to racial or ethnic shifts for example white residents in the vbw decreased from 63 9 in census year 1990 to 15 0 by 2020 and sbw decreased from 25 6 to 5 5 these watersheds have a majority minority population as of census year 2020 in urban areas problems such as overcrowding ethnocultural diversity and physical deterioration of areas with large dense populations are thought to contribute to the emigration of white residents i e white flight or exodus kye 2018 income levels for residents in these urban watersheds were at or below the median income reported for texas residents as of census year 2020 4 3 risk assessment analysis children under the age of 6 years are most susceptible to long term cancer risks from heavy metal exposure cui et al 2018 other harmful effects include mental retardation neurocognitive disorders behavioral disorders respiratory problems and cardiovascular diseases osman et al 2019 the health risk assessment revealed that cancer risks at sbw and vbw exceeded the acceptable level 1x10 4 for children from ingestion of soil contaminated with cd cr and ni risk levels for soil samples collected at vbw range from 1 21x10 4 to 2 44x10 4 and at sbw risk range from 1 04x10 4 to 2 15x10 4 health risks from exposure to cd include renal damage osteoporosis pediatric cancer cardiovascular diseases and stunted growth osman et al 2019 health effects from ingestion of cr include cancer and adverse gastrointestinal hematological immune kidney and liver effects osman et al 2019 the most common effect from ni exposure is allergic reactions individual that are highly sensitive to ni may experience an allergic reaction after consuming food or water or breathe dust containing ni atsdr 2005 5 conclusion our chemical analysis revealed that the cu ni pb zn p and n in water samples collected from sb and vb were found to be at levels that can pose a threat for aquatic organisms higher metal concentrations in water samples were found in sb compared to concentrations found in vb in soil samples cr cu ni pb and zn were significantly enriched compared to the background levels occurring naturally in texas soils particularly in the sb intense urbanization and industrialization in both watersheds have contributed to the deterioration of soil and water quality overall land cover change patterns were similar for both watersheds with vegetative surfaces decreasing significantly while impervious surfaces increased over the past three decades the increase in impervious surfaces correlated with rapid population growth indicating urban expansion throughout the region land cover changes was significant with sbw having the higher conversion of vegetative surfaces compared to vbw both watersheds experienced extensive population growth with sbw adding 3111 residents per year and vbw adding 336 residents per year over a 30 year period from 1990 to 2020 the watersheds were shown to have mostly minority residents who earn less than the median household income reported for the state of texas human health risk assessments were calculated to determine the individuals most at risk from exposure to heavy metal pollution results revealed that cd cr and ni being the primary metals of concern for children under age 6 years health risks were found to be higher in vb compared to the risk revealed

20058,extreme climate events such as hurricanes and tropical storms can cause acute instability of the hydrologic cycle thereby threatening the sustainability and resiliency of an authentic watershed ecosystem s services a 2011 extreme climate event known as hurricane tropical storm irene irene imposed an acute effect on the quality of the ecosystem services in vermont this risk assessment of the otter creek basin the basin watershed restoration in central vermont included an analysis of the conceptual site model key elements of the strategic plan and potential ecological outcomes the outcome of the ecological restoration of the basin is dependent upon an adaptive management strategy which is implemented through various regulatory policies thereby a systematic literature review slr of regulatory milestone documents released between 1998 and 2019 was completed to characterize and assess the basin s strategic planning efforts and forecasts to operationalize this study a replicable methodology was utilized by using a conceptual site model to assess and forecast data trends analysis of the data trends resulted in an ecological risk assessment of the 2019 tactical basin plan tbp that forecasted 2021 2025 restoration activities currently in a transition phase as a hybrid ecosystem while undergoing restoration activities the basin s restoration strategy could result in the re establishment of the watershed as an authentic ecosystem which can self regulate with appropriate biodiversity and ecosystem function based on past history however without restoration and resiliency a poorly managed strategy could result in a decreased classification toward a novel no analogue ecosystem where keystone species are lost and ecosystem functions are highly altered therefore a successful restoration is essential to elevate the basin from a hybrid ecosystem by restoring its authentic characteristics and regaining its self regulated natural ecosystem services keywords hybrid ecosystem climate extremes watershed management tactical basin plan ecological restoration 1 introduction hurricane irene also known as tropical storm irene irene migrated from the atlantic ocean and delivered a devastating impact on the east coast of the united states of america usa in late august 2011 irene reached climate extremes and thereby provided an example of an extreme climate event due to its type occurrence and the exceedance of a threshold according to the 2014 vermont climate assessment vca report the concept of a climate extreme refers to weather and climate events like hot spells heavy rains periods of drought and flooding and severe storms and most of the scientific literature on climate extremes uses definitions that fall roughly into two categories those related to the probability of occurrence of a certain type of event and those related to exceeding a particular threshold galford et al 2014 irene s effects were felt all the way from puerto rico to the canadian maritime provinces and as far west as the catskill mountains in new york devastating flooding occurred in vermont new hampshire new york and new jersey with damaging storm surge along several east coast states irene s impact caused eight million people to lose power and caused the historic closure of the new york city mass transit system u s department of commerce 2012 according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration irene was ranked as the costliest category one storm to strike the usa causing at least 15 8 billion in damage freedman 2012 scientists are concerned that the increased frequency and intensity of climate events is anticipated to make climate extremes more common through observations taken since the 1940 s rainfall has increased across vermont with the greatest increases occurring in the mountainous regions records show that heavy rainfall events are becoming more common and pose threats of flooding galford et al 2014 extreme climate events similar to irene could make landfall far more frequently causing powerful devastating storm surges every three to 20 years according to researchers from mit and princeton university chu 2012 the research group simulated thousands of storms under different climate conditions concluding that a 500 year flood could with climate change occur once every 25 to 240 years chu 2012 much of irene s most damaging impact was caused by extreme rainfall in new england which resulted in devastating inland flooding making landfall in north carolina in august 2011 irene followed the eastern seaboard causing over 40 deaths due to inland flooding which was especially damaging in vermont and new york u s department of commerce 2012 in vermont irene was considered a 100 year storm event as it was the biggest since 1927 freedman 2012 it also exceeded many thresholds for river levels in vermont causing widespread flash flooding resulting in severe impacts in august 2011 heavy rainfall saturated the ground and as a result flooding was widespread when additional rains fell with the arrival of irene galford et al 2014 this combination of climate factors resulted in an extreme event that reached historic proportions unveiling a new concern for an increase in the connection of extreme events combinations of extreme events are termed connected to convey the diversity and complexity of interacting physical and societal mechanisms that cause their impacts to be amplified relative to the impacts from those same events occurring separately or univariately raymond et al 2020 as the focus of this review article irene provided the climate extreme that connected several ongoing climate concerns in a disastrous manner including saturated floodplain soils extreme precipitation in mountain regions rapid stormwater runoff and pollution flash flooding in rivers and floodplains widespread agricultural nonpoint source pollution and freshwater invasive species the otter creek basin watershed ecosystem the basin in central vermont experienced substantial damage from irene especially within the southern portion of the otter creek watershed in rutland county located in central vermont vdec anr 2012 according to vermont department of environmental conservation vdec one of the main effects of climate change is the disruption of the water cycle and accordingly irene s severe damage from flooding was primarily caused by a disruption of the hydrologic cycle vdec anr 2019 an example of a threshold exceedance occurred in rutland as the highest ever flood crest above flood stage was recorded in 83 years with a total change in water height of 13 feet pealer 2012 records across vermont show that flash flood flows are increasingly common threatening human health in developments that are situated in floodplains vulnerable communities include low income residents in mobile home parks that can be catastrophically destroyed by just one to two feet of flood water galford et al 2014 inland flooding from climate extremes also impacts the quality of the environment in vermont impacts of flooding on water quality continues to be a concern in agricultural areas where the historical legacy of fertilizer use decades ago is resulting in high levels of nutrient run off into rivers and lakes large pulses of nutrients are stripped from soils and transported through waterways during large precipitation events galford et al 2014 in vermont over 450 farms were impacted and over 9 000 acres of farmland were damaged by flooding in many cases during irene s record breaking floods the change in river levels was dramatic in both longevity and magnitude the observed sudden and tremendous increases in river stages in the 2 to 3 h timeframe were more characteristic of flash flooding in small streams than expected behavior from main stem rivers u s department of commerce 2012 climate models project more frequent high flow events and flooding particularly in the winter months as a greater fraction of winter precipitation will fall as rain or freezing rain rather than snow while vermont rivers have sustained higher levels of base flow over recent decades in summer months in contrast to other new england states climate projections show increased potential for short term dry spells too much and too little water pose threats to agriculture forests infrastructure health and homes galford et al 2014 the basin s characteristics include these types of connected climate concerns regarding human health and the environment thereby causing a need for a regulatory strategy to provide greater resiliency this review article provides an overview of the baseline conditions transition phase and restoration strategies for the basin the case study methodology provides a conceptual site model of the basin prior to examining the restoration activities data analysis of milestone documents through a slr assists in providing an ecological risk assessment of the basin see table 1 due to concerns to human health and the environment irene s widespread damage to the basin resulted in a regulatory response of strategies and policies created to implement a comprehensive watershed restoration project this research thereby reviews and assesses the regulatory strategies that are intended to provide resilience against the connected climate conditions that threaten the basin s water quality and hydrologic stability the potential outcome of the restoration of the basin is dependent upon an adaptive management strategy which is implemented through a 2019 tbp vdec anr 2019 the results of the slr are provided through a summary of the basin s tbp regulatory policy decision making process which was used to prioritize restoration actions through implementing strategies over time a summary of the forecasted primary restoration activities scheduled for 2021 to 2025 are provided in the 2019 tbp an upcoming 2025 tbp is anticipated to include an evaluation of five years of restoration activities in comparison to metrics plus public input to finalize the plan the conclusions provide a brief analysis of the five year strategy and potential for renewed restoration of the basin 1 1 conceptual site model the basin is located in vermont usa encompassing an area that is 1 506 km2 936 miles2 and includes the sub watersheds of otter creek plus the smaller lewis creek and little otter creek in the lowlands the main stem of the high quality otter creek is the longest flatwater boating segment in vermont including waterfalls cascades gorges scenic segments class ii iii rapids swimming holes and fishing areas in 1942 lindeman defined the ecosystem as the system composed of physical chemical biological processes active within a space time unit of any magnitude lindeman 1942 the edges of the basin s watershed are determined by physical boundaries that control the water movement within the hydrologic cycle related to the ecosystem therefore a watershed ecosystem has definable boundaries while including both abiotic and biotic components among which nutrients cycle effectively providing a functional system which transfers and circulates energy and matter lindeman 1942 ricklefs miller 2000 fig 1 displays how the appalachian trail which is located along the topographic height of the green mountains creates an east west divide and drainage basin divisions between several adjacent surrounding watersheds the hydrologic flow of the basin in an elliptical shape with long east and west borders and minimal northern and southern borders within the basin hydrologic flow migrates from a highpoint of the appalachian trail along the green mountain drainage divide to the lowlands in the northwest 1 2 ecological restoration prior to the devastating effects of irene that altered the watershed ecosystem the basin exhibited many authentic characteristics of a natural ecosystem in its historic baseline setting one of the largest rivers and watersheds in vermont the otter creek flows through the largest and most biologically diverse swamp complex in new england while intersecting multiple conservation and wildlife management areas the 1 566 acre cornwall swamp wildlife management area was designated in 1974 as a national natural landmark by the u s national park service and includes great diversity of plant life fish and wildlife vtf w n d the 1 100 acres of the otter creek wildlife management area is 70 forested and hosts rich biodiversity of plants and wild animals including river otters muskrats deer black bear and moose vermont pbs 2011 natural ecosystems can be altered and their functioning distorted in four main ways 1 selective removal of key species or changes to habitat 2 addition of new elements 3 changes in the natural disturbance patterns and 4 as a result in the change in climate that occur through human activities dudley 2011 defining the basin s ecosystem s authenticity in the baseline setting is especially useful in understanding the decision making and strategy of prioritizing restoration efforts where they are most likely to be most effective toward restoring the most important natural characteristics of the ecosystem in 2011 a british conservationist defined an authentic ecosystem as a resilient ecosystem with the level of biodiversity and range of ecological interactions that can be predicted as a result of the combination of historic geographic and climate conditions in a particular location million trees 2012 dudley s new definition of authenticity is purposefully broad as it is meant to reflect elements of naturalness in both fairly pristine and radically altered ecosystems as ecosystems react quickly to climate change and old baselines disappear dudley 2011 an authentic ecosystem has the ability to self regulate with appropriate biodiversity and ecosystem function while including new non native species due to geography and climate change allison 2014 once an ecosystem is altered from its authentic characteristics in its natural setting it becomes a hybrid ecosystem until it is restored to the characteristics of an authentic ecosystem or it further degrades to the status of a novel ecosystem allison 2014 in the best case scenario hybrid ecosystems will still contain original keystone species and most of the original ecosystem functions so restoration and management efforts will be best employed to maintain the hybrid ecosystem in good condition supplying desired ecosystem services allison 2014 no longer able to self regulate since irene in 2011 the basin has been in a transitional period renewed restoration provides an opportunity to prepare the basin for climate change extremes while reproducing the watershed s natural characteristics as an authentic ecosystem allison 2014 it is theoretically possible that natural conditions of an authentic ecosystem can be restored as long as the biotic and abiotic conditions don t become altered beyond the status of a hybrid ecosystem allison 2014 sections of the basin have retained or restored some of its natural characteristics during this transitional period therefore acting as a hybrid ecosystem allison 2014 actively providing ecosystem services but which is vulnerable to decline under climate extremes however without successful restoration and resiliency measures to protect the basin against future climate change extremes a future climate event that connects multiple climate change concerns could force the basin to fall into the lower classification of a novel no analogue ecosystem allison 2014 the state of vermont has thereby been regulating the ecological restoration of the basin in an attempt to regain its authenticity regulatory policy is implemented through watershed planning sustainability efforts adaptation and mitigation to better manage environmental concerns and change vulnerability toward resiliency efforts together these efforts are preparing a more stable future for quality of human and non human life in the basin over a 15 year timeline at a minimum resulting in a 2019 tbp 1 3 baseline setting in 1998 an environmental assessment ea report was completed for the basin including a detailed watershed description causes and sources of impairments or threats to river water quality summary of major issues and recommendations the 1998 ea report provided baseline conditions of the basin prior to irene s extreme climate event focusing on stressors caused primarily by land use activities the ea report determined that the major cause of impairment and the largest threat to up to 88 miles of rivers and streams in the basin was streambank erosion that results in siltation or sedimentation which additionally threatens another 152 miles of surface water vermont department of environmental conservation agency of natural resources vdec anr 1998 agriculture comprises 23 of the watershed s property and was the second primary source of impairment causing nutrients and pathogens to stress the ecosystem vermont department of environmental conservation agency of natural resources vdec anr 1998 stormwater runoff in urban areas such as rutland middlebury and vergennes has been increasing due to towns experiencing growth in higher elevations in fact in 1998 urban runoff in rutland city containing toxic materials sediment heated water and pollutants was a significant problem the large number of non point source pollution impacts from agriculture warranted a focus of resources toward technical and funding assistance municipal plans and zoning regulations were required to address these agricultural areas with respect to surface water wetlands floodplains stormwater and hydrology vermont department of environmental conservation agency of natural resources vdec anr 1998 fig 2 displays the baseline condition of major stressors to the basin s ecosystem pre irene plus the boundaries of the 27 sub watersheds within the basin fig 3 displays the baseline condition of the basin s streams that were impacted by agricultural non point source pollution and stormwater runoff prior to irene 2 materials and methods 2 1 research design this review article provides the basin s restoration process as a qualitative case study of a long term restoration of a watershed ecosystem as per the definition of a case study which is to be defined within a bounded system within a bounded time limit of a phenomenon this study is purposefully prepared with a replicable methodology through a slr using a slr this case study analyzes the basin s 1990 s baseline condition up to irene in 2011 restoration activities from 2012 to 2019 and the restoration strategy from 2021 to 2025 provided in the 2019 tbp 2 2 data collection techniques methods for data collection of a qualitative case study are focused on a triangulation of documents improving validity of the review article summary prior to completion of the review article watershed boundaries were overlaid onto a vermont road map providing a bounded limit for various field visits and observations by the researcher to ground truth and verify data collected during the study 2 3 systematic literature review slr this research utilized a slr to investigate a wide range of databases peer reviewed journal articles and institutional reports for inclusive review results in particular this slr reviewed the basin s regulatory milestone documents including policy decision making that led to prioritizing strategies and restoration action 2 4 data analysis methods data analysis included a preliminary evaluation of the baseline conditions of the basin s conceptual site model plus numerous regulatory milestone reports and data from 1990 to 2019 see table 1 an ecological risk assessment of the basin s ecological restoration was provided and an analysis of data related to regulatory decision making in the 2019 tbp was analyzed for effectiveness 3 results and discussion 3 1 ecological risk assessment in august 2011 irene provided a model of an extreme climate event that exceeded a hydrologic threshold for the stability of the basin threatening the ecological status of the watershed and its ability to self regulate exceedance of a threshold acts as a leverage point for an ecological risk assessment for regulatory agencies as the ecosystem must be regulated to preserve and restore its ecosystem services irene provided an example of how an extreme climate event could stress an authentic ecosystem toward losing its keystone species and functionality indefinitely thankfully the basin s wetlands displayed hurricane resistance and helped lessen the massive floods one characteristic sign of an authentic watershed allison 2014 however many of these wetlands have turned to agricultural land and development over time since irene therefore shrinking their total acreage and lessening their capability for future climate events due to climate change there is an 80 increase in the likelihood of severity and amount of flooding in the future increasing risk to ecological and also economic stability vdec anr 2012 the observation of this risk to the basin resulted in regulatory agencies providing strategies and policies into regulatory milestone documents from 2012 to 2019 after irene prioritization of efforts to enhance the basin s resiliency resulted in the may 2012 water quality management plan wqmp the wqmp updated the basin s goals strategies and forecasts provided in previous milestone documents the wqmp was prepared in accordance with state regulations and the federal clean water act the wqmp includes watershed scale planning regarding partnerships water quality issues agricultural runoff phosphorus loading river management runoff restoration and protection efforts vdec anr 2012 as per a regulatory adaptive management approach the wqmp emerged as a critical tool toward prioritizing the basin s flooding attenuation pollution control restoration and resiliency efforts as a successful initial step toward retaining the basin s authenticity the wqmp recommended re classification of high quality waters to outstanding resource waters to protect the basin s numerous recreational and scenic assets abundant wetlands and aquatic wildlife habitat in response to stressed water concerns in altered sections of the basin the wqmp prepared a strategy for complete stormwater system mapping and illicit discharge detection for towns in the basin plus establishing fluvial erosion hazard zones vdec anr 2012 the wqmp concluded that there are many watershed scale scientific and qualitative surface water quality concerns that require better land use solutions in the basin concerns were identified defined prioritized ranked and grouped into upper mid and lower otter creek regions over several years by the wqmp planning stakeholders with community input from the addison county river watch collaborative and the upper otter creek watershed council upper otter creek is generally affected by nonpoint source pollution and inadequate protection practices whereas lower otter creek is generally affected by excessive sedimentation and run off contamination pathogens are considered an important problem throughout the basin as they pose a health risk from contact recreation otter creek natural resources conservation district 2017 as it is the most stressed by contaminants lower otter creek requires further scientific study plus interagency and public partnerships to manage the watershed s stability and quality into the future six water bodies and 4 8 miles of otter creek are impaired as they do not meet vermont water quality standards vwqs vdec anr 2012 in addition 630 square miles of watershed are affected due to a combination of agricultural runoff phosphorus loading developed land runoff geomorphic stability lack of riparian buffers flood resiliency total maximum daily load tmdl pathogenic bacteria using escherichia coli e coli as an indicator and aging wastewater treatment facilities vdec anr 2012 3 2 regulatory policy and implementations the 2014 vca report provided a comprehensive overview of climate change trends and forecasts based on historical data the vca report provided a summary of warming conditions forecasted to threaten the ecological services and the economic stability throughout the basin the vca report also confirmed that climate change is altering the basin s bioregional economies including farming practices growing seasons maple syrup production ski resorts outdoor tourism and the energy sector galford et al 2014 statewide the vca report summarized that the vermont average temperature has increased 1 3 f since 1960 with 50 of effects since 1990 the freezing period has shortened by four days each decade the growing season has lengthened by 3 7 days every decade and annual precipitation has increased 5 9 in especially in mountain regions since 1990 galford et al 2014 for agriculture although an extended growing season from global warming may provide farmers future choices they also must adapt to flash flooding weed growth disease outbreaks and pest infestations future storm events are predicted to threaten the basin s fossil fuel energy infrastructure and cause energy outages within 30 to 40 years forecasted average winter temperatures will cause most winter precipitation to fall as rain reducing winter tourism in the basin galford et al 2014 these climate alterations were thereby predicted to significantly affect the authenticity of the characteristics of the basin s ecosystem services the vermont water quality monitoring program strategy for 2015 to 2020 was created and finalized by vdec between 2015 and 2017 as per vermont s 2015 clean water act and 2016 vwqs the watershed planning program of the water investment division was charged with developing and implementing a tbp through funding partner support agency support and public rulemaking vdec anr 2020 a 2016 vdec assessment and listing methodology established surface water monitoring techniques to evaluate surface waters in comparison to the updated 2016 vwqs a 2017 surface water management strategy established objectives to minimize pollution protect aquatic and riparian habitats and minimize flood hazards the 2019 tbp integrated watershed modeling water quality monitoring pollution source assessments and stakeholder input to document geographically specific actions necessary to protect maintain enhance and restore surface waters vdec anr 2019 additional milestone reports include essential information regarding restoration projects the 2018 clean water initiative investment report cwir from the vermont treasurer provided a summary of results of vermont s various water quality projects by watershed from 2016 to 2018 in table 2 the cwir provides quantitative metrics for restoration activities for agriculture acres of land treated natural resources acres of land restored developed lands and roads acres miles and cubic yards and wastewater number of treatment locations a 2018 rutland regional plan promotes land use practices basin wide including future use of land community involvement recreation agriculture forestry wildlife water quality energy flood resiliency and wastewater systems rutland region planning commission 2018 the 2019 act 76 clean water service delivery act established clean water service providers to maintain non regulatory projects to meet non regulatory phosphorus reduction targets 3 3 tactical basin plan tbp as a culmination of these regulatory efforts the december 2019 tbp provided a summary of the quality of surface water features including an updated baseline of data to recalibrate models to include the effects of hurricane irene vdec anr 2019 the 2019 tbp determined that six waterbodies and 4 8 miles of otter creek are impaired as they do not meet the vwqs plus 630 square miles of watershed is affected due to a combination of agricultural runoff phosphorus loading developed land runoff geomorphic stability lack of riparian buffers flood resiliency tmdl pathogenic bacteria and aging wastewater treatment facilities vdec anr 2019 fig 4 displays the locations of greatest stress on surface water bodies within the basin upper otter creek is generally affected by nonpoint source pollution and inadequate protection practices whereas lower otter creek by excessive sedimentation and run off contamination stressed water in the basin may be caused by stormwater urban runoff agricultural runoff morphological instability pathogens or pollution that creates a need for surface water restoration efforts and regulation in addition contaminated groundwater can occur from point sources affecting surface and drinking water quality point sources affecting surface groundwater and drinking water quality may include waste water treatment systems and rutland county brownfield sites abramovich 2013 point sources are only 10 of the problem therefore long term watershed quality is contingent on increasing best management practices on agricultural lands and developed areas specifically aimed at reducing pollutant loads to the creek 3 4 tbp decision making the 2019 tbp provides an implementation table of 56 recommendations over a 5 year timeline for future restoration activities monitoring evaluation education and outreach for agriculture developed lands wastewater treatment facilities and natural resource restoration projects vdec anr 2019 the projects vary in priority level and not all are expected to be completed over the next five years but each strategy is expected to be pursued and reported upon in a 2025 tbp due to the threat of future climate change events disruption of the water cycle caused by climate change is the primary concern for the hydrologic life cycles of migratory fish birds and insects plus overall water quality in the watershed climate change concerns also include warmer surface waters with less dissolved oxygen for many aquatic species such as brook trout vdec anr 2020 therefore to address a more sustainable restoration the 2019 tbp focuses on maintaining and restoring habitat connectivity increasing river and lake riparian buffers and stream equilibrium conditions to reduce the impact of climate change on the basin s rivers lakes and ponds over a 5 year timeline vdec anr 2019 the 2019 tbp uses the concepts of structured decision making sdm and adaptive management by evaluating existing data and prioritizing restoration activities sdm is defined as a prescriptive approach to environmental decision making that facilitates better choices based both on theories of rational choice and judgmental limitations of decision makers and stakeholders failing et al 2013 as a result of the slr fig 5 was created to display the use of sdm in the 2019 tbp by classifying restoration activities into sectors in the 21st century it will be absolutely essential in all restorations that the basic guiding principles of adaptive management have to occur simultaneously and continuously allison 2014 adaptive management includes the creation of a circular flow chart that includes the concepts of 1 assess problem 2 design 3 implement 4 monitor 5 evaluate and 6 adjust failing et al 2013 the 2019 tbp provides a list of guidelines that are available for navigating the regulations and monitoring individual restoration projects therefore as a result of the slr fig 6 was created to display a flow chart prepared to assess a problem and implement a solution through applying regulatory policy following regulatory guidelines will provide the opportunity to monitor evaluate and adjust restoration activities through applying metrics in an adaptive management approach 3 5 ecological restoration activities fig 7 displays the 2019 tbp s technique of separating activities into sectors focus areas and restoration strategies vdec anr 2020 monitoring kickoff activities was intended to be completed in 2021 as per the tbp strategy however future funding will be prioritized by projects that achieve the highest water quality benefits or cumulative benefits water quality flood resiliency and water resource protection based on metrics after five years the updated 2025 tbp will include 1 a summary of water quality monitoring 2 evaluation of data 3 strategies to protect water quality 4 public input to finalize the plan and 5 plan implementation tracking and project identification vdec anr 2020 a particularly important dilemma for the ecological restoration of the surface water quality in the otter creek basin is phosphorus pollution stemming from agricultural land use one tradeoff that occurs in the otter creek basin is that the vermont agency of agriculture provides exemptions for farmers to spread manure on snow or frozen land gribkoff 2019 these exemptions override the 2016 overhaul of on farm water quality practices required by vermont s clean water act which put restrictions on manure spreading including a prohibition to spread on frozen or snow covered fields at any time in 2018 over 60 exemptions were issued due to early or late snowfalls gribkoff 2019 in 2019 an emergency exemption was provided from november 22 through december 15 2019 due to an early series of snowfall gribkoff 2019 the agency cited 10 in of additional precipitation as a historic and unrelenting weather crisis for dairy farmers gribkoff 2019 a scientific solution to the agricultural trade off is to increase the protection and development of wetlands as a primary restoration activity protecting wetlands provides two essential services 1 absorbing floodwaters and 2 retaining sediment and nutrients to improve the water quality of lakes and rivers usepa 2020 in 2019 the epa awarded 1 323 000 in wetland program development grant funds across six states in 2020 vermont received over 230 000 in grants to protect manage and restore wetlands usepa 2020 funding was received for mapping and wetland restoration in rutland and addison counties prioritized toward areas with the highest potential for phosphorus removal usepa 2020 fig 8 displays the tbp strategy for surface water protection and wetland development through reclassification efforts 4 conclusion irene confirmed that a primary concern in the basin from climate extremes is the disruption of the water cycle vdec anr 2019 caused by extreme precipitation resulting in stream flow above threshold limits which increase the frequency of local flooding and fluvial erosion galford et al 2014 irene resulted in increasing the basin s ecosystem s vulnerability for decades from a single event creating a vulnerability for quality of life of human and non human species while the ecosystem undergoes restoration as a hybrid ecosystem an evaluation of the progress of a restoration plan project typically requires an assessment and an affirmation of the key elements of the plan allison 2014 therefore the research methodology included a slr of milestone reports to locate review and analyze the key elements of the restoration planning and implementation one approach for evaluation and forecasting is to look at the amount of climate change that has already happened look at the future projected change and then ask what ecosystem we can reasonably expect to maintain at the site in the future allison 2014 as indicated in figs 2 and 3 the basin already had land use stressors acting upon it including habitat destruction but irene exacerbated these stressors by connecting them together beyond a threshold limit for the hydrologic cycle figs 7 and 8 display the prioritization of restoration activities toward the geographic sections of the basin that have the greatest opportunity to improve and maintain its restoration while the basin acts as a hybrid ecosystem during this transition period it is logical to assume that the implementation of the basin s tbp has the potential to decrease or increase its quality of ecosystem services over time based upon the outcome of the restoration activities while retaining some of the historic characteristics and original keystone species hybrid ecosystems provide a transitional phase toward restoration or degradation allison 2014 this outcome is more challenging to forecast due to unplanned events or exemptions such as the vermont agency of agriculture s exemption of agricultural run off events or upcoming climate extremes if the ecosystem is further degraded the loss of keystone species could lower the classification of the basin to a truly novel no analogue ecosystem novel no analogue ecosystems arise from a number of factors land use change habitat destruction climate change and invasive species these factors interact to form a triple whammy in which it is absolutely inevitable that currently existing ecosystems will change and that their new form will be different from anything we have seen before truly novel no analogue ecosystems are most likely to develop when conditions have changed so drastically that the original ecosystem functions have also been lost or at least highly altered allison 2014 therefore to avoid this degradation toward a novel ecosystem that can never be adequately restored a successful tbp adaptive management plan is needed to address acute concerns while providing a holistic approach toward restoring this hybrid ecosystem while restoration of the ecosystem has been prioritized toward the most impacted sections of the otter creek in the tbp the restoration must include a holistic approach to the watershed a holistic approach will address the concern that encroachment stream channel erosion land erosion and pathogens continue to degrade water quality in all sections of otter creek causing stressed and impacted surface water throughout the basin vdec anr 2020 therefore while prioritization is essential to adaptive management the connected concerns throughout the basin have the potential to decline across a threshold into the category of a novel ecosystem unless there is also an effective holistic approach toward renewed restoration renewed restoration for the basin is a result that can be achieved through an adaptive management approach that successfully guides a project toward a successful outcome allison 2014 renewed restoration is ecological restoration along the middle path restoration projects that recognize the importance of the past pre disturbance ecosystems by maintaining as much historical fidelity as possible while utilizing the reality of rapidly changing hybrid and novel ecosystems in order to promote diversity ecosystem services and human connection to the environment allison 2014 the basic guiding principles of adaptive management design management monitoring and re evaluation have to occur simultaneously and continuously for a successful restoration project allison 2014 instead of managing a hybrid ecosystem only for its services improving the baseline conditions of the ecosystem through renewed restoration should reproduce the characteristics of an authentic ecosystem which can self regulate with appropriate biodiversity and ecosystem function but may include new non native species due to geography and climate change allison 2014 therefore the basin has the potential to undergo renewed restoration and become self regulating effectively becoming resilient enough to be considered an authentic ecosystem upon completion of the tbp s restoration activities however the outcome of the basin is entirely conditional upon the successful implementation and adaptive management of the 2019 tbp as well as the upcoming 2025 tbp by various regulators and stakeholders for effectiveness toward the ecosystem s resilience under future climate change scenarios an increase in the basin s stressors connected climate concerns significant trade offs or extreme climate change events prior to the completion of the 2025 tbp restoration activities could significantly alter the outcome of the restoration plans and activities ultimately there is an urgency for stakeholders to implement successful restoration activities that are monitored with metrics for successful adaptive management of the existing 2019 and upcoming 2025 tbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

20058,extreme climate events such as hurricanes and tropical storms can cause acute instability of the hydrologic cycle thereby threatening the sustainability and resiliency of an authentic watershed ecosystem s services a 2011 extreme climate event known as hurricane tropical storm irene irene imposed an acute effect on the quality of the ecosystem services in vermont this risk assessment of the otter creek basin the basin watershed restoration in central vermont included an analysis of the conceptual site model key elements of the strategic plan and potential ecological outcomes the outcome of the ecological restoration of the basin is dependent upon an adaptive management strategy which is implemented through various regulatory policies thereby a systematic literature review slr of regulatory milestone documents released between 1998 and 2019 was completed to characterize and assess the basin s strategic planning efforts and forecasts to operationalize this study a replicable methodology was utilized by using a conceptual site model to assess and forecast data trends analysis of the data trends resulted in an ecological risk assessment of the 2019 tactical basin plan tbp that forecasted 2021 2025 restoration activities currently in a transition phase as a hybrid ecosystem while undergoing restoration activities the basin s restoration strategy could result in the re establishment of the watershed as an authentic ecosystem which can self regulate with appropriate biodiversity and ecosystem function based on past history however without restoration and resiliency a poorly managed strategy could result in a decreased classification toward a novel no analogue ecosystem where keystone species are lost and ecosystem functions are highly altered therefore a successful restoration is essential to elevate the basin from a hybrid ecosystem by restoring its authentic characteristics and regaining its self regulated natural ecosystem services keywords hybrid ecosystem climate extremes watershed management tactical basin plan ecological restoration 1 introduction hurricane irene also known as tropical storm irene irene migrated from the atlantic ocean and delivered a devastating impact on the east coast of the united states of america usa in late august 2011 irene reached climate extremes and thereby provided an example of an extreme climate event due to its type occurrence and the exceedance of a threshold according to the 2014 vermont climate assessment vca report the concept of a climate extreme refers to weather and climate events like hot spells heavy rains periods of drought and flooding and severe storms and most of the scientific literature on climate extremes uses definitions that fall roughly into two categories those related to the probability of occurrence of a certain type of event and those related to exceeding a particular threshold galford et al 2014 irene s effects were felt all the way from puerto rico to the canadian maritime provinces and as far west as the catskill mountains in new york devastating flooding occurred in vermont new hampshire new york and new jersey with damaging storm surge along several east coast states irene s impact caused eight million people to lose power and caused the historic closure of the new york city mass transit system u s department of commerce 2012 according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration irene was ranked as the costliest category one storm to strike the usa causing at least 15 8 billion in damage freedman 2012 scientists are concerned that the increased frequency and intensity of climate events is anticipated to make climate extremes more common through observations taken since the 1940 s rainfall has increased across vermont with the greatest increases occurring in the mountainous regions records show that heavy rainfall events are becoming more common and pose threats of flooding galford et al 2014 extreme climate events similar to irene could make landfall far more frequently causing powerful devastating storm surges every three to 20 years according to researchers from mit and princeton university chu 2012 the research group simulated thousands of storms under different climate conditions concluding that a 500 year flood could with climate change occur once every 25 to 240 years chu 2012 much of irene s most damaging impact was caused by extreme rainfall in new england which resulted in devastating inland flooding making landfall in north carolina in august 2011 irene followed the eastern seaboard causing over 40 deaths due to inland flooding which was especially damaging in vermont and new york u s department of commerce 2012 in vermont irene was considered a 100 year storm event as it was the biggest since 1927 freedman 2012 it also exceeded many thresholds for river levels in vermont causing widespread flash flooding resulting in severe impacts in august 2011 heavy rainfall saturated the ground and as a result flooding was widespread when additional rains fell with the arrival of irene galford et al 2014 this combination of climate factors resulted in an extreme event that reached historic proportions unveiling a new concern for an increase in the connection of extreme events combinations of extreme events are termed connected to convey the diversity and complexity of interacting physical and societal mechanisms that cause their impacts to be amplified relative to the impacts from those same events occurring separately or univariately raymond et al 2020 as the focus of this review article irene provided the climate extreme that connected several ongoing climate concerns in a disastrous manner including saturated floodplain soils extreme precipitation in mountain regions rapid stormwater runoff and pollution flash flooding in rivers and floodplains widespread agricultural nonpoint source pollution and freshwater invasive species the otter creek basin watershed ecosystem the basin in central vermont experienced substantial damage from irene especially within the southern portion of the otter creek watershed in rutland county located in central vermont vdec anr 2012 according to vermont department of environmental conservation vdec one of the main effects of climate change is the disruption of the water cycle and accordingly irene s severe damage from flooding was primarily caused by a disruption of the hydrologic cycle vdec anr 2019 an example of a threshold exceedance occurred in rutland as the highest ever flood crest above flood stage was recorded in 83 years with a total change in water height of 13 feet pealer 2012 records across vermont show that flash flood flows are increasingly common threatening human health in developments that are situated in floodplains vulnerable communities include low income residents in mobile home parks that can be catastrophically destroyed by just one to two feet of flood water galford et al 2014 inland flooding from climate extremes also impacts the quality of the environment in vermont impacts of flooding on water quality continues to be a concern in agricultural areas where the historical legacy of fertilizer use decades ago is resulting in high levels of nutrient run off into rivers and lakes large pulses of nutrients are stripped from soils and transported through waterways during large precipitation events galford et al 2014 in vermont over 450 farms were impacted and over 9 000 acres of farmland were damaged by flooding in many cases during irene s record breaking floods the change in river levels was dramatic in both longevity and magnitude the observed sudden and tremendous increases in river stages in the 2 to 3 h timeframe were more characteristic of flash flooding in small streams than expected behavior from main stem rivers u s department of commerce 2012 climate models project more frequent high flow events and flooding particularly in the winter months as a greater fraction of winter precipitation will fall as rain or freezing rain rather than snow while vermont rivers have sustained higher levels of base flow over recent decades in summer months in contrast to other new england states climate projections show increased potential for short term dry spells too much and too little water pose threats to agriculture forests infrastructure health and homes galford et al 2014 the basin s characteristics include these types of connected climate concerns regarding human health and the environment thereby causing a need for a regulatory strategy to provide greater resiliency this review article provides an overview of the baseline conditions transition phase and restoration strategies for the basin the case study methodology provides a conceptual site model of the basin prior to examining the restoration activities data analysis of milestone documents through a slr assists in providing an ecological risk assessment of the basin see table 1 due to concerns to human health and the environment irene s widespread damage to the basin resulted in a regulatory response of strategies and policies created to implement a comprehensive watershed restoration project this research thereby reviews and assesses the regulatory strategies that are intended to provide resilience against the connected climate conditions that threaten the basin s water quality and hydrologic stability the potential outcome of the restoration of the basin is dependent upon an adaptive management strategy which is implemented through a 2019 tbp vdec anr 2019 the results of the slr are provided through a summary of the basin s tbp regulatory policy decision making process which was used to prioritize restoration actions through implementing strategies over time a summary of the forecasted primary restoration activities scheduled for 2021 to 2025 are provided in the 2019 tbp an upcoming 2025 tbp is anticipated to include an evaluation of five years of restoration activities in comparison to metrics plus public input to finalize the plan the conclusions provide a brief analysis of the five year strategy and potential for renewed restoration of the basin 1 1 conceptual site model the basin is located in vermont usa encompassing an area that is 1 506 km2 936 miles2 and includes the sub watersheds of otter creek plus the smaller lewis creek and little otter creek in the lowlands the main stem of the high quality otter creek is the longest flatwater boating segment in vermont including waterfalls cascades gorges scenic segments class ii iii rapids swimming holes and fishing areas in 1942 lindeman defined the ecosystem as the system composed of physical chemical biological processes active within a space time unit of any magnitude lindeman 1942 the edges of the basin s watershed are determined by physical boundaries that control the water movement within the hydrologic cycle related to the ecosystem therefore a watershed ecosystem has definable boundaries while including both abiotic and biotic components among which nutrients cycle effectively providing a functional system which transfers and circulates energy and matter lindeman 1942 ricklefs miller 2000 fig 1 displays how the appalachian trail which is located along the topographic height of the green mountains creates an east west divide and drainage basin divisions between several adjacent surrounding watersheds the hydrologic flow of the basin in an elliptical shape with long east and west borders and minimal northern and southern borders within the basin hydrologic flow migrates from a highpoint of the appalachian trail along the green mountain drainage divide to the lowlands in the northwest 1 2 ecological restoration prior to the devastating effects of irene that altered the watershed ecosystem the basin exhibited many authentic characteristics of a natural ecosystem in its historic baseline setting one of the largest rivers and watersheds in vermont the otter creek flows through the largest and most biologically diverse swamp complex in new england while intersecting multiple conservation and wildlife management areas the 1 566 acre cornwall swamp wildlife management area was designated in 1974 as a national natural landmark by the u s national park service and includes great diversity of plant life fish and wildlife vtf w n d the 1 100 acres of the otter creek wildlife management area is 70 forested and hosts rich biodiversity of plants and wild animals including river otters muskrats deer black bear and moose vermont pbs 2011 natural ecosystems can be altered and their functioning distorted in four main ways 1 selective removal of key species or changes to habitat 2 addition of new elements 3 changes in the natural disturbance patterns and 4 as a result in the change in climate that occur through human activities dudley 2011 defining the basin s ecosystem s authenticity in the baseline setting is especially useful in understanding the decision making and strategy of prioritizing restoration efforts where they are most likely to be most effective toward restoring the most important natural characteristics of the ecosystem in 2011 a british conservationist defined an authentic ecosystem as a resilient ecosystem with the level of biodiversity and range of ecological interactions that can be predicted as a result of the combination of historic geographic and climate conditions in a particular location million trees 2012 dudley s new definition of authenticity is purposefully broad as it is meant to reflect elements of naturalness in both fairly pristine and radically altered ecosystems as ecosystems react quickly to climate change and old baselines disappear dudley 2011 an authentic ecosystem has the ability to self regulate with appropriate biodiversity and ecosystem function while including new non native species due to geography and climate change allison 2014 once an ecosystem is altered from its authentic characteristics in its natural setting it becomes a hybrid ecosystem until it is restored to the characteristics of an authentic ecosystem or it further degrades to the status of a novel ecosystem allison 2014 in the best case scenario hybrid ecosystems will still contain original keystone species and most of the original ecosystem functions so restoration and management efforts will be best employed to maintain the hybrid ecosystem in good condition supplying desired ecosystem services allison 2014 no longer able to self regulate since irene in 2011 the basin has been in a transitional period renewed restoration provides an opportunity to prepare the basin for climate change extremes while reproducing the watershed s natural characteristics as an authentic ecosystem allison 2014 it is theoretically possible that natural conditions of an authentic ecosystem can be restored as long as the biotic and abiotic conditions don t become altered beyond the status of a hybrid ecosystem allison 2014 sections of the basin have retained or restored some of its natural characteristics during this transitional period therefore acting as a hybrid ecosystem allison 2014 actively providing ecosystem services but which is vulnerable to decline under climate extremes however without successful restoration and resiliency measures to protect the basin against future climate change extremes a future climate event that connects multiple climate change concerns could force the basin to fall into the lower classification of a novel no analogue ecosystem allison 2014 the state of vermont has thereby been regulating the ecological restoration of the basin in an attempt to regain its authenticity regulatory policy is implemented through watershed planning sustainability efforts adaptation and mitigation to better manage environmental concerns and change vulnerability toward resiliency efforts together these efforts are preparing a more stable future for quality of human and non human life in the basin over a 15 year timeline at a minimum resulting in a 2019 tbp 1 3 baseline setting in 1998 an environmental assessment ea report was completed for the basin including a detailed watershed description causes and sources of impairments or threats to river water quality summary of major issues and recommendations the 1998 ea report provided baseline conditions of the basin prior to irene s extreme climate event focusing on stressors caused primarily by land use activities the ea report determined that the major cause of impairment and the largest threat to up to 88 miles of rivers and streams in the basin was streambank erosion that results in siltation or sedimentation which additionally threatens another 152 miles of surface water vermont department of environmental conservation agency of natural resources vdec anr 1998 agriculture comprises 23 of the watershed s property and was the second primary source of impairment causing nutrients and pathogens to stress the ecosystem vermont department of environmental conservation agency of natural resources vdec anr 1998 stormwater runoff in urban areas such as rutland middlebury and vergennes has been increasing due to towns experiencing growth in higher elevations in fact in 1998 urban runoff in rutland city containing toxic materials sediment heated water and pollutants was a significant problem the large number of non point source pollution impacts from agriculture warranted a focus of resources toward technical and funding assistance municipal plans and zoning regulations were required to address these agricultural areas with respect to surface water wetlands floodplains stormwater and hydrology vermont department of environmental conservation agency of natural resources vdec anr 1998 fig 2 displays the baseline condition of major stressors to the basin s ecosystem pre irene plus the boundaries of the 27 sub watersheds within the basin fig 3 displays the baseline condition of the basin s streams that were impacted by agricultural non point source pollution and stormwater runoff prior to irene 2 materials and methods 2 1 research design this review article provides the basin s restoration process as a qualitative case study of a long term restoration of a watershed ecosystem as per the definition of a case study which is to be defined within a bounded system within a bounded time limit of a phenomenon this study is purposefully prepared with a replicable methodology through a slr using a slr this case study analyzes the basin s 1990 s baseline condition up to irene in 2011 restoration activities from 2012 to 2019 and the restoration strategy from 2021 to 2025 provided in the 2019 tbp 2 2 data collection techniques methods for data collection of a qualitative case study are focused on a triangulation of documents improving validity of the review article summary prior to completion of the review article watershed boundaries were overlaid onto a vermont road map providing a bounded limit for various field visits and observations by the researcher to ground truth and verify data collected during the study 2 3 systematic literature review slr this research utilized a slr to investigate a wide range of databases peer reviewed journal articles and institutional reports for inclusive review results in particular this slr reviewed the basin s regulatory milestone documents including policy decision making that led to prioritizing strategies and restoration action 2 4 data analysis methods data analysis included a preliminary evaluation of the baseline conditions of the basin s conceptual site model plus numerous regulatory milestone reports and data from 1990 to 2019 see table 1 an ecological risk assessment of the basin s ecological restoration was provided and an analysis of data related to regulatory decision making in the 2019 tbp was analyzed for effectiveness 3 results and discussion 3 1 ecological risk assessment in august 2011 irene provided a model of an extreme climate event that exceeded a hydrologic threshold for the stability of the basin threatening the ecological status of the watershed and its ability to self regulate exceedance of a threshold acts as a leverage point for an ecological risk assessment for regulatory agencies as the ecosystem must be regulated to preserve and restore its ecosystem services irene provided an example of how an extreme climate event could stress an authentic ecosystem toward losing its keystone species and functionality indefinitely thankfully the basin s wetlands displayed hurricane resistance and helped lessen the massive floods one characteristic sign of an authentic watershed allison 2014 however many of these wetlands have turned to agricultural land and development over time since irene therefore shrinking their total acreage and lessening their capability for future climate events due to climate change there is an 80 increase in the likelihood of severity and amount of flooding in the future increasing risk to ecological and also economic stability vdec anr 2012 the observation of this risk to the basin resulted in regulatory agencies providing strategies and policies into regulatory milestone documents from 2012 to 2019 after irene prioritization of efforts to enhance the basin s resiliency resulted in the may 2012 water quality management plan wqmp the wqmp updated the basin s goals strategies and forecasts provided in previous milestone documents the wqmp was prepared in accordance with state regulations and the federal clean water act the wqmp includes watershed scale planning regarding partnerships water quality issues agricultural runoff phosphorus loading river management runoff restoration and protection efforts vdec anr 2012 as per a regulatory adaptive management approach the wqmp emerged as a critical tool toward prioritizing the basin s flooding attenuation pollution control restoration and resiliency efforts as a successful initial step toward retaining the basin s authenticity the wqmp recommended re classification of high quality waters to outstanding resource waters to protect the basin s numerous recreational and scenic assets abundant wetlands and aquatic wildlife habitat in response to stressed water concerns in altered sections of the basin the wqmp prepared a strategy for complete stormwater system mapping and illicit discharge detection for towns in the basin plus establishing fluvial erosion hazard zones vdec anr 2012 the wqmp concluded that there are many watershed scale scientific and qualitative surface water quality concerns that require better land use solutions in the basin concerns were identified defined prioritized ranked and grouped into upper mid and lower otter creek regions over several years by the wqmp planning stakeholders with community input from the addison county river watch collaborative and the upper otter creek watershed council upper otter creek is generally affected by nonpoint source pollution and inadequate protection practices whereas lower otter creek is generally affected by excessive sedimentation and run off contamination pathogens are considered an important problem throughout the basin as they pose a health risk from contact recreation otter creek natural resources conservation district 2017 as it is the most stressed by contaminants lower otter creek requires further scientific study plus interagency and public partnerships to manage the watershed s stability and quality into the future six water bodies and 4 8 miles of otter creek are impaired as they do not meet vermont water quality standards vwqs vdec anr 2012 in addition 630 square miles of watershed are affected due to a combination of agricultural runoff phosphorus loading developed land runoff geomorphic stability lack of riparian buffers flood resiliency total maximum daily load tmdl pathogenic bacteria using escherichia coli e coli as an indicator and aging wastewater treatment facilities vdec anr 2012 3 2 regulatory policy and implementations the 2014 vca report provided a comprehensive overview of climate change trends and forecasts based on historical data the vca report provided a summary of warming conditions forecasted to threaten the ecological services and the economic stability throughout the basin the vca report also confirmed that climate change is altering the basin s bioregional economies including farming practices growing seasons maple syrup production ski resorts outdoor tourism and the energy sector galford et al 2014 statewide the vca report summarized that the vermont average temperature has increased 1 3 f since 1960 with 50 of effects since 1990 the freezing period has shortened by four days each decade the growing season has lengthened by 3 7 days every decade and annual precipitation has increased 5 9 in especially in mountain regions since 1990 galford et al 2014 for agriculture although an extended growing season from global warming may provide farmers future choices they also must adapt to flash flooding weed growth disease outbreaks and pest infestations future storm events are predicted to threaten the basin s fossil fuel energy infrastructure and cause energy outages within 30 to 40 years forecasted average winter temperatures will cause most winter precipitation to fall as rain reducing winter tourism in the basin galford et al 2014 these climate alterations were thereby predicted to significantly affect the authenticity of the characteristics of the basin s ecosystem services the vermont water quality monitoring program strategy for 2015 to 2020 was created and finalized by vdec between 2015 and 2017 as per vermont s 2015 clean water act and 2016 vwqs the watershed planning program of the water investment division was charged with developing and implementing a tbp through funding partner support agency support and public rulemaking vdec anr 2020 a 2016 vdec assessment and listing methodology established surface water monitoring techniques to evaluate surface waters in comparison to the updated 2016 vwqs a 2017 surface water management strategy established objectives to minimize pollution protect aquatic and riparian habitats and minimize flood hazards the 2019 tbp integrated watershed modeling water quality monitoring pollution source assessments and stakeholder input to document geographically specific actions necessary to protect maintain enhance and restore surface waters vdec anr 2019 additional milestone reports include essential information regarding restoration projects the 2018 clean water initiative investment report cwir from the vermont treasurer provided a summary of results of vermont s various water quality projects by watershed from 2016 to 2018 in table 2 the cwir provides quantitative metrics for restoration activities for agriculture acres of land treated natural resources acres of land restored developed lands and roads acres miles and cubic yards and wastewater number of treatment locations a 2018 rutland regional plan promotes land use practices basin wide including future use of land community involvement recreation agriculture forestry wildlife water quality energy flood resiliency and wastewater systems rutland region planning commission 2018 the 2019 act 76 clean water service delivery act established clean water service providers to maintain non regulatory projects to meet non regulatory phosphorus reduction targets 3 3 tactical basin plan tbp as a culmination of these regulatory efforts the december 2019 tbp provided a summary of the quality of surface water features including an updated baseline of data to recalibrate models to include the effects of hurricane irene vdec anr 2019 the 2019 tbp determined that six waterbodies and 4 8 miles of otter creek are impaired as they do not meet the vwqs plus 630 square miles of watershed is affected due to a combination of agricultural runoff phosphorus loading developed land runoff geomorphic stability lack of riparian buffers flood resiliency tmdl pathogenic bacteria and aging wastewater treatment facilities vdec anr 2019 fig 4 displays the locations of greatest stress on surface water bodies within the basin upper otter creek is generally affected by nonpoint source pollution and inadequate protection practices whereas lower otter creek by excessive sedimentation and run off contamination stressed water in the basin may be caused by stormwater urban runoff agricultural runoff morphological instability pathogens or pollution that creates a need for surface water restoration efforts and regulation in addition contaminated groundwater can occur from point sources affecting surface and drinking water quality point sources affecting surface groundwater and drinking water quality may include waste water treatment systems and rutland county brownfield sites abramovich 2013 point sources are only 10 of the problem therefore long term watershed quality is contingent on increasing best management practices on agricultural lands and developed areas specifically aimed at reducing pollutant loads to the creek 3 4 tbp decision making the 2019 tbp provides an implementation table of 56 recommendations over a 5 year timeline for future restoration activities monitoring evaluation education and outreach for agriculture developed lands wastewater treatment facilities and natural resource restoration projects vdec anr 2019 the projects vary in priority level and not all are expected to be completed over the next five years but each strategy is expected to be pursued and reported upon in a 2025 tbp due to the threat of future climate change events disruption of the water cycle caused by climate change is the primary concern for the hydrologic life cycles of migratory fish birds and insects plus overall water quality in the watershed climate change concerns also include warmer surface waters with less dissolved oxygen for many aquatic species such as brook trout vdec anr 2020 therefore to address a more sustainable restoration the 2019 tbp focuses on maintaining and restoring habitat connectivity increasing river and lake riparian buffers and stream equilibrium conditions to reduce the impact of climate change on the basin s rivers lakes and ponds over a 5 year timeline vdec anr 2019 the 2019 tbp uses the concepts of structured decision making sdm and adaptive management by evaluating existing data and prioritizing restoration activities sdm is defined as a prescriptive approach to environmental decision making that facilitates better choices based both on theories of rational choice and judgmental limitations of decision makers and stakeholders failing et al 2013 as a result of the slr fig 5 was created to display the use of sdm in the 2019 tbp by classifying restoration activities into sectors in the 21st century it will be absolutely essential in all restorations that the basic guiding principles of adaptive management have to occur simultaneously and continuously allison 2014 adaptive management includes the creation of a circular flow chart that includes the concepts of 1 assess problem 2 design 3 implement 4 monitor 5 evaluate and 6 adjust failing et al 2013 the 2019 tbp provides a list of guidelines that are available for navigating the regulations and monitoring individual restoration projects therefore as a result of the slr fig 6 was created to display a flow chart prepared to assess a problem and implement a solution through applying regulatory policy following regulatory guidelines will provide the opportunity to monitor evaluate and adjust restoration activities through applying metrics in an adaptive management approach 3 5 ecological restoration activities fig 7 displays the 2019 tbp s technique of separating activities into sectors focus areas and restoration strategies vdec anr 2020 monitoring kickoff activities was intended to be completed in 2021 as per the tbp strategy however future funding will be prioritized by projects that achieve the highest water quality benefits or cumulative benefits water quality flood resiliency and water resource protection based on metrics after five years the updated 2025 tbp will include 1 a summary of water quality monitoring 2 evaluation of data 3 strategies to protect water quality 4 public input to finalize the plan and 5 plan implementation tracking and project identification vdec anr 2020 a particularly important dilemma for the ecological restoration of the surface water quality in the otter creek basin is phosphorus pollution stemming from agricultural land use one tradeoff that occurs in the otter creek basin is that the vermont agency of agriculture provides exemptions for farmers to spread manure on snow or frozen land gribkoff 2019 these exemptions override the 2016 overhaul of on farm water quality practices required by vermont s clean water act which put restrictions on manure spreading including a prohibition to spread on frozen or snow covered fields at any time in 2018 over 60 exemptions were issued due to early or late snowfalls gribkoff 2019 in 2019 an emergency exemption was provided from november 22 through december 15 2019 due to an early series of snowfall gribkoff 2019 the agency cited 10 in of additional precipitation as a historic and unrelenting weather crisis for dairy farmers gribkoff 2019 a scientific solution to the agricultural trade off is to increase the protection and development of wetlands as a primary restoration activity protecting wetlands provides two essential services 1 absorbing floodwaters and 2 retaining sediment and nutrients to improve the water quality of lakes and rivers usepa 2020 in 2019 the epa awarded 1 323 000 in wetland program development grant funds across six states in 2020 vermont received over 230 000 in grants to protect manage and restore wetlands usepa 2020 funding was received for mapping and wetland restoration in rutland and addison counties prioritized toward areas with the highest potential for phosphorus removal usepa 2020 fig 8 displays the tbp strategy for surface water protection and wetland development through reclassification efforts 4 conclusion irene confirmed that a primary concern in the basin from climate extremes is the disruption of the water cycle vdec anr 2019 caused by extreme precipitation resulting in stream flow above threshold limits which increase the frequency of local flooding and fluvial erosion galford et al 2014 irene resulted in increasing the basin s ecosystem s vulnerability for decades from a single event creating a vulnerability for quality of life of human and non human species while the ecosystem undergoes restoration as a hybrid ecosystem an evaluation of the progress of a restoration plan project typically requires an assessment and an affirmation of the key elements of the plan allison 2014 therefore the research methodology included a slr of milestone reports to locate review and analyze the key elements of the restoration planning and implementation one approach for evaluation and forecasting is to look at the amount of climate change that has already happened look at the future projected change and then ask what ecosystem we can reasonably expect to maintain at the site in the future allison 2014 as indicated in figs 2 and 3 the basin already had land use stressors acting upon it including habitat destruction but irene exacerbated these stressors by connecting them together beyond a threshold limit for the hydrologic cycle figs 7 and 8 display the prioritization of restoration activities toward the geographic sections of the basin that have the greatest opportunity to improve and maintain its restoration while the basin acts as a hybrid ecosystem during this transition period it is logical to assume that the implementation of the basin s tbp has the potential to decrease or increase its quality of ecosystem services over time based upon the outcome of the restoration activities while retaining some of the historic characteristics and original keystone species hybrid ecosystems provide a transitional phase toward restoration or degradation allison 2014 this outcome is more challenging to forecast due to unplanned events or exemptions such as the vermont agency of agriculture s exemption of agricultural run off events or upcoming climate extremes if the ecosystem is further degraded the loss of keystone species could lower the classification of the basin to a truly novel no analogue ecosystem novel no analogue ecosystems arise from a number of factors land use change habitat destruction climate change and invasive species these factors interact to form a triple whammy in which it is absolutely inevitable that currently existing ecosystems will change and that their new form will be different from anything we have seen before truly novel no analogue ecosystems are most likely to develop when conditions have changed so drastically that the original ecosystem functions have also been lost or at least highly altered allison 2014 therefore to avoid this degradation toward a novel ecosystem that can never be adequately restored a successful tbp adaptive management plan is needed to address acute concerns while providing a holistic approach toward restoring this hybrid ecosystem while restoration of the ecosystem has been prioritized toward the most impacted sections of the otter creek in the tbp the restoration must include a holistic approach to the watershed a holistic approach will address the concern that encroachment stream channel erosion land erosion and pathogens continue to degrade water quality in all sections of otter creek causing stressed and impacted surface water throughout the basin vdec anr 2020 therefore while prioritization is essential to adaptive management the connected concerns throughout the basin have the potential to decline across a threshold into the category of a novel ecosystem unless there is also an effective holistic approach toward renewed restoration renewed restoration for the basin is a result that can be achieved through an adaptive management approach that successfully guides a project toward a successful outcome allison 2014 renewed restoration is ecological restoration along the middle path restoration projects that recognize the importance of the past pre disturbance ecosystems by maintaining as much historical fidelity as possible while utilizing the reality of rapidly changing hybrid and novel ecosystems in order to promote diversity ecosystem services and human connection to the environment allison 2014 the basic guiding principles of adaptive management design management monitoring and re evaluation have to occur simultaneously and continuously for a successful restoration project allison 2014 instead of managing a hybrid ecosystem only for its services improving the baseline conditions of the ecosystem through renewed restoration should reproduce the characteristics of an authentic ecosystem which can self regulate with appropriate biodiversity and ecosystem function but may include new non native species due to geography and climate change allison 2014 therefore the basin has the potential to undergo renewed restoration and become self regulating effectively becoming resilient enough to be considered an authentic ecosystem upon completion of the tbp s restoration activities however the outcome of the basin is entirely conditional upon the successful implementation and adaptive management of the 2019 tbp as well as the upcoming 2025 tbp by various regulators and stakeholders for effectiveness toward the ecosystem s resilience under future climate change scenarios an increase in the basin s stressors connected climate concerns significant trade offs or extreme climate change events prior to the completion of the 2025 tbp restoration activities could significantly alter the outcome of the restoration plans and activities ultimately there is an urgency for stakeholders to implement successful restoration activities that are monitored with metrics for successful adaptive management of the existing 2019 and upcoming 2025 tbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

20059,crabs are the most dominant groups in mangrove ecosystem and play a vital role in building and sustaining the structure and function of the mangrove ecosystems however a systematic evaluation of global research status of mangrove crabs is still lacking here a bibliometric analysis based on the science citation index expanded sci e was carried out to provide insights into research activities tendencies and challenges of the mangrove crabs from 1980 to 2016 the results showed that the average annual output of the publications was low brazil took a leading position out of the 63 countries territories with the largest number of publications followed by usa australia china and germany journal of experimental marine biology and ecology was the most popular journal the reproductive ecology e g reproduction population ecology e g population structure and their relationship were the mainstream the estuarine ecosystem and the method of stable isotope received ecologists favor behavioral ecology e g bioturbation ecosystem function e g carbon and the ecological effect among them were the main issues in this field biodiversity was a new hot topic brazil australia usa china and kenya were the top five hot regions among the 53 hot countries on a global scale different regions have different hot topics the breeding ecology was the most popular theme in the americas region the ecological effects of crabs were the most hotstops in the africa east asia region and the east and south asia oceania region the challenges of the development were not comprehensive and uneven on a global scale there was a certain number of countries with mangrove distributions were still outside this field such as most of the western and northeastern countries of africa e g angola some central american countries e g guatemala and some western and southeast asian countries e g cambodia furthermore we found that some topics were ignored or lagged in each territory our results highlight that the global research status of mangrove crab is still at a relatively backward stage and regional development is extremely unbalanced keywords bibliometric mangrove crabs hotspot spatio temporal dynamics challenges introduction mangroves have long attracted interest in the scientific community arguably due to their high biodiversity climate change mitigation and high productivity kathiresan and bingham 2001 luther and greenberg 2009 over the past few decades research on mangroves has yielded many insights into their ecological functions barbier et al 2008 global patterns and processes luther and greenberg 2009 chen et al 2021 and adaptations to saline environments krauss et al 2008 as well as into their role in namely a haven for many juvenile marine species fishes crustaceans shellfish reptiles and mammals nagelkerken et al 2008 benthic fauna especially crabs as the ecological engineers of mangrove ecosystem are one of the most dominant groups in mangroves and play a vital role in building and sustaining the structure and function of mangrove ecosystems cannicci et al 2008 kristensen 2008 such as nutrient recycling lee 1998 and detritus formation they form an important link in the mangrove food web harada and lee 2016 and the dynamics of the ecosystems through their feeding activities nordhaus et al 2007 their burrowing activity changes the topography of the mangrove floor and improves soil aeration and enhances the bioturbation of soil sediments gillikin and kamanu 2005 what s more lots of efforts had been done to research mangrove crabs in the last few decades nabout et al 2010 peer et al 2015 among them mainly carried out mesoscale and small scale ecology research which includes biodiversity bandibas and hilomen 2016 bosire et al 2004 lee 2008 feeding ecology nordhaus et al 2007 eco behavior e g burrowing araújo júnior et al 2016 gillikin and kamanu 2005 physiological mechanisms charmantier et al 2002 morphological characteristics naderloo et al 2016 and developed microscale ecology research which contains microecology e g microbial parasitism and molecular ecology e g gene identification naderloo et al 2016 silva et al 2010 additionally several large scale research works had been made e g the populations and global warming fusi et al 2015 hall and thatje 2009 however a systematic evaluation of global mangrove crabs research is still lacking the first comprehensive review of mangrove crabs was conducted in 1984 which described the occurrence of 61 genera and subgenera of crabs in mangrove ecosystems with ocypodidae and grapsidae being the two most important families in terms of taxa jones 1984 hereafter another effort about reviewing and evaluating the diversity the ecological role as well as the implications of such findings for mangrove conservation of grapsid crabs in indo pacific mangrove ecosystems was conducted in 1998 lee 1998 further achievement a scientometric analysis of fiddler crab genus uca decapoda ocypodidae in coastal was published in 2010 and a comprehensive evaluation of the global literature on fiddler crab has been carried out nabout et al 2010 not yet finished a review of fiddler crabs in south africa was published in 2015 which discussed in depth the aspects of biological and ecological including life cycle and reproduction feeding ecology biotic interactions and tolerance to environmental fluctuations and pollution peer et al 2015 yet the overall research status and challenges in this field are still poorly understood nonetheless macrobenthos is not well studied as compared to others e g vegetation in the mangrove ecosystem lee 2008 it s not difficult to find that there is practically no overall information about mangrove crab research on a broad scale this leads to much comprehensive information on mangrove crabs remaining poorly understood therefore this is an important factor in the rapid degradation of mangrove resources over the last few decades feka and ajonina 2011 valiela et al 2001 therefore it is not surprising that understanding and predicting the spatiotemporal dynamics of biological characteristics e g population and research trends remains a central goal in ecology jetz et al 2012 furthermore large scale research is an effective way to master scientific information gaston 2000 willig et al 2003 thus thorough review research of the science behind mangrove crabs on a global scale is urgently needed to not only improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of global mangrove crabs but also effectively guide us to exploit and protect the biodiversity of mangroves in the future considering that many studies of mangrove crabs have already been published bibliometric is a useful way to map the literature around a research field torres salinas et al 2013 which has been used in much global research of specific fields recently xu and boeing 2013 thus bibliometric evaluation of publications could serve as an alternative and innovative way of connecting various aspects of scientific findings and revealing global research trends of mangrove crabs bibliometric analysis is based on the research methodology employed in the science of library and information and it contains a series of quantitative and visual procedures to generalize the patterns and dynamics of publications cobo et al 2011 bibliometric methods have already been widely discussed in many disciplines e g science engineering and mangroves and could interpret the scientific production and research trends of a specific topic fu et al 2013 saravanan 2013 xu and boeing 2013 it is a comprehensive scientific analysis platform which sets the authoritative databases e g the web of science database institute for scientific information isi as the data source and based on source title countries institutes journals authors reference rate keywords abstract to analyze the development of research fields across different periods persson 2009 however traditional bibliometric analysis in scientific research fields has many deficiencies such as data deficiencies and not comprehensive analysis e g only selecting several journals or categories to represent global research trends of a topic nabout et al 2010 xu and boeing 2013 furthermore geographic analyses can elucidate spatial patterns and identify geographic areas in which most of the research activity occurs miller 2005 network analysis allows us to understand the interrelationships among research disciplines helps us to visualize the collaborative patterns among countries and institutions and can identify the hot issues of a research field morel et al 2009 based on the sci e web of science information from the period 1980 2016 the present bibliometric evaluation combined traditional literary analysis and innovative methods to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of mangrove crab research in this study we expected to study the research status and challenges of mangrove crab topics by exploring the temporal and spatial dynamics of keywords materials and methods data sources the mangrove crabs data was downloaded from the scientific citation index expanded sci e databases of the web science thomson reuters the combination indexing mangrove and crab were searched in terms of a topic within the publication year limitation from 1980 to 2016 the record of an individual document included the following fields downloaded authors au document title ti language la document type dt author keywords de key words plus id author address c1 reference count nr times cited tc year published py and journal name jn after the operation has been performed to eliminate the duplicated records a total of 1 059 publications were identified as being related to mangrove crabs classification methods six document types were identified among a total of 1 059 publications among them the most number of publications was the peer reviewed research articles document type 992 which accounted for 93 67 of total publications the five other document types which contained reviews 27 2 55 proceeding paper 21 1 98 meeting abstract 12 1 14 note 6 0 57 and editorial material 1 0 09 there were six types of publishing language but 1024 of the 1059 papers 96 69 were published in english the last five publishing languages included portuguese 26 2 46 spanish 4 0 38 french 2 0 19 japanese 2 0 19 and russian 1 0 09 the articles published by england scotland northern ireland and wales were reclassified as being published by the united kingdom uk and the articles from hong kong and taiwan were included in publications from china xu and boeing 2013 according to the number of articles arcgis 10 2 software was used to map the global distribution of mangrove crabs outputs and classify all countries into several groups scott and janikas 2010 and origin pro 9 1 software was executed to map the temporal variation and fit the development model of mangrove crabs outputs seifert 2014 the collaborations among countries were determined by the addresses of the authors based on the following strategies the term single country article was assigned to the article where co authors were from the same country while the term internationally collaborative article was assigned when researchers were from multiple countries fu et al 2013 xu and boeing 2013 the 20 most productive countries in mangrove crabs research were characterized by total publications total citations single country articles and citations and international collaborative articles and citations using the output features the science mapping of comprehensive strength was built for the 20 most productive countries of mangrove crabs research by the software of canoco 5 ter braak and smilauer 2015 the title author keywords and abstract provide a considerable overview of an article s theme although the title and abstract are readily available in articles the meaning of a single word within the title or abstract might be more obscure the keywords analysis can provide a relatively comprehensive overview of mangrove crabs research trends because the authors keywords are typically more indicative of the context of the article xu and boeing 2013 thus the author s keywords were analyzed to demonstrate the tendencies and hotspots of mangrove crabs research bornmann and mutz 2015 saravanan 2013 xu and boeing 2013 the spss 21 0 software was performed to conduct frequency analysis to define the most frequent keywords according to annual compositions of the 100 most frequent keywords several periods and some groups of countries of mangrove crabs research were determined by hierarchical cluster analysis hca with the software of pc ord 4 0 xu and boeing 2013 following the procedure of co words analysis the co words network of the 50 most frequent keywords was mapped to explore research hotspots in addition combining with venn diagram statistical analysis chilakamarri et al 2000 sorting analysis and spatial autocorrelation analysis dormann et al 2007 ter braak and smilauer 2015 to find out the pattern of mangrove crabs research in geographical change based on the natural distribution of mangroves the hot regions of mangrove crabs were identified in the americas africa asia and oceania a bold assumption was dished that the study areas of countries with mangrove distributions were cited in their own countries whereas the countries with no mangrove distributions were obtained by counting the summary and material method of their articles what s more the hot regions of mangrove crabs were mapped and divided into three regions which contained the americas africa east asia and the east and south asia oceania by arcgis 10 2 analyzing the relationship between their research information and revealing the hotspots of each region by summarizing the top 20 keywords to provide a reference for scholars to publish their findings on mangrove crabs research the 15 most popular journals were generalized by the number of articles citations and impact factor the impact factor and positions in a web of science categories were taken from journal citation reports jcr published in 2016 using the software of canoco 5 the procedures of principal components analysis pca were used to map the most influential journals ter braak and smilauer 2015 data analysis to uncover the temporal dynamics of mangrove crab research we used hierarchical cluster analysis hca heat map analysis and venn diagram to reveal the temporal dynamics of all keywords a co words network of the 50 most frequently used keywords was formed to identify the hot issues of mangrove crab research to reveal the spatial dynamics of mangrove crab research geographic analysis venn diagram analysis and ordination analysis were used to reveal the hot regions and hot issues based on keywords results temporal dynamics temporal dynamics of publication outputs the number of articles per year showed a volatility increase trend during the last 37 years 1980 2016 and the trend was consistent with the logistic model fig s1a table s1 meanwhile the sustained growth rate of the global mangrove crabs publications fitted to the literature growth curve of d place fig s1b table s1 the parameter b represents the sustained increase rate of literature price 1961 its value was 0 15 table s1 and according to the equation time ln2 b price 1961 these results not only revealed that the model had high stability but also exposed that it took roughly 4 62 years to double the number of global mangrove crab literature the descriptors of major scientific productivity are generalized from 1980 to 2016 in table s2 the mean number of authors per articles heightened from 1 to 4 33 during 1980 2016 table s2 moreover there was showing an overall upward trend over time the average number of references showed an overall increasing trend over time table s2 in addition with the increase in publication time the average citations of article per year tc tp displayed two development stages one stage with an upward trend from 2016 to 1991 and another phase with a downward trend from1980 to 1990 table s2 and the average number of references showed an overall increasing trend over time table s2 temporal dynamics of research tendencies and hotspots among the 1059 publications there were 3152 unique keywords which appeared 6745 times the relationship between the frequency of keywords and their ranks was fitting the power law distribution fig s2 there were 2194 keywords that appeared only one time each accounting for 69 61 of the total 3152 keywords however 100 3 17 most frequent keywords appeared 2026 times and were responsible for 30 04 of the total keyword and then based on the constitution of these 100 high frequency words hierarchical cluster analysis hca categorized the development period of mangrove crabs research 1980 2016 into two distinct phases fig s3 stage 1 1980 1994 and stage 2 1995 2016 furthermore the distribution of keywords in these two stages was counted by venn diagram fig s4 the results displayed that there were 504 common keywords between the two stages accounting for 78 90 of the total keywords in stage 1 and 16 75 of all the keywords in stage 2 whereas 143 unique keywords in stage 1 and 2505 peculiar keywords accounting for 22 10 and 83 25 of these 647 keywords in stage 1 and 3009 keywords in stage 2 respectively fig s4 in order to further reveal the otherness and commonness of research topics between the two stages the 100 most frequent keywords were dissected by hca and heat map collaborative analysis fifty unique keywords of mangrove crabs were the common topics between the two phases co topics accounting for 50 00 of the 100 keywords fig 1 heat map six group topics were classified at 1 8e 0 1 distance value by hca fig 1 hca what s more the first group gathered the information on search terms breeding ecology behavior ecology feeding ecology the new method and fishery production etc the population ecology behavioral ecology feeding ecology of crabs were in the second the third group mainly expounded the biodiversity and taxonomy of crab the fourth group contained behavior ecology population ecology and environmental effects of mangrove crabs the fifth group was formed by the breeding ecology bioturbation and the model of crab the feeding ecology biogeochemical and environmental effects were in the last group fig 1 different groups contained multiple topics which reflected the synergistic effect of mangrove crab research over time the similar themes between different groups further explained that the mangrove crab research retained continuity over time the 50 most frequent keywords appeared 1509 times and thus less than 2 00 of 3152 keywords were responsible for 22 37 of total keyword occurrences the temporal evolution for them was presented by the summaries of frequency and rank table 1 and the intellectual connections of scientific knowledge are shown by the co words network fig 2 it is worth emphasizing that connection represents a direct relationship the greater relationship then the closer position between keywords in the co words network ding et al 2001 leydesdorff and persson 2010 the result showed that the 50 keywords existed with dense connections fig 2 it reflected the complexity and diversity of mangrove crab research ranking top three the keywords mangrove crab and mangroves were the search terms in the data retrieval process table 1 and occupied the core position in the co words network fig 2 three families of crabs were the main types of biological hotspots in mangroves which contained grapsidae e g sesarmidae ocypodidae e g ucides cordatus and fiddler crab and portunidae e g mud crab and their ranking had a different degree of promotion from the first stage to the second phase e g the ranking of ocypodidae increased 91 grapsidae advanced 26 and portunidae gone forward 15 table 1 a sharp rise in rankings occurred among the estuary brachyura reproduction stable isotopes population structure kenya sex ratio fecundity sediments carbon genus uca and herbivory which rankings advanced more than 100 ranks from the first stage to the second phase table 1 sesarmidae recruitment biodiversity mozambique distribution mangrove forest and settlement were the seven new topics in the second stage table 1 the spatial dynamics the spatial dynamics of publication outputs the global distribution of published articles for mangrove crabs shows a broad geographical coverage a total of 63 countries territories are involved in mangrove crab research fig 3 and the average production of them was 16 81 articles the 63 countries were classified into three groups based on the mean level of production the first group comprised 34 countries which contained 20 31 75 countries that just published only one article the second group totaled 8 countries and the third group included the 20 most productive countries among the 20 countries 7 were from europe 7 from asia 2 from north america 2 from south america and 2 from africa brazil headed the article ranking of countries with the highest citations and numbers table 2 and was responsible for the most single country 212 and internationally collaborative articles 38 the usa published the second highest number of articles 133 followed by the uk 127 china 71 and germany 70 table 2 there were 505 single country articles from the five most productive countries which accounted for 64 41 of the total 784 single country articles brazil published 212 articles with the highest percentage of single country articles 27 04 while germany published 41 articles with the highest percentage of internationally collaborative articles 12 24 table 2 among the 20 most productive countries the average citations of articles per country tc tp fluctuated between 4 16 and 25 97 and the max difference among them was counted by 6 24 times table 2 kenya was the most powerful country to improve the influence by the mode of a single country with 29 73 citations value however mexico developed the way of internationally collaborative and obtained the highest citations value 47 33 table 2 european countries such as germany the uk portugal belgium france and denmark research mangrove crabs mainly in the way of international cooperation tc cp tc sp table 2 whereas countries with mangrove distribution such as brazil usa australia china and singapore studied mangrove crabs mainly by the way of a single country to uncover the comprehensive strength of the 20 most productive countries a series of ordination analyses were executed by the canoco 5 0 software after setting the average value of each index as a standardized index the principal component analysis pca results showed that the explained variations of the first two axes were 99 13 and 0 87 and four distinct patterns of the comprehensive strengths were identified there were 3 15 00 countries usa australia and italy with high number and citation of articles model 1 but 9 45 00 countries thailand uk malaysia south africa france singapore belgium japan and portugal with a low level of articles number and citation model 3 among the 20 most productive publications fig s5a india denmark mexico kenya and venezuela were the five countries which contained a high level of article citation but the low quantity of publications model 2 on the contrary brazil china and germany were the three members which developed a high level of article number but low quality model 4 fig s5a among the 20 countries the patterns of distribution of their comprehensive strengths were the difference between single country articles and internationally collaborative articles as well according to the result of internationally collaborative articles there were 57 50 and 42 50 explanatory power of the first and second axis and 3 2 8 and 7 countries distributed in models 1 2 3 and 4 separately fig s5b whereas about the single country articles model 1 contained 4 countries model 2 and 3 both comprised 7 members and model 4 obtained 2 countries fig s5c the spatial distribution of information among the 20 most productive publications countries 2876 unique keywords were classified which accounted for 91 19 of the total 3152 keywords based on the 100 most frequency keywords the most 20 productive publications countries were dived into three groups by hierarchical cluster analysis fig s6 more specifically the usa australia and brazil were the first group members the second group contained china germany singapore south africa italy and the uk japan thailand venezuela mexico india kenya malaysia belgium denmark and france were classified into the third group fig s6 the statistical work of keywords was performed to reveal the abundance of research information for the three groups the results showed that 1826 keywords were contained in the first group 1140 topics were researched in the second group and 937 keywords were found in the third group what s more the distribution pattern of keywords between them was exposed by venn diagram 1094 508 394 keywords existed alone in group 1 to group 3 accounting for 38 07 17 66 and 13 70 of 2876 keywords respectively fig s7 spatial autocorrelation analysis the globally and locally spatial autocorrelation sac analyses were enforced in the geoda software to further uncover the spatial disparity of mangrove crab research table s3 showed that all the total publications tp total citations tc and the absolute information content a info the total unique keywords displayed globally and locally spatial negative correlation moran s i less than 0 but only the tp and a info showed significant globally and locally spatial autocorrelation p less than 0 05 table s3 in addition the three models of ordinary least square model ols spatial lag model slm and spatial error model sem were running to reveal the spatial correlation between the tp independent variable and a info dependent variable the results showed that the model of mangrove crab research was fitting the sem table s4 spatial distribution of mangrove crab research hot spot regions we found that five countries with mangrove distribution that kenya 46 brazil 19 australia 9 indonesia 7 and mozambique 6 were most attractive to european scientists the hot spot regions of mangrove crabs were mapped with publications by arcgis 10 2 fig 4 a the hot regions are mainly distributed in 53 countries on a global scale north america e g usa south america e g brazil east africa e g kenya east asia e g china south asia e g india southeast asia e g malaysia and thailand and oceania e g australia were the top eight hot regions around the world fig 4a among them brazil occupied a leading position with 269 articles followed by australia 136 usa 135 china 71 and kenya 64 fig 4a in this study three study regions were created to study their hot topics which contained the americas africa east asia and east and south asia oceania fig 4a the number of keywords was 1590 americas 565 africa east asia and 1566 east and south asia oceania respectively there were 1106 215 and 842 unique keywords in them therefore there amounting to 2163 keywords which accounted for 68 62 of 3152 keywords were the unique themes around the world fig 4b it revealed that the spatial dynamics of research topics were mainly existing differences the top 20 topics of each study area were selected to reveal their hot topics based on their pca results fig 5 the first two axes accounted for 100 of cumulative explained variation there were nine co topics among them fig 5 purples and eleven unique themes in each of them fig 5 in the region of americas the breeding ecology individual ecology and population ecology were the main popular topics brazil was the most attractive place and fiddler crab was the most popular species fig 5 around the africa east asia region the individual ecology and population ecology were the mainstream topics grapsidae and portunidae were the two famous species kenya east africa and mozambique were the three hotspot area sites fig 5 in the east and south asia oceania region ecologists were interested in the biological taxonomy ecological effects of crab and the new research methods were keen on the species of sesarmidae and concerned about the australian very much fig 5 the popular journals the 1059 articles analyzed in our study were published in 306 journals from various scientific fields among these journals 289 journals 94 44 contained less than 10 articles while the most commonly used 20 journals published 416 articles on mangrove crab research accounting for more than 39 28 of total articles table s5 according to the titles and themes of these commonly used journals the journals about marine were identified as the popular journals of mangrove cab research the percentages of most commonly used journals were not high indicating the breadth of publication distribution as well as the broad interest in mangrove cabs research from various angles most articles on mangrove cabs 56 5 29 were published byjournal of experimental marine biology and ecology which evidenced that experimental research was the mainstream of mangrove crab research the result of principal component analysis pca showed that the 15 most frequently used journals were classified into five groups fig s8 among them 8 journals in red color were confirmed as the most influential journals for mangrove crab research fig s8 which contained journal of experimental marine biology and ecology marine ecology progress series estuarine coastal and shelf science hydrobiologia marine biology journal of sea research bulletin of marine science marine and freshwater research discussions the temporal dynamics over the past 37 years there were only a total of 1059 articles about mangrove crabs on global scare and approximately output average of 28 literatures per year significantly less than the mean of 257 4 articles per year on mangrove and the average annual of 308 papers on biofuel saravanan 2013 xu and boeing 2013 reflecting that mangrove crab research needs to be excavated deeply although their outputs were not much the annual distribution and temporal growth rate of their articles were respectively abiding by the logistic growth model and literature growth curve of d place these not only revealed their development law but also reflected their development can be predicted because the logistic growth model is a comprehensive forecasting model that has been applied in many fields e g ecology and information science bagley et al 2001 harrell 2015 and the literature growth curve of d place is a model specifically for predicting the development of literature price 1961 in addition to the number of documents the mean number of authors per article the average number of references and the average citations of articles per year are respectively three indexes about the level of cooperation knowledge accumulation and influences xu and boeing 2013 saravanan 2013 fu et al 2013 thus the development of this field has been more and more collaboration and accumulation during the last 37 years but its influence was increasing first and then decreased from 2016 to 1980 which revealed a phenomenon of literature obsolescence in this field lariviere et al 2008 author keywords are typically more indicative of the context of the article thus the analysis of the keyword is considered to be an effective way to comprehensively analyze the development trend of a field xu and boeing 2013 the power law is also an important role in information research clauset et al 2009 thus among the total keywords a small group of widely used keywords and the remaining large number of less used keywords could be separated generally the small group with a small number can reflect larger information in this field clauset et al 2009 xu and boeing 2013 the hierarchical cluster analysis hca is the best option to reveal the hierarchy of development xu and boeing 2013 therefore the 100 high frequency keywords have executed this analysis and the results certificated that mangrove crab research obviously existed in two development stages meanwhile these intimated to us that a comprehensive evaluation of mangrove crab research should divide into two stages what s more the distribution of information is an important indicator for the development of a field thus the relationship of information between the two stages was existed continuity by venn diagram chilakamarri et al 2000 and heat map zhang et al 2017 furthermore the continuity and coexistence for the category field of 100 frequent keywords were unearthed by hca these not only reflected the depth of research in the mangrove crab field xu and boeing 2013 but also reminded the lack of groundbreaking for this field to develop a wide range of research this may be one of the reasons why the number of articles was too small the temporal evolution analysis associated with co words network analysis is an effective way to comprehensively evaluate the hotspots of a field xu and boeing 2013 first of all the complex network of relationships further revealed its depth of research ding et al 2001 leydesdorff and persson 2010 following a more specific discussion grapsidae e g sesarmidae ocypodidae e g ucides cordatus and fiddler crab and portunidae e g mud crab are three common families of crabs in mangroves hartnoll et al 2002 therefore it is not astonished that they were the popular species in this filed moreover the distribution of these three species in estuarine mangrove wetland is also abundant lee 2008 due to it owning rich mangrove resources and attracting crabs to inhabit with the trait of adequate freshwater resources and rich nutrients reserves lotze et al 2006 therefore it is no doubt that the rank of estuary has rapidly risen during the last 37 years furthermore except habitat feeding habits are an indispensable fundamental theme of animal research nordhaus et al 2007 and food is the source of energy and the foundation of all ecological activities feller 2002 harada and lee 2016 therefore lots of work on the feeding ecology had been done and led to the ranking of keyword herbivory increased by 305 this shows that crab is a primary consumer in mangrove ecosystems and it is the key link between the producer and the consumer feller 2002 harada and lee 2016 kristensen 2008 population ecology is an unavoidable problem of ecological research hendry and day 2005 therefore that is why the keyword population structure showed a sharp rise in rankings in table 1 on account of reproductive characteristics and sex ratio play a decisive role in population structure hendry and day 2005 and reproductive ecology is directly related to the sustainability and vitality of population development nalepa et al 2010 thence the keywords reproduction sex ratio and fecundity also accompanied it to develop together and were constantly excavated at the same time besides these items of reproductive ecology the recruitment of larvae also plays an important role in the sustainable development and vitality of the population nalepa et al 2010 and is an indispensable item in this field lipcius and stockhausen 2002 that is why the keyword recruitment was newly created in the second stage table 1 and closed with the keyword population in the co words network fig 2 crabs are the ecological engineer of mangroves kristensen 2008 thus scientists are not restricted to the above items of mangrove crabs their ecological behavior and their ecological effects on the surroundings are the main causes of paying attention to them kristensen 2008 therefore the items of behavior ecology such as ecology behavior bioturbation sediments and carbon were very popular with scientists table 1 and all have a direct relationship to each other fig 2 not difficult to understand as the macrobenthos in mangroves kristensen 2008 most of their ecological behavior e g burrowing predation and excretion acts directly on the substrate which leads to the sediment environment e g carbon changes cannicci et al 2008 araújo júnior et al 2016 finally on the one hand the changes with feedback effect affecting their behavior cannicci et al 2008 on the other hand with chain effect further impacting the environment e g plant nagelkerken et al 2008 moreover new technologies and new methods are means of making significant progress in scientific research therefore the method of the stable isotope is widely used to solve biogeochemical problems due to the data can contribute both source sink tracer and process information jennerjahn 2012 peterson and fry 1987 so there is no doubt that the stable isotope was a hotspot in the last 37 years biodiversity is an indispensable topic for bio ecological research gaston 2000 reich et al 2012 after an in depth understanding of the population ecology behavioral ecology and ecological effects the biodiversity of mangrove crabs has been a hot topic since 1995 table 1 it revealed that this topic is a popular hotspot in mangrove ecosystem chen et al 2020 because biodiversity plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the structure and function of communities and ecosystems reich et al 2012 furthermore fully understanding the level of biodiversity and its impact mechanism for mangrove crabs not only helps us to promote scientific research but is also good for providing a theoretical basis for management steneck et al 2002 additionally biodiversity and distribution patterns are the necessary avenues for mastering the resources of mangrove crabs bandibas and hilomen 2016 steneck et al 2002 therefore it is not surprising that the items e g biodiversity diversity and distribution of this topic have been developed into hot topics during the last 37 years table 1 fig 2 capture fisheries production is believed to constitute the major value of marketed products from the mangroves kathiresan and bingham 2001 the keyword fishery was sustained attention by ecologists in the two stage table 1 and closed to the crab keywords e g mangrove crabs and mangrove crab in the co words network these revealed that fishery production was still an important research direction because it was directly related to the production of income lee 2008 a complementary explanation is that the mud crab scylla serrata is the most important crab for commercial culture le et al 2008 therefore the keyword mud crab increased 67 ranks and didn t astonish us the spatial dynamics based on the number of publications 63 countries territories were confirmed to participate in the mangrove crab research on a global scale this result also helps to identify the countries or continents which have taken up the research work in this particular field saravanan 2013 from the perspective of the intercontinental the americas asia and europe are the top three continents that were contributing more to this field from the national perspective brazil the usa and australia are the three countries that were dedicating more to the field additionally some problems are highlighted as well the research on global mangrove crabs was not comprehensive because some countries with mangrove distribution are still outside this field which mainly contains most of the west african countries e g angola ghana and togo some countries in the middle of the americas e g honduras guatemala and cuba and some southeast asian countries e g cambodia and myanmar fig 3 except for the number of articles that can lead to the global contribution rate pattern differentiation the influencing index tc tp is also an important indicator of the influence of a country in a particular field xu and boeing 2013 however the influence of the country is also different in this field because of the different modes of cooperation kenya took leadership in the single country mode but mexico is the leader in the international collaboration model these are not enough yet the comprehensive strength of a country in the science field was reflected by the number of articles and the influence was marked by the citations yu et al 2016 therefore based on the principle of ordination analysis ter braak and smilauer 2015 ringner 2008 the usa australia and italy dominate the research on global mangrove crabs have been identified unfortunately even though countries from south america africa and asia have most of the world s mangrove resources miller 2005 they are still outside it therefore the differentiation of the global dominant pattern is serious in this field in addition this pattern is also affected by the way of cooperation fig s5b c so they can break the pattern by changing the way of cooperation except that the above indicators reflect spatial differences in this field the information about the subject matter is the most intuitive indicator of spatial distribution patterns leydesdorff and persson 2010 thence more than 90 of the total information in this field was further analyzed and divided into three different patterns fig s6 different mode has different information content fig s7 it reflected that there are global differences and imbalances in the research content the evidence for these differences and imbalances is also displayed in other aspects such as group 1 contained the highest information content with the lowest country number but group 3 owned the lowest information content with the highest country number fig s7 to test and verify the above conclusions about spatial differences and imbalances spatial autocorrelation analyses were executed in this study because it can conduct a comprehensive evaluation of global and regional scale data dormann et al 2007 and has been widely used in the ecological field e g species distributional dormann et al 2007 tittensor et al 2010 based on the value of moran s i tittensor et al 2010 the mangrove crab research existed significant and negative spatial autocorrelation global and local therefore the modes of spatial autocorrelation can be applied to this study dormann et al 2007 such as ordinary least square model ols spatial lag model slm and spatial error model sem dormann et al 2007 worm et al 2005 therefore the tp independent variable and a info dependent variable were carried out to find out a suitable model for this field finally the sem was verified to be the best appropriate mode in this field not finished yet the hot regions and their hotspots are also issues that ecologists want to know because they can resolve the two important questions in this field which places have been carried out the research and what research has been studied in these places the geospatial analysis can answer these questions scott and janikas 2010 thus 53 countries territories were confirmed and they were very attractive to the scientist fig 4a what s more brazil australia the usa china and kenya were the five countries that have been identified as the hottest spot region on a global scale in addition to affirm these achievements some problems are unavoidable the global pattern of serious differences uneven regional development and other issues still existed firstly there were still few research activities in the western and northeastern african regions secondly some countries in central america are still in a blank state finally some southeast asian countries are also in a blank stage it further illustrates that the development of this field was not comprehensive and uneven this may be one of the reasons for the small number of publications moreover the three major regional statistical information also certified that there was not comprehensive and uneven in this field fig s8 finally in addition to focusing on the hotspot of each major region fig 5 the problems implied in their back are more worthy of our exploration the specific circumstances are as follows first of all in the region of the americas except for its three hotspots breeding ecology individual ecology and population ecology some other topics e g behavioral ecology biodiversity and ecological effects were ignored or lagged behind secondly in the africa west asia the breeding ecology and new research methods were ignored or lagged behind by ecologist finally the breeding ecology and feeding ecology were neglected or lagged behind by scientist in view of this each region should maintain its advantage theme while strengthening the development of backward themes conclusions the temporal and co word analysis of keywords provides clues for research tendencies and hotspots stable isotope is the most favorite method and grapsidae ocypodidae and portunidae were the three common species in these researches the population structure of mangrove crabs is the focus of most attention thus indicators that have a significant impact on population structure also become hot spots e g reproduction sex ratio and fecundity as the ecological engineer of the mangrove ecosystem the behavioral ecology e g burrowing and bioturbation and feeding ecology e g predation and herbivory were essential and developed into a new hot spot what s more their ecological effects on the sediments were also the main issues in this field mangrove ecosystems have been claimed as critical habitats for economic animals thus the function of the breeding sites of fishery resources e g mud crab scylla serrata has been a research topic for a long time different research hotspots were found among the americas africa east asia and east and south asia oceania in the americas the reproductive ecology and population ecology of mangrove crabs were the main study topics in the africa east asia region the behavioral ecology and population characteristics were the hotspots the ecological effect of crabs and the stable isotope were the main research hotspots in the east and south asia oceania region the research challenge should also be highlighted especially the uneven regional development and the overall development is not comprehensive most of the countries in the west and northeast of africa e g angola some central american countries e g guatemala and a few western and southeast asian countries e g cambodia were still outside this research field to reduce the imbalance of regional development they should face up to these issues in the americas region the behavioral ecology biodiversity and ecological effects were ignored or lagged behind in the africa west asia region less research about the breeding ecology and new research methods in the east and south asia oceania region the breeding ecology and feeding ecology were little known therefore in future research except for strengthening research on the blank regions scientists should also pay more attention to the regional balance of research topics for the blank regions international cooperation was strongly recommended and scientists should orderly carry out these studies e g biodiversity population ecology and behavioral ecology for the theme of uneven development among regions in the americas region scientists should strengthen research the topics are population ecology behavioral ecology biodiversity and ecological effects in the africa west asia region the breeding ecology and new research methods etc should be given more attention in the east and south asia oceania region the breeding ecology and feeding ecology etc should be studied more declaration of competing interest the

20059,crabs are the most dominant groups in mangrove ecosystem and play a vital role in building and sustaining the structure and function of the mangrove ecosystems however a systematic evaluation of global research status of mangrove crabs is still lacking here a bibliometric analysis based on the science citation index expanded sci e was carried out to provide insights into research activities tendencies and challenges of the mangrove crabs from 1980 to 2016 the results showed that the average annual output of the publications was low brazil took a leading position out of the 63 countries territories with the largest number of publications followed by usa australia china and germany journal of experimental marine biology and ecology was the most popular journal the reproductive ecology e g reproduction population ecology e g population structure and their relationship were the mainstream the estuarine ecosystem and the method of stable isotope received ecologists favor behavioral ecology e g bioturbation ecosystem function e g carbon and the ecological effect among them were the main issues in this field biodiversity was a new hot topic brazil australia usa china and kenya were the top five hot regions among the 53 hot countries on a global scale different regions have different hot topics the breeding ecology was the most popular theme in the americas region the ecological effects of crabs were the most hotstops in the africa east asia region and the east and south asia oceania region the challenges of the development were not comprehensive and uneven on a global scale there was a certain number of countries with mangrove distributions were still outside this field such as most of the western and northeastern countries of africa e g angola some central american countries e g guatemala and some western and southeast asian countries e g cambodia furthermore we found that some topics were ignored or lagged in each territory our results highlight that the global research status of mangrove crab is still at a relatively backward stage and regional development is extremely unbalanced keywords bibliometric mangrove crabs hotspot spatio temporal dynamics challenges introduction mangroves have long attracted interest in the scientific community arguably due to their high biodiversity climate change mitigation and high productivity kathiresan and bingham 2001 luther and greenberg 2009 over the past few decades research on mangroves has yielded many insights into their ecological functions barbier et al 2008 global patterns and processes luther and greenberg 2009 chen et al 2021 and adaptations to saline environments krauss et al 2008 as well as into their role in namely a haven for many juvenile marine species fishes crustaceans shellfish reptiles and mammals nagelkerken et al 2008 benthic fauna especially crabs as the ecological engineers of mangrove ecosystem are one of the most dominant groups in mangroves and play a vital role in building and sustaining the structure and function of mangrove ecosystems cannicci et al 2008 kristensen 2008 such as nutrient recycling lee 1998 and detritus formation they form an important link in the mangrove food web harada and lee 2016 and the dynamics of the ecosystems through their feeding activities nordhaus et al 2007 their burrowing activity changes the topography of the mangrove floor and improves soil aeration and enhances the bioturbation of soil sediments gillikin and kamanu 2005 what s more lots of efforts had been done to research mangrove crabs in the last few decades nabout et al 2010 peer et al 2015 among them mainly carried out mesoscale and small scale ecology research which includes biodiversity bandibas and hilomen 2016 bosire et al 2004 lee 2008 feeding ecology nordhaus et al 2007 eco behavior e g burrowing araújo júnior et al 2016 gillikin and kamanu 2005 physiological mechanisms charmantier et al 2002 morphological characteristics naderloo et al 2016 and developed microscale ecology research which contains microecology e g microbial parasitism and molecular ecology e g gene identification naderloo et al 2016 silva et al 2010 additionally several large scale research works had been made e g the populations and global warming fusi et al 2015 hall and thatje 2009 however a systematic evaluation of global mangrove crabs research is still lacking the first comprehensive review of mangrove crabs was conducted in 1984 which described the occurrence of 61 genera and subgenera of crabs in mangrove ecosystems with ocypodidae and grapsidae being the two most important families in terms of taxa jones 1984 hereafter another effort about reviewing and evaluating the diversity the ecological role as well as the implications of such findings for mangrove conservation of grapsid crabs in indo pacific mangrove ecosystems was conducted in 1998 lee 1998 further achievement a scientometric analysis of fiddler crab genus uca decapoda ocypodidae in coastal was published in 2010 and a comprehensive evaluation of the global literature on fiddler crab has been carried out nabout et al 2010 not yet finished a review of fiddler crabs in south africa was published in 2015 which discussed in depth the aspects of biological and ecological including life cycle and reproduction feeding ecology biotic interactions and tolerance to environmental fluctuations and pollution peer et al 2015 yet the overall research status and challenges in this field are still poorly understood nonetheless macrobenthos is not well studied as compared to others e g vegetation in the mangrove ecosystem lee 2008 it s not difficult to find that there is practically no overall information about mangrove crab research on a broad scale this leads to much comprehensive information on mangrove crabs remaining poorly understood therefore this is an important factor in the rapid degradation of mangrove resources over the last few decades feka and ajonina 2011 valiela et al 2001 therefore it is not surprising that understanding and predicting the spatiotemporal dynamics of biological characteristics e g population and research trends remains a central goal in ecology jetz et al 2012 furthermore large scale research is an effective way to master scientific information gaston 2000 willig et al 2003 thus thorough review research of the science behind mangrove crabs on a global scale is urgently needed to not only improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of global mangrove crabs but also effectively guide us to exploit and protect the biodiversity of mangroves in the future considering that many studies of mangrove crabs have already been published bibliometric is a useful way to map the literature around a research field torres salinas et al 2013 which has been used in much global research of specific fields recently xu and boeing 2013 thus bibliometric evaluation of publications could serve as an alternative and innovative way of connecting various aspects of scientific findings and revealing global research trends of mangrove crabs bibliometric analysis is based on the research methodology employed in the science of library and information and it contains a series of quantitative and visual procedures to generalize the patterns and dynamics of publications cobo et al 2011 bibliometric methods have already been widely discussed in many disciplines e g science engineering and mangroves and could interpret the scientific production and research trends of a specific topic fu et al 2013 saravanan 2013 xu and boeing 2013 it is a comprehensive scientific analysis platform which sets the authoritative databases e g the web of science database institute for scientific information isi as the data source and based on source title countries institutes journals authors reference rate keywords abstract to analyze the development of research fields across different periods persson 2009 however traditional bibliometric analysis in scientific research fields has many deficiencies such as data deficiencies and not comprehensive analysis e g only selecting several journals or categories to represent global research trends of a topic nabout et al 2010 xu and boeing 2013 furthermore geographic analyses can elucidate spatial patterns and identify geographic areas in which most of the research activity occurs miller 2005 network analysis allows us to understand the interrelationships among research disciplines helps us to visualize the collaborative patterns among countries and institutions and can identify the hot issues of a research field morel et al 2009 based on the sci e web of science information from the period 1980 2016 the present bibliometric evaluation combined traditional literary analysis and innovative methods to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of mangrove crab research in this study we expected to study the research status and challenges of mangrove crab topics by exploring the temporal and spatial dynamics of keywords materials and methods data sources the mangrove crabs data was downloaded from the scientific citation index expanded sci e databases of the web science thomson reuters the combination indexing mangrove and crab were searched in terms of a topic within the publication year limitation from 1980 to 2016 the record of an individual document included the following fields downloaded authors au document title ti language la document type dt author keywords de key words plus id author address c1 reference count nr times cited tc year published py and journal name jn after the operation has been performed to eliminate the duplicated records a total of 1 059 publications were identified as being related to mangrove crabs classification methods six document types were identified among a total of 1 059 publications among them the most number of publications was the peer reviewed research articles document type 992 which accounted for 93 67 of total publications the five other document types which contained reviews 27 2 55 proceeding paper 21 1 98 meeting abstract 12 1 14 note 6 0 57 and editorial material 1 0 09 there were six types of publishing language but 1024 of the 1059 papers 96 69 were published in english the last five publishing languages included portuguese 26 2 46 spanish 4 0 38 french 2 0 19 japanese 2 0 19 and russian 1 0 09 the articles published by england scotland northern ireland and wales were reclassified as being published by the united kingdom uk and the articles from hong kong and taiwan were included in publications from china xu and boeing 2013 according to the number of articles arcgis 10 2 software was used to map the global distribution of mangrove crabs outputs and classify all countries into several groups scott and janikas 2010 and origin pro 9 1 software was executed to map the temporal variation and fit the development model of mangrove crabs outputs seifert 2014 the collaborations among countries were determined by the addresses of the authors based on the following strategies the term single country article was assigned to the article where co authors were from the same country while the term internationally collaborative article was assigned when researchers were from multiple countries fu et al 2013 xu and boeing 2013 the 20 most productive countries in mangrove crabs research were characterized by total publications total citations single country articles and citations and international collaborative articles and citations using the output features the science mapping of comprehensive strength was built for the 20 most productive countries of mangrove crabs research by the software of canoco 5 ter braak and smilauer 2015 the title author keywords and abstract provide a considerable overview of an article s theme although the title and abstract are readily available in articles the meaning of a single word within the title or abstract might be more obscure the keywords analysis can provide a relatively comprehensive overview of mangrove crabs research trends because the authors keywords are typically more indicative of the context of the article xu and boeing 2013 thus the author s keywords were analyzed to demonstrate the tendencies and hotspots of mangrove crabs research bornmann and mutz 2015 saravanan 2013 xu and boeing 2013 the spss 21 0 software was performed to conduct frequency analysis to define the most frequent keywords according to annual compositions of the 100 most frequent keywords several periods and some groups of countries of mangrove crabs research were determined by hierarchical cluster analysis hca with the software of pc ord 4 0 xu and boeing 2013 following the procedure of co words analysis the co words network of the 50 most frequent keywords was mapped to explore research hotspots in addition combining with venn diagram statistical analysis chilakamarri et al 2000 sorting analysis and spatial autocorrelation analysis dormann et al 2007 ter braak and smilauer 2015 to find out the pattern of mangrove crabs research in geographical change based on the natural distribution of mangroves the hot regions of mangrove crabs were identified in the americas africa asia and oceania a bold assumption was dished that the study areas of countries with mangrove distributions were cited in their own countries whereas the countries with no mangrove distributions were obtained by counting the summary and material method of their articles what s more the hot regions of mangrove crabs were mapped and divided into three regions which contained the americas africa east asia and the east and south asia oceania by arcgis 10 2 analyzing the relationship between their research information and revealing the hotspots of each region by summarizing the top 20 keywords to provide a reference for scholars to publish their findings on mangrove crabs research the 15 most popular journals were generalized by the number of articles citations and impact factor the impact factor and positions in a web of science categories were taken from journal citation reports jcr published in 2016 using the software of canoco 5 the procedures of principal components analysis pca were used to map the most influential journals ter braak and smilauer 2015 data analysis to uncover the temporal dynamics of mangrove crab research we used hierarchical cluster analysis hca heat map analysis and venn diagram to reveal the temporal dynamics of all keywords a co words network of the 50 most frequently used keywords was formed to identify the hot issues of mangrove crab research to reveal the spatial dynamics of mangrove crab research geographic analysis venn diagram analysis and ordination analysis were used to reveal the hot regions and hot issues based on keywords results temporal dynamics temporal dynamics of publication outputs the number of articles per year showed a volatility increase trend during the last 37 years 1980 2016 and the trend was consistent with the logistic model fig s1a table s1 meanwhile the sustained growth rate of the global mangrove crabs publications fitted to the literature growth curve of d place fig s1b table s1 the parameter b represents the sustained increase rate of literature price 1961 its value was 0 15 table s1 and according to the equation time ln2 b price 1961 these results not only revealed that the model had high stability but also exposed that it took roughly 4 62 years to double the number of global mangrove crab literature the descriptors of major scientific productivity are generalized from 1980 to 2016 in table s2 the mean number of authors per articles heightened from 1 to 4 33 during 1980 2016 table s2 moreover there was showing an overall upward trend over time the average number of references showed an overall increasing trend over time table s2 in addition with the increase in publication time the average citations of article per year tc tp displayed two development stages one stage with an upward trend from 2016 to 1991 and another phase with a downward trend from1980 to 1990 table s2 and the average number of references showed an overall increasing trend over time table s2 temporal dynamics of research tendencies and hotspots among the 1059 publications there were 3152 unique keywords which appeared 6745 times the relationship between the frequency of keywords and their ranks was fitting the power law distribution fig s2 there were 2194 keywords that appeared only one time each accounting for 69 61 of the total 3152 keywords however 100 3 17 most frequent keywords appeared 2026 times and were responsible for 30 04 of the total keyword and then based on the constitution of these 100 high frequency words hierarchical cluster analysis hca categorized the development period of mangrove crabs research 1980 2016 into two distinct phases fig s3 stage 1 1980 1994 and stage 2 1995 2016 furthermore the distribution of keywords in these two stages was counted by venn diagram fig s4 the results displayed that there were 504 common keywords between the two stages accounting for 78 90 of the total keywords in stage 1 and 16 75 of all the keywords in stage 2 whereas 143 unique keywords in stage 1 and 2505 peculiar keywords accounting for 22 10 and 83 25 of these 647 keywords in stage 1 and 3009 keywords in stage 2 respectively fig s4 in order to further reveal the otherness and commonness of research topics between the two stages the 100 most frequent keywords were dissected by hca and heat map collaborative analysis fifty unique keywords of mangrove crabs were the common topics between the two phases co topics accounting for 50 00 of the 100 keywords fig 1 heat map six group topics were classified at 1 8e 0 1 distance value by hca fig 1 hca what s more the first group gathered the information on search terms breeding ecology behavior ecology feeding ecology the new method and fishery production etc the population ecology behavioral ecology feeding ecology of crabs were in the second the third group mainly expounded the biodiversity and taxonomy of crab the fourth group contained behavior ecology population ecology and environmental effects of mangrove crabs the fifth group was formed by the breeding ecology bioturbation and the model of crab the feeding ecology biogeochemical and environmental effects were in the last group fig 1 different groups contained multiple topics which reflected the synergistic effect of mangrove crab research over time the similar themes between different groups further explained that the mangrove crab research retained continuity over time the 50 most frequent keywords appeared 1509 times and thus less than 2 00 of 3152 keywords were responsible for 22 37 of total keyword occurrences the temporal evolution for them was presented by the summaries of frequency and rank table 1 and the intellectual connections of scientific knowledge are shown by the co words network fig 2 it is worth emphasizing that connection represents a direct relationship the greater relationship then the closer position between keywords in the co words network ding et al 2001 leydesdorff and persson 2010 the result showed that the 50 keywords existed with dense connections fig 2 it reflected the complexity and diversity of mangrove crab research ranking top three the keywords mangrove crab and mangroves were the search terms in the data retrieval process table 1 and occupied the core position in the co words network fig 2 three families of crabs were the main types of biological hotspots in mangroves which contained grapsidae e g sesarmidae ocypodidae e g ucides cordatus and fiddler crab and portunidae e g mud crab and their ranking had a different degree of promotion from the first stage to the second phase e g the ranking of ocypodidae increased 91 grapsidae advanced 26 and portunidae gone forward 15 table 1 a sharp rise in rankings occurred among the estuary brachyura reproduction stable isotopes population structure kenya sex ratio fecundity sediments carbon genus uca and herbivory which rankings advanced more than 100 ranks from the first stage to the second phase table 1 sesarmidae recruitment biodiversity mozambique distribution mangrove forest and settlement were the seven new topics in the second stage table 1 the spatial dynamics the spatial dynamics of publication outputs the global distribution of published articles for mangrove crabs shows a broad geographical coverage a total of 63 countries territories are involved in mangrove crab research fig 3 and the average production of them was 16 81 articles the 63 countries were classified into three groups based on the mean level of production the first group comprised 34 countries which contained 20 31 75 countries that just published only one article the second group totaled 8 countries and the third group included the 20 most productive countries among the 20 countries 7 were from europe 7 from asia 2 from north america 2 from south america and 2 from africa brazil headed the article ranking of countries with the highest citations and numbers table 2 and was responsible for the most single country 212 and internationally collaborative articles 38 the usa published the second highest number of articles 133 followed by the uk 127 china 71 and germany 70 table 2 there were 505 single country articles from the five most productive countries which accounted for 64 41 of the total 784 single country articles brazil published 212 articles with the highest percentage of single country articles 27 04 while germany published 41 articles with the highest percentage of internationally collaborative articles 12 24 table 2 among the 20 most productive countries the average citations of articles per country tc tp fluctuated between 4 16 and 25 97 and the max difference among them was counted by 6 24 times table 2 kenya was the most powerful country to improve the influence by the mode of a single country with 29 73 citations value however mexico developed the way of internationally collaborative and obtained the highest citations value 47 33 table 2 european countries such as germany the uk portugal belgium france and denmark research mangrove crabs mainly in the way of international cooperation tc cp tc sp table 2 whereas countries with mangrove distribution such as brazil usa australia china and singapore studied mangrove crabs mainly by the way of a single country to uncover the comprehensive strength of the 20 most productive countries a series of ordination analyses were executed by the canoco 5 0 software after setting the average value of each index as a standardized index the principal component analysis pca results showed that the explained variations of the first two axes were 99 13 and 0 87 and four distinct patterns of the comprehensive strengths were identified there were 3 15 00 countries usa australia and italy with high number and citation of articles model 1 but 9 45 00 countries thailand uk malaysia south africa france singapore belgium japan and portugal with a low level of articles number and citation model 3 among the 20 most productive publications fig s5a india denmark mexico kenya and venezuela were the five countries which contained a high level of article citation but the low quantity of publications model 2 on the contrary brazil china and germany were the three members which developed a high level of article number but low quality model 4 fig s5a among the 20 countries the patterns of distribution of their comprehensive strengths were the difference between single country articles and internationally collaborative articles as well according to the result of internationally collaborative articles there were 57 50 and 42 50 explanatory power of the first and second axis and 3 2 8 and 7 countries distributed in models 1 2 3 and 4 separately fig s5b whereas about the single country articles model 1 contained 4 countries model 2 and 3 both comprised 7

19 of the total 3152 keywords based on the 100 most frequency keywords the most 20 productive publications countries were dived into three groups by hierarchical cluster analysis fig s6 more specifically the usa australia and brazil were the first group members the second group contained china germany singapore south africa italy and the uk japan thailand venezuela mexico india kenya malaysia belgium denmark and france were classified into the third group fig s6 the statistical work of keywords was performed to reveal the abundance of research information for the three groups the results showed that 1826 keywords were contained in the first group 1140 topics were researched in the second group and 937 keywords were found in the third group what s more the distribution pattern of keywords between them was exposed by venn diagram 1094 508 394 keywords existed alone in group 1 to group 3 accounting for 38 07 17 66 and 13 70 of 2876 keywords respectively fig s7 spatial autocorrelation analysis the globally and locally spatial autocorrelation sac analyses were enforced in the geoda software to further uncover the spatial disparity of mangrove crab research table s3 showed that all the total publications tp total citations tc and the absolute information content a info the total unique keywords displayed globally and locally spatial negative correlation moran s i less than 0 but only the tp and a info showed significant globally and locally spatial autocorrelation p less than 0 05 table s3 in addition the three models of ordinary least square model ols spatial lag model slm and spatial error model sem were running to reveal the spatial correlation between the tp independent variable and a info dependent variable the results showed that the model of mangrove crab research was fitting the sem table s4 spatial distribution of mangrove crab research hot spot regions we found that five countries with mangrove distribution that kenya 46 brazil 19 australia 9 indonesia 7 and mozambique 6 were most attractive to european scientists the hot spot regions of mangrove crabs were mapped with publications by arcgis 10 2 fig 4 a the hot regions are mainly distributed in 53 countries on a global scale north america e g usa south america e g brazil east africa e g kenya east asia e g china south asia e g india southeast asia e g malaysia and thailand and oceania e g australia were the top eight hot regions around the world fig 4a among them brazil occupied a leading position with 269 articles followed by australia 136 usa 135 china 71 and kenya 64 fig 4a in this study three study regions were created to study their hot topics which contained the americas africa east asia and east and south asia oceania fig 4a the number of keywords was 1590 americas 565 africa east asia and 1566 east and south asia oceania respectively there were 1106 215 and 842 unique keywords in them therefore there amounting to 2163 keywords which accounted for 68 62 of 3152 keywords were the unique themes around the world fig 4b it revealed that the spatial dynamics of research topics were mainly existing differences the top 20 topics of each study area were selected to reveal their hot topics based on their pca results fig 5 the first two axes accounted for 100 of cumulative explained variation there were nine co topics among them fig 5 purples and eleven unique themes in each of them fig 5 in the region of americas the breeding ecology individual ecology and population ecology were the main popular topics brazil was the most attractive place and fiddler crab was the most popular species fig 5 around the africa east asia region the individual ecology and population ecology were the mainstream topics grapsidae and portunidae were the two famous species kenya east africa and mozambique were the three hotspot area sites fig 5 in the east and south asia oceania region ecologists were interested in the biological taxonomy ecological effects of crab and the new research methods were keen on the species of sesarmidae and concerned about the australian very much fig 5 the popular journals the 1059 articles analyzed in our study were published in 306 journals from various scientific fields among these journals 289 journals 94 44 contained less than 10 articles while the most commonly used 20 journals published 416 articles on mangrove crab research accounting for more than 39 28 of total articles table s5 according to the titles and themes of these commonly used journals the journals about marine were identified as the popular journals of mangrove cab research the percentages of most commonly used journals were not high indicating the breadth of publication distribution as well as the broad interest in mangrove cabs research from various angles most articles on mangrove cabs 56 5 29 were published byjournal of experimental marine biology and ecology which evidenced that experimental research was the mainstream of mangrove crab research the result of principal component analysis pca showed that the 15 most frequently used journals were classified into five groups fig s8 among them 8 journals in red color were confirmed as the most influential journals for mangrove crab research fig s8 which contained journal of experimental marine biology and ecology marine ecology progress series estuarine coastal and shelf science hydrobiologia marine biology journal of sea research bulletin of marine science marine and freshwater research discussions the temporal dynamics over the past 37 years there were only a total of 1059 articles about mangrove crabs on global scare and approximately output average of 28 literatures per year significantly less than the mean of 257 4 articles per year on mangrove and the average annual of 308 papers on biofuel saravanan 2013 xu and boeing 2013 reflecting that mangrove crab research needs to be excavated deeply although their outputs were not much the annual distribution and temporal growth rate of their articles were respectively abiding by the logistic growth model and literature growth curve of d place these not only revealed their development law but also reflected their development can be predicted because the logistic growth model is a comprehensive forecasting model that has been applied in many fields e g ecology and information science bagley et al 2001 harrell 2015 and the literature growth curve of d place is a model specifically for predicting the development of literature price 1961 in addition to the number of documents the mean number of authors per article the average number of references and the average citations of articles per year are respectively three indexes about the level of cooperation knowledge accumulation and influences xu and boeing 2013 saravanan 2013 fu et al 2013 thus the development of this field has been more and more collaboration and accumulation during the last 37 years but its influence was increasing first and then decreased from 2016 to 1980 which revealed a phenomenon of literature obsolescence in this field lariviere et al 2008 author keywords are typically more indicative of the context of the article thus the analysis of the keyword is considered to be an effective way to comprehensively analyze the development trend of a field xu and boeing 2013 the power law is also an important role in information research clauset et al 2009 thus among the total keywords a small group of widely used keywords and the remaining large number of less used keywords could be separated generally the small group with a small number can reflect larger information in this field clauset et al 2009 xu and boeing 2013 the hierarchical cluster analysis hca is the best option to reveal the hierarchy of development xu and boeing 2013 therefore the 100 high frequency keywords have executed this analysis and the results certificated that mangrove crab research obviously existed in two development stages meanwhile these intimated to us that a comprehensive evaluation of mangrove crab research should divide into two stages what s more the distribution of information is an important indicator for the development of a field thus the relationship of information between the two stages was existed continuity by venn diagram chilakamarri et al 2000 and heat map zhang et al 2017 furthermore the continuity and coexistence for the category field of 100 frequent keywords were unearthed by hca these not only reflected the depth of research in the mangrove crab field xu and boeing 2013 but also reminded the lack of groundbreaking for this field to develop a wide range of research this may be one of the reasons why the number of articles was too small the temporal evolution analysis associated with co words network analysis is an effective way to comprehensively evaluate the hotspots of a field xu and boeing 2013 first of all the complex network of relationships further revealed its depth of research ding et al 2001 leydesdorff and persson 2010 following a more specific discussion grapsidae e g sesarmidae ocypodidae e g ucides cordatus and fiddler crab and portunidae e g mud crab are three common families of crabs in mangroves hartnoll et al 2002 therefore it is not astonished that they were the popular species in this filed moreover the distribution of these three species in estuarine mangrove wetland is also abundant lee 2008 due to it owning rich mangrove resources and attracting crabs to inhabit with the trait of adequate freshwater resources and rich nutrients reserves lotze et al 2006 therefore it is no doubt that the rank of estuary has rapidly risen during the last 37 years furthermore except habitat feeding habits are an indispensable fundamental theme of animal research nordhaus et al 2007 and food is the source of energy and the foundation of all ecological activities feller 2002 harada and lee 2016 therefore lots of work on the feeding ecology had been done and led to the ranking of keyword herbivory increased by 305 this shows that crab is a primary consumer in mangrove ecosystems and it is the key link between the producer and the consumer feller 2002 harada and lee 2016 kristensen 2008 population ecology is an unavoidable problem of ecological research hendry and day 2005 therefore that is why the keyword population structure showed a sharp rise in rankings in table 1 on account of reproductive characteristics and sex ratio play a decisive role in population structure hendry and day 2005 and reproductive ecology is directly related to the sustainability and vitality of population development nalepa et al 2010 thence the keywords reproduction sex ratio and fecundity also accompanied it to develop together and were constantly excavated at the same time besides these items of reproductive ecology the recruitment of larvae also plays an important role in the sustainable development and vitality of the population nalepa et al 2010 and is an indispensable item in this field lipcius and stockhausen 2002 that is why the keyword recruitment was newly created in the second stage table 1 and closed with the keyword population in the co words network fig 2 crabs are the ecological engineer of mangroves kristensen 2008 thus scientists are not restricted to the above items of mangrove crabs their ecological behavior and their ecological effects on the surroundings are the main causes of paying attention to them kristensen 2008 therefore the items of behavior ecology such as ecology behavior bioturbation sediments and carbon were very popular with scientists table 1 and all have a direct relationship to each other fig 2 not difficult to understand as the macrobenthos in mangroves kristensen 2008 most of their ecological behavior e g burrowing predation and excretion acts directly on the substrate which leads to the sediment environment e g carbon changes cannicci et al 2008 araújo júnior et al 2016 finally on the one hand the changes with feedback effect affecting their behavior cannicci et al 2008 on the other hand with chain effect further impacting the environment e g plant nagelkerken et al 2008 moreover new technologies and new methods are means of making significant progress in scientific research therefore the method of the stable isotope is widely used to solve biogeochemical problems due to the data can contribute both source sink tracer and process information jennerjahn 2012 peterson and fry 1987 so there is no doubt that the stable isotope was a hotspot in the last 37 years biodiversity is an indispensable topic for bio ecological research gaston 2000 reich et al 2012 after an in depth understanding of the population ecology behavioral ecology and ecological effects the biodiversity of mangrove crabs has been a hot topic since 1995 table 1 it revealed that this topic is a popular hotspot in mangrove ecosystem chen et al 2020 because biodiversity plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the structure and function of communities and ecosystems reich et al 2012 furthermore fully understanding the level of biodiversity and its impact mechanism for mangrove crabs not only helps us to promote scientific research but is also good for providing a theoretical basis for management steneck et al 2002 additionally biodiversity and distribution patterns are the necessary avenues for mastering the resources of mangrove crabs bandibas and hilomen 2016 steneck et al 2002 therefore it is not surprising that the items e g biodiversity diversity and distribution of this topic have been developed into hot topics during the last 37 years table 1 fig 2 capture fisheries production is believed to constitute the major value of marketed products from the mangroves kathiresan and bingham 2001 the keyword fishery was sustained attention by ecologists in the two stage table 1 and closed to the crab keywords e g mangrove crabs and mangrove crab in the co words network these revealed that fishery production was still an important research direction because it was directly related to the production of income lee 2008 a complementary explanation is that the mud crab scylla serrata is the most important crab for commercial culture le et al 2008 therefore the keyword mud crab increased 67 ranks and didn t astonish us the spatial dynamics based on the number of publications 63 countries territories were confirmed to participate in the mangrove crab research on a global scale this result also helps to identify the countries or continents which have taken up the research work in this particular field saravanan 2013 from the perspective of the intercontinental the americas asia and europe are the top three continents that were contributing more to this field from the national perspective brazil the usa and australia are the three countries that were dedicating more to the field additionally some problems are highlighted as well the research on global mangrove crabs was not comprehensive because some countries with mangrove distribution are still outside this field which mainly contains most of the west african countries e g angola ghana and togo some countries in the middle of the americas e g honduras guatemala and cuba and some southeast asian countries e g cambodia and myanmar fig 3 except for the number of articles that can lead to the global contribution rate pattern differentiation the influencing index tc tp is also an important indicator of the influence of a country in a particular field xu and boeing 2013 however the influence of the country is also different in this field because of the different modes of cooperation kenya took leadership in the single country mode but mexico is the leader in the international collaboration model these are not enough yet the comprehensive strength of a country in the science field was reflected by the number of articles and the influence was marked by the citations yu et al 2016 therefore based on the principle of ordination analysis ter braak and smilauer 2015 ringner 2008 the usa australia and italy dominate the research on global mangrove crabs have been identified unfortunately even though countries from south america africa and asia have most of the world s mangrove resources miller 2005 they are still outside it therefore the differentiation of the global dominant pattern is serious in this field in addition this pattern is also affected by the way of cooperation fig s5b c so they can break the pattern by changing the way of cooperation except that the above indicators reflect spatial differences in this field the information about the subject matter is the most intuitive indicator of spatial distribution patterns leydesdorff and persson 2010 thence more than 90 of the total information in this field was further analyzed and divided into three different patterns fig s6 different mode has different information content fig s7 it reflected that there are global differences and imbalances in the research content the evidence for these differences and imbalances is also displayed in other aspects such as group 1 contained the highest information content with the lowest country number but group 3 owned the lowest information content with the highest country number fig s7 to test and verify the above conclusions about spatial differences and imbalances spatial autocorrelation analyses were executed in this study because it can conduct a comprehensive evaluation of global and regional scale data dormann et al 2007 and has been widely used in the ecological field e g species distributional dormann et al 2007 tittensor et al 2010 based on the value of moran s i tittensor et al 2010 the mangrove crab research existed significant and negative spatial autocorrelation global and local therefore the modes of spatial autocorrelation can be applied to this study dormann et al 2007 such as ordinary least square model ols spatial lag model slm and spatial error model sem dormann et al 2007 worm et al 2005 therefore the tp independent variable and a info dependent variable were carried out to find out a suitable model for this field finally the sem was verified to be the best appropriate mode in this field not finished yet the hot regions and their hotspots are also issues that ecologists want to know because they can resolve the two important questions in this field which places have been carried out the research and what research has been studied in these places the geospatial analysis can answer these questions scott and janikas 2010 thus 53 countries territories were confirmed and they were very attractive to the scientist fig 4a what s more brazil australia the usa china and kenya were the five countries that have been identified as the hottest spot region on a global scale in addition to affirm these achievements some problems are unavoidable the global pattern of serious differences uneven regional development and other issues still existed firstly there were still few research activities in the western and northeastern african regions secondly some countries in central america are still in a blank state finally some southeast asian countries are also in a blank stage it further illustrates that the development of this field was not comprehensive and uneven this may be one of the reasons for the small number of publications moreover the three major regional statistical information also certified that there was not comprehensive and uneven in this field fig s8 finally in addition to focusing on the hotspot of each major region fig 5 the problems implied in their back are more worthy of our exploration the specific circumstances are as follows first of all in the region of the americas except for its three hotspots breeding ecology individual ecology and population ecology some other topics e g behavioral ecology biodiversity and ecological effects were ignored or lagged behind secondly in the africa west asia the breeding ecology and new research methods were ignored or lagged behind by ecologist finally the breeding ecology and feeding ecology were neglected or lagged behind by scientist in view of this each region should maintain its advantage theme while strengthening the development of backward themes conclusions the temporal and co word analysis of keywords provides clues for research tendencies and hotspots stable isotope is the most favorite method and grapsidae ocypodidae and portunidae were the three common species in these researches the population structure of mangrove crabs is the focus of most attention thus indicators that have a significant impact on population structure also become hot spots e g reproduction sex ratio and fecundity as the ecological engineer of the mangrove ecosystem the behavioral ecology e g burrowing and bioturbation and feeding ecology e g predation and herbivory were essential and developed into a new hot spot what s more their ecological effects on the sediments were also the main issues in this field mangrove ecosystems have been claimed as critical habitats for economic animals thus the function of the breeding sites of fishery resources e g mud crab scylla serrata has been a research topic for a long time different research hotspots were found among the americas africa east asia and east and south asia oceania in the americas the reproductive ecology and population ecology of mangrove crabs were the main study topics in the africa east asia region the behavioral ecology and population characteristics were the hotspots the ecological effect of crabs and the stable isotope were the main research hotspots in the east and south asia oceania region the research challenge should also be highlighted especially the uneven regional development and the overall development is not comprehensive most of the countries in the west and northeast of africa e g angola some central american countries e g guatemala and a few western and southeast asian countries e g cambodia were still outside this research field to reduce the imbalance of regional development they should face up to these issues in the americas region the behavioral ecology biodiversity and ecological effects were ignored or lagged behind in the africa west asia region less research about the breeding ecology and new research methods in the east and south asia oceania region the breeding ecology and feeding ecology were little known therefore in future research except for strengthening research on the blank regions scientists should also pay more attention to the regional balance of research topics for the blank regions international cooperation was strongly recommended and scientists should orderly carry out these studies e g biodiversity population ecology and behavioral ecology for the theme of uneven development among regions in the americas region scientists should strengthen research the topics are population ecology behavioral ecology biodiversity and ecological effects in the africa west asia region the breeding ecology and new research methods etc should be given more attention in the east and south asia oceania region the breeding ecology and feeding ecology etc should be studied more declaration of competing interest the
