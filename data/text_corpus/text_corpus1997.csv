9985,desalinated sea water dsw is increasingly being used as an alternative source of irrigation in dry coastal areas owing to its high price and singular composition it is often blended with other water resources to curb costs although this is a common practice limited resources are available to manage the increased agro economic complexity required to balance several water sources with heterogeneous quality price and availability restrictions to support the management of fertigation with dsw in this study we present an open source decision support tool dst irriblend dsw the dst has been designed to identify potentially profitable fertigation options for different water and fertiliser availability scenarios to demonstrate the key features of the tool we applied it to two actual case study scenarios in south eastern spain where severe water scarcity led to massive seawater desalination for agricultural supply the information provided by the dst enabled the assessment of the viability of different water blending options and the selection of an optimal combination of water and fertilisers the simulation results showed that the fertigation costs of the studied crops hydroponic lettuce and greenhouse tomato substantially increased with the integration of dsw the dst output showed how water price rises and how additional types and amounts of fertilisers are required when more dsw is used however because the salinity of the blend is also reduced with the use of dsw the yield outcome improves and thus to some extent compensates for the increased cost in fact despite higher costs the studied crops were found to be very profitable when the optimised solutions computed by the dst were selected moreover the optimum fertigation solutions not only reduced costs but also decreased nutrient leaching in areas of severely polluted aquifers graphical abstract ga1 keywords desalination fertigation farming profitability agriculture resilience open source tools 1 introduction freshwater resources are scarce and cannot meet current or future demands of irrigated agriculture therefore non conventional resources are becoming indispensable in many parts of the world scheierling and tr√©guer 2018 in water stressed coastal regions seawater desalination can provide unlimited irrigation supply without being climate dependent thereby fostering long term food security and socio economic stability burn et al 2015 furthermore in water limited areas that have long resorted to marginal low quality waters bortolini et al 2018 the low salinity of desalinated seawater dsw allows reversing prior problematic trends of soil salinisation and groundwater contamination kaner et al 2017 raveh and ben gal 2018 overall dsw is an attractive solution to alleviate irrigation water shortages but its high price and potential increases in fertilisation costs may reduce farming profitability and hinder adoption the high energy consumption of seawater desalination makes dsw more expensive than other resources zarzo and prats 2018 moreover its singular chemical composition could cause agronomic risks such as phytotoxicity soil alkalinisation and an increase in fertilisation costs ben gal et al 2009 kim et al 2020 yermiyahu et al 2007 the increase in fertilisation costs is because dsw lacks certain essential nutrients for plant growth such as ca mg and s which are generally abundant in conventional irrigation waters in many arid regions and thus taken for granted by farmers ben gal et al 2009 in addition to the need for increased amounts of fertiliser the management of a higher variety of fertilisers could in some cases also require intensive upgrading of the irrigation system head martinez alvarez et al 2020 in order to reduce water and fertigation costs dsw can be used in combination with cheaper water sources with a higher mineral content ben gal et al 2009 martinez alvarez et al 2020 recent studies have demonstrated this aspect and presented new economically feasible irrigation management options based on dsw blended with locally available brackish water for greenhouse crops in spain reca et al 2018 maltese vineyards aparicio et al 2019 and several salt sensitive crops in israel s arava valley kaner et al 2017 the integration of dsw into irrigated agriculture is increasing however limited resources are available to assist with the management of multiple water sources with heterogeneous quality price and availability restrictions one of the first suitable resources in this direction was answerapp kaner et al 2017 which is an online application that combines a biological physical model for crop response to salinity with economic calculations this application indicates the potential profitability of irrigation of various crops as a function of water salinity but does not provide options for water blending and fertilisation optimisation to the best of our knowledge the first resource to specifically compute the optimal irrigation blend of dsw with other sources was the garum software reca et al 2018 this is a useful decision support tool dst which helps farmers optimise the water mixture and usage when different sources of nonuniform quality water are available for the irrigation of greenhouse crops in semiarid regions the main drawback of this method is that fertilisation is included in fixed costs and not as part of the optimisation algorithm several fertigation simulators and applications can be found in the literature for managing the application of fertilisers in soil and soilless crops barradas et al 2012 perez castro et al 2017 however few of these resources offer the possibility of calculating the optimal combination of fertilisers to meet the nutritional needs at a minimum cost bueno delgado et al 2016 and none have integrated the combined management of dsw with other sources martinez alvarez et al 2020 building on previous knowledge from garum developers the main aim of the dst presented herein irriblend dsw is to help users form more effective decisions to maximise profits in crop production with a mix of conventional waters e g surface underground and brackish and dsw a remarkable novelty of our dst is that apart from computing the optimum most profitable water blend it provides the optimal selection and amount of commercial fertiliser required for that water combination given that the irrigation water is already a nutrient carrier the benefits of this approach are two fold it optimises the fertilisation cost and prevents over fertilisation and leaching of nutrients another notable aspect of our dst is that it follows the current practice for the effective design and delivery of dsts to improve the otherwise low uptake by potential users gallardo et al 2020 rose et al 2016 thus our tool is free open source and easily accessible on the cloud from a web browser and does not require software installation it is ready to be used by end users with visual and interactive input and output files in common formats in addition the code is open and accessible in a free repository hosting service for researchers and advanced users and is prepared for further development the main objectives of this study are i to describe the main features and structure of irriblend dsw and ii to demonstrate its use with two case studies of high return hydroponic crops in south eastern se spain and discuss its practicality for fertigation management in water limited areas in the following sections we first provide an overview and description of the modules of the dst and present the case studies then we analyse and discuss the results of the two case studies and finally conclude the article and indicate the strengths and weaknesses of the presented tool as well as its future work prospects 2 materials and methods 2 1 irriblend dsw overview irriblend dsw is a dst designed to optimise soilless crop fertigation profitability when irrigated with a mix of dsw and conventional water the tool computes the optimal blend of dsw with the available conventional water and selects the best combination of commercial fertilisers considering the composition of the water blend therefore the following information is required by the dst the available water sources quality price quantity restrictions available commercial fertilisers composition and price nutritional needs and salinity threshold of the crop and indicators of potential profit under optimal conditions without water stress salinity damage or phytosanitary issues the tool uses this information to calculate the most profitable water blend and the required amount of each selected fertiliser the potential profitability for each possible water blend and the amount of each commercial fertiliser used to optimise costs are also provided and compared with the optimum 2 2 programme structure and modules the dst is coded in python 3 and uses freely available scientific libraries the programme was implemented in google colaboratory gc which is an excellent environment for collaborative research gc is a free jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely on the cloud and requires no installation it serves as an interactive code interface a data visualisation tool and a markdown editor which can be used by research collaborators as well as end users the dst code and the user guide are freely available at github along with the input and output data of the two examples corresponding to the case studies presented in this article please see research data statement the user guide explains how irriblend dsw can be easily implemented from a web browser without any setup or installation the only requirement is to have a free google account to enable access to the gc the input and output files are all stored in the google drive gdrive of the user account due to the possible hurdles of data requirements and formats all the inputs required to run this dst are stored in one spreadsheet users can use the sample input files provided to test the dst and as a template for their runs the dst is structured into four interconnected parts with specific functionalities as described in the following subsections fig 1 shows the outline and data flow of the dst 2 2 1 input data import this module reads and imports all the input data from one spreadsheet fig 1 running the dst requires the following specific information ideal solutions for crop fertigation the ideal solution must be provided in mmol l along with the electrical conductivity ec limit in ds m for the simulation the ec limit is the maximum electrical conductivity in the fertigation solution mix of water and fertilisers allowed by the user for simulation purposes this value should be substantially above the crop tolerance to allow the simulation of yield loss under salinity stress water sources composition price and availability the composition of each water source must be provided in mg l the ec in ds m the price in m3 and the availability as a percentage a value of 100 means that there are no restrictions on the availability of that water source the programme can run simulations using two or three water sources commercial fertilisers composition and price the composition of each available commercial fertiliser must be provided in mmol g density in g cm3 and price in kg the programme can handle up to 30 fertilisers crop info productivity and profitability indicators the following indicators are to be provided assuming a crop without limitations of water and nutrients and free of climate and phytosanitary stress o water productivity kg yield m3 water used for fertigation o land productivity kg yield m2 of crop surface o crop market price kg o crop salinity threshold a ds m above which there is yield loss and salinity yield reduction factor b these parameters a and b are based on the formula of fao 61 fao 2002 in which yield is reduced linearly over the crop salinity threshold relative yield 100 b ecr a where ecr is the ec in the root zone in the soilless culture in ds m 2 2 2 water blend generator the water blend generator simulates all possible water blends from two or three water sources in 5 steps considering the availability restrictions given by the user for example if there are three water sources wa wb and wc with availabilities of 100 100 and 20 then a possible water blend could be wa 35 wb 50 and wc 15 the sum of wa wb and wc is always 100 and in this example wc is either less than or equal to 20 the blend is a linear average of the composition and conductivity in which each water source is given the corresponding percentage weight the fertigation optimisation algorithm 2 2 3 determines for each water blend generated whether nutritional needs can be fulfilled using the irrigation water given the specified restrictions and constraints 2 2 3 fertigation optimisation given the chemical composition of the water blend and the ideal fertigation solution the programme calculates the nutrients that must be added to the already nutrient loaded irrigation water to satisfy the uptake for the crop thereafter the type and quantity of commercial fertilisers from the database that can provide the nutrients needed at the minimum cost were calculated for this purpose the optimisation algorithm runs the optimisation function of the python scipy library for constrained minimisation with the sequential least squares programming slsqp to minimise the cost function under the assumption of the following set of constraints ec ec limit exact nutritional needs amounts of no3 nh4 h2po4 k and hco3 amounts of ca 2 mg 2 so4 2 cl and na equal to or above needs 2 2 4 visualisation and output the last module visualises and stores the results five sections of results are presented in the output file feasible water combinations all the water combinations having a solution i e those that provide the target fertigation solution with the given set of commercial fertilisers under the user s restrictions are stored for these combinations the ec ds m and price m3 are provided optimum combination of commercial fertilisers for each feasible water combination the optimum cheapest combination of commercial fertilisers is provided the amount of each fertiliser is given in g l fertigation solution the fertigation solution ions in mmol l for each feasible water combination is provided along with the final ec ds m in the solution and the price m3 productivity and profitability indicators for each water combination the profit potential indicator ha water productivity kg yield m3 and production cost kg yield are given the profit potential indicator ppi is the yield benefit production kg market price kg minus the fertigation cost cost of water plus fertiliser optimum water blend this indicates the water blend that provides the maximum ppi 2 3 case studies both case studies to demonstrate the features of irriblend dsw correspond to high return hydroponic crops in water limited areas of se spain specifically case 1 is set in the segura river basin srb and case 2 is set in the eastern part of the andalusian mediterranean basins amb where irrigated agriculture is concentrated fig 2 substantial seawater desalination for agricultural supply has been implemented in these areas due to the exacerbated water shortage that threatens their strategic highly profitable agricultural production the water deficit directly impacting irrigated agriculture is over 400 mm3 year in the srb chs 2015 and over 160 mm3 year in amb cmaot 2015 this deficit is partly alleviated by dsw agricultural supply which amounts to 126 mm3 in the srb and to 34 mm3 in the amb fig 2 acuamed 2019 martinez alvarez et al 2019 we describe each case and the data used to evaluate the dst in detail in the subsequent sections 2 3 1 case 1 soilless lettuce in the srb a lettuce crop in the campo de cartagena irrigation district fig 2 was selected for the case study because it is the principal winter vegetable crop grown in the srb more than 500 000 t of lettuce was exported in 2019 generating a revenue of 475 million fepex 2020 in particular we present a case of the lettuce variety little gem grown with the hydroponic nutrient film technique nft in which the nutrient solution flows through channels where plants have their bare root systems the nft system has been reported to provide higher yields and water productivity and is more eco friendly than the traditional soil cultivation maestre valero et al 2018 tables 1 4 show the input data used to run the dst for each section indicated in epigraph 2 2 1 respectively i nutrient solution for fertigation ii water sources iii commercial fertilisers and iv productivity and profitability indicators the input data used in this case study were obtained mainly from a recent study conducted by our research team in which a comprehensive inventory was built with data from two commercial farms using nft systems to grow lettuce in the srb maestre valero et al 2018 martinez mate et al 2018 the traditional water supply in the area is surface water from the segura basin or the tagus segura external water transfer this conventional fresh water supply is of high quality ec 1 ds m with approximately 100 mg l of ca and 40 mg l of mg and has a low cost 0 16 m3 however its availability for agriculture has drastically decreased over the last decade pellicer martinez and miguel martinez paz 2018 this is the main reason for the increased use of dsw which is often mixed with low quality underground water to reduce costs in our simulations we used three water sources table 2 water transferred by the tagus segura aqueduct dsw from the escombreras desalination plant fig 2 and brackish underground water aqualogy 2016 it should be noted that the quality and price of the dsw from the escombreras plant is similar to the rest of the desalination plants in the area shown in fig 2 martinez alvarez et al 2020 in accordance with the current availability situation supply restrictions were imposed only for the tagus segura water with a limitation of 30 in the blend 2 3 2 case 2 greenhouse tomato in almeria in the eastern part of the amb there are more than 32 000 ha of horticultural greenhouses which generate over 3 5 m t vegetables and 2 b each year cajamar 2019 the greenhouse gh tomato is the most important vegetable representing 20 of the total gh area in the region half of the production is exported mainly to european markets cajamar 2019 there are different varieties of gh tomato grown in soil and soilless cultures and with short and long production cycles our case study corresponds to hydroponic tomato cultivar ramyle variety with a long post harvest life which can be grown in autumn or spring short 5 months cycles in the study area the case study was conducted in the campo de n√≠jar gh district fig 2 where there is currently no surface water available for irrigation the continuous over withdrawal of irrigation water from the aquifer resulted in a severe drop in the groundwater level furthermore excessive return flows from irrigation have led to severe aquifer salinisation and pollution sanchez et al 2015a the high salinity of the irrigation water has led to notably reduced crop yields and has limited crop production in the area to only the most salt tolerant crops such as tomato and watermelon sanchez et al 2015b the aquifer was the only source available until the carboneras desalination plant started supplying water for irrigation in this district in 2005 however the usage of dsw has been lower than expected mainly because of farmers concerns about its high price and the need for additional fertilisation aznar sanchez et al 2017 our case study represents the current situation in which farmers have access to two independent water distribution networks one supplying low quality underground water underground n√≠jar in table 2 at a low rate 0 18 m3 and dsw from the carboneras plant at a higher rate 0 6 m3 the farmers must then make proper water usage and mixing decisions to obtain the desired water quality tables 1 4 show the input data used to run the dst these data were obtained from recent studies conducted in the study area in which the ideal nutrient solution for soilless gh cultivar ramyle tomato was defined rodriguez et al 2014 the water sources were characterised reca et al 2018 valera et al 2017 productivity and profitability indicators of the crop were assessed rodriguez et al 2014 sanchez et al 2015a and the salinity threshold and yield loss were observed magan et al 2008 3 results table 5 presents the main data outputs of the optimum water blend computed by dst for both case studies 3 1 case 1 considering the crop needs the fertiliser and water types available and the restrictions imposed the dst calculated that the optimum water blend consisted of 30 fresh water tagus segura 55 of dsw and 15 brackish underground water fig 3 this water blend had an ec of 1 41 ds m and the cost per m3 was 0 38 the optimal cheapest combination of fertilisers and final closest to user input considering the imposed restraints fertigation solution are shown in table 5 the ec of the computed fertigation solution 2 9 ds m was just below the salinity threshold of the crop 3 ds m and therefore the water and land productivity potential is reached the cost of the fertigation solution water fertiliser was 1 36 m3 which implies a fertigation production cost of 0 037 kg the optimal solution found by the dst leaves a ppi of 120 9 103 ha year corresponding to nine crop cycles which shows that this crop can be very profitable 17 7 103 ha year with good management of water resources and fertilisers in this simulation output file case1 appendix a out of 93 water combinations in 5 steps for each water source there were 87 feasible solutions i e the fertigation optimisation algorithm found a solution under the set of constraints for the given available water and fertilisers only 42 surpassed the profitability threshold which is the sum of investment and operational costs excluding the cost of water and fertilisers 103 2 103 ha year maestre valero et al 2018 looking at the fertiliser selection for each water blend only phosphoric and nitric acids potassium and ammonium nitrates and potassium sulphate are required for blends containing up to 40 dsw however the simulation shows that apart from these fertilisers calcium nitrate is required for blends with more than 40 of dsw to compensate for the lack of ca in the dsw and magnesium nitrate is also needed when the proportion of dsw exceeds 70 3 2 case 2 for the given input data crop needs fertiliser and water types and restrictions the dst calculated the optimum water blend to be 65 of dsw and 35 of brackish underground water fig 4 this water blend had an ec of 1 98 ds m and the cost per m3 was 0 45 the economically optimal combination of fertilisers and final fertigation solution are shown in table 5 the ec of the computed fertigation solution 3 09 ds m was just below the salinity threshold of the crop 3 2 ds m and therefore the water and land productivity potential can be reached as in case study 1 in this case the use of 35 of low cost brackish water substantially reduces the costs by 0 15 m3 compared with that by using only dsw without simulated yield losses the final cost of the fertigation solution water fertiliser was 1 26 m3 which implies a fertigation production cost of 0 065 kg the optimal solution proposed by the dst has a ppi of 33 7 103 ha cycle which after discounting the rest of the costs leaves a reasonably good net profit of 6 4 103 ha cycle the simulation output output file case2 appendix a shows 10 feasible solutions all of them surpassed the profitability threshold investment plus operational costs excluding the cost of water and fertilisers 27 3 103 ha but a sharp decrease in ppi was observed with percentual increases in brackish water fig 4 the fertilisers required in the blend of up to 50 of dsw were mainly nitric and phosphoric acids and potassium and ammonium nitrates however if dsw dominates potassium sulphate is required and the amount of calcium nitrate increases linearly with the percentage of dsw in the blend 4 discussion the results of the irriblend dsw simulations offered valuable information for the fertigation management of the demonstrative case studies presented in which dsw and conventional waters with different quality price and availability are used once the requirements and available resources for the production systems were characterised the dst could identify which combinations of water and fertiliser could be viable from a technical and economic perspective both case studies involve intensive production systems with great land and water productivity table 4 but with substantial investment and operational costs much higher than traditional systems the dst provides the value of ppi money left when subtracting the cost of fertigation from the crop revenue for all technically feasible combinations but only those with a ppi above the profitability threshold investment plus operational costs excluding the cost of water and fertilisers would be economically feasible for the nft lettuce case the dst showed that only half of the technically viable options were likely to be profitable whereas for the gh tomato all the solutions were above the profitability threshold however the real contribution of the dst is not merely filtering out unfeasible options from an economic perspective but also to offer information on how to optimise the use of available resources and maximise profits navigating the interactive plots figs 3 and 4 supplementary videos 1 and 2 it can be seen that in both cases increasing the amount of low quality water brackish over the optimum percentage drastically reduces the ppi in fact the ec of the optimal solutions was close to the crop salinity threshold since maximal addition of cheaper brackish water substantially reduces costs without simulated yield loss in the nft lettuce case this limit was 35 of brackish water in the blend as percentages over it rendered the crop non profitable this implies that because the availability of conventional fresh water is becoming very scarce without the supply of dsw production would not be viable in the case of gh tomato although all solutions surpassed the profitability threshold the dst showed that adding more than 65 of brackish water in the blend causes the ec to increase above the salinity threshold which can result in a decrease in net profit over 2 103 ha cycle it is important to note here that for the calculations we used the mean gh tomato market price 0 54 kg in the 2017 18 season for a crop market price below 0 45 kg as in the 2015 16 season we would have found combinations with the ppi below the profitability threshold among the technically viable ones as in the case of nft lettuce supplementary material related to this article can be found online at doi 10 1016 j agwat 2021 107012 the following is the supplementary material related to this article video 1 and video 2 video 1 interactive plot showing the decrease in the profit potential indicator ppi as the percentage of brackish water increases for case study 1 video 2 interactive plot showing the impact on the profit potential indicator ppi of increasing the percentage of dsw to 90 for case study 1 information about fertiliser selection and cost for each water blend derived from these simulations was relevant for fertigation management in both cases the data showed that the amount and type of fertiliser required increased as the percentage of dsw increased in the water blend however this cost increase is lower than that owing to the dsw cost the increase in fertiliser cost was approximately 0 06 m3 for both the nft lettuce and the gh tomato when moving from 35 to 85 of dsw in the water blend whereas the increase in water cost was over 0 22 m3 in the said percentage range therefore notwithstanding that fertilisation programmes and even systems require adaptation to dsw the fertiliser cost overrun derived from the integration of dsw did not seem to pose a major threat to profitability however it is important to bear in mind that even if minimising the fertiliser input had a less relevant impact on costs it is key to preventing leaching nutrients and preserving the over polluted aquifers in the region 5 conclusion we have presented irriblend dsw a user friendly freely available dst designed to guide water managers make correct decisions to maximise profits in soilless crop fertigation when blending conventional waters with dsw additionally we have demonstrated its use with two case studies of hydroponic crops in se spain in which the dst showed fluctuations in fertigation costs for different water combinations and identified which of these are potentially profitable our results demonstrate that the intensive horticultural crops analysed in this study can be very profitable despite the increase in fertigation costs caused by the integration of dsw provided there is adequate management of water resources and fertilisers the plots displayed by the dst allow us to see at a glance the economic impact of the different water blending options thereby enabling selection of the optimal blend the increase in cost was mainly due to the high cost of dsw and marginally due to additional fertilisers needed to compensate for the lack of certain nutrients in dsw in both cases we observed evidence of significant economic benefit of mixing dsw with moderate amounts of low cost brackish water the latter should only be done up to the crop ec threshold as beyond that limit the yield loss cannot be compensated by the decrease in cost due to the use of cheaper water the current version of the dst is open source coded in python a language widely used for scientific research implemented in gc and shared in github to enhance collaborative research the programme has a modular structure ready for upgrades and further development one key aspect to be improved in future versions is the modelling of the salinity impact on yield with new modules that could link the dst with biological physical models similar to answerapp another current limitation of the dst is that it is only implemented for soilless fertigation one of the priorities for future versions of this tool is to enable simulations with traditional crops in soil moreover we have not addressed the potential phytotoxicity issues from the use of dsw and underground brackish water in this study this could also be implemented to improve the tool overall we envision future versions of irriblend dsw which in connection with crop models and other

water resources to curb costs although this is a common practice limited resources are available to manage the increased agro economic complexity required to balance several water sources with

presented tool as well as its future work prospects 2 materials and methods 2 1 irriblend dsw overview irriblend dsw is a dst designed to optimise soilless crop fertigation profitability when irrigated with a mix of dsw and conventional water the tool computes the optimal blend of dsw with the available conventional water and selects the best combination of commercial fertilisers considering the composition of the water blend therefore the following information is required by the dst the available water sources quality price quantity restrictions available commercial fertilisers composition and price nutritional needs and salinity threshold of the crop and indicators of potential profit under optimal conditions without water stress salinity damage or phytosanitary issues the tool uses this information to calculate the most profitable water blend and the required amount of each selected fertiliser the potential profitability for each possible water blend and the amount of each commercial fertiliser used to optimise costs are also provided and compared with the optimum 2 2 programme structure and modules the dst is coded in python 3 and uses freely available scientific libraries the programme was implemented in google colaboratory gc which is an excellent environment for collaborative research gc is a free jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely on the cloud and requires no installation it serves as an interactive code interface a data visualisation tool and a markdown editor which can be used by research collaborators as well as end users the dst code and the user guide are freely available at github along with the input and output data of the two examples corresponding to the case studies presented in this article please see research data statement the user guide explains how irriblend dsw can be easily implemented from a web browser without any setup or installation the only requirement is to have a free google account to enable access to the gc the input and output files are all stored in the google drive gdrive of the user account due to the possible hurdles of data requirements and formats all the inputs required to run this dst are stored in one spreadsheet users can use the sample input files provided to test the dst and as a template for their runs the dst is structured into four interconnected parts with specific functionalities as described in the following subsections fig 1 shows the outline and data flow of the dst 2 2 1 input data import this module reads and imports all the input data from one spreadsheet fig 1 running the dst requires the following specific information ideal solutions for crop fertigation the ideal solution must be provided in mmol l along with the electrical conductivity ec limit in ds m for the simulation the ec limit is the maximum electrical conductivity in the fertigation solution mix of water and fertilisers allowed by the user for simulation purposes this value should be substantially above the crop tolerance to allow the simulation of yield loss under salinity stress water sources composition price and availability the composition of each water source must be provided in mg l the ec in ds m the price in m3 and the availability as a percentage a value of 100 means that there are no restrictions on the availability of that water source the programme can run simulations using two or three water sources commercial fertilisers composition and price the composition of each available commercial fertiliser must be provided in mmol g density in g cm3 and price in kg the programme can handle up to 30 fertilisers crop info productivity and profitability indicators the following indicators are to be provided assuming a crop without limitations of water and nutrients and free of climate and phytosanitary stress o water productivity kg yield m3 water used for fertigation o land productivity kg yield m2 of crop surface o crop market price kg o crop salinity threshold a ds m above which there is yield loss and salinity yield reduction factor b these parameters a and b are based on the formula of fao 61 fao 2002 in which yield is reduced linearly over the crop salinity threshold relative yield 100 b ecr a where ecr is the ec in the root zone in the soilless culture in ds m 2 2 2 water blend generator the water blend generator simulates all possible water blends from two or three water sources in 5 steps considering the availability restrictions given by the user for example if there are three water sources wa wb and wc with availabilities of 100 100 and 20 then a possible water blend could be wa 35 wb 50 and wc 15 the sum of wa wb and wc is always 100 and in this example wc is either less than or equal to 20 the blend is a linear average of the composition and conductivity in which each water source is given the corresponding percentage weight the fertigation optimisation algorithm 2 2 3 determines for each water blend generated whether nutritional needs can be fulfilled using the irrigation water given the specified restrictions and constraints 2 2 3 fertigation optimisation given the chemical composition of the water blend and the ideal fertigation solution the programme calculates the nutrients that must be added to the already nutrient loaded irrigation water to satisfy the uptake for the crop thereafter the type and quantity of commercial fertilisers from the database that can provide the nutrients needed at the minimum cost were calculated for this purpose the optimisation algorithm runs the optimisation function of the python scipy library for constrained minimisation with the sequential least squares programming slsqp to minimise the cost function under the assumption of the following set of constraints ec ec limit exact nutritional needs amounts of no3 nh4 h2po4 k and hco3 amounts of ca 2 mg 2 so4 2 cl and na equal to or above needs 2 2 4 visualisation and output the last module visualises and stores the results five sections of results are presented in the output file feasible water combinations all the water combinations having a solution i e those that provide the target fertigation solution with the given set of commercial fertilisers under the user s restrictions are stored for these combinations the ec ds m and price m3 are provided optimum combination of commercial fertilisers for each feasible water combination the optimum cheapest combination of commercial fertilisers is provided the amount of each fertiliser is given in g l fertigation solution the fertigation solution ions in mmol l for each feasible water combination is provided along with the final ec ds m in the solution and the price m3 productivity and profitability indicators for each water combination the profit potential indicator ha water productivity kg yield m3 and production cost kg yield are given the profit potential indicator ppi is the yield benefit production kg market price kg minus the fertigation cost cost of water plus fertiliser optimum water blend this indicates the water blend that provides the maximum ppi 2 3 case studies both case studies to demonstrate the features of irriblend dsw correspond to high return hydroponic crops in water limited areas of se spain specifically case 1 is set in the segura river basin srb and case 2 is set in the eastern part of the andalusian mediterranean basins amb where irrigated agriculture is concentrated fig 2 substantial seawater desalination for agricultural supply has been implemented in these areas due to the exacerbated water shortage that threatens their strategic highly profitable agricultural production the water deficit directly impacting irrigated agriculture is over 400 mm3 year in the srb chs 2015 and over 160 mm3 year in amb cmaot 2015 this deficit is partly alleviated by dsw agricultural supply which amounts to 126 mm3 in the srb and to 34 mm3 in the amb fig 2 acuamed 2019 martinez alvarez et al 2019 we describe each case and the data used to evaluate the dst in detail in the subsequent sections 2 3 1 case 1 soilless lettuce in the srb a lettuce crop in the campo de cartagena irrigation district fig 2 was selected for the case study because it is the principal winter vegetable crop grown in the srb more than 500 000 t of lettuce was exported in 2019 generating a revenue of 475 million fepex 2020 in particular we present a case of the lettuce variety little gem grown with the hydroponic nutrient film technique nft in which the nutrient solution flows through channels where plants have their bare root systems the nft system has been reported to provide higher yields and water productivity and is more eco friendly than the traditional soil cultivation maestre valero et al 2018 tables 1 4 show the input data used to run the dst for each section indicated in epigraph 2 2 1 respectively i nutrient solution for fertigation ii water sources iii commercial fertilisers and iv productivity and profitability indicators the input data used in this case study were obtained mainly from a recent study conducted by our research team in which a comprehensive inventory was built with data from two commercial farms using nft systems to grow lettuce in the srb maestre valero et al 2018 martinez mate et al 2018 the traditional water supply in the area is surface water from the segura basin or the tagus segura external water transfer this conventional fresh water supply is of high quality ec 1 ds m with approximately 100 mg l of ca and 40 mg l of mg and has a low cost 0 16 m3 however its availability for agriculture has drastically decreased over the last decade pellicer martinez and miguel martinez paz 2018 this is the main reason for the increased use of dsw which is often mixed with low quality underground water to reduce costs in our simulations we used three water sources table 2 water transferred by the tagus segura aqueduct dsw from the escombreras desalination plant fig 2 and brackish underground water aqualogy 2016 it should be noted that the quality and price of the dsw from the escombreras plant is similar to the rest of the desalination plants in the area shown in fig 2 martinez alvarez et al 2020 in accordance with the current availability situation supply restrictions were imposed only for the tagus segura water with a limitation of 30 in the blend 2 3 2 case 2 greenhouse tomato in almeria in the eastern part of the amb there are more than 32 000 ha of horticultural greenhouses which generate over 3 5 m t vegetables and 2 b each year cajamar 2019 the greenhouse gh tomato is the most important vegetable representing 20 of the total gh area in the region half of the production is exported mainly to european markets cajamar 2019 there are different varieties of gh tomato grown in soil and soilless cultures and with short and long production cycles our case study corresponds to hydroponic tomato cultivar ramyle variety with a long post harvest life which can be grown in autumn or spring short 5 months cycles in the study area the case study was conducted in the campo de n√≠jar gh district fig 2 where there is currently no surface water available for irrigation the continuous over withdrawal of irrigation water from the aquifer resulted in a severe drop in the groundwater level furthermore excessive return flows from irrigation have led to severe aquifer salinisation and pollution sanchez et al 2015a the high salinity of the irrigation water has led to notably reduced crop yields and has limited crop production in the area to only the most salt tolerant crops such as tomato and watermelon sanchez et al 2015b the aquifer was the only source available until the carboneras desalination plant started supplying water for irrigation in this district in 2005 however the usage of dsw has been lower than expected mainly because of farmers concerns about its high price and the need for additional fertilisation aznar sanchez et al 2017 our case study represents the current situation in which farmers have access to two independent water distribution networks one supplying low quality underground water underground n√≠jar in table 2 at a low rate 0 18 m3 and dsw from the carboneras plant at a higher rate 0 6 m3 the farmers must then make proper water usage and mixing decisions to obtain the desired water quality tables 1 4 show the input data used to run the dst these data were obtained from recent studies conducted in the study area in which the ideal nutrient solution for soilless gh cultivar ramyle tomato was defined rodriguez et al 2014 the water sources were characterised reca et al 2018 valera et al 2017 productivity and profitability indicators of the crop were assessed rodriguez et al 2014 sanchez et al 2015a and the salinity threshold and yield loss were observed magan et al 2008 3 results table 5 presents the main data outputs of the optimum water blend computed by dst for both case studies 3 1 case 1 considering the crop needs the fertiliser and water types available and the restrictions imposed the dst calculated that the optimum water blend consisted of 30 fresh water tagus segura 55 of dsw and 15 brackish underground water fig 3 this water blend had an ec of 1 41 ds m and the cost per m3 was 0 38 the optimal cheapest combination of fertilisers and final closest to user input considering the imposed restraints fertigation solution are shown in table 5 the ec of the computed fertigation solution 2 9 ds m was just below the salinity threshold of the crop 3 ds m and therefore the water and land productivity potential is reached the cost of the fertigation solution water fertiliser was 1 36 m3 which implies a fertigation production cost of 0 037 kg the optimal solution found by the dst leaves a ppi of 120 9 103 ha year corresponding to nine crop cycles which shows that this crop can be very profitable 17 7 103 ha year with good management of water resources and fertilisers in this simulation output file case1 appendix a out of 93 water combinations in 5 steps for each water source there were 87 feasible solutions i e the fertigation optimisation algorithm found a solution under the set of constraints for the given available water and fertilisers only 42 surpassed the profitability threshold which is the sum of investment and operational costs excluding the cost of water and fertilisers 103 2 103 ha year maestre valero et al 2018 looking at the fertiliser selection for each water blend only phosphoric and nitric acids potassium and ammonium nitrates and potassium sulphate are required for blends containing up to 40 dsw however the simulation shows that apart from these fertilisers calcium nitrate is required for blends with more than 40 of dsw to compensate for the lack of ca in the dsw and magnesium nitrate is also needed when the proportion of dsw exceeds 70 3 2 case 2 for the given input data crop needs fertiliser and water types and restrictions the dst calculated the optimum water blend to be 65 of dsw and 35 of brackish underground water fig 4 this water blend had an ec of 1 98 ds m and the cost per m3 was 0 45 the economically optimal combination of fertilisers and final fertigation solution are shown in table 5 the ec of the computed fertigation solution 3 09 ds m was just below the salinity threshold of the crop 3 2 ds m and therefore the water and land productivity potential can be reached as in case study 1 in this case the use of 35 of low cost brackish water substantially reduces the costs by 0 15 m3 compared with that by using only dsw without simulated yield losses the final cost of the fertigation solution water fertiliser was 1 26 m3 which implies a fertigation production cost of 0 065 kg the optimal solution proposed by the dst has a ppi of 33 7 103 ha cycle which after discounting the rest of the costs leaves a reasonably good net profit of 6 4 103 ha cycle the simulation output output file case2 appendix a shows 10 feasible solutions all of them surpassed the profitability threshold investment plus operational costs excluding the cost of water and fertilisers 27 3 103 ha but a sharp decrease in ppi was observed with percentual increases in brackish water fig 4 the fertilisers required in the blend of up to 50 of dsw were mainly nitric and phosphoric acids and potassium and ammonium nitrates however if dsw dominates potassium sulphate is required and the amount of calcium nitrate increases linearly with the percentage of dsw in the blend 4 discussion the results of the irriblend dsw simulations offered valuable information for the fertigation management of the demonstrative case studies presented in which dsw and conventional waters with different quality price and availability are used once the requirements and available resources for the production systems were characterised the dst could identify which combinations of water and fertiliser could be viable from a technical and economic perspective both case studies involve intensive production systems with great land and water productivity table 4 but with substantial investment and operational costs much higher than traditional systems the dst provides the value of ppi money left when subtracting the cost of fertigation from the crop revenue for all technically feasible combinations but only those with a ppi above the profitability threshold investment plus operational costs excluding the cost of water and fertilisers would be economically feasible for the nft lettuce case the dst showed that only half of the technically viable options were likely to be profitable whereas for the gh tomato all the solutions were above the profitability threshold however the real contribution of the dst is not merely filtering out unfeasible options from an economic perspective but also to offer information on how to optimise the use of available resources and maximise profits navigating the interactive plots figs 3 and 4 supplementary videos 1 and 2 it can be seen that in both cases increasing the amount of low quality water brackish over the optimum percentage drastically reduces the ppi in fact the ec of the optimal solutions was close to the crop salinity threshold since maximal addition of cheaper brackish water substantially reduces costs without simulated yield loss in the nft lettuce case this limit was 35 of brackish water in the blend as percentages over it rendered the crop non profitable this implies that because the availability of conventional fresh water is becoming very scarce without the supply of dsw production would not be viable in the case of gh tomato although all solutions surpassed the profitability threshold the dst showed that adding more than 65 of brackish water in the blend causes the ec to increase above the salinity threshold which can result in a decrease in net profit over 2 103 ha cycle it is important to note here that for the calculations we used the mean gh tomato market price 0 54 kg in the 2017 18 season for a crop market price below 0 45 kg as in the 2015 16 season we would have found combinations with the ppi below the profitability threshold among the technically viable ones as in the case of nft lettuce supplementary material related to this article can be found online at doi 10 1016 j agwat 2021 107012 the following is the supplementary material related to this article video 1 and video 2 video 1 interactive plot showing the decrease in the profit potential indicator ppi as the percentage of brackish water increases for case study 1 video 2 interactive plot showing the impact on the profit potential indicator ppi of increasing the percentage of dsw to 90 for case study 1 information about fertiliser selection and cost for each water blend derived from these simulations was relevant for fertigation management in both cases the data showed that the amount and type of fertiliser required increased as the percentage of dsw increased in the water blend however this cost increase is lower than that owing to the dsw cost the increase in fertiliser cost was approximately 0 06 m3 for both the nft lettuce and the gh tomato when moving from 35 to 85 of dsw in the water blend whereas the increase in water cost was over 0 22 m3 in the said percentage range therefore notwithstanding that fertilisation programmes and even systems require adaptation to dsw the fertiliser cost overrun derived from the integration of dsw did not seem to pose a major threat to profitability however it is important to bear in mind that even if minimising the fertiliser input had a less relevant impact on costs it is key to preventing leaching nutrients and preserving the over polluted aquifers in the region 5 conclusion we have presented irriblend dsw a user friendly freely available dst designed to guide water managers make correct decisions to maximise profits in soilless crop fertigation when blending conventional waters with dsw additionally we have demonstrated its use with two case studies of hydroponic crops in se spain in which the dst showed fluctuations in fertigation costs for different water combinations and identified which of these are potentially profitable our results demonstrate that the intensive horticultural crops analysed in this study can be very profitable despite the increase in fertigation costs caused by the integration of dsw provided there is adequate management of water resources and fertilisers the plots displayed by the dst allow us to see at a glance the economic impact of the different water blending options thereby enabling selection of the optimal blend the increase in cost was mainly due to the high cost of dsw and marginally due to additional fertilisers needed to compensate for the lack of certain nutrients in dsw in both cases we observed evidence of significant economic benefit of mixing dsw with moderate amounts of low cost brackish water the latter should only be done up to the crop ec threshold as beyond that limit the yield loss cannot be compensated by the decrease in cost due to the use of cheaper water the current version of the dst is open source coded in python a language widely used for scientific research implemented in gc and shared in github to enhance collaborative research the programme has a modular structure ready for upgrades and further development one key aspect to be improved in future versions is the modelling of the salinity impact on yield with new modules that could link the dst with biological physical models similar to answerapp another current limitation of the dst is that it is only implemented for soilless fertigation one of the priorities for future versions of this tool is to enable simulations with traditional crops in soil moreover we have not addressed the potential phytotoxicity issues from the use of dsw and underground brackish water in this study this could also be implemented to improve the tool overall we envision future versions of irriblend dsw which in connection with crop models and other

and increase farmers incomes on the tibetan plateau therefore it has been widely grown in this region in the past decades the aims of this study were to clarify the patterns of water sources and water use efficiency under 3 management practices to determine the optimal cultivation strategies a 2 year field experiment was undertaken in a chinese wolfberry plantation with 3 management practices including the conventional flat planting plus surface drip irrigation ck flat planting with full film mulching plus surface drip irrigation mf and ridge furrow full film mulching plus surface drip irrigation mr the soil moisture in shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers were regarded as the trees potential water sources the isosource model and two bayesian mixing models of mixsir and mixsiar were employed to calculate the contribution of different water sources to xylem water the mixsir model exhibited relatively better performance in quantifying water source contribution for different layers compared with the isosource and mixsiar models management practices significantly altered water use patterns of the wolfberry during the growing periods under ck the wolfberry preferentially extracted moisture from the middle and deep layers even during rainfall and irrigation under mf and mr they switched more flexibly their water source between the three layers and they used more water from shallow and middle layers when soil moisture availability increased there which was especially true under mr compared with ck the average yield of mr and wue were found to increase by 21 5 and 17 respectively over the 2 years period this indicated that film mulching and ridge furrow altered the water use strategy of chinese wolfberry and wue which can inform the designing of the best management regimes the response to tree water use in terms of soil nutrients and subsurface irrigation should be investigated to optimize field management practices including irrigation schedules and modes keywords chinese wolfberry water use strategy stable isotope bayesian mixing model water use efficiency 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp often called the third pole plays a major role in safeguarding the environmental security downstream in east china and south asia yao et al 2012 moreover the ecological environment on the qinghai tibet plateau is extremely sensitive to human activities however land uses on the tp have been extensively transformed by socio economic development and intensifying human activity especially overgrazing wang et al 2020a wu et al 2021 this has led to severe socio economic and ecological problems including increasing desertification grassland degradation and reduction in forest cover cao et al 2004 chen et al 2011 feng et al 2005 jin et al 2019 miehe et al 2019 in the past decades the chinese government has adopted several measures to recover and protect the degraded rangelands chen et al 2021 wu et al 2021 including enclosure closure against grazing and reducing livestock density wu et al 2021 however a consensus on the magnitude of efforts to be made in these measures is lacking although these measures are directly linked to the improvement of farmer s incomes developing high value added ecological agriculture may ameliorate the degradation by reducing overgrazing and improving livelihoods of the farmers and herders jin et al 2019 miehe et al 2008 zhou et al 2019 chinese wolfberry lycium barbarum l also called the goji berry hereafter wolfberry is a crop of high economic value that has been widely used to ameliorate wind erosion and improve soil structure the northern part of the tp provides suitable conditions for its cultivation abundant sunshine and large diurnal temperature variation and has become the second largest area after the ningxia hui autonomous region for its production in china lei et al 2020 however drought and water scarcity have strongly constrained development of wolfberry orchards on the tp deng et al 2017 xu et al 2019 therefore minimising water use and enhancing water productivity are essential mulching and drip irrigation are among the well known approaches mo et al 2017 liao et al 2019a 2019b 2021 fang et al 2021 the subsurface irrigation method has been applied in the arid and semi arid areas of china in recent years considering that it has near zero soil evaporation and optimum nutrient supply cai et al 2021 fu et al 2021 in this area the irrigation system should be upgraded from the surface drip irrigation method to the subsurface drip irrigation method therefore the water uptake patterns of wolfberries during the growth period should be elucidated to formulate an optimal water management system and the best buried depth for the subsurface drip irrigation analysis of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes provides a highly sensitive and accurate approach to study plants water use patterns and eco hydrological processes barbeta and penuelas 2017 dai et al 2015 dawson and ehleringer 1991 huo et al 2018 gao et al 2018a grossiord et al 2017 wang et al 2020b especially in the arid and semi arid areas wu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 gao et al 2018b yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the theoretical basis is that xylem water can be regarded as a mixture of water from all utilized sources so the proportional uses of specific sources can be estimated by comparing hydrogen or oxygen isotope signatures of xylem water and all potential water sources dawson et al 2002 huo et al 2018 these analyses assume that no fractionation of these isotopes occur during root water uptake except in halophytic and xerophytic plants ellsworth and williams 2007 lin and sternberg 1993 however recent studies reported that deuterium fractionation in root water uptake may occur even for trees in the temperate oceanic climate barbeta et al 2018 on the contrary there are no reports according to our knowledge on the fractionation of stable oxygen isotopes therefore in the present study we have used stable oxygen isotopes to measure water use patterns of wolfberry end member mixing models are widely used to quantify water sources across global ecosystems they can be categorised as simple linear mixing models e g isosource and bayesian mixing models e g mixsir and mixsiar rothfuss and javaux 2017 unlike the former bayesian mixing models incorporate uncertainties of prior information in data processing stock et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in most published studies of plants water use patterns only one of these two kinds of models has been used however evaristo et al 2017 recently found that the two source mass balance model over estimated the groundwater contribution to trees xylem water in christchurch botanic gardens new zealand differences in results of the two kinds of mixing models have rarely been tested in other ecosystems therefore the objectives of this study were to quantify the variation in water use patterns of wolfberry trees on the tp using oxygen stable isotopes and both simple and bayesian mixing models to obtain sound foundations for water management and crop production in wolfberry orchards 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted in the huaitou tala irrigation area 37 21 n 96 44 e 2869 m above sea level in the northeastern part of the tp in haixi mongol and tibetan autonomous prefecture it has a typical continental climate for the plateau dry windy and cold according to reference data for the period 1977 2016 collected at delingha weather station annual minimum average and maximum air temperatures are 27 9 6 5 and 34 7 c respectively mean annual precipitation amounts to just 241 mm of which more than 70 occurs from june to september accordingly the area receives abundant sunshine 3010 h per year on average the groundwater depth exceeds 50 m according to the international soil classification system the local soil type belongs to sandy loam the soil texture is about 82 sand 0 02 2 mm in the 0 100 cm layer basic properties of the soil in the study area are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design the study was conducted in a wolfberry orchard where the trees were planted with 1 m 3 m spacing in 2015 drip irrigation was applied with 50 cm spacing of drippers each supplying 3 75 l h 1 for six times in 4 h during the growth period and then once in winter after defoliation for approximately 10 h because the study area was a demonstration area of the best irrigation and fertilization system of wolfberry in the alpine region li 2019 we followed the local irrigation schedule three treatments were applied in the orchard conventional flat planting plus surface drip irrigation ck flat planting with full film mulching plus surface drip irrigation mf and ridge furrow full film mulching plus surface drip irrigation mr in 1 5 m 20 m plots with 1 5 m buffers in a randomised block design each plot comprised 20 trees with 3 replicates per treatment on each sampling occasion one tree in each plot was randomly selected a black gardening cloth was used in this study the ridges and furrows had the same width which is 20 cm and the ridge height is 30 cm and the wolfberry planted in the ditch similar planting patterns can be found in gu et al 2016 uniform summer pruning pest and disease control and fertiliser supply were carried out for all treatments 2 3 fine root sampling in october 2018 samples of the 0 120 cm soil layer were taken at 20 40 60 80 100 120 cm depth from three equally spaced points 0 3 m away from the trunk of each of one wolfberry trees in each plot taking into account the influence of wolfberry canopy expansion and root growth root samples were collected at 0 100 cm no sample at 120 cm soil layer from the wolfberry trees trunk three equally spaced points at 0 3 and 0 6 m radial distance in october 2019 the samples were collected using a hand auger 90 mm diameter and passed through a 2 mm sieve to separate gravel from the soil roots were removed with tweezers eliminating dead roots and grass roots and a vernier caliper with 1 10 2 precision was used to take fine roots 2 mm from root samples the fine root length density frld in each case were then calculated 2 1 frld length v where length was the fine root length and v was the volume of soil as described in detail by li et al 2017 2 4 isotope data acquisition during growing stages 15 may to 1 october precipitation and irrigation water samples were taken the precipitation samples were collected in 600 ml plastic bottles through a 10 cm diameter funnel with a ping pong ball placed in the funnel to prevent evaporation then immediately transferred into 20 ml vials sealed with a cap and parafilm after rain samples were subsequently stored in a refrigerator 4 c until isotope analysis soil and xylem samples were taken in four growth stages leaf emergence lfe mid may to mid june blossom and young fruit byf late june to mid july

july and 22 september in 2018 and 6 june 18 july 16 august and 1 october in 2019 in each plot wolfberry trees with similar mean heights and ground diameters were selected for sampling table 2 on each sampling occasion one of these trees in each plot was randomly selected then soil and xylem samples were simultaneously collected three lignified branches were cut from the sunny side and cut into 1 2 cm pieces from which bark and phloem were removed to prevent possible isotope fractionation of xylem water huo et al 2018 samples were then immediately placed in vials which were wrapped in parafilm and put in a portable cooler to avoid evaporation samples of 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil layers were also collected from each tree using a hand auger œÜ 40 mm at a distance of 30 cm away from the trunk every layer of soil samples were mixed well and divided into two parts one of which was placed in wrapped vials like the xylem samples while the other was placed in a soil moisture tin and sealed for subsequent gravimetric determination of soil water content all the xylem and soil samples were transported to the laboratory and stored in a freezer 15 20 before water extraction each sampling event was between 8 30 and 12 00 when the trees were transpiring in addition meteorological information rainfall net radiation air temperature etc during the study period was recorded by an ar5 weather station located 50 m north of the orchard 2 5 determination of stable isotopic composition the water was extracted from the xylem samples and the soil samples by an li 2000 cryogenic vacuum distillation system los gatos research mountain view usa and placed in 5 ml glass vials sealed with parafilm which were stored at 4 c until isotope analysis the oxygen isotope composition of the water extracted from the soil samples was measured using a tiwa 45ep isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris analyser los gatos research mountain view usa which provides analytical precision of 0 2 for Œ¥ 18o to avoid any effects of organic compounds in the samples of cryogenically extracted xylem water they were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometry trms which provides the same analytical precision with iris for Œ¥ 18o 2 6 fruits yield and wue natural precipitation and irrigation represent the main source of chinese wolfberry water in the study area chinese wolfberry mainly consumes water from soil moisture precipitation and irrigation during the growth period thus the water balance equation is 2 2 et p i w r d g where et is evapotranspiration during the growth period p is the precipitation during the same period i is irrigation w is variation in the soil water storage in the 0 100 cm layer between the beginning and end of the growth period r is runoff d is leakage and g is capillary lifted water the underground water level in the study area was 50 m the leakage d and capillary water g can therefore be neglected a small magnitude of precipitation during the growth period ensured that the runoff r was also negligible the water balance equation can thus be modified as follows 2 3 et p i w the total fruit yield at maturity were weighed in each treatment method separately and wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following equation 2 4 wue yield et where yield is the fruit yield at wolfberry harvest kg ha 1 and et is the total evapotranspiration mm 2 7 data analysis 2 7 1 determination of plant water sources partitioning methods we used three approaches one linear mixing model isosource and two bayesian models mixsir and mixsiar to determine contributions of water sources for the wolfberry trees the first method was application of the simple isosource mixing model to obtain feasible ranges of water sources used by the plants phillips and gregg 2003 based on the distributions Œ¥ 18o values and fine root length density frld we considered three potential water sources shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers these layers were expected to have distinct characteristics the isotopic composition of the soil water in the top 20 cm generally fluctuates most due to precipitation and evaporation and shallow layers have higher frld than the middle and deep layers the deep soil layers relatively stable isotopically and have low frld the middle layer was expected to have intermediate isotopic fluctuation in the isosource model the source increment was set at 1 and the mass balance tolerance at 1 2 when use of 1 was fruitless the result is described by the distribution of all such feasible solutions table s1 the mean value of isotopic values in plant xylem and the potential water sources were considered when the isosource model was run in the second approach we used bayesian mixing models mixsir with sampling importance resampling algorithm which explains uncertainties associated with multiple sources the mixsir model can add prior knowledge the mean Œ¥ 18o and their standard deviations sd values of xylem samples and source isotope compositions were input into the model the third was used the bayesian mixing models mixsiar the posterior distribution use the markov chain monte carlo sampling technique includes the advantages of mixsir in addition mixsiar model can also explain variation in proportional contributions of sources through fixed and random effects stock et al 2018 inputs for the mixsiar model included means and standard deviations of isotopic values for plant xylem and each potential water source the concentration dependence and tef trophic enrichment factor values were set to zero the mixsiar model with long or very long settings until convergence more detailed information regarding the parameters of those models can be found in wang et al 2019 the output result of the isosource model is the frequency and range of the contribution of potential water sources to evaluate the performance of the isosource model we used the average contribution rate frequency of potential water sources the output of the bayesian models mixsir and mixsiar is the average contribution rate of potential water sources rather than the frequency distribution of the feasible solution 2 7 2 evaluation of model performance it is difficult to obtain measure directly the water source contributions to plants rothfuss and javaux 2017 therefore we indirectly evaluated the prediction effect of different water source allocation with different data input models by assessing the degree of match between observed and predicted values of xylem water isotopic compositions wang et al 2019 in this study the isotopic compositions of xylem water were considered as the observed values o i the predicted value p i were based on the assumption that the water isotopic compositions of the plant is a mixture of various potential water sources ehleringer and dawson 1992 stock et al 2018 the predicted value p i was calculated as follows 2 5 p i j 1 k f j Œ¥ x where j represents the j th water source k is the total number of water sources there are three water sources in this study k 3 f refer to the contribution rate of the water source which were predicted by water source partitioning methods and Œ¥ x represents the isotope value of the water source Œ¥ 18o to evaluate the performance of different models we calculated five indicators as follows

infeasible fitting zhang et al 2020 2 7 3 statistical analysis the data were analysed using spss 23 0 software spss inc somers ny usa one way anova with post hoc duncan tests was used to analyse between treatment and between layer differences in frld at the 0 05 probability level relationships between soil water contents and both contributions of water sources to the wolfberry trees and frld were analysed by linear regression figures were drawn using originpro 2016 software originlab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 climate and isotopic composition Œ¥ 18o of rainwater and irrigation water daily rainfall mean air temperature and Œ¥ 18o values of rainwater and irrigation water recorded at the study area from may to september in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 1 the total rainfall during the growing period was 146 8 mm and 130 4 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively more than 78 of the rainfall occurred from the beginning of 1st june to 31st august there were wide variations in both Œ¥ 18o values of the rainfall 14 4 to 1 7 and amounts of precipitation throughout the growing period the pearson s correlation analysis indicated no correlation between the Œ¥ 18o values of rainwater and rainfall or daily average temperature 3 2 soil water content and stable isotope composition of soil water the soil water profiles varied substantially between both treatments and growth stages fig 3 soil water contents were higher under the mf and mr treatments than under ck by 30 2 and 37 1 respectively on average across the soil profile on the seven sampling occasions in addition the water content of shallow soil fluctuated most strongly and the ranges of soil water content have decreased over soil depth the water content of deep soil showed slight fluctuations the change pattern of the Œ¥ 18o values of water was similar among the treatments therefore we did not consider differences in the change pattern of the Œ¥ 18o values of water across the treatments the fig 4 shows the temporal and spatial variation of soil water Œ¥ 18o values under all treatment the Œ¥ 18o values of water in the shallow layer clearly varied the variations in Œ¥ 18o values were lower in the middle layer under each treatment and no significant variations were detected in the deep layer 3 3 seasonal water use patterns of wolfberry under the three treatments estimates of relative contributions of water from the three potential sources were obtained from the oxygen isotope values using the isosource mixsir and mixsiar models the three models indicated that the wolfberry under ck used more water from the deep layer with a mean value of 53 1 26 8 82 8 during the growth season in lfe and df ck took up correspondingly large proportions of water from the deep layers by 73 9 and 66 7 respectively and ck mainly using the water from the middle and deep layers during byf and ftm the mf and mr mainly used water from the middle and deep layers during lef and df they could shift their water source among all 3 layers in byf and fm but mr used more the shallow and middle layers water fig 5 the results obtained using the three methods were similar regarding the main apparent root water uptake depth of wolfberry however there were differences in the relative contributions of water sources they indicated the mixsir model displayed a higher proportion of middle water sources than the isosource and mixsiar models in most cases for instance the mixsir model indicated that the middle layer had a higher contribution in the byf and ftm stages under mr than that indicated by the isosource and mixsiar models in 2018 in addition under mr the isosource model indicated that the middle layers had higher contributions 62 7 than the mixsir 48 5 and mixsiar 42 4 models in lef in 2019 the summary of the performance of water utilization predictions using different models is shown in table 3 the isosource model revealed the lowest rmse mape mine and maxe and the largest ne which indicated the accuracy and reliability of this model the rmse mape and maxe values of the mixsiar model were comparatively larger than those of the isosource and mixsir models while the mixsiar model showed lower ne values than the isosource and mixsir models which suggested that the mixsiar model yields comparatively poorer outcomes in terms of water utilisation prediction 3 4 root distributions the distribution of frld under each of the treatments are shown in fig 2 the spatial distribution of the roots was influenced by the ridge furrow system and mulch under each treatment condition most of the fine roots were found in the shallow and middle layers 82 8 83 4 and 83 5 of the total roots on an average over 2 years in the ck mf and mr respectively in general the order of frld with different treatments was mr mf ck although no obvious differences were found in the distribution of frld in each treatment group frld of mf and mr were extended compared with that of ck frld in ck within the shallow soil layer was significantly lower than that in mf and mr 3 5 yield and wue mf and mr showed an increase in yield by 4 7 and 16 4 in 2018 and by 14 4 and 26 6 in 2019 respectively compared with ck table 4 similar trends were observed in wue across the treatment groups compared with ck mf and mr improved wue by 5 7 and 17 1 in 2018 and by 4 2 and 17 0 in 2019 respectively the maximum yield and wue value were recorded in mr whereas the lowest yield and wue value were recorded in ck 3 6 relationship between source contribution and soil water content and fine roots to understand the effect of the soil water content on root water uptake we examined correlations between soil layers contributions to the trees xylem water and their water contents using data obtained for all plants at each sampling date overall there was no significant correlation between these variables fig 6 however water content was positively correlated with the contribution of the shallow layer but not correlated with the contribution of the middle and deep layers fig 6 to study the relationship between root water uptake and fine root density the contribution of each layer to the xylem water of all sampled trees subjected to the same treatment were averaged to obtain a mean value for each treatment and sampling date correlations between these means and proportion of fine biomass frld values of corresponding soil layers on corresponding sampling dates were then examined the contribution of water sources decreased exponentially with increases in frld when using data obtained for all samples fig 7 conversely the contribution of water sources decreased first and then increased with increasing frld in the deep layer fig s1 however there was no significant relationship between the proportion of fine biomass and contribution of water source in shallow and middle layers fig s1 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of different models of water use source identification the Œ¥ 18o of the soil water is mainly affected by evaporation and is enriched in the surface layer however the effect of evaporation decreases with an increase in soil depth therefore under each treatment the Œ¥ 18o of the soil water first decreased rapidly and then tended to be stable with increases in soil depth in the 0 100 cm soil layer in accordance with previous findings cao et al 2018 huo et al 2018 zhao et al 2018a the prediction accuracy of these 3 models was different across different study areas evaristo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore the selection of an accurate prediction model is essential to analyse plant water use patterns the rmse values of the models were lower whereas the ne values of the models were larger than those reported in a study by wang et al 2019 these results together indicate that the 3 models had accurate and credible outcomes in the present study however some differences in the water uptake proportions were observed among the 3 models in general the order of predicting performance was isosource mixsir mixsiar the best performance of isosource was due to the isosource model which did not consider the uncertainties of the stable isotopic composition in plants water sources and xylem water parnell et al 2010 therefore the water uptake proportion predictions of the isosource model did not necessarily reflect the actual root water absorption wang et al 2019 the bayesian mixing model mixsir and mixsiar models can deal with water source apportionment better due to consideration of the error structure residual and process error and the uncertainties of potential water sources brian and brice 2016 parnell et al 2010 stock et al 2018 differences in the contribution from different layers of the 2 bayesian mixing models may be attributed to the error parameterisation and posterior distribution in the model calculations in this study the performance of both bayesian models was excellent and the comprehensive performance of the mixsir model was better therefore the mixsir model was employed to estimate the relative contributions of water sources in present study 4 2 analysis of water sources under the three treatments the isotopic values of xylem water and soil water exhibited seasonal variations and between field management practices fig 4 table s2 indicating that the water used by trees from may to september may came from different soil water sources in the different treatments the shallow and middle layers have relatively high water contents due to water supplied by winter irrigation and snow melt during the lfe stage dai et al 2015 zhao et al 2018b the trees in ck did not use water from the shallow water source 5 6 and instead depended on water from the deep water source 72 8 this was attribute to low temperatures and water consumption table s3 zhang et al 2018 however under the mf and mr they used more proportions of water from shallow layer 10 2 and 18 respectively possibly because the mulching and creation of ridges and furrows increased the soil temperature and humidity fig 3 table s3 gu et al 2016 thereby enhancing root activity in shallow soil layer clarke et al 2015 during byf and ftm the root growth was the fastest and the root activity was strong cao and he 2013 the trees could flexibly use the water source of each soil layer ck treatment mainly used the middle and deep soil water sources increased precipitation did not increase the utilization of shallow water sources in byf in2019 which may be because of a decrease in the soil water content in the shallow layer compared with the other two treatment groups due to water loss through evaporation table s3 moreover 74 of the precipitation events were 5 mm which is an invalid rainfall amount for crop growth zhao et al 2018b because of which the root system sensitivity to precipitation was reduced only when the precipitation increases to a certain threshold the root system in the shallow soil layer can respond and the root system can form the ability to maintain absorption of shallow water source zhao et al 2018b in contrast under mr and mf the mulching measures reduced the water loss from soil evaporation and under mr the tillage measures could sufficiently increase the infiltration of the precipitation to induce responses table s3 liu et al 2014 compared to ck the trees in mf and mr can flexibly switch to different water sources due to increased soil water content and root biomass in each soil layers increased absorption of shallow water sources in byf 2019 may be because the ridges increased rainfall infiltration and thus induce strongly responses from rainfall in mr in autumn the temperature and wolfberry transpiration dropped but rain was scarce so both soil water content and root activity declined in the shallow layer and wolfberry preferred use of water in the middle and deep soil layers which is relatively abundant and stable gao et al 2018a 4 3 impact of soil water availability and fine roots on water sources root water uptake is closely related to soil water availability and the distribution of functional roots kulmatiski et al 2017 gao et al 2018a we found that contributions of the shallow soil layer were positively correlated with its water content indicating that the trees root systems were sensitive to the shallow water sources and responded rapidly to changes except ck due to the high density of fine roots and possibly through changes in the activity or abundance of aquaporins gregory et al 2015 the root systems of wolfberries may be able to exploit a large horizontal area of shallow soil which may also facilitate absorption of nutrients that are generally highest in the shallow layer table 1 clarke et al 2015 similar results were reported by gao et al 2018b who revealed a positive correlation between the soil water content and root water uptake in a semiarid revegetated ecosystem in the middle and deep soil layers the trees water utilisation did not match the soil water content a possible explanation for this finding is that the trees water requirements could be more easily met in the shallow layer owing to the strong concentration of the trees root in the shallow soil layer soil water availability is not a major constraint factor in the trees water absorption huo et al 2020 we detected a non linear correlation between frld and water source contributions possibly because the decline in shallow water availability during the long drought in september fig 5 led to more water uptake from the deep layer with low frld yang et al 2018 changes in the plants water sources may also be related to the architecture and hydraulic effects of root systems rosado et al 2011 kulmatiski and beard 2013 therefore plants water use strategies are inextricably linked to soil water availability and their fine root distributions 4 4 effect of field management practices on wolfberry yield and wue studies have reported that both mulching and tillage measures can improve the yield and wue in maize and wheat fang et al 2021 daryanto et al 2017 mainly because mulching can increase the accumulation of soil water due to reduced soil evaporation and ridge furrow farming practice can enhance the use of rainfall zhang et al 2021 in addition mulching and tillage measures can effectively increase surface soil moisture soil temperature and water use such hydrothermal conditions play an important role in the dry matter accumulation and growth yield of plants zhang et al 2021 although the magnitude of the difference was small in evapotranspiration among the 3 treatments in 2018 the soil evaporation in mf and mr was less than that in ck table s3 indicating that more soil water in mf and mr was used for plant transpiration thus the wue in mf and mr was increased by 5 and 17 compared with that in ck irrigation water is becoming scarce due to the increasing demands for water for industrial urban and other uses in arid and semi arid areas hamzei 2011 and it is projected that global mean temperature rises by at least 2 by the end of the twenty first century particularly on tp chen et al 2013 hence traditional flat planting as in the ck treatment may no longer be suitable for agriculture in many drylands and in these areas water conserving agricultural measures may be needed we found that the soil water contents and proportional use of shallow and middle water sources were consistently higher under the mf and mr than those under ck treatments throughout the growth period shallow soil water is thus extremely important for wolfberry production this is consistent with reports that a combination of full film mulching and tillage is an effective way to improve soil moisture and temperature mo et al 2017 liao et al 2019b 2021 with great potential for saving water in arid and semi arid areas gu et al 2016 in the context of rainfall increases on the tp kuang and jiao 2016 film mulching and tillage measures could collect large volumes of rainwater and increase the available water for plants thereby increasing production and wue therefore we recommend it as a water management strategy for dryland wolfberry orchards 5 conclusion our analysis of chinese wolfberry s water use patterns in different management practices using stable oxygen isotope techniques and three models isosource mixsir and mixsiar no significant difference was noted in water utilisation predicted using the 3 methods in this study the three models exhibited good performance for wolfberry water source apportionment and the similar results acquired using the three models indicated that the prediction of wolfberry water source is reliable overall the mixsir model exhibited relatively better performance than the isosource and mixsiar models the ck trees tended to use more soil water from deeper layers and their water use patterns were insensitive to rainfall whereas the mf and mr trees shifted their water source between all three layers depending on soil water content the proportional contribution of only at shallow water layer was positively correlated with its water content and overall contributions of the layers were exponentially decayed with frld in them the water source utilisation of the mr trees was found to be highly flexible and sensitive to precipitation irrigation during the growth period whereas tillage and film mulching were found to increase the shallow soil water content in the field wolfberry s proportional use of shallow soil water wolfberry yield and wue therefore it was established as the most effective water management practice in wolfberry orchards further study is however required to enhance the quantitative understanding of soil nutrients and

and increase farmers incomes on the tibetan plateau therefore it has been widely grown in this region in the past decades the aims of this study were to clarify the patterns of water sources and water use efficiency under 3 management practices to determine the optimal cultivation strategies a 2 year field experiment was undertaken in a chinese wolfberry plantation with 3 management practices including the conventional flat planting plus surface drip irrigation ck flat planting with full film mulching plus surface drip irrigation mf and ridge furrow full film mulching plus surface drip irrigation mr the soil moisture in shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers were regarded as the trees potential water sources the isosource model and two bayesian mixing models of mixsir and mixsiar were employed to calculate the contribution of different water sources to xylem water the mixsir model exhibited relatively better performance in quantifying water source contribution for different layers compared with the isosource and mixsiar models management practices significantly altered water use patterns of the wolfberry during the growing periods under ck the wolfberry preferentially extracted moisture from the middle and deep layers even during rainfall and irrigation under mf and mr they switched more flexibly their water source between the three layers and they used more water from shallow and middle layers when soil moisture availability increased there which was especially true under mr compared with ck the average yield of mr and wue were found to increase by 21 5 and 17 respectively over the 2 years period this indicated that film mulching and ridge furrow altered the water use strategy of chinese wolfberry and wue which can inform the designing of the best management regimes the response to tree water use in terms of soil nutrients and subsurface irrigation should be investigated to optimize field management practices including irrigation schedules and modes keywords chinese wolfberry water use strategy stable isotope bayesian mixing model water use efficiency 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp often called the third pole plays a major role in safeguarding the environmental security downstream in east china and south asia yao et al 2012 moreover the ecological environment on the qinghai tibet plateau is extremely sensitive to human activities however land uses on the tp have been extensively transformed by socio economic development and intensifying human activity especially overgrazing wang et al 2020a wu et al 2021 this has led to severe socio economic and ecological problems including increasing desertification grassland degradation and reduction in forest cover cao et al 2004 chen et al 2011 feng et al 2005 jin et al 2019 miehe et al 2019 in the past decades the chinese government has adopted several measures to recover and protect the degraded rangelands chen et al 2021 wu et al 2021 including enclosure closure against grazing and reducing livestock density wu et al 2021 however a consensus on the magnitude of efforts to be made in these measures is lacking although these measures are directly linked to the improvement of farmer s incomes developing high value added ecological agriculture may ameliorate the degradation by reducing overgrazing and improving livelihoods of the farmers and herders jin et al 2019 miehe et al 2008 zhou et al 2019 chinese wolfberry lycium barbarum l also called the goji berry hereafter wolfberry is a crop of high economic value that has been widely used to ameliorate wind erosion and improve soil structure the northern part of the tp provides suitable conditions for its cultivation abundant sunshine and large diurnal temperature variation and has become the second largest area after the ningxia hui autonomous region for its production in china lei et al 2020 however drought and water scarcity have strongly constrained development of wolfberry orchards on the tp deng et al 2017 xu et al 2019 therefore minimising water use and enhancing water productivity are essential mulching and drip irrigation are among the well known approaches mo et al 2017 liao et al 2019a 2019b 2021 fang et al 2021 the subsurface irrigation method has been applied in the arid and semi arid areas of china in recent years considering that it has near zero soil evaporation and optimum nutrient supply cai et al 2021 fu et al 2021 in this area the irrigation system should be upgraded from the surface drip irrigation method to the subsurface drip irrigation method therefore the water uptake patterns of wolfberries during the growth period should be elucidated to formulate an optimal water management system and the best buried depth for the subsurface drip irrigation analysis of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes provides a highly sensitive and accurate approach to study plants water use patterns and eco hydrological processes barbeta and penuelas 2017 dai et al 2015 dawson and ehleringer 1991 huo et al 2018 gao et al 2018a grossiord et al 2017 wang et al 2020b especially in the arid and semi arid areas wu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 gao et al 2018b yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the theoretical basis is that xylem water can be regarded as a mixture of water from all utilized sources so the proportional uses of specific sources can be estimated by comparing hydrogen or oxygen isotope signatures of xylem water and all potential water sources dawson et al 2002 huo et al 2018 these analyses assume that no fractionation of these isotopes occur during root water uptake except in halophytic and xerophytic plants ellsworth and williams 2007 lin and sternberg 1993 however recent studies reported that deuterium fractionation in root water uptake may occur even for trees in the temperate oceanic climate barbeta et al 2018 on the contrary there are no reports according to our knowledge on the fractionation of stable oxygen isotopes therefore in the present study we have used stable oxygen isotopes to measure water use patterns of wolfberry end member mixing models are widely used to quantify water sources across global ecosystems they can be categorised as simple linear mixing models e g isosource and bayesian mixing models e g mixsir and mixsiar rothfuss and javaux 2017 unlike the former bayesian mixing models incorporate uncertainties of prior information in data processing stock et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in most published studies of plants water use patterns only one of these two kinds of models has been used however evaristo et al 2017 recently found that the two source mass balance model over estimated the groundwater contribution to trees xylem water in christchurch botanic gardens new zealand differences in results of the two kinds of mixing models have rarely been tested in other ecosystems therefore the objectives of this study were to quantify the variation in water use patterns of wolfberry trees on the tp using oxygen stable isotopes and both simple and bayesian mixing models to obtain sound foundations for water management and crop production in wolfberry orchards 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted in the huaitou tala irrigation area 37 21 n 96 44 e 2869 m above sea level in the northeastern part of the tp in haixi mongol and tibetan

average and maximum air temperatures are 27 9 6 5 and 34 7 c respectively mean annual precipitation amounts to just 241 mm of which more than 70 occurs from june to september accordingly the area receives abundant sunshine 3010 h per year on average the groundwater depth exceeds 50 m according to the international soil classification system the local soil type belongs to sandy loam the soil texture is about 82 sand 0 02 2 mm in the 0 100 cm layer basic properties of the soil in the study area are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design the study was conducted in a wolfberry orchard where the trees were planted with 1 m 3 m spacing in 2015 drip irrigation was applied with 50 cm spacing of drippers each supplying 3 75 l h 1 for six times in 4 h during the growth period and then once in winter after defoliation for approximately 10 h because the study area was a demonstration area of the best irrigation and fertilization system of wolfberry in the alpine region li 2019 we followed the local irrigation schedule three treatments were applied in the orchard conventional flat planting plus surface drip irrigation ck flat planting with full film mulching plus surface drip irrigation mf and ridge furrow full film mulching plus surface drip irrigation mr in 1 5 m 20 m plots with 1 5 m buffers in a randomised block design each plot comprised 20 trees with 3 replicates per treatment on each sampling occasion one tree in each plot was randomly selected a black gardening cloth was used in this study the ridges and furrows had the same width which is 20 cm and the ridge height is 30 cm and the wolfberry planted in the ditch similar planting patterns can be found in gu et al 2016 uniform summer pruning pest and disease control and fertiliser supply were carried out for all treatments 2 3 fine root sampling in october 2018 samples of the 0 120 cm soil layer were taken at 20 40 60 80 100 120 cm depth from three equally spaced points 0 3 m away from the trunk of each of one wolfberry trees in each plot taking into account the influence of wolfberry canopy expansion and root growth root samples were collected at 0 100 cm no sample at 120 cm soil layer from the wolfberry trees trunk three equally spaced points at 0 3 and 0 6 m radial distance in october 2019 the samples were collected using a hand auger 90 mm diameter and passed through a 2 mm sieve to separate gravel from the soil roots were removed with tweezers eliminating dead roots and grass roots and a vernier caliper with 1 10 2 precision was used to take fine roots 2 mm from root samples the fine root length density frld in each case were then calculated 2 1 frld length v where length was the fine root length and v was the volume of soil as described in detail by li et al 2017 2 4 isotope data acquisition during growing stages 15 may to 1 october precipitation and irrigation water samples were taken the precipitation samples were collected in 600 ml plastic bottles through a 10 cm diameter funnel with a ping pong ball placed in the funnel to prevent evaporation then immediately transferred into 20 ml vials sealed with a cap and parafilm after rain samples were subsequently stored in a refrigerator 4 c until isotope analysis soil and xylem samples were taken in four growth stages leaf emergence lfe mid may to mid june blossom and young fruit byf late june to mid july fruit maturation ftm late july to mid september and defoliation df late september to early of october after a period of at least 5 days with no rainfall or irrigation the sampling dates were 9 july 30 july and 22 september in 2018 and 6 june 18 july 16 august and 1 october in 2019 in each plot wolfberry trees with similar mean heights and ground diameters were selected for sampling table 2 on each sampling occasion one of these trees in each plot was randomly selected then soil and xylem samples were simultaneously collected three lignified branches were cut from the sunny side and cut into 1 2 cm pieces from which bark and phloem were removed to prevent possible isotope fractionation of xylem water huo et al 2018 samples were then immediately placed in vials which were wrapped in parafilm and put in a portable cooler to avoid evaporation samples of 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil layers were also collected from each tree using a hand auger œÜ 40 mm at a distance of 30 cm away from the trunk every layer of soil samples were mixed well and divided into two parts one of which was placed in wrapped vials like the xylem samples while the other was placed in a soil moisture tin and sealed for subsequent gravimetric determination of soil water content all the xylem and soil samples were transported to the laboratory and stored in a freezer 15 20 before water extraction each sampling event was between 8 30 and 12 00 when the trees were transpiring in addition meteorological information rainfall net radiation air temperature etc during the study period was recorded by an ar5 weather station located 50 m north of the orchard 2 5 determination of stable isotopic composition the water was extracted from the xylem samples and the soil samples by an li 2000 cryogenic vacuum distillation system los gatos research mountain view usa and placed in 5 ml glass vials sealed with parafilm which were stored at 4 c until isotope analysis the oxygen isotope composition of the water extracted from the soil samples was measured using a tiwa 45ep isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris analyser los gatos research mountain view usa which provides analytical precision of 0 2 for Œ¥ 18o to avoid any effects of organic compounds in the samples of cryogenically extracted xylem water they were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometry trms which provides the same analytical precision with iris for Œ¥ 18o 2 6 fruits yield and wue natural precipitation and irrigation represent the main source of chinese wolfberry water in the study area chinese wolfberry mainly consumes water from soil moisture precipitation and irrigation during the growth period thus the water balance equation is 2 2 et p i w r d g where et is evapotranspiration during the growth period p is the precipitation during the same period i is irrigation w is variation in the soil water storage in the 0 100 cm layer between the beginning and end of the growth period r is runoff d is leakage and g is capillary lifted water the underground water level in the study area was 50 m the leakage d and capillary water g can therefore be neglected a small magnitude of precipitation during the growth period ensured that the runoff r was also negligible the water balance equation can thus be modified as follows 2 3 et p i w the total fruit yield at maturity were weighed in each treatment method separately and wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated using the following equation 2 4 wue yield et where yield is the fruit yield at wolfberry harvest kg ha 1 and et is the total evapotranspiration mm 2 7 data analysis 2 7 1 determination of plant water sources partitioning methods we used three approaches one linear mixing model isosource and two bayesian models mixsir and mixsiar to determine contributions of water sources for the wolfberry trees the first method was application of the simple isosource mixing model to obtain feasible ranges of water sources used by the plants phillips and gregg 2003 based on the distributions Œ¥ 18o values and fine root length density frld we considered three potential water sources shallow 0 20 cm middle 20 60 cm and deep 60 100 cm soil layers these layers were expected to have distinct characteristics the isotopic composition of the soil water in the top 20 cm generally fluctuates most due to precipitation and evaporation and shallow layers have higher frld than the middle and deep layers the deep soil layers relatively stable isotopically and have low frld the middle layer was expected to have intermediate isotopic fluctuation in the isosource model the source increment was set at 1 and the mass balance tolerance at 1 2 when use of 1 was fruitless the result is described by the distribution of all such feasible solutions table s1 the mean value of isotopic values in plant xylem and the potential water sources were considered when the isosource model was run in the second approach we used bayesian mixing models mixsir with sampling importance resampling algorithm which explains uncertainties associated with multiple sources the mixsir model can add prior knowledge the mean Œ¥ 18o and their standard deviations sd values of xylem samples and source isotope compositions were input into the model the third was used the bayesian mixing models mixsiar the posterior distribution use the markov chain monte carlo sampling technique includes the advantages of mixsir in addition mixsiar model can also explain variation in proportional contributions of sources through fixed and random effects stock et al 2018 inputs for the mixsiar model included means and standard deviations of isotopic values for plant xylem and each potential water source the concentration dependence and tef trophic enrichment factor values were set to zero the mixsiar model with long or very long settings until convergence more detailed information regarding the parameters of those models can be found in wang et al 2019 the output result of the isosource model is the frequency and range of the contribution of potential water sources to evaluate the performance of the isosource model we used the average contribution rate frequency of potential water sources the output of the bayesian models mixsir and mixsiar is the average contribution rate of potential water sources rather than the frequency distribution of the feasible solution 2 7 2 evaluation of model performance it is difficult to obtain measure directly the water source contributions to plants rothfuss and javaux 2017 therefore we indirectly evaluated the prediction effect of different water source allocation with different data input models by assessing the degree of match between observed and predicted values of xylem water isotopic compositions wang et al 2019 in this study the isotopic compositions of xylem water were considered as the observed values o i the predicted value p i were based on the assumption that the water isotopic compositions of the plant is a mixture of various potential water sources ehleringer and dawson 1992 stock et al 2018 the predicted value p i was calculated as follows 2 5 p i j 1 k f j Œ¥ x where j represents the j th water source k is the total number of water sources there are three water sources in this study k 3 f refer to the contribution rate of the water source which were predicted by water source partitioning methods and Œ¥ x represents the isotope value of the water source Œ¥ 18o to evaluate the performance of different models we calculated five indicators as follows 1 root mean square error rmse 2 6 r m s e 1 n 1 n p i o i 2 2 nash coefficient ne 2 7 n e 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o m o i 2 3 mean absolute percentage error mape 2 8 mape 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 4 the

infeasible fitting zhang et al 2020 2 7 3 statistical analysis the data were analysed using spss 23 0 software spss inc somers ny usa one way anova with post hoc duncan tests was used to analyse between treatment and between layer differences in frld at the 0 05 probability level relationships between soil water contents and both contributions of water sources to the wolfberry trees and frld were analysed by linear regression figures were drawn using originpro 2016 software originlab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 climate and isotopic composition Œ¥ 18o of rainwater and irrigation water daily rainfall mean air temperature and Œ¥ 18o values of rainwater and irrigation water recorded at the study area from may to september in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 1 the total rainfall during the growing period was 146 8 mm and 130 4 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively more than 78 of the rainfall occurred from the beginning of 1st june to 31st august there were wide variations in both Œ¥ 18o values of the rainfall 14 4 to 1 7 and amounts of precipitation throughout the growing period the pearson s correlation analysis indicated no correlation between the Œ¥ 18o values of rainwater and rainfall or daily average temperature 3 2 soil water content and stable isotope composition of soil water the soil water profiles varied substantially between both treatments and growth stages fig 3 soil water contents were higher under the mf and mr treatments than under ck by 30 2 and 37 1 respectively on average across the soil profile on the seven sampling occasions in addition the water content of shallow soil fluctuated most strongly and the ranges of soil water content have decreased over soil depth the water content of deep soil showed slight fluctuations the change pattern of the Œ¥ 18o values of water was similar among the treatments therefore we did not consider differences in the change pattern of the Œ¥ 18o values of water across the treatments the fig 4 shows the temporal and spatial variation of soil water Œ¥ 18o values under all treatment the Œ¥ 18o values of water in the shallow layer clearly varied the variations in Œ¥ 18o values were lower in the middle layer under each treatment and no significant variations were detected in the deep layer 3 3 seasonal water use patterns of wolfberry under the three treatments estimates of relative contributions of water from the three potential sources were obtained from the oxygen isotope values using the isosource mixsir and mixsiar models the three models indicated that the wolfberry under ck used more water from the deep layer with a mean value of 53 1 26 8 82 8 during the growth season in lfe and df ck took up correspondingly large proportions of water from the deep layers by 73 9 and 66 7 respectively and ck mainly using the water from the middle and deep layers during byf and ftm the mf and mr mainly used water from the middle and deep layers during lef and df they could shift their water source among all 3 layers in byf and fm but mr used more the shallow and middle layers water fig 5 the results obtained using the three methods were similar regarding the main apparent root water uptake depth of wolfberry however there were differences in the relative contributions of water sources they indicated the mixsir model displayed a higher proportion of middle water sources than the isosource and mixsiar models in most cases for instance the mixsir model indicated that the middle layer had a higher contribution in the byf and ftm stages under mr than that indicated by the isosource and mixsiar models in 2018 in addition under mr the isosource model indicated that the middle layers had higher contributions 62 7 than the mixsir 48 5 and mixsiar 42 4 models in lef in 2019 the summary of the performance of water utilization predictions using different models is shown in table 3 the isosource model revealed the lowest rmse mape mine and maxe and the largest ne which indicated the accuracy and reliability of this model the rmse mape and maxe values of the mixsiar model were comparatively larger than those of the isosource and mixsir models while the mixsiar model showed lower ne values than the isosource and mixsir models which suggested that the mixsiar model yields comparatively poorer outcomes in terms of water utilisation prediction 3 4 root distributions the distribution of frld under each of the treatments are shown in fig 2 the spatial distribution of the roots was influenced by the ridge furrow system and mulch under each treatment condition most of the fine roots were found in the shallow and middle layers 82 8 83 4 and 83 5 of the total roots on an average over 2 years in the ck mf and mr respectively in general the order of frld with different treatments was mr mf ck although no obvious differences were found in the distribution of frld in each treatment group frld of mf and mr were extended compared with that of ck frld in ck within the shallow soil layer was significantly lower than that in mf and mr 3 5 yield and wue mf and mr showed an increase in yield by 4 7 and 16 4 in 2018 and by 14 4 and 26 6 in 2019 respectively compared with ck table 4 similar trends were observed in wue across the treatment groups compared with ck mf and mr improved wue by 5 7 and 17 1 in 2018 and by 4 2 and 17 0 in 2019 respectively the maximum yield and wue value were recorded in mr whereas the lowest yield and wue value were recorded in ck 3 6 relationship between source contribution and soil water content and fine roots to understand the effect of the soil water content on root water uptake we examined correlations between soil layers contributions to the trees xylem water and their water contents using data obtained for all plants at each sampling date overall there was no significant correlation between these variables fig 6 however water content was positively correlated with the contribution of the shallow layer but not correlated with the contribution of the middle and deep layers fig 6 to study the relationship between root water uptake and fine root density the contribution of each layer to the xylem water of all sampled trees subjected to the same treatment were averaged to obtain a mean value for each treatment and sampling date correlations between these means and proportion of fine biomass frld values of corresponding soil layers on corresponding sampling dates were then examined the contribution of water sources decreased exponentially with increases in frld when using data obtained for all samples fig 7 conversely the contribution of water sources decreased first and then increased with increasing frld in the deep layer fig s1 however there was no significant relationship between the proportion of fine biomass and contribution of water source in shallow and middle layers fig s1 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of different models of water use source identification the Œ¥ 18o of the soil water is mainly affected by evaporation and is enriched in the surface layer however the effect of evaporation decreases with an increase in soil depth therefore under each treatment the Œ¥ 18o of the soil water first decreased rapidly and then tended to be stable with increases in soil depth in the 0 100 cm soil layer in accordance with previous findings cao et al 2018 huo et al 2018 zhao et al 2018a the prediction accuracy of these 3 models was different across different study areas evaristo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore the selection of an accurate prediction model is essential to analyse plant water use patterns the rmse values of the models were lower whereas the ne values of the models were larger than those reported in a study by wang et al 2019 these results together indicate that the 3 models had accurate and credible outcomes in the present study however some differences in the water uptake proportions were observed among the 3 models in general the order of predicting performance was isosource mixsir mixsiar the best performance of isosource was due to the isosource model which did not consider the uncertainties of the stable isotopic composition in plants water sources and xylem water parnell et al 2010 therefore the water uptake proportion predictions of the isosource model did not necessarily reflect the actual root water absorption wang et al 2019 the bayesian mixing model mixsir and mixsiar models can deal with water source apportionment better due to consideration of the error structure residual and process error and the uncertainties of potential water sources brian and brice 2016 parnell et al 2010 stock et al 2018 differences in the contribution from different layers of the 2 bayesian mixing models may be attributed to the error parameterisation and posterior distribution in the model calculations in this study the performance of both bayesian models was excellent and the comprehensive performance of the mixsir model was better therefore the mixsir model was employed to estimate the relative contributions of water sources in present study 4 2 analysis of water sources under the three treatments the isotopic values of xylem water and soil water exhibited seasonal variations and between field management practices fig 4 table s2 indicating that the water used by trees from may to september may came from different soil water sources in the different treatments the shallow and middle layers have relatively high water contents due to water supplied by winter irrigation and snow melt during the lfe stage dai et al 2015 zhao et al 2018b the trees in ck did not use water from the shallow water source 5 6 and instead depended on water from the deep water source 72 8 this was attribute to low temperatures and water consumption table s3 zhang et al 2018 however under the mf and mr they used more proportions of water from shallow layer 10 2 and 18 respectively possibly because the mulching and creation of ridges and furrows increased the soil temperature and humidity fig 3 table s3 gu et al 2016 thereby enhancing root activity in shallow soil layer clarke et al 2015 during byf and ftm the root growth was the fastest and the root activity was strong cao and he 2013 the trees could flexibly use the water source of each soil layer ck treatment mainly used the middle and deep soil water sources increased precipitation did not increase the utilization of shallow water sources in byf in2019 which may be because of a decrease in the soil water content in the shallow layer compared with the other two treatment groups due to water loss through evaporation table s3 moreover 74 of the precipitation events were 5 mm which is an invalid rainfall amount for crop growth zhao et al 2018b because of which the root system sensitivity to precipitation was reduced only when the precipitation increases to a certain threshold the root system in the shallow soil layer can respond and the root system can form the ability to maintain absorption of shallow water source zhao et al 2018b in contrast under mr and mf the mulching measures reduced the water loss from soil evaporation and under mr the tillage measures could sufficiently increase the infiltration of the precipitation to induce responses table s3 liu et al 2014 compared to ck the trees in mf and mr can flexibly switch to different water sources due to increased soil water content and root biomass in each soil layers increased absorption of shallow water sources in byf 2019 may be because the ridges increased rainfall infiltration and thus induce strongly responses from rainfall in mr in autumn the temperature and wolfberry transpiration dropped but rain was scarce so both soil water content and root activity declined in the shallow layer and wolfberry preferred use of water in the middle and deep soil layers which is relatively abundant and stable gao et al 2018a 4 3 impact of soil water availability and fine roots on water sources root water uptake is closely related to soil water availability and the distribution of functional roots kulmatiski et al 2017 gao et al 2018a we found that contributions of the shallow soil layer were positively correlated with its water content indicating that the trees root systems were sensitive to the shallow water sources and responded rapidly to changes except ck due to the high density of fine roots and possibly through changes in the activity or abundance of aquaporins gregory et al 2015 the root systems of wolfberries may be able to exploit a large horizontal area of shallow soil which may also facilitate absorption of nutrients that are generally highest in the shallow layer table 1 clarke et al 2015 similar results were reported by gao et al 2018b who revealed a positive correlation between the soil water content and root water uptake in a semiarid revegetated ecosystem in the middle and deep soil layers the trees water utilisation did not match the soil water content a possible explanation for this finding is that the trees water requirements could be more easily met in the shallow layer owing to the strong concentration of the trees root in the shallow soil layer soil water availability is not a major constraint factor in the trees water absorption huo et al 2020 we detected a non linear correlation between frld and water source contributions possibly because the decline in shallow water availability during the long drought in september fig 5 led to more water uptake from the deep layer with low frld yang et al 2018 changes in the plants water sources may also be related to the architecture and hydraulic effects of root systems rosado et al 2011 kulmatiski and beard 2013 therefore plants water use strategies are inextricably linked to soil water availability and their fine root distributions 4 4 effect of field management practices on wolfberry yield and wue studies have reported that both mulching and tillage measures can improve the yield and wue in maize and wheat fang et al 2021 daryanto et al 2017 mainly because mulching can increase the accumulation of soil water due to reduced soil evaporation and ridge furrow farming practice can enhance the use of rainfall zhang et al 2021 in addition mulching and tillage measures can effectively increase surface soil moisture soil temperature and water use such hydrothermal conditions play an important role in the dry matter accumulation and growth yield of plants zhang et al 2021 although the magnitude of the difference was small in evapotranspiration among the 3 treatments in 2018 the soil evaporation in mf and mr was less than that in ck table s3 indicating that more soil water in mf and mr was used for plant transpiration thus the wue in mf and mr was increased by 5 and 17 compared with that in ck irrigation water is becoming scarce due to the increasing demands for water for industrial urban and other uses in arid and semi arid areas hamzei 2011 and it is projected that global mean temperature rises by at least 2 by the end of the twenty first century particularly on tp chen et al 2013 hence traditional flat planting as in the ck treatment may no longer be suitable for agriculture in many drylands and in these areas water conserving agricultural measures may be needed we found that the soil water contents and proportional use of shallow and middle water sources were consistently higher under the mf and mr than those under ck treatments throughout the growth period shallow soil water is thus extremely important for wolfberry production this is consistent with reports that a combination of full film mulching and tillage is an effective way to improve soil moisture and temperature mo et al 2017 liao et al 2019b 2021 with great potential for saving water in arid and semi arid areas gu et al 2016 in the context of rainfall increases on the tp kuang and jiao 2016 film mulching and tillage measures could collect large volumes of rainwater and increase the available water for plants thereby increasing production and wue therefore we recommend it as a water management strategy for dryland wolfberry orchards 5 conclusion our analysis of chinese wolfberry s water use patterns in different management practices using stable oxygen isotope techniques and three models isosource mixsir and mixsiar no significant difference was noted in water utilisation predicted using the 3 methods in this study the three models exhibited good performance for wolfberry water source apportionment and the similar results acquired using the three models indicated that the prediction of wolfberry water source is reliable overall the mixsir model exhibited relatively better performance than the isosource and mixsiar models the ck trees tended to use more soil water from deeper layers and their water use patterns were insensitive to rainfall whereas the mf and mr trees shifted their water source between all three layers depending on soil water content the proportional contribution of only at shallow water layer was positively correlated with its water content and overall contributions of the layers were exponentially decayed with frld in them the water source utilisation of the mr trees was found to be highly flexible and sensitive to precipitation irrigation during the growth period whereas tillage and film mulching were found to increase the shallow soil water content in the field wolfberry s proportional use of shallow soil water wolfberry yield and wue therefore it was established as the most effective water management practice in wolfberry orchards further study is however required to enhance the quantitative understanding of soil nutrients and

9987,excessive water and fertilizer input in conventional farming practices not only lead to low production but also damaged the ecosystem by causing groundwater decline and groundwater nitrate contamination the two year field experiments were conducted at zhengzhou of china and tandojam of pakistan sites respectively the whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator model was used to simulate soil water dynamic nitrogen n fate and maize yield under different irrigation practices including farmer based full flood irrigation fi drip irrigation di and rainfed rf at the zhengzhou site treatments of the tandojam site were full flood irrigation f100 moderate deficit irrigation f75 and high deficit irrigation f50 to meet the 100 75 and 50 crop evapotranspiration respectively results showed that the model precisely simulated water consumption fates of n crop growth and yield at both sites in zhengzhou site we found the lowest grain yield in the rf system whereas the di increased average grain yield by 9 8 decreased 62 5 water consumption compared to fi for the two years moreover the di had a negligible amount of drainage runoff and n leaching which subsequently improved water use efficiency wue up to 24 5 and 9 1 fertilizer n use efficiency fnue in tandojam site compared to f100 the f75 produced almost equal grain yield with 25 1 water saving reduced 42 5 drainage and 11 8 runoff 57 n leaching enhanced 4 1 wue and 14 9 fnue furthermore results suggested that too deficit irrigation for example f50 could cause serious yield loss or complete crop failure because the weather condition of the tandojam site is very hot keywords irrigation practices water use efficiency fertilizer n use efficiency different climate conditions whcns model 1 introduction the water demand is increasing worldwide while the availability of fresh water is decreasing water scarcity affecting most of the globe presently groundwater depletion and degradation due to conventional farming practices is a major problem for both china and pakistan therefore it is crucially important to ensure the efficient use of irrigation water through improved irrigation management practices which will help to address water conservation problems montazar et al 2020 irrigation management strategies can play a significant role in ecosystem safety and food security with sustainable income liu et al 2016 reported that farmers normally apply 5 7 times full flood irrigation to wheat crop by each time pumping of 70 80 mm water thus the annual groundwater abstraction reaches 600 800 mm yr 1 a survey study showed that 7 6 million tubewells are being used to pump groundwater in china feng et al 2013 and 1 2 million in pakistan qureshi 2020 consequently excessive water pumping continuously causing groundwater decline with a rate of 1 m yr 1 in north china plain yang et al 2015a and there could be a 10 20 m water table drop in the lower and upper regions of pakistan by 2025 dawn newspaper 2021 the current condition of groundwater in neighbouring counties is that the first aquifer is completely depleted now the second aquifer is going to be depleted because the water pumping of farmers from the ground is not only excessive but also quicker than it can replenish in addition the annual natural water refilling is low 200 mm yr 1 due to low precipitation in china min et al 2015 and abstraction rates have exceeded the recharge rate of 55 billion m3 in pakistan dawn newspaper 2021 the situation can even be hard in the near future and the agricultural system could fluctuate badly for example the fast development of urban areas will further increase the water demand and reduce its availability liu et al 2011 yang et al 2015b gong et al 2018 on the other hand excessive use of n fertilizer in crop production threatened the terrestrial and aquatic systems an estimated 250 kg n ha 1 per season exceeds the crop n assimilation capacity cui et al 2010 a typical plant can uptake half of the applied n only while the remaining enters water bodies via deep drain in the process of leaching pathways khan et al 2017 since n in the form of no3 is highly water soluble and mobile it moves and displaces freely with water on the most type of soils letey and vaughan 2013 an estimated 18 20 of n loss occurs via leaching from the cropping system ju and zhang 2017 many researchers characterized the crop production system of the china and pakistan as low n use efficiency the fertilizer n use efficiency fnue is often 30 35 because farmers apply n fertilizer through the broadcasting method during full flood irrigation which results in high n leaching there are many groundwater friendly crop production practices following climatic and edaphic factors in some areas of china maize is cultivated as rainfed and under drip irrigation management practice to conserve water because tandojam pakistan s study area has a hot climate rainfed crop production is not possible and farmers do not adopt drip irrigation management practices due to high costs here optimal deficit irrigation of maize is considered a water saving strategy even though maize is a drought tolerance crop too deficit irrigation could result in crop failure or serious yield loss the drip irrigation and moderate deficit flood irrigation management practice involve the low application of irrigation water on the soil which wet only rooting depth soil unlike conventional full flood irrigation which involves saturating the whole soil up to 80 cm drip irrigation although only practiced in a small area is claimed to have high potential to significantly increase yield zaccaria et al 2017 by enhancing photosynthesis rate umair et al 2019 reduce evaporation deep drainage and save irrigation darouich et al 2014 √ßetin and akalp 2019 the evaporation rate was significantly lower in the drip irrigated plot without adverse effects on the crop s transpiration yang et al 2020 drip irrigation also reduces drainage and improves water use efficiency wue wei et al 2010 ayars et al 2015 there are also many advantages of drip irrigation particularly drip irrigation maintains soil aeration thereby promotes plant root growth enhances leaf area and grain quality to mitigate the effect of farming practices in the study areas many researchers have focused on maize and compared its yield potentiality under different agronomic practices ma et al 2017 cui et al 2018 sun et al 2019 qi et al 2020 zahra et al 2021 previous studies suggested that partial root zone soil drying or maintaining top soil available water content at 30 could increase maize yield compared to full irrigation karandish and ≈°im≈Ønek 2019 attia et al 2021 those studies mainly focused on maize production region with water shortage in one country with almost the same weather conditions however the information on the water and nitrogen use efficiencies of maize under different irrigation management practices in different countries with a totally different climate is still limited therefore the aims of this study were to i compare maize yield water consumption n fates wue and fnue of maize under different irrigation management practices in zhengzhou china and tandojam pakistan ii analyze the main reasons causing the difference of maize yields wues and fnues for both sites 2 materials and methods the two year field experiments were conducted from 2018 to 2019 at zhengzhou china and tandojam pakistan the detail is given below 2 1 zhengzhou site the experimental station of north china university of water resources and electric power zhengzhou is located at 34 47 ºn 113 38 ºe fig 1 it is warm temperate sub humid and continental monsoon conditions the mean annual temperature is 14 4 c during june and july the monthly average temperature rises to 26 3 30 c the average annual rainfall is 480 mm about 60 70 occurs during the maize growing season yang et al 2017 the soil of the experimental site has sandy loam texture ph 8 3 organic matter 11 2 g kg 1 alkaline n 76 6 mg kg 1 available p 8 2 mg kg 1 and exchangeable k 67 4 mg kg 1 wang et al 2010 the layer wise basic soil physical properties are presented in table 1 there were three irrigation management practices including farmer based full flood irrigation fi drip irrigation di and rainfed rf the plot size was 130 m2 13 m long 10 m wide the experimental plot design was a randomized complete block design which consisted of four replications approximately 1 m of protection line was set between the neighboring plots to reduce the effect of water lateral infiltration for fi the irrigation amount was according to local farmer practices in the di plot the average soil water content in the root zone 0 80 cm was kept between 50 and 80 of the field capacity based on the measured soil water content once a week there were separate water outlets and water meters for fi and di to record irrigation amount the irrigation system was comprised of computer and smartphone control applications lorvanleuang and zhao 2018 a full dose of p 25 kg ha 1 and k 21 kg ha 1 fertilizers were all applied as basal the source of p was superphosphate and k was potassium chloride the total amount of urea was 225 kg n ha 1 for each treatment the 60 of n was used as base fertilizer and 40 as topdressing all treatments received an equal rate of fertilizer the maize variety luobai 3 was sown on 15 april at a row spacing of 60 cm with a seed rate of 28 kg ha 1 the plant density was 7 8 plants m2 the maize was harvested on 25 september 2 2 tandojam site the experimental site student s experimental farm sindh agriculture university tandojam is located at 25 25 60 n 68 31 60e fig 1 it is semi arid atmospheric temperature ranges cool to cold in winter 9 16 c and hot to very hot during summer 37 43 c rainfall is highly irregular and significantly lower than potential evapotranspiration etp annual rainfall ranges 145 155 mm therefore crop production rainfed is impossible without irrigation and also drip irrigation method is not practiced due to high cost tunio et al 2020 the soil of the study site has clay loam texture ph 7 8 poor in organic matter and available p 3 02 mg kg 1 but high in exchangeable k 140 mg kg 1 buriro et al 2015 the layer wise basic physical soil properties are given in table 1 the experimental plot design was a randomized complete block design which consisted of three replications the plot size was 24 m2 6 m long 4 m wide there were three irrigation management practices including full flood irrigation f100 as control treatment moderate deficit irrigation f75 and high deficit irrigation f50 to meet the 100 75 and 50 actual crop etp respectively a cut throat flume 0 8 m 1 5 m was installed at the water channel center to apply the required depth of water the water flow rate and irrigation amounts were calculated according to equations given in tunio et al 2020 the n fertilizer rate was applied as urea at rate of 160 kg n ha 1 from which 50 incorporated in the soil during seed bed preparation and 50 broadcasted in two equal splits at the time of first and second irrigation while p and k fertilizers were applied according to the recommendations of the agricultural research institute tandojam buriro et al 2015 the maize variety hicorn339 was sown on 20 july with seed rate 30 kg ha 1 the row spacing was 60 65 cm and the plants were spaced at 20 25 cm within the row the plant density was 6 8 plants m2 the maize growth was monitored once week the maize was harvested on 16 november 2 3 observations and measurements the soil bulk density and field capacity was determined by the cutting ring method wang et al 2017 soil particle fraction was analyzed using the hydrometer method beretta et al 2014 soil saturated residual water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity was obtained using a neural network model based on soil particle fraction and bulk density schaap et al 1998 the soil water content was measured from different soil depths 0 80 cm at 20 cm interval in each experimental plot using on field installed witu technology tubular moisture sensors at the zhengzhou site zhang et al 2020 while soil water content at the tandojam site was determined by the gravimetric method to determine soil nitrate concentrations fresh soil samples were extracted with 1 mol l 1 kcl 1 10 soil water and analyzed using continuous flow analyzer aa3 bran and luebbe germany the lai and dry matter were measured at different growth stages grain yield was measured when the grain moisture content dropped below 15 replicated cob samples of different treatments were oven dried to keep grain moisture at desired level leghari et al 2019 the meteorological data were obtained from local weather station at zhengzhou and regional agromet center tandojam including the daily average temperature minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity average wind speed 2 m radiation and precipitation 2 4 whcns model the whcns model can simulate water dynamics n fates and crop growth under different field management

m 2 dry matter kg ha 1 and grain yield under different irrigation management practices at zhengzhou and tandojam sites were used to calibrate the model and then validated by the second year data season 2019 among the input parameters highly sensitive crop and soil parameters were adjusted by trial and error method to minimize the error between simulated and observed values shi et al 2020 the calibrated crop and n transformation parameters are shown in table 2 statistical evaluation of simulated data with observed values indicated satisfactory model performance referred to previous studies he et al 2018 liang et al 2019a the model precisely projected soil water content n concentration lai dry matter and grain yield the rmse ranged from 0 02 to 0 06 for water content 0 80 cm 3 45 4 35

zhengzhou site the d values of the tandojam site were between 0 52 and 0 98 for soil water content 0 91 0 98 for n concentrations 0 90 0 93 for lai 0 50 0 73 for dry matter and 0 84 0 99 for grain yield in correlation coefficients the r equal to 1 existed between simulated and measured dry matter and grain yield of both experimental sites similarly simulated soil n concentrations and lai had a strong correlation with r corresponding up to 0 95 table 3 and fig 2 a strong relationship r 0 80 for grain yield and dry matter also reported by shi et al 2020 with a simulation error of 10 3 2 effect of different irrigation practices on maize yield at two sites the measured and simulated grain yields for both sites under different irrigation management practices are shown in fig 3 for zhengzhou site the farmer based fi management practice consumed a high amount of irrigation 240 mm compared to di and produced a total grain yield of 20434 kg ha 1 significantly p 0 05 high grain yield 22 449 kg ha 1 obtained from di at 62 5 decreased water 90 mm for the two years thus di increased grain production by 9 8 and 70 7 than those of fi and rf practices respectively the rf treatment exhibited 13 149 kg ha 1 grain yield which was 35 6 lower than fi because the rf plot was highly under water stress the precipitation distribution was uneven throughout the experimental period the primary reason for improved yield from the drip irrigation plot was vigorous plant growth and development which subsequently promoted root growth enhanced biomass accumulation grain fillings and cob length for tandojam site similarly to the zhengzhou site the farmer based f100 management practice also consumed an excessive amount of irrigation 780 mm compared to f75 and f50 treatments for the two years the f100 treatment showed a total grain yield of 18819 kg ha 1 and f75 showed 17652 kg ha 1 at 25 1 decreased application of irrigation 584 mm the yield gap between f100 and f75 was only 6 2 furthermore f50 treatment showed significantly low total grain yield 13149 kg ha 1 at 50 and 33 3 decreased irrigation amount compared to f100 and f75 treatments 3 3 effect of different irrigation practices on water consumption and wue at two sites the water consumption of maize field for both sites under different irrigation management practices is given in table 4 for zhengzhou site the simulation showed negligible amounts of drainage and runoff in the di and rf and farmer based fi management had higher average drainage of 20 mm the rf and di plots had an average evaporation rate of 141 6 mm and 147 0 mm while fi exhibited 195 9 mm evaporation which was 33 3 increased evaporation as compared to di in crop transpiration the rf had 13 8 15 decreased water consumption through transpiration than those of fi and di the fi and di treatments had 190 3 mm and 193 0 mm transpiration respectively with only 1 4 variation furthermore the difference in terms of water balance between fi and di was 4 0 the fi and di had an average 58 3 mm 55 9 mm water income respectively the lower water income was under rf with 43 9 mm in the case of wue the di had higher wue than the other treatments in the first season the wue under di was 3 4 kg m 3 and the subsequent year was 3 2 kg m 3 thus the order of wue was di fi rf for tandojam site the results showed that farmer based f100 management had higher average evaporation of 193 6 mm and transpiration rate of 213 7 mm whereas f75 and f50 exhibited 172 3 mm and 114 7 mm evaporation and 196 3 mm and 145 0 mm transpiration respectively the average drainage and runoff rates were also higher in f100 the f75 and f50 management practices decreased water loss via drainage by 42 6 and 73 6 and water loss via runoff by 11 8 and 37 3 compared to f100 increased et drainage and runoff affected the wue the f75 and showed a maximum average wue of 2 5 kg m 3 and 2 7 kg m 3 respectively furthermore the results demonstrated that rainfall is critical for water balance system in tanojam the water balance of all treatments for 2018 was negative due to rainfall while it was positive in 2019 3 4 effect of different irrigation practices on n fates n balance and fnue at two sites the n fate of maize field for both sites under different irrigation management practices is given in table 5 for zhengzhou site the results showed that the n leaching was negligible in di and rf and higher in fi the fi treatment had an average n leaching of 18 4 kg ha 1 whereas the nh3 volatilization was higher in both di and rf and lower in fi the average volatilization was 19 0 kg ha 1 in di and 22 5 kg ha 1 in rf which was a 35 7 60 7 increased than fi the n denitrification rates were minor in all treatments the maximum n leaching under fi could be attributed to excessive irrigation and the reason for increased n volatilization from rf and di fields could be low moisture at the soil surface layer in the case of mineralization and crop n uptake the net mineralization of fi had an average of 54 0 kg n ha 1 and di had 39 5 kg n ha 1 despite this difference in n net mineralization the di had increased n uptake the average crop n uptake of the drip irrigated crop was 219 0 kg n ha 1 which was 8 9 higher than fi and 15 3 than rf the more crop n uptake under di affected the n balance therefore di had a minimum average of 25 5 kg n ha 1 n surpluses the maximum average n surpluses 43 2 kg ha 1 and 49 1 kg ha 1 were observed in fi and rf systems the increased n utilization in the di field increased 13 3 55 fnue than fi and rf the di crop had an average fnue of 47 2 kg kg 1 thus the order of fnue was di fi rf for tandojam site the results indicated that the n leaching was low in f75 and f50 than f100 the f100 had an average n leaching 57 1 kg ha 1 whereas the nh3 volatilization was higher in f50 the average volatilization was 15 9 kg ha 1 in f50 73 3 and 61 1 higher than f100 and f75 while n denitrification was 30 4 kg ha 1 in f100 and 25 0 kg ha 1 in f75 significantly low n denitrification was 12 7 kg ha 1 in f50 in the case of nh3 mineralization and crop n uptake the f75 had an average of 80 9 kg ha 1 net mineralization and 191 1 kg ha 1 n uptake and f100 had 72 2 kg ha 1 n mineralization and 210 0 kg ha 1 n uptake the n surplus of all treatments was negative except for f50 in the 2019 season moreover the fates of n showed that n leaching and nh3 volatilization loss influenced the fnue the order of fnue was f50 f75 f100 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of different irrigation practices on water productivity of maize at both sites irrigation management practices strongly influence crop water productivity kumar jha et al 2019 the farmer based full flood irrigation tends to induce super saturated water content in the topsoil layer which probably causes lack of air and consequently affects grain yield kang et al 2002 the soil texture of the study area zhengzhou is predominantly sandy clay loam and tandojam is heavily textured the surface layer has a hard structure due to low organic matter wang et al 2015 buriro et al 2015 therefore the farmer based full irrigation practice had higher et and drainage at both sites as the irrigation application reduced then these water losses also reduced for example di treatment of zhengzhou site and f75 and f50 treatments of tandojam site the di management practice at the zhengzhou site increased yield by 9 8 with 62 5 water saving and the f75 at the tandojam site produced almost equal yield with 25 1 water saving although f50 showed 50 water saving the 30 1 yield decrease could not be ignored these results are consistent with the findings of greaves and wang 2017 they differentiated water productivity of maize between 100 and 83 irrigation levels and reported that the 17 deficit irrigation offered 14 water saving compared to farmer s practice without any substantial yield penalty while zou et al 2021 achieved highest maize water productivity at 20 deficit irrigation furthermore the reduced application of irrigation also improved wue the results of increases in yield water conservancy and enhanced wue under di and f75 irrigation management practices could be attributed to keeping root zone soil water content at an optimal level el hendawy et al 2008 optimal application of water mainly promoted root growth and then boosted biomass accumulation fig s1 showed the pattern of irrigation management practices affecting maize growth and yield previously also reported by zhou et al 2017 sandhu et al 2019 and yang et al 2020 they found that application of reduced irrigation via either drip or flood method improves maize growth and increases yield by 13 7 while reducing et up to 22 mm runoff and deep drainages typically reduced irrigation extends maize grain filling stage which result in higher yield wang et al 2018 overall those results indicated that the drip and moderate deficit irrigation treatments would be beneficial in terms of water productivity of maize crop our results were consistent with these studies 4 2 the effects of different irrigation management practices on n fate and fnue of maize at both sites the n loss through volatilization denitrification and leaching is not only yield affecting factor but also the primary cause of maximum n deposition in the terrestrial and aquatic systems a typical plant can uptake half of the applied n only and the remaining cost as environmental contamination khan et al 2017 since n in the form of no3 is highly water soluble and mobile it moves and displaces freely with water through the most type of soils leghari et al 2016 the present study showed that the farmer based full flood irrigation practices is inefficient as compared to the reduced application of irrigation via flood or drip irrigation management practices because of low n use efficiency the lower irrigation amount via drip reduced n loss in the form of leaching by 97 6 enhanced crop n uptake by 8 9 and improved fnue by 13 3 at the zhengzhou site while 25 lower irrigation application to meet 75 crop et reduced n leaching loss by 57 enhanced crop n uptake by 9 0 and improved fnue by 14 9 at tandojam site with the cost of minor yield decline these results are consistent with li et al 2016 who observed less than 40 kg n ha 1 and more than 50 kg n ha 1 leaching when irrigation amount was below and over 300 mm the reduced n losses in the di and f75 treatments where lower irrigation was applied could be the result of the maintained soil moisture optimum soil moisture improves n uptake wu et al 2019 for instant lu et al 2021 and xiao et al 2019 experimented effect of 28 5 decreased irrigation to maintain optimum soil water content and achieved 28 6 n saving with 24 61 7 reduced n leaching wang et al 2019 noticed 17 2 higher fnue at moderate water stress compared to farmer based full irrigation our study suggest that the drip and moderate deficit irrigation treatments would be also advantageous in terms of n productivity of maize crop 4 3 best irrigation management practices for each site although maize is a drought tolerance crop aba accumulates in the leaf tissue and subsequently induces stomatal closure as well as zmasr3 gene increases plant water content the prolonged dry days could result in crop failure or limited yield in areas where irrigation water availability is a problem and crops are cultivated through high deficit irrigation practices or rainfed liang et al 2019b gad√©djisso tossou et al 2018 our findings showed that di management would be the best water saving practice for the zhengzhou area which agreed with the findings of many other researchers faloye et al 2017 hu et al 2018 ning et al 2019 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the primary reasons behind the recommendation of di were increased water saving and grain yield fu et al 2017 because rf maize is not cultivated and the di method is also not practiced due to high cost in the tandojam area the moderate deficit irrigation f75 treatment would be a good water saving practice without affecting grain yield the f50 treatment saves enough water but could not be considered due to significant yield decline it resulted in stunted plant growth mainly decreased lai in our experiment which could be result of inhibited co2 exchange zhang et al 2018 and lowered intercepted photosynthetically active radiations song et al 2019 the lai is a critical part of plant its increase enhances metabolic capacity of maize bai and gao 2021 everywhere the goal of water saving management practice is to conserve irrigation water while maintaining yield in this study the selected best irrigation management practices agreed with the recent research of memon et al 2021 investigated different deficit irrigation strategies and concluded that crop could be produced at more than 26 deficit irrigation with minor yield reduction while zou et al 2021 found that reducing the irrigation allocation to maize crop by 20 would produce either equal or higher yield with improved wue up to 16 as compared to full irrigation 5 conclusions the whcns model was tested at zhengzhou china and tandojam pakistan sites with a totally different weather and soil conditions the statistical evaluation showed that the model performed well in simulating soil water content soil mineral n lai dry matter and crop yield under different water saving management practices therefore the model could be used to simulate the effects of different irrigation management practices on the water consumption and n fates at both sites based on the simulation results we found that the di would significantly improve crop yield in the zhengzhou area compared to farmer based full irrigation practice the di not only increased grain yield but also conserved water by decreasing evaporation drainage and runoff moreover the di had a negligible amount of n leaching and had maximum average crop n uptake both wue and fnues were also higher in di whereas fi resulted in increased evaporation rate and this was a major pathway of water loss for tandojam area 25 deficit irrigation by reducing irrigation amount during each irrigation application would be a good water saving strategy this level of deficit irrigation will not affect yield and help to minimize n losses the observed and simulated data indicated that too deficit irrigation could cause serious yield loss or complete crop failure because the weather of the study area is very hot credit authorship contribution statement

9987,excessive water and fertilizer input in conventional farming practices not only lead to low production but also damaged the ecosystem by causing groundwater decline and groundwater nitrate contamination the two year field experiments were conducted at zhengzhou of china and tandojam of pakistan sites respectively the whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator model was used to simulate soil water dynamic nitrogen n fate and maize yield under different irrigation practices including farmer based full flood irrigation fi drip irrigation di and rainfed rf at the zhengzhou site treatments of the tandojam site were full flood irrigation f100 moderate deficit irrigation f75 and high deficit irrigation f50 to meet the 100 75 and 50 crop evapotranspiration respectively results showed that the model precisely simulated water consumption fates of n crop growth and yield at both sites in zhengzhou site we found the lowest grain yield in the rf system whereas the di increased average grain yield by 9 8 decreased 62 5 water consumption compared to fi for the two years moreover the di had a negligible amount of drainage runoff and n leaching which subsequently improved water use efficiency wue up to 24 5 and 9 1 fertilizer n use efficiency fnue in tandojam site compared to f100 the f75 produced almost equal grain yield with 25 1 water saving reduced 42 5 drainage and 11 8 runoff 57 n leaching enhanced 4 1 wue and 14 9 fnue furthermore results suggested that too deficit irrigation for example f50 could cause serious yield loss or complete crop failure because the weather condition of the tandojam site is very hot keywords irrigation practices water use efficiency fertilizer n use efficiency different climate conditions whcns model 1 introduction the water demand is increasing worldwide while the availability of fresh water is decreasing water scarcity affecting most of the globe presently groundwater depletion and degradation due to conventional farming practices is a major problem for both china and pakistan therefore it is crucially important to ensure the efficient use of irrigation water through improved irrigation management practices which will help to address water conservation problems montazar et al 2020 irrigation management strategies can play a significant role in ecosystem safety and food security with sustainable income liu et al 2016 reported that farmers normally apply 5 7 times full flood irrigation to wheat crop by each time pumping of 70 80 mm water thus the annual groundwater abstraction reaches 600 800 mm yr 1 a survey study showed that 7 6 million tubewells are being used to pump groundwater in china feng et al 2013 and 1 2 million in pakistan qureshi 2020 consequently excessive water pumping continuously causing groundwater decline with a rate of 1 m yr 1 in north china plain yang et al 2015a and there could be a 10 20 m water table drop in the lower and upper regions of pakistan by 2025 dawn newspaper 2021 the current condition of groundwater in neighbouring counties is that the first aquifer is completely depleted now the second aquifer is going to be depleted because the water pumping of farmers from the ground is not only excessive but also quicker than it can replenish in addition the annual natural water refilling is low 200 mm yr 1 due to low precipitation in china min et al 2015 and abstraction rates have exceeded the recharge rate of 55 billion m3 in pakistan dawn newspaper 2021 the situation can even be hard in the near future and the agricultural system could fluctuate badly for example the fast development of urban areas will further increase the water demand and reduce its availability liu et al 2011 yang et al 2015b gong et al 2018 on the other hand excessive use of n fertilizer in crop production threatened the terrestrial and aquatic systems an estimated 250 kg n ha 1 per season exceeds the crop n assimilation capacity cui et al 2010 a typical plant can uptake half of the applied n only while the remaining enters water bodies via deep drain in the process of leaching pathways khan et al 2017 since n in the form of no3 is highly water soluble and mobile it moves and displaces freely with water on the most type of soils letey and vaughan 2013 an estimated 18 20 of n loss occurs via leaching from the cropping system ju and zhang 2017 many researchers characterized the crop production system of the china and pakistan as low n use efficiency the fertilizer n use efficiency fnue is often 30 35 because farmers apply n fertilizer through the broadcasting method during full flood irrigation which results in high n leaching there are many groundwater friendly crop production practices following climatic and edaphic factors in some areas of china maize is cultivated as rainfed and under drip irrigation management practice to conserve water because tandojam pakistan s study area has a hot climate rainfed crop production is not possible and farmers do not adopt drip irrigation management practices due to high costs here optimal deficit irrigation of maize is considered a water saving strategy even though maize is a drought tolerance crop too deficit irrigation could result in crop failure or serious yield loss the drip irrigation and moderate deficit flood irrigation management practice involve the low application of irrigation water on the soil which wet only rooting depth soil unlike conventional full flood irrigation which involves saturating the whole soil up to 80 cm drip irrigation although only practiced in a small area is claimed to have high potential to significantly increase yield zaccaria et al 2017 by enhancing photosynthesis rate umair et al 2019 reduce evaporation deep drainage and save irrigation darouich et al 2014 √ßetin and akalp 2019 the evaporation rate was significantly lower in the drip irrigated plot without adverse effects on the crop s transpiration yang et al 2020 drip irrigation also reduces drainage and improves water use efficiency wue wei et al 2010 ayars et al 2015 there are also many advantages of drip irrigation particularly drip irrigation maintains soil aeration thereby promotes plant root growth enhances leaf area and grain quality to mitigate the effect of farming practices in the study areas many researchers have focused on maize and compared its yield potentiality under different agronomic practices ma et al 2017 cui et al 2018 sun et al 2019 qi et al 2020 zahra et al 2021 previous studies suggested that partial root zone soil drying or maintaining top soil available water content at 30 could increase maize yield compared to full irrigation karandish and ≈°im≈Ønek 2019 attia et al 2021 those studies mainly focused on maize production region with water shortage in one country with almost the same weather conditions however the information on the water and nitrogen use efficiencies of maize under different irrigation management practices in different countries with a totally different climate is still limited therefore the aims of this study were to i compare maize yield water consumption n fates wue and fnue of maize under different irrigation management practices in zhengzhou china and tandojam pakistan ii analyze the main reasons causing the difference of maize yields wues and fnues for both sites 2 materials and methods the two year field experiments were conducted from 2018 to 2019 at zhengzhou china and tandojam pakistan the detail is given below 2 1 zhengzhou site the experimental

strong correlation with r corresponding up to 0 95 table 3 and fig 2 a strong relationship r 0 80 for grain yield and dry matter also reported by shi et al 2020 with a simulation error of 10 3 2 effect of different irrigation practices on maize yield at two sites the measured and simulated grain yields for both sites under different irrigation management practices are shown in fig 3 for zhengzhou site the farmer based fi management practice consumed a high amount of irrigation 240 mm compared to di and produced a total grain yield of 20434 kg ha 1 significantly p 0 05 high grain yield 22 449 kg ha 1 obtained from di at 62 5 decreased water 90 mm for the two years thus di increased grain production by 9 8 and 70 7 than those of fi and rf practices respectively the rf treatment exhibited 13 149 kg ha 1 grain yield which was 35 6 lower than fi because the rf plot was highly under water stress the precipitation distribution was uneven throughout the experimental period the primary reason for improved yield from the drip irrigation plot was vigorous plant growth and development which subsequently promoted root growth enhanced biomass accumulation grain fillings and cob length for tandojam site similarly to the zhengzhou site the farmer based f100 management practice also consumed an excessive amount of irrigation 780 mm compared to f75 and f50 treatments for the two years the f100 treatment showed a total grain yield of 18819 kg ha 1 and f75 showed 17652 kg ha 1 at 25 1 decreased application of irrigation 584 mm the yield gap between f100 and f75 was only 6 2 furthermore f50 treatment showed significantly low total grain yield 13149 kg ha 1 at 50 and 33 3 decreased irrigation amount compared to f100 and f75 treatments 3 3 effect of different irrigation practices on water consumption and wue at two sites the water consumption of maize field for both sites under different irrigation management practices is given in table 4 for zhengzhou site the simulation showed negligible amounts of drainage and runoff in the di and rf and farmer based fi management had higher average drainage of 20 mm the rf and di plots had an average evaporation rate of 141 6 mm and 147 0 mm while fi exhibited 195 9 mm evaporation which was 33 3 increased evaporation as compared to di in crop transpiration the rf had 13 8 15 decreased water consumption through transpiration than those of fi and di the fi and di treatments had 190 3 mm and 193 0 mm transpiration respectively with only 1 4 variation furthermore the difference in terms of water balance between fi and di was 4 0 the fi and di had an average 58 3 mm 55 9 mm water income respectively the lower water income was under rf with 43 9 mm in the case of wue the di had higher wue than the other treatments in the first season the wue under di was 3 4 kg m 3 and the subsequent year was 3 2 kg m 3 thus the order of wue was di fi rf for tandojam site the results showed that farmer based f100 management had higher average evaporation of 193 6 mm and transpiration rate of 213 7 mm whereas f75 and f50 exhibited 172 3 mm and 114 7 mm evaporation and 196 3 mm and 145 0 mm transpiration respectively the average drainage and runoff rates were also higher in f100 the f75 and f50 management practices decreased water loss via drainage by 42 6 and 73 6 and water loss via runoff by 11 8 and 37 3 compared to f100 increased et drainage and runoff affected the wue the f75 and showed a maximum average wue of 2 5 kg m 3 and 2 7 kg m 3 respectively furthermore the results demonstrated that rainfall is critical for water balance system in tanojam the water balance of all treatments for 2018 was negative due to rainfall while it was positive in 2019 3 4 effect of different irrigation practices on n fates n balance and fnue at two sites the n fate of maize field for both sites under different irrigation management practices is given in table 5 for zhengzhou site the results showed that the n leaching was negligible in di and rf and higher in fi the fi treatment had an average n leaching of 18 4 kg ha 1 whereas the nh3 volatilization was higher in both di and rf and lower in fi the average volatilization was 19 0 kg ha 1 in di and 22 5 kg ha 1 in rf which was a 35 7 60 7 increased than fi the n denitrification rates were minor in all treatments the maximum n leaching under fi could be attributed to excessive irrigation and the reason for increased n volatilization from rf and di fields could be low moisture at the soil surface layer in the case of mineralization and crop n uptake the net mineralization of fi had an average of 54 0 kg n ha 1 and di had 39 5 kg n ha 1 despite this difference in n net mineralization the di had increased n uptake the average crop n uptake of the drip irrigated crop was 219 0 kg n ha 1 which was 8 9 higher than fi and 15 3 than rf the more crop n uptake under di affected the n balance therefore di had a minimum average of 25 5 kg n ha 1 n surpluses the maximum average n surpluses 43 2 kg ha 1 and 49 1 kg ha 1 were observed in fi and rf systems the increased n utilization in the di field increased 13 3 55 fnue than fi and rf the di crop had an average fnue of 47 2 kg kg 1 thus the order of fnue was di fi rf for tandojam site the results indicated that the n leaching was low in f75 and f50 than f100 the f100 had an average n leaching 57 1 kg ha 1 whereas the nh3 volatilization was higher in f50 the average volatilization was 15 9 kg ha 1 in f50 73 3 and 61 1 higher than f100 and f75 while n denitrification was 30 4 kg ha 1 in f100 and 25 0 kg ha 1 in f75 significantly low n denitrification was 12 7 kg ha 1 in f50 in the case of nh3 mineralization and crop n uptake the f75 had an average of 80 9 kg ha 1 net mineralization and 191 1 kg ha 1 n uptake and f100 had 72 2 kg ha 1 n mineralization and 210 0 kg ha 1 n uptake the n surplus of all treatments was negative except for f50 in the 2019 season moreover the fates of n showed that n leaching and nh3 volatilization loss influenced the fnue the order of fnue was f50 f75 f100 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of different irrigation practices on water productivity of maize at both sites irrigation management practices strongly influence crop water productivity kumar jha et al 2019 the farmer based full flood irrigation tends to induce super saturated water content in the topsoil layer which probably causes lack of air and consequently affects grain yield kang et al 2002 the soil texture of the study area zhengzhou is predominantly sandy clay loam and tandojam is heavily textured the surface layer has a hard structure due to low organic matter wang et al 2015 buriro et al 2015 therefore the farmer based full irrigation practice had higher et and drainage at both sites as the irrigation application reduced then these water losses also reduced for example di treatment of zhengzhou site and f75 and f50 treatments of tandojam site the di management practice at the zhengzhou site increased yield by 9 8 with 62 5 water saving and the f75 at the tandojam site produced almost equal yield with 25 1 water saving although f50 showed 50 water saving the 30 1 yield decrease could not be ignored these results are consistent with the findings of greaves and wang 2017 they differentiated water productivity of maize between 100 and 83 irrigation levels and reported that the 17 deficit irrigation offered 14 water saving compared to farmer s practice without any substantial yield penalty while zou et al 2021 achieved highest maize water productivity at 20 deficit irrigation furthermore the reduced application of irrigation also improved wue the results of increases in yield water conservancy and enhanced wue under di and f75 irrigation management practices could be attributed to keeping root zone soil water content at an optimal level el hendawy et al 2008 optimal application of water mainly promoted root growth and then boosted biomass accumulation fig s1 showed the pattern of irrigation management practices affecting maize growth and yield previously also reported by zhou et al 2017 sandhu et al 2019 and yang et al 2020 they found that application of reduced irrigation via either drip or flood method improves maize growth and increases yield by 13 7 while reducing et up to 22 mm runoff and deep drainages typically reduced irrigation extends maize grain filling stage which result in higher yield wang et al 2018 overall those results indicated that the drip and moderate deficit irrigation treatments would be beneficial in terms of water productivity of maize crop our results were consistent with these studies 4 2 the effects of different irrigation management practices on n fate and fnue of maize at both sites the n loss through volatilization denitrification and leaching is not only yield affecting factor but also the primary cause of maximum n deposition in the terrestrial and aquatic systems a typical plant can uptake half of the applied n only and the remaining cost as environmental contamination khan et al 2017 since n in the form of no3 is highly water soluble and mobile it moves and displaces freely with water through the most type of soils leghari et al 2016 the present study showed that the farmer based full flood irrigation practices is inefficient as compared to the reduced application of irrigation via flood or drip irrigation management practices because of low n use efficiency the lower irrigation amount via drip reduced n loss in the form of leaching by 97 6 enhanced crop n uptake by 8 9 and improved fnue by 13 3 at the zhengzhou site while 25 lower irrigation application to meet 75 crop et reduced n leaching loss by 57 enhanced crop n uptake by 9 0 and improved fnue by 14 9 at tandojam site with the cost of minor yield decline these results are consistent with li et al 2016 who observed less than 40 kg n ha 1 and more than 50 kg n ha 1 leaching when irrigation amount was below and over 300 mm the reduced n losses in the di and f75 treatments where lower irrigation was applied could be the result of the maintained soil moisture optimum soil moisture improves n uptake wu et al 2019 for instant lu et al 2021 and xiao et al 2019 experimented effect of 28 5 decreased irrigation to maintain optimum soil water content and achieved 28 6 n saving with 24 61 7 reduced n leaching wang et al 2019 noticed 17 2 higher fnue at moderate water stress compared to farmer based full irrigation our study suggest that the drip and moderate deficit irrigation treatments would be also advantageous in terms of n productivity of maize crop 4 3 best irrigation management practices for each site although maize is a drought tolerance crop aba accumulates in the leaf tissue and subsequently induces stomatal closure as well as zmasr3 gene increases plant water content the prolonged dry days could result in crop failure or limited yield in areas where irrigation water availability is a problem and crops are cultivated through high deficit irrigation practices or rainfed liang et al 2019b gad√©djisso tossou et al 2018 our findings showed that di management would be the best water saving practice for the zhengzhou area which agreed with the findings of many other researchers faloye et al 2017 hu et al 2018 ning et al 2019 zou et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the primary reasons behind the recommendation of di were increased water saving and grain yield fu et al 2017 because rf maize is not cultivated and the di method is also not practiced due to high cost in the tandojam area the moderate deficit irrigation f75 treatment would be a good water saving practice without affecting grain yield the f50 treatment saves enough water but could not be considered due to significant yield decline it resulted in stunted plant growth mainly decreased lai in our experiment which could be result of inhibited co2 exchange zhang et al 2018 and lowered intercepted photosynthetically active radiations song et al 2019 the lai is a critical part of plant its increase enhances metabolic capacity of maize bai and gao 2021 everywhere the goal of water saving management practice is to conserve irrigation water while maintaining yield in this study the selected best irrigation management practices agreed with the recent research of memon et al 2021 investigated different deficit irrigation strategies and concluded that crop could be produced at more than 26 deficit irrigation with minor yield reduction while zou et al 2021 found that reducing the irrigation allocation to maize crop by 20 would produce either equal or higher yield with improved wue up to 16 as compared to full irrigation 5 conclusions the whcns model was tested at zhengzhou china and tandojam pakistan sites with a totally different weather and soil conditions the statistical evaluation showed that the model performed well in simulating soil water content soil mineral n lai dry matter and crop yield under different water saving management practices therefore the model could be used to simulate the effects of different irrigation management practices on the water consumption and n fates at both sites based on the simulation results we found that the di would significantly improve crop yield in the zhengzhou area compared to farmer based full irrigation practice the di not only increased grain yield but also conserved water by decreasing evaporation drainage and runoff moreover the di had a negligible amount of n leaching and had maximum average crop n uptake both wue and fnues were also higher in di whereas fi resulted in increased evaporation rate and this was a major pathway of water loss for tandojam area 25 deficit irrigation by reducing irrigation amount during each irrigation application would be a good water saving strategy this level of deficit irrigation will not affect yield and help to minimize n losses the observed and simulated data indicated that too deficit irrigation could cause serious yield loss or complete crop failure because the weather of the study area is very hot credit authorship contribution statement

9988,groundwater is an important source for domestic drinking agriculture and industrial activities however arsenic and nitrate contamination in groundwater are major world problem and public health concern this research aimed to evaluate the concentration and spatial distribution of arsenic and nitrate in groundwater of 22 cultivated villages of chahardoli plain of iran by geostatistical techniques and their possible health hazards in local residents a total of 94 groundwater samples were collected from wells in agriculture areas and analyze for arsenic and nitrate concentrations geostatistical analysis and health risk assessment model were applied to investigate spatial distribution and associated health risks of arsenic and nitrate in groundwater of the study area the levels of nitrate in groundwater had a range of 3 20 428 00 mg l with the mean value of 152 95 115 49 Œºg l nitrate concentration in 73 of samples exceeded the world health organization who acceptable limits of 50 mg l arsenic as was found in groundwater which ranged from 0 39 to 220 82 Œºg l mean 30 16 Œºg l and exceeded the who recommended level 10 Œºg l for 59 of the groundwater samples the health risk of nitrate indicated the hazard quotient hq values suggesting an unacceptable noncarcinogenic health risk for arsenic the mean values of hq for a men women and children were 0 24 0 04 1 54 0 29 0 05 1 85 and 0 65 0 11 4 15 respectively generally exposure to arsenic and nitrate via groundwater depicts that children were at greater risk followed by women and men gold mining was also one of the proposed causes of elevated arsenic concentrations in the northern part of the plain it can be concluded that in addition to the specific geology of the study area that has led to high concentrations of arsenic in the plain the spatial distribution of arsenic revealed an increase in the northern part of the region that may be due to the presence of gold mine keywords groundwater chahardoli plain arsenic nitrate health risk 1 introduction water is a significant source for humans particularly for drinking and irrigation it is reported that 80 of the diseases in the world derive from the poor quality of drinking water qasemi et al 2019 the demand for water is increasing extremely due to the expansion of industry and agriculture as well as rapid urbanization and overall growth of the world s population people depend on surface water sometimes supplied from reservoirs and private wells to support their water needs bouaroudj et al 2019 groundwater is considered one of the biggest sources of water supply for different uses such as drinking irrigation industrial and municipal uses in iran contamination of groundwater by human activities is a gradual and hazardous process of negative effects this groundwater contamination is a hidden and intricate procedure with some long period impacts the monitoring control and prevention of groundwater contamination are crucial since remediation of groundwater contamination can include very expensive methods sidibe and xueyu 2018 many factors such as climate circulation of groundwater through rock types topography soil type intrusion of saline water in coastal areas human activities on the ground and so on show various effects on the groundwater quality shakerkhatibi et al 2019 human activities such as agricultural activities application of fertilizers wastewater application and urbanization may lead to produce several types of pollutants which impact adversely groundwater quality nitrate heavy metals and metalloids are considered the most prevalent hazardous pollutants in groundwater and pose an environmental threat salman et al 2019 groundwater pollution with nitrate as a common worldwide problem is a current subject in scientific studies and water planning associations nitrate pollution mainly originated by the intensive use of synthetic and organic fertilizers and wastewater discharges hern√°ndez del amo et al 2018 nitrate is an important parameter for evaluating groundwater pollution from diffuse sources and has been applied as a surrogate indicator to determine the vulnerability of ground water resources to contamination fabro et al 2015 environmental protection agency epa has established maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mg l for nitrate n form no3 n and 50 mg l when reported in the nitrate form no3 us epa 2000 high nitrate concentrations in water can cause many health problems such as methemo globinemia or blue baby syndrome and increase the incidence rates of gastric cancer lymphoma colorectal cancer and other types of cancers huang et al 2011 nitrate levels above the standard limits are of concern especially for pregnant women infants and children qasemi et al 2018b also elevated nitrate level in groundwater results in algal blooms and eutrophication in the surface water sources and it is considered as one of the greatest threats to aquatic ecology kumar et al 2014 owing to the high stability and solubility of nitrate it is a common contaminant in groundwater and surface resources in many areas of iran kamarehie et al 2019 arsenic pollution in groundwater is a great public health problem in several parts of the globe for the last few decades the 105 countries in the world with 200 million people have been exposed to arsenic at concentration greater than the world health organization who guideline value of as of 10 Œºg l chakraborti et al 2016 groundwater arsenic is often related with geologic sources most people of the india and in various parts of the world countries like chile taiwan bangladesh mexico germany thailand and parts of china are being highly affected because of exposure to arsenic through the consumption of groundwater samal et al 2011 mukherjee et al 2011 hoque et al 2011 arsenic are also flagged as a class i human carcinogen based on classification by the agency of research on cancer iarc martinez et al 2011 acute arsenic exposure may be associated with vomiting nausea diarrhea liver toxicity and acute kidney damage hunt et al 2014 arsenicosis or chronic arsenic toxicity is generally described by the classical dermal stigmata and internal disorders such as liver damage in the presence of determined arsenic exposure mandal et al 2017 long term exposure to arsenic may also cause hyperkeratosis malignant melanoma peripheral nervous system disorders cardiovascular problems and cancer the united state environmental protection agency usepa and the world health organization who maximum contaminant levels mcls for arsenic in drinking water is 50 Œºg l and 10 Œºg l respectively saleh et al 2018 change of the quality of groundwater due to mismanagement of groundwater extraction is one of the key issues degradation of ground waters in order to maintain the quality of groundwater it is important to know the spatial and temporal distribution of the quality factors therefore one time identification and mapping water quality changes by observational and traditional methods is a hard work time consuming and costly in this regard geostatistical methods are one of the advanced techniques used for zoning of groundwater quality geostatistical methods are used to determine unknown values of variables and as methods that reducing the costs by reducing the sampling meanwhile these methods can significantly increase the estimation accuracy there were several methods for interpolation includes inverse distance weighting idw kriging method interpolating polynomials radial basis functions rbf and splines these techniques are commonly used to demonstrate and interpolate spatial variation the ordinary kriging is the most commonly used geostatistical estimation groundwater quality maps are applied as a guide for the classify of the locations that are at the threat of contamination of heavy metals uddin et al 2018 various studies have used geostatistical methods for assessment of groundwater contamination with arsenic and nitrate ravenscroft et al 2001 gaus et al 2003 liu et al 2004 hossain et al 2005 lee et al 2007 shamsudduha et al 2009 mosaferi et al 2017 ventura houle et al 2018 therefore the present research was undertaken to i determine the baseline concentration of arsenic and nitrate in groundwater ii evaluate spatial distribution of ground water arsenic and nitrate concentrations and iii comparing the results with who and epa prescribed standard 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area chahardoli plain of qorveh is located in the kurdistan province in western iran between 34 52 and 35 12 north latitude and 47 52 and 48 48 east longitude the total area of this plain is about 340 sq km the east and southwest of the plain are surrounded by mountains the highest elevation is in the highlands up to 2200 m and the lowest elevation in the plain is about 1800 m above the sea level the area is characterized by annual rainfall of 360 mm and average annual temperature 12 c the plain consists of quaternary foothills sediments the main geological zones of iran are sanandaj sirjan central iran loot nehbandan makran kopedaq and alborz except a small part of the kurdistan province that locates within the zagros folded belt most of the province belongs to the terminal part of sanandaj sirjan zone the part of zagros is mostly composed of thick red radiolarite and biston limestone with triassic to upper cretaceous age sanandaj sirjan zone as the main one within the study area is an intercontinental rift zone in which thick sequence of volcano sedimentary rocks are accumulated nasrabadi and shirani bidabadi 2013 chahardoli plain of qorveh is an area with agricultural potential therefore most of the people get their income from agriculture and to some extent livestock farming agriculture is the main human activity in the study area wheat barley potato canola and fodder corn are the most important agricultural products produced in the plain the inappropriate or excessive of fertilizers that contain nutrients such as nitrogen are applied to increase production in the agricultural crops these activities may be as the major sources of pollution in the study area 2 2 groundwater sampling total of 94 groundwater samples were collected from wells in the study area as presented in fig 1 during july of 2012 wells were pumped out at least 15 min before the start of the sample collection the sampling bottles were completely washed with clean water and detergent and rinsed with distilled water at the time of sample collection containers were washed three times with the well water before samples collection groundwater samples for nitrate and arsenic were collected in two separate polyethylene bottles who 1997 one set contained no preservative and was applied for the nitrate determination the other samples for arsenic analysis were acidified with hno3 1 ml per 250 ml sample in order to preventing precipitation of the arsenic after collection all groundwater samples were placed in an ice box before transported to the laboratory also information such as well depth type of crop fertilizer consumption rate fertilizer type area under cultivation and the level of pesticide use have also been taken the locations of sampling points were recorded by global positioning system gps in the laboratory nitrate concentration was measured by using spectrophotometric techniques and the concentrations of arsenic were determined using hydride generator atomic absorption spectrometer hg aas polya and watts 2017 2 3 geostatistical analysis geostatistics includes a series of statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze and estimate the variable values that distributed in a continuous form in space or time this estimation could compensate or replace for the not enough data from maps fabro et al 2017 2 3 1 variogram analysis the basic tool in geostatistics is the variogram that describes the spatial dependence between near observations the variogram can be described as the half variance of the difference between the attribute values at all points separated by lag distance h variogram is calculated by goovaerts 1998 as follows eq 1 1 Œ≥ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where n h is the number pairs z xi z xi is observed value of the variable x at location i z xi h and z xi h is observed value of variable at distance h from xi a variogram plot can be obtained by computing the variogram at different distances therefore the variogram plot is fitted with a theoretical model such as exponential spherical and gaussian that these fitted models provide information about the spatial structure as well as will be input into for the kriging mcgrath et al 2004 the spherical model is given by eq 2 2 Œ≥ h c 0 c 3 h 2 a h 3 2 a 3 0 h a c 0 c h a the exponential model is given by eq 3 3 Œ≥ h c 0 c 1 e h a the gaussian model is given by eq 4 4 Œ≥ h c 0 c 1 exp h 2 a 2 where c0 is the nugget variance or nugget effect h 0 indicates the measurement error and field variation within the minimum sampling spacing typically the variogram increases with increasing lag distance to near or reach a maximum value or sill c0 c equivalent to the population variance c is the structural variance and a is the spatial range across which the data show spatial correlation 2 3 2 kriging the kriging is the most basic geostatistical technique that provides the best linear unbiased estimation blue for modeling the spatial distribution of a random variable the kriging method is considered to be as an optimal spatial interpolation method to estimate the value of the random variable z x at an unsampled location x0 based on the measured values in linear form liang et al 2018 that can be expressed by the following eq 5 5 z xi i 1 n Œª i z x i in this equation z xi is the estimated value at location xi z xi is the known value at the sampling site xi Œªi is the weights associated with the sampling point xi and n is the number of observations 2 4 noncarcinogenic health risk assessment arsenic enters the human body via several ways including inhalation oral route ingestion and skin absorption however the exposure of human to arsenic via the oral route is significant and other ways have negligible contribution contaminated groundwater ingestion was considered as the only pathway of as exposure for humans ravindra and mor 2019 the target hazard quotient thq and chronic daily intake cdi are methods to evaluate noncarcinogenic risk of heavy metals via contaminated water consumption table 1 the cdi mg kg day of arsenic is calculated according to the recommended model by environmental protection agency usepa using the following eq 6 6 cdi c ir bw where c is the concentration of the arsenic and nitrate in groundwater sample mg l or ¬µg l ir is the daily average intake of water in the area l d and bw indicates the body weight of receptor kg the hq for arsenic and nitrate was estimated by applying the ratio of calculated mean cdi mg kg day to the oral reference dose rfd mg kg day eq 7 if the ratio is less than 1 the exposed population is unlikely to experience obvious adverse effects 7 thq cdi rfd rfd used in this research for arsenic and nitrate were 1 6 mg kg day and 3 2 ¬µg kg day respectively the scale of target hazard quotient thq according to chronic daily intake cdi and reference dose mg kg day is categorized based on the ratio of cdi rfd indicating 1 no risk if 1 5 low risk if 5 10 medium risk if 10 high risk 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis of data was performed by spss v 22 and exel software 2007 the descriptive statistics of nitrate and arsenic including mean minimum maximum and coefficients of variation were calculated before each statistical test the normality of the data was first checked a probability value of 0 05 was considered statistically significant in this study moreover in order to determine the arsenic and nitrate distributions and to produce their maps kriging interpolation method that is one of the spatial analysis tools of geographical information system gis software arcgis 10 3 was applied for comparison of nitrate and arsenic levels with who guidelines one sample t test was used non parametric tests of kruskal wallis and mann whitney were applied to compare arsenic and nitrate concentrations for all the different villages 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater nitrate and arsenic concentration 3 1 1 nitrate the results of groundwater analysis for nitrate are shown in table 2 the nitrate in groundwater of study area varies from 3 20 m to 428 00 mg l with the mean value of 152 95 115 49 mg l there were 73 of groundwater samples among the total analyzed samples n 94 that exceeded the world health organization who standard of 50 mg l therefore the status of nitrate contamination in groundwater of the chahardoli plain was very hazardous and groundwater resources were not appropriate for drinking without chemical treatment also the institute of standards and industrial research of iran isiri has recommended the maximum allowable value of 50 mg l for nitrate isiri 2009 groundwater nitrate concentrations were significantly higher than the who standard table 3 the high levels of nitrate are always associated with anthropogenic sources fertilizer human and animal waste are the main sources of nitrate in groundwater because it is highly soluble in water nitrate was found as the main anionic species in both agricultural and urban areas ako et al 2014 the presence of nitrate at high level in the groundwater can be an indirect indicator of the presence of other contaminants originated from human activities elisante and muzuka 2017 a large coefficient of variation cv value of nitrate 75 5 in table 2 is indicating its high variability in the study area the high variability in no 3 probably resulted from application of fertilizers in the study region the nitrate levels in groundwater in regions that inorganic nitrogen fertilizers are applied may contain 1000 mg l snook 2014 based on the classification presented by adimalla 2020 the groundwater nitrate pollution can be classified into three categories include low health risk when nitrate concentration is lower than 45 mg l high health risk when nitrate concentrations in between 46 and 100 mg l and very high health risk when greater than 100 mg l according to this classification 23 groundwater have low health risk in terms of nitrate and 14 observed to be in the high health risk class while 63 percent fell in the very high health risk class based on the dwaf 1996 the concentrations of nitrate greater than 10 mg l can cause blue baby syndrome or methaemoglobinaemia in infants and can also lead to the occurrence of mucous membrane irritation in adults if it is higher than 20 mg l the nitrate concentrations obtained in the present research were much higher than other studies such as hu et al 2005 singh and singh 2018 ahada and suthar 2018 zhang et al 2018 cheong et al 2012 esmaeili et al 2018 fabro et al 2015 dash et al 2010 he and wu 2019 qasemi et al 2018a wu et al 2019 and qasemi et al 2020 table 4 in the study of samantara et al 2015 in the groundwater of kalpakkam tamil nadu india nitrate level in 57 of samples exceeded the standard limit for drinking prescribed by the who and bureau of indian standards bis the anthropogenic sources of nitrate contamination in groundwater are generally fertilizer and domestic waste nitrate has a high solubility in water and is very stable over a wide range of environmental conditions that means that it seldom combines with other substance nitrate does not bind to the soil particles like other water contaminants but readily leaches into groundwater via the soil hence nitrate will move with groundwater for some distance even many kilometers from its potential source and remain for years after its initial infiltration goni et al 2019 3 1 2 arsenic the arsenic concentration values observed in groundwater samples ranged from 0 39 to 220 82 Œºg l 1 as presented in table 2 more than half of the samples 56 samples 59 samples were than the recommended level of who 10 Œºg l 1 for drinking water also the limit of 10 Œºg l of arsenic in water was established by the institute of standards and industrial research of iran siri isiri 2009 groundwater arsenic concentrations were significantly higher than the who standard table 3 arsenic contaminated groundwater is found in many countries around the world including bangladesh chile argentina india china taiwan vietnam mexico romania and parts of the usa arsenic concentrations in groundwater of these areas have been reported from 100 to 2 000 ¬µg l jiang 2001 arsenic is naturally present at high concentrations in the groundwater of many provinces of iran east azerbaijan hashtrood west azerbaijan takab sistan and baluchistan khash fars groundwater near lake maharloo khorasan razavi kashmar and kurdistan gorveh and bijar provinces have been reported as the districts suffering from arsenic contamination in groundwater alidadi et al 2015 in some areas of kurdistan province iran there was the problem of arsenic contamination chronic poisoning manifestations such as pigmentation keratosis skin lesions and even amputation due to gangrene have been reported the first cases of chronic arsenic poisoning results from drinking water were recognized in 1981 there are some villages with arsenic in water supplies exceeding 1000 ¬µg l with a mean level of 290 ¬µg l mosaferi et al 2003 mukherjee et al 2006 arsenic at a concentration of 50 ¬µg l in drinking water may cause skin lesions however observations in the bangladeshi and indian peoples show that the probability of dermal effects is very high if arsenic concentrations above 300 Œºg l at few years time chakraborti et al 2018 in the study from gangetic basin india kumar et al 2019 as level in groundwater was observed to be in the range of 1 36 Œºg l mean 9 Œºg l in a study in groundwater of patna district india the as concentrations were above the who limit of 10 mg l in 61 hand tube wells and above 50 mg l the acceptable limit of many developing countries in 44 of samples chakraborti et al 2016 these findings from other studies are consistent with the results of the present study the main source of the arsenic pollution more than 90 can be attributed to geogenic origin shajia et al 2020 in previous study in part of the our stud area nasrabadi and shirani bidabadi 2013 evaluated the spatial distribution of quantitative risk and hazard level of arsenic exposure in groundwater of qorveh county in iran and concluded the existence of volcanic activities in the upper miocene and pleistocene was the main geopogenic source of arsenic pollution in iran the arsenic pollution in water resources has been studied in recent years arsenic contamination was evaluated by mosaferi et al 2008 in groundwater from 210 villages of east azerbaijan province the concentration of arsenic was from 0 to 500 ¬µg l that the reason for the high level of arsenic in these villages were due to the structure and quality geological of the region rahnamarad et al 2020 observed arsenic concentrations in groundwater of rafsanjan plain iran ranged from 4 to 278 Œºg l with a mean value of 59 Œºg l arsenic concentrations in 85 3 of water samples were higher than 10 Œºg l provided by the who guideline compared with other studies table 4 the nitrate concentration in the study area was higher than those observed in japan mukherjee et al 2006 new zealand robinson et al 2006 southwest england nriagu et al 2007 australia mukherjee et al 2006 india singh and singh 2018 iran barzegar et al 2015 however it was lower than those reported in vietnam berg et al 2007 the high arsenic concentrations in groundwater of study area shows that population s health might be affected from exposure to arsenic contamination 3 2 village the statistics of nitrate concentration in all the twenty two villages of chahardoli plain are given in table 5 the highest mean concentration of nitrate was observed at zanagabad dashkasan and hasan abad over 300 mg l the highest and lowest nitrate concentrations are obtained in zanagabad and garmekhani villages with 320 23 and 7 12 mg l respectively the difference in nitrate concentration at various villages could be related to the fertilizer application rates type of cultivation rainfall intensity groundwater depth irrigated or rainfed cultivation and etc the groundwater arsenic concentrations in samples from different villages were indicated in table 5 as it is observed the highest concentrations of arsenic belong to villages of zanagabad qujaq and delbaran whilst other villages indicate lower concentrations the findings indicated significant differences in nitrate and arsenic concentrations for the groundwater samples collected from the different villages p 0 05 the signs of water pollution and complications of chronic poisoning were observed in people belonging to these villages comparing the arsenic levels in the groundwater of villages with the maximum permissible limits 10 ¬µg l by the who showed that except for the groundwater samples from garmekhani ghasem abad hajji abad galali shahabodin and sutapeh the average concentration of arsenic in all other villages was higher than the this limit also for nitrate only two villages ghasem abad and garmekhani have mean concentrations lower than the who limit 50 mg l the results of barati et al 2010 indicated that the people who lived longer in the village with arsenic contamination in drinking water were at a higher risk of having multi chronic arsenical poisoning and residents who were exposed to higher concentrations of arsenic in drinking water were also of a higher risk of developing multi chronic arsenical poisoning in general based on nitrate concentration groundwater have been divided into three groups 1 very polluted water no3 45 mg l 2 polluted water no3 between 20 and 45 mg l and 3 slightly polluted water no3 20 mg l miranzadeh et al 2006 according to this classification three villages ghasem abad garmekhani and gandab had no3 20 mg l that slightly polluted and other villages had no3 45 mg l that very polluted water as the results of the present research indicated the concentrations of nitrate and arsenic in some of the studied village areas were higher in comparison to most recent studies nitrate and arsenic concentrations can be related to natural processes such as geology of the study area and many human activities such as cultivation fertilizers agricultural activities and discharge of sewage into absorbing wells 3 3 health risk the cdi chronic daily intake data was applied to estimate individual daily exposure of nitrate and arsenic table 6 indicates the cdi and the hq of nitrate and arsenic for the groundwater from the study villages the average cdi mg kg day values for nitrate in men women and children was 3 92 4 71 and 10 respectively the cdi ranges of nitrate for men women and children were 0 18 8 21 mg kg day 0 22 9 8 mg kg day and 0 49 22 09 mg kg day respectively the average cdi mg kg day values for arsenic in men women and children was 0 77 0 93 and 2 08respectively the ranges of cdi values of arsenic for men women and children were 0 12 4 94 mg kg day 0 15 5 93 mg kg day and 0 33 13 29 mg kg day respectively also computed hqs of nitrate and arsenic in the groundwater for three age groups were presented in the table 6 the mean values of hq for the measured nitrate concentrations for men women and children were 2 45 0 11 5 13 2 94 0 14 6 16 and 6 59 0 31 13 73 respectively for arsenic the mean values of hq for a men women and children were 0 24 0 04 1 54 0 29 0 05 1 85 and 0 65 0 11 4 15 respectively generally exposure to arsenic and nitrate via groundwater was in the following order children women men nitrate indicate hq 1 0 for three groups shows the potential of an adverse effect to human health therefore the health risk of nitrate indicated the hq values suggesting an unacceptable noncarcinogenic health risk but in the case of arsenic hq values showed an acceptable noncarcinogenic health risk our results demonstrated that children face a greater risk than adults because of their smaller body weight zhai et al 2017 li et al 2019 aso children are at high risk of suffering health consequences of environmental pollutants such as drinking water contaminants because they continue to develop both behaviorally and physiologically throughout childhood same studies have also disclosed the similar findings li et al 2019 he and wu 2019 zhai et al 2017 the obtained results of cdi and hq in this study showed that level of the human health risk for women is a little higher than that for men this result is the same with the zhai et al 2017 and li et al 2016 residents around the world especially people in the agricultural districts are facing higher noncarcinogenic exposure risk of nitrate as fertilization of agriculture is the most common source of nitrate in groundwater contamination li et al 2019 similar studies in other parts of the world were performed about human health risk assessment of arsenic and nitrate groundwater pollution rezaei et al 2018 evaluated health risk assessment related to the fluoride nitrate and nitrite in the drinking water in the sanandaj kurdistan county of iran their results showed that the mean values of cdi for the men women and children were 0 4258 0 5110 and 1 1454 mg kg day respectively the findings of this research indicated that the hq for three groups were above the one hq 1 and exposed to nitrate risks in the research conducted by li et al 2019 regarding the health risks due to nitrate ingestion through drinking water of yan an city on the loess plateau of northwest china they were observed that for the all study research the average hq values for adults and children were 2 25 and 3 97 respectively and approximately 47 2 of the sampling sites showed hq greater than 1 also the outcome of this research is partly in line with the study by qasemi et al 2018b that their results showed hq values of nitrate for 41 of children and infants were above the safety level hq 1 and concluded that the groundwater nitrate have significant health effects on these age groups liang et al 2018 surveyed the health risk associated with as groundwater of the lanyang plain taiwan and found that 34 of the people had access to groundwater where the hq was 1 also the findings rasool et al 2016 in punjab state pakistan indicated that the average values of hq were higher than 1 and health impacts of chronic arsenic exposure arisen via consumption of groundwater in the study of singh and ghosh 2012 in patna district india the health risk assessment of arsenic groundwater showed that hq values exceeded the typical toxic risk index value of 1 in the study conducted by sadler et al 2016 in drinking water from village wells in semarang indonesia result showed the hq values as evaluated against who guideline values at 50 95 percentile points were hq50 at 0 42 and hq95 at 1 2 respectively 3 4 spatial distribution of nitrate and arsenic 3 4 1 nitrate in this research the effective range for nitrate was estimated 2 2 km nitrate seen in table 7 co co c showed moderate dependency with 0 60 this can be related to the extrinsic and intrinsic factors the experimental variogram of nitrate in groundwater was best fitted by a spherical model the spatial distribution of the nitrate concentrations for chahardoli plain is shown in fig 2 the spatial distribution map of nitrate inferred high nitrate levels in the northeast southeast and the center of the study area which from the west and east there was increasing trend toward the center may be relate to the use of fertilizer in agricultural lands the center parts of the plain are intensively applied for agricultural practices 3 4 2 arsenic to investigate the spatial structure of arsenic concentration the variogram was calculated and the corresponding curve plotted and then a spherical model was fitted table 7 shows the various parameters of the variogram for arsenic in the study area the effective range r is the distance where the variogram reaches 95 of the sill and data exhibit spatial correlation in this study the effective range for arsenic was estimated 3 5 km the ratio ofco co c can be used to classifying the spatial dependence of groundwater quality variables if this ratio is less than 0 25 show strong spatial dependence between 0 25 and 0 75 the variable show moderate spatial dependence and if it is greater than 0 75 the variables indicate a weak spatial dependence as seen in table 7 a high ratio ofco co c shows the weak spatial dependence of arsenic this can be related to geology of study area the experimental variogram of arsenic concentrations in groundwater was best fitted by a spherical model fig 3 showed the spatial distribution of arsenic concentration in the groundwater of chahardoli plain based on this map the highest arsenic values were observed in the northern part of the region and lowest in the western part of the study area also in this map arsenic concentration did not follow the homogenous pattern and varied in different parts of the plain the highest arsenic concentrations in the northern study area may be due to the presence of dashkasan au mine which increased arsenic entry into the groundwater it could be the main geogenic source of this element in the region dashkasan au mine sari gunay is the largest known epithermal gold deposit in iran moore et al 2016 other studies reported that the groundwater in a gold mining area has been polluted by arsenic borba et al 2003 barzegar et al 2015 concluded that the arsenic in the groundwater of tabriz plain aquifer iran could be originated from geological formations such as alluvial tuffs of sahand mountain 4 conclusions the results of this study showed that the mean concentrations of arsenic in groundwater samples in the chahardooli plain were higher than the who guidelines 10 Œºg l also the spatial distribution map of showed that the arsenic concentration in most parts of the plain was higher than the maximum permissible level in drinking water gold mining was also one of the proposed causes of elevated arsenic concentrations in the northern part of the plain generally it can be concluded that in addition to the specific geology of the study area that has led to high concentrations of arsenic in the plain anthropogenic factors have also influenced the arsenic concentrations therefore as this water is used for agricultural and livestock purposes and in some cases groundwater is used for drinking it is necessary to use a suitable and efficient method to remove arsenic from water groundwater in the study area showed elevated levels of nitrates which 73 of samples contained nitrate concentrations exceeding the who standard 50 mg g the results of this research showed that three groups men women and children were exposed to nitrate contact from groundwater with hq 1 the findings showed that the values of hq were highest in the children group so they are at high risk therefore there is an essential need to design further studies for determine the main sources and factors affecting nitrate and arsenic groundwater contamination also continuous monitoring and awareness raising to native communities about its health effects of these pollutants must be prioritized further studies should be conducted to clearly assess sources and geochemical processes of groundwater arsenic enrichment in chahardooli plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this research was supported by malayer university of iran 
9988,groundwater is an important source for domestic drinking agriculture and industrial activities however arsenic and nitrate contamination in groundwater are major world problem and public health concern this research aimed to evaluate the concentration and spatial distribution of arsenic and nitrate in groundwater of 22 cultivated villages of chahardoli plain of iran by geostatistical techniques and their possible health hazards in local residents a total of 94 groundwater samples were collected from wells in agriculture areas and analyze for arsenic and nitrate concentrations geostatistical analysis and health risk assessment model were applied to investigate spatial distribution and associated health risks of arsenic and nitrate in groundwater of the study area the levels of nitrate in groundwater had a range of 3 20 428 00 mg l with the mean value of 152 95 115 49 Œºg l nitrate concentration in 73 of samples exceeded the world health organization who acceptable limits of 50 mg l arsenic as was found in groundwater which ranged from 0 39 to 220 82 Œºg l mean 30 16 Œºg l and exceeded the who recommended level 10 Œºg l for 59 of the groundwater samples the health risk of nitrate indicated the hazard quotient hq values suggesting an unacceptable noncarcinogenic health risk for arsenic the mean values of hq for a men women and children were 0 24 0 04 1 54 0 29 0 05 1 85 and 0 65 0 11 4 15 respectively generally exposure to arsenic and nitrate via groundwater depicts that children were at greater risk followed by women and men gold mining was also one of the proposed causes of elevated arsenic concentrations in the northern part of the plain it can be concluded that in addition to the specific geology of the study area that has led to high concentrations of arsenic in the plain the spatial distribution of arsenic revealed an increase in the northern part of the region that may be due to the presence of gold mine keywords groundwater chahardoli plain arsenic nitrate health risk 1 introduction water is a significant source for humans particularly for drinking and irrigation it is reported that 80 of the diseases in the world derive from the poor quality of drinking water qasemi et al 2019 the demand for water is increasing extremely due to the expansion of industry and agriculture as well as rapid urbanization and overall growth of the world s population people depend on surface water sometimes supplied from reservoirs and private wells to support their water needs bouaroudj et al 2019 groundwater is considered one of the biggest sources of water supply for different uses such as drinking irrigation industrial and municipal uses in iran contamination of groundwater by human activities is a gradual and hazardous process of negative effects this groundwater contamination is a hidden and intricate procedure with some long period impacts the monitoring control and prevention of groundwater contamination are crucial since remediation of groundwater contamination can include very expensive methods sidibe and xueyu 2018 many factors such as climate circulation of groundwater through rock types topography soil type intrusion of saline water in coastal areas human activities on the ground and so on show various effects on the groundwater quality shakerkhatibi et al 2019 human activities such as agricultural activities application of fertilizers wastewater application and urbanization may lead to produce several types of pollutants which impact adversely groundwater quality nitrate heavy metals and metalloids are considered the most prevalent hazardous pollutants in groundwater and pose an environmental threat salman et al 2019 groundwater pollution with nitrate as a common worldwide problem is a current subject in scientific studies and water planning associations nitrate pollution mainly originated by the intensive use of synthetic and organic fertilizers and wastewater discharges hern√°ndez del amo et al 2018 nitrate is an important parameter for evaluating groundwater pollution from diffuse sources and has been applied as a surrogate indicator to determine the vulnerability of ground water resources to contamination fabro et al 2015 environmental protection agency epa has established maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mg l for nitrate n form no3 n and 50 mg l when reported in the nitrate form no3 us epa 2000 high nitrate concentrations in water can cause many health problems such as methemo globinemia or blue baby syndrome and increase the incidence rates of gastric cancer lymphoma colorectal cancer and other types of cancers huang et al 2011 nitrate levels above the standard limits are of concern especially for pregnant women infants and children qasemi et al 2018b also elevated nitrate level in groundwater results in algal blooms and eutrophication in the surface water sources and it is considered as one of the greatest threats to aquatic ecology kumar et al 2014 owing to the high stability and solubility of nitrate it is a common contaminant in groundwater and surface resources in many areas of iran kamarehie et al 2019 arsenic pollution in groundwater is a great public health problem in several parts of the globe for the last few decades the 105 countries in the world with 200 million people have been exposed to arsenic at concentration greater than the world health organization who guideline value of as of 10 Œºg l chakraborti et al 2016 groundwater arsenic is often related with geologic sources most people of the india and in various parts of the world countries like chile taiwan bangladesh mexico germany thailand and parts of china are being highly affected because of exposure to arsenic through the consumption of groundwater samal et al 2011 mukherjee et al 2011 hoque et al 2011 arsenic are also flagged as a class i human carcinogen based on classification by the agency of research on cancer iarc martinez et al 2011 acute arsenic exposure may be associated with vomiting nausea diarrhea liver toxicity and acute kidney damage hunt et al 2014 arsenicosis or chronic arsenic toxicity is generally described by the classical dermal stigmata and internal disorders such as liver damage in the presence of determined arsenic exposure mandal et al 2017 long term exposure to arsenic may also cause hyperkeratosis malignant melanoma peripheral nervous system disorders cardiovascular problems and cancer the united state environmental protection agency usepa and the world health organization who maximum contaminant levels mcls for arsenic in drinking water is 50 Œºg l and 10 Œºg l respectively saleh et al 2018 change of the quality of groundwater due to mismanagement of groundwater extraction is one of the key issues degradation of ground waters in order to maintain the quality of groundwater it is important to know the spatial and temporal distribution of the quality factors therefore one time identification and mapping water quality changes by observational and traditional methods is a hard work time consuming and costly in this regard geostatistical methods are one of the advanced techniques used for zoning of groundwater quality geostatistical methods are used to determine unknown values of variables and as methods that reducing the costs by reducing the sampling meanwhile these methods can significantly increase the estimation accuracy there were several methods for interpolation includes inverse distance weighting idw kriging method interpolating polynomials radial basis functions rbf and splines these techniques are commonly used to demonstrate and interpolate spatial variation the ordinary kriging is the most commonly used geostatistical estimation groundwater quality maps are applied as a guide for the classify of the locations that are at the threat of contamination of heavy metals uddin et al 2018 various studies have used geostatistical methods for assessment of groundwater contamination with arsenic and nitrate ravenscroft et al 2001 gaus et al 2003 liu et al 2004 hossain et al 2005 lee et al 2007 shamsudduha et al 2009 mosaferi et al 2017 ventura houle et al 2018 therefore the present research was undertaken to i determine the baseline concentration of arsenic and nitrate in groundwater ii evaluate spatial distribution of ground water arsenic and nitrate concentrations and iii comparing the results with who and epa prescribed standard 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area chahardoli plain of qorveh is located in the kurdistan province in western iran between 34 52 and 35 12 north latitude and 47 52 and 48 48 east longitude the total area of this plain is about 340 sq km the east and southwest of the plain are surrounded by mountains the highest elevation is in the highlands up to 2200 m and the lowest elevation in the plain is about 1800 m above the sea level the area is characterized by annual rainfall of 360 mm and average annual temperature 12 c the plain consists of quaternary foothills sediments the main geological zones of iran are sanandaj sirjan central iran loot nehbandan makran kopedaq and alborz except a small part of the kurdistan province that locates within the zagros folded belt most of the province belongs to the terminal part of sanandaj sirjan zone the part of zagros is mostly composed of thick red radiolarite and biston limestone with triassic to upper cretaceous age sanandaj sirjan zone as the main one within the study area is an intercontinental rift zone in which thick sequence of volcano sedimentary rocks are accumulated nasrabadi and shirani bidabadi 2013 chahardoli plain of qorveh is an area with agricultural potential therefore most of the people get their income from agriculture and to some extent livestock farming agriculture is the main human activity in the study area wheat barley potato canola and fodder corn are the most important agricultural products produced in the plain the inappropriate or excessive of fertilizers that contain nutrients such as nitrogen are applied to increase production in the agricultural crops these activities may be as the major sources of pollution in the study area 2 2 groundwater sampling total of 94 groundwater samples were collected from wells in the study area as presented in fig 1 during july of 2012 wells were pumped out at least 15 min before the start of the sample collection the sampling bottles were completely washed with clean water and detergent and rinsed with distilled water at the time of sample collection containers were washed three times with the well water before samples collection groundwater samples for nitrate and arsenic were collected in two separate polyethylene bottles who 1997 one set contained no preservative and was applied for the nitrate determination the other samples for arsenic analysis were acidified with hno3 1 ml per 250 ml sample in order to preventing precipitation of the arsenic after collection all groundwater samples were placed in an ice box before transported to the laboratory also information such as well depth type of crop fertilizer consumption rate fertilizer type area under cultivation and the level of pesticide use have also been taken the locations of sampling points were recorded by global positioning system gps in the laboratory nitrate concentration was measured by using spectrophotometric techniques and the concentrations of arsenic were determined using hydride generator atomic absorption spectrometer hg aas polya and watts 2017 2 3 geostatistical analysis geostatistics includes a series of statistical and mathematical techniques to analyze and estimate the variable values that distributed in a continuous form in space or time this estimation could compensate or replace for the not enough data from maps fabro et al 2017 2 3 1 variogram analysis the basic tool in geostatistics is the variogram that describes the spatial dependence between near observations the variogram can be described as the half variance of the difference between the attribute values at all points separated by lag distance h variogram is calculated by goovaerts 1998 as follows eq 1 1 Œ≥ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where n h is the number pairs z xi z xi is observed value of the variable x at location i z xi h and z xi h is observed value of variable at distance h from xi a variogram plot can be obtained by computing the variogram at different distances therefore the variogram plot is fitted with a theoretical model such as exponential spherical and gaussian that these fitted models provide information about the spatial structure as well as will be input into for the kriging mcgrath et al 2004 the spherical model is given by eq 2 2 Œ≥ h c 0 c 3 h 2 a h 3 2 a 3 0 h a c 0 c h a the exponential model is given by eq 3 3 Œ≥ h c 0 c 1 e h a the gaussian model is given by eq 4 4 Œ≥ h c 0 c 1 exp h 2 a 2 where c0 is the nugget variance or nugget effect h 0 indicates the measurement error and field variation within the minimum sampling spacing typically the variogram increases with increasing lag distance to near or reach a maximum value or sill c0 c equivalent to the population variance c is the structural variance and a is the spatial range across which the data show spatial correlation 2 3 2 kriging the kriging is the most basic geostatistical technique that provides the best linear unbiased estimation blue for modeling the spatial distribution of a random variable the kriging method is considered to be as an optimal spatial interpolation method to estimate the value of the random variable z x at an unsampled location x0 based on the measured values in linear form liang et al 2018 that can be expressed by the following eq 5 5 z xi i 1 n Œª i z x i in this equation z xi is the estimated value at location xi z xi is the known value at the sampling site xi Œªi is the weights associated with the sampling point xi and n is the number of observations 2 4 noncarcinogenic health risk assessment arsenic enters the human body via several ways including inhalation oral route ingestion and skin absorption however the exposure of human to arsenic via the oral route is significant and other ways have negligible contribution contaminated groundwater ingestion was considered as the only pathway of as exposure for humans ravindra and mor 2019 the target hazard quotient thq and chronic daily intake cdi are methods to evaluate noncarcinogenic risk of heavy metals via contaminated water consumption table 1 the cdi mg kg day of arsenic is calculated according to the recommended model by environmental protection agency usepa using the following eq 6 6 cdi c ir bw where c is the concentration of the arsenic and nitrate in groundwater sample mg l or ¬µg l ir is the daily average intake of water in the area l d and bw indicates the body weight of receptor kg the hq for arsenic and nitrate was estimated by applying the ratio of calculated mean cdi mg kg day to the oral reference dose rfd mg kg day eq 7 if the ratio is less than 1 the exposed population is unlikely to experience obvious adverse effects 7 thq cdi rfd rfd used in this research for arsenic and nitrate were 1 6 mg kg day and 3 2 ¬µg kg day respectively the scale of target hazard quotient thq according to chronic daily intake cdi and reference dose mg kg day is categorized based on the ratio of cdi rfd indicating 1 no risk if 1 5 low risk if 5 10 medium risk if 10 high risk 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis of data was performed by spss v 22 and exel software 2007 the descriptive statistics of nitrate and arsenic including mean minimum maximum and coefficients of variation were calculated before each statistical test the normality of the data was first checked a probability value of 0 05 was considered statistically significant in this study moreover in order to determine the arsenic and nitrate distributions and to produce their maps kriging interpolation method that is one of the spatial analysis tools of geographical information system gis software arcgis 10 3 was applied for comparison of nitrate and arsenic levels with who guidelines one sample t test was used non parametric tests of kruskal wallis and mann whitney were applied to compare arsenic and nitrate concentrations for all the different villages 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater nitrate and arsenic concentration 3 1 1 nitrate the results of groundwater analysis for nitrate are shown in table 2 the nitrate in groundwater of study area varies from 3 20 m to 428 00 mg l with the mean value of 152 95 115 49 mg l there were 73 of groundwater samples among the total analyzed samples n 94 that exceeded the world health organization who standard of 50 mg l therefore the status of nitrate contamination in groundwater of the chahardoli plain was very hazardous and groundwater resources were not appropriate for drinking without chemical treatment also the institute of standards and industrial research of iran isiri has recommended the maximum allowable value of 50 mg l for nitrate isiri 2009 groundwater nitrate concentrations were significantly higher than the who standard table 3 the high levels of nitrate are always associated with anthropogenic sources fertilizer human and animal waste are the main sources of nitrate in groundwater because it is highly soluble in water nitrate was found as the main anionic species in both agricultural and urban areas ako et al 2014 the presence of nitrate at high level in the groundwater can be an indirect indicator of the presence of other contaminants originated from human activities elisante and muzuka 2017 a large coefficient of variation cv value of nitrate 75 5 in table 2 is indicating its high variability in the study area the high variability in no 3 probably resulted from application of fertilizers in the study region the nitrate levels in groundwater in regions that inorganic nitrogen fertilizers are applied may contain 1000 mg l snook 2014 based on the classification presented by adimalla 2020 the groundwater nitrate pollution can be classified into three categories include low health risk when nitrate concentration is lower than 45 mg l high health risk when nitrate concentrations in between 46 and 100 mg l and very high health risk when greater than 100 mg l according to this classification 23 groundwater have low health risk in terms of nitrate and 14 observed to be in the high health risk class while 63 percent fell in the very high health risk class based on the dwaf 1996 the concentrations of nitrate greater than 10 mg l can cause blue baby syndrome or methaemoglobinaemia in infants and can also lead to the occurrence of mucous membrane irritation in adults if it is higher than 20 mg l the nitrate concentrations obtained in the present research were much higher than other studies such as hu et al 2005 singh and singh 2018 ahada and suthar 2018 zhang et al 2018 cheong et al 2012 esmaeili et al 2018 fabro et al 2015 dash et al 2010 he and wu 2019 qasemi et al 2018a wu et al 2019 and qasemi et al 2020 table 4 in the study of samantara et al 2015 in the groundwater of kalpakkam tamil nadu india nitrate level in 57 of samples exceeded the standard limit for drinking prescribed by the who and bureau of indian standards bis the anthropogenic sources of nitrate contamination in groundwater are generally fertilizer and domestic waste nitrate has a high solubility in water and is very stable over a wide range of environmental conditions that means that it seldom combines with other substance nitrate does not bind to the soil particles like other water contaminants but readily leaches into groundwater via the soil hence nitrate will move with groundwater for some distance even many kilometers from its potential source and remain for years after its initial infiltration goni et al 2019 3 1 2 arsenic the arsenic concentration values observed in groundwater samples ranged from 0 39 to 220 82 Œºg l 1 as presented in table 2 more than half of the samples 56 samples 59 samples were than the recommended level of who 10 Œºg l 1 for drinking water also the limit of 10 Œºg l of arsenic in water was established by the institute of standards and industrial research of iran siri isiri 2009 groundwater arsenic concentrations were significantly higher than the who standard table 3 arsenic contaminated groundwater is found in many countries around the world including bangladesh chile argentina india china taiwan vietnam mexico romania and parts of the usa arsenic concentrations in groundwater of these areas have been reported from 100 to 2 000 ¬µg l jiang 2001 arsenic is naturally present at high concentrations in the groundwater of many provinces of iran east azerbaijan hashtrood west azerbaijan takab sistan and baluchistan khash fars groundwater near lake maharloo khorasan razavi kashmar and kurdistan gorveh and bijar provinces have been reported as the districts suffering from arsenic contamination in groundwater alidadi et al 2015 in some areas of kurdistan province iran there was the problem of arsenic contamination chronic poisoning manifestations such as pigmentation keratosis skin lesions and even amputation due to gangrene have been reported the first cases of chronic arsenic poisoning results from drinking water were recognized in 1981 there are some villages with arsenic in water supplies exceeding 1000 ¬µg l with a mean level of 290 ¬µg l mosaferi et al 2003 mukherjee et al 2006 arsenic at a concentration of 50 ¬µg l in drinking water may cause skin lesions however observations in the bangladeshi and indian peoples show that the probability of dermal effects is very high if arsenic concentrations above 300 Œºg l at few years time chakraborti et al 2018 in the study from gangetic basin india kumar et al 2019 as level in groundwater was observed to be in the range of 1 36 Œºg l mean 9 Œºg l in a study in groundwater of patna district india the as concentrations were above the who limit of 10 mg l in 61 hand tube wells and above 50 mg l the acceptable limit of many developing countries in 44 of samples chakraborti et al 2016 these findings from other studies are consistent with the results of the present study the main source of the arsenic pollution more than 90 can be attributed to geogenic origin shajia et al 2020 in previous study in part of the our stud area nasrabadi and shirani bidabadi 2013 evaluated the spatial distribution of quantitative risk and hazard level of arsenic exposure in groundwater of qorveh county in iran and concluded the existence of volcanic activities in the upper miocene and pleistocene was the main geopogenic source of arsenic pollution in iran the arsenic pollution in water resources has been studied in recent years arsenic contamination was evaluated by mosaferi et al 2008 in groundwater from 210 villages of east azerbaijan province the concentration of arsenic was from 0 to 500 ¬µg l that the reason for the high level of arsenic in these villages were due to the structure and quality geological of the region rahnamarad et al 2020 observed arsenic concentrations in groundwater of rafsanjan plain iran ranged from 4 to 278 Œºg l with a mean value of 59 Œºg l arsenic concentrations in 85 3 of water samples were higher than 10 Œºg l provided by the who guideline compared with other studies table 4 the nitrate concentration in the study area was higher than those observed in japan mukherjee et al 2006 new zealand robinson et al 2006 southwest england nriagu et al 2007 australia mukherjee et al 2006 india singh and singh 2018 iran barzegar et al 2015 however it was lower than those reported in vietnam berg et al 2007 the high arsenic concentrations in groundwater of study area shows that population s health might be affected from exposure to arsenic contamination 3 2 village the statistics of nitrate concentration in all the twenty two villages of chahardoli plain are given in table 5 the highest mean concentration of nitrate was observed at zanagabad dashkasan and hasan abad over 300 mg l the highest and lowest nitrate concentrations are obtained in zanagabad and garmekhani villages with 320 23 and 7 12 mg l respectively the difference in nitrate concentration at various villages could be related to the fertilizer application rates type of cultivation rainfall intensity groundwater depth irrigated or rainfed cultivation and etc the groundwater arsenic concentrations in samples from different villages were indicated in table 5 as it is observed the highest concentrations of arsenic belong to villages of zanagabad qujaq and delbaran whilst other villages indicate lower concentrations the findings indicated significant differences in nitrate and arsenic concentrations for the groundwater samples collected from the different villages p 0 05 the signs of water pollution and complications of chronic poisoning were observed in people belonging to these villages comparing the arsenic levels in the groundwater of villages with the maximum permissible limits 10 ¬µg l by the who showed that except for the groundwater samples from garmekhani ghasem abad hajji abad galali shahabodin and sutapeh the average concentration of arsenic in all other villages was higher than the this limit also for nitrate only two villages ghasem abad and garmekhani have mean concentrations lower than the who limit 50 mg l the results of barati et al 2010 indicated that the people who lived longer in the village with arsenic contamination in drinking water were at a higher risk of having multi chronic arsenical poisoning and residents who were exposed to higher concentrations of arsenic in drinking water were also of a higher risk of developing multi chronic arsenical poisoning in general based on nitrate concentration groundwater have been divided into three groups 1 very polluted water no3 45 mg l 2 polluted water no3 between 20 and 45 mg l and 3 slightly polluted water no3 20 mg l miranzadeh et al 2006 according to this classification three villages ghasem abad garmekhani and gandab had no3 20 mg l that slightly polluted and other villages had no3 45 mg l that very polluted water as the results of the present research indicated the concentrations of nitrate and arsenic in some of the studied village areas were higher in comparison to most recent studies nitrate and arsenic concentrations can be related to natural processes such as geology of the study area and many human activities such as cultivation fertilizers agricultural activities and discharge of sewage into absorbing wells 3 3 health risk the cdi chronic daily intake data was applied to estimate individual daily exposure of nitrate and arsenic table 6 indicates the cdi and the hq of nitrate and arsenic for the groundwater from the study villages the average cdi mg kg day values for nitrate in men women and children was 3 92 4 71 and 10 respectively the cdi ranges of nitrate for men women and children were 0 18 8 21 mg kg day 0 22 9 8 mg kg day and 0 49 22 09 mg kg day respectively the average cdi mg kg day values for arsenic in men women and children was 0 77 0 93 and 2 08respectively the ranges of cdi values of arsenic for men women and children were 0 12 4 94 mg kg day 0 15 5 93 mg kg day and 0 33 13 29 mg kg day respectively also computed hqs of nitrate and arsenic in the groundwater for three age groups were presented in the table 6 the mean values of hq for the measured nitrate concentrations for men women and children were 2 45 0 11 5 13 2 94 0 14 6 16 and 6 59 0 31 13 73 respectively for arsenic the mean values of hq for a men women and children were 0 24 0 04 1 54 0 29 0 05 1 85 and 0 65 0 11 4 15 respectively generally exposure to arsenic and nitrate via groundwater was in the following order children women men nitrate indicate hq 1 0 for three groups shows the potential of an adverse effect to human health therefore the health risk of nitrate indicated the hq values suggesting an unacceptable noncarcinogenic health risk but in the case of arsenic hq values showed an acceptable noncarcinogenic health risk our results demonstrated that children face a greater risk than adults because of their smaller body weight zhai et al 2017 li et al 2019 aso children are at high risk of suffering health consequences of environmental pollutants such as drinking water contaminants because they continue to develop both behaviorally and physiologically throughout childhood same studies have also disclosed the similar findings li et al 2019 he and wu 2019 zhai et al 2017 the obtained results of cdi and hq in this study showed that level of the human health risk for women is a little higher than that for men this result is the same with the zhai et al 2017 and li et al 2016 residents around the world especially people in the agricultural districts are facing higher noncarcinogenic exposure risk of nitrate as fertilization of agriculture is the most common source of nitrate in groundwater contamination li et al 2019 similar studies in other parts of the world were performed about human health risk assessment of arsenic and nitrate groundwater pollution rezaei et al 2018 evaluated health risk assessment related to the fluoride nitrate and nitrite in the drinking water in the sanandaj kurdistan county of iran their results showed that the mean values of cdi for the men women and children were 0 4258 0 5110 and 1 1454 mg kg day respectively the findings of this research indicated that the hq for three groups were above the one hq 1 and exposed to nitrate risks in the research conducted by li et al 2019 regarding the health risks due to nitrate ingestion through drinking water of yan an city on the loess plateau of northwest china they were observed that for the all study research the average hq values for adults and children were 2 25 and 3 97 respectively and approximately 47 2 of the sampling sites showed hq greater than 1 also the outcome of this research is partly in line with the study by qasemi et al 2018b that their results showed hq values of nitrate for 41 of children and infants were above the safety level hq 1 and concluded that the groundwater nitrate have significant health effects on these age groups liang et al 2018 surveyed the health risk associated with as groundwater of the lanyang plain taiwan and found that 34 of the people had access to groundwater where the hq was 1 also the findings rasool et al 2016 in punjab state pakistan indicated that the average values of hq were higher than 1 and health impacts of chronic arsenic exposure arisen via consumption of groundwater in the study of singh and ghosh 2012 in patna district india the health risk assessment of arsenic groundwater showed that hq values exceeded the typical toxic risk index value of 1 in the study conducted by sadler et al 2016 in drinking water from village wells in semarang indonesia result showed the hq values as evaluated against who guideline values at 50 95 percentile points were hq50 at 0 42 and hq95 at 1 2 respectively 3 4 spatial distribution of nitrate and arsenic 3 4 1 nitrate in this research the effective range for nitrate was estimated 2 2 km nitrate seen in table 7 co co c showed moderate dependency with 0 60 this can be related to the extrinsic and intrinsic factors the experimental variogram of nitrate in groundwater was best fitted by a spherical model the spatial distribution of the nitrate concentrations for chahardoli plain is shown in fig 2 the spatial distribution map of nitrate inferred high nitrate levels in the northeast southeast and the center of the study area which from the west and east there was increasing trend toward the center may be relate to the use of fertilizer in agricultural lands the center parts of the plain are intensively applied for agricultural practices 3 4 2 arsenic to investigate the spatial structure of arsenic concentration the variogram was calculated and the corresponding curve plotted and then a spherical model was fitted table 7 shows the various parameters of the variogram for arsenic in the study area the effective range r is the distance where the variogram reaches 95 of the sill and data exhibit spatial correlation in this study the effective range for arsenic was estimated 3 5 km the ratio ofco co c can be used to classifying the spatial dependence of groundwater quality variables if this ratio is less than 0 25 show strong spatial dependence between 0 25 and 0 75 the variable show moderate spatial dependence and if it is greater than 0 75 the variables indicate a weak spatial dependence as seen in table 7 a high ratio ofco co c shows the weak spatial dependence of arsenic this can be related to geology of study area the experimental variogram of arsenic concentrations in groundwater was best fitted by a spherical model fig 3 showed the spatial distribution of arsenic concentration in the groundwater of chahardoli plain based on this map the highest arsenic values were observed in the northern part of the region and lowest in the western part of the study area also in this map arsenic concentration did not follow the homogenous pattern and varied in different parts of the plain the highest arsenic concentrations in the northern study area may be due to the presence of dashkasan au mine which increased arsenic entry into the groundwater it could be the main geogenic source of this element in the region dashkasan au mine sari gunay is the largest known epithermal gold deposit in iran moore et al 2016 other studies reported that the groundwater in a gold mining area has been polluted by arsenic borba et al 2003 barzegar et al 2015 concluded that the arsenic in the groundwater of tabriz plain aquifer iran could be originated from geological formations such as alluvial tuffs of sahand mountain 4 conclusions the results of this study showed that the mean concentrations of arsenic in groundwater samples in the chahardooli plain were higher than the who guidelines 10 Œºg l also the spatial distribution map of showed that the arsenic concentration in most parts of the plain was higher than the maximum permissible level in drinking water gold mining was also one of the proposed causes of elevated arsenic concentrations in the northern part of the plain generally it can be concluded that in addition to the specific geology of the study area that has led to high concentrations of arsenic in the plain anthropogenic factors have also influenced the arsenic concentrations therefore as this water is used for agricultural and livestock purposes and in some cases groundwater is used for drinking it is necessary to use a suitable and efficient method to remove arsenic from water groundwater in the study area showed elevated levels of nitrates which 73 of samples contained nitrate concentrations exceeding the who standard 50 mg g the results of this research showed that three groups men women and children were exposed to nitrate contact from groundwater with hq 1 the findings showed that the values of hq were highest in the children group so they are at high risk therefore there is an essential need to design further studies for determine the main sources and factors affecting nitrate and arsenic groundwater contamination also continuous monitoring and awareness raising to native communities about its health effects of these pollutants must be prioritized further studies should be conducted to clearly assess sources and geochemical processes of groundwater arsenic enrichment in chahardooli plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this research was supported by malayer university of iran 
9989,the scarcity of water resources has posed serious threats to the sustainable development of agriculture and promoted the need for water saving technologies deficit irrigation has been widely used as a water saving practice globally although it does facilitate the improvement in crop water productivity wp its influence on crop yield varies considerably therefore a global meta analysis was conducted to systematically and quantitatively analyze the responses of both wp and seed cotton yield to deficit irrigation and explore the optimal conditions for the better application of deficit irrigation in practice it was found that although deficit irrigation averagely increased wp by 5 3 compared with full irrigation it caused a significant decline in seed cotton yield by 20 2 on average overall deficit irrigation performed best at the seedling blooming stage of cotton under 80 100 full irrigation in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm and average annual temperature 10 cotton planted in medium textured soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 obtained highest seed cotton yield and wp seed cotton yield and wp were increased by ridge planting with film mulching additionally drip irrigation was most beneficial for seed cotton yield than sprinkler and furrow irrigations deficit irrigation throughout the whole growing season of cotton was the most undesirable measure seed cotton yield and wp were significantly affected by fertilization rate and the appropriate nitrogen phosphorus and potassium application rates were 300 400 kg n ha 1 79 105 kg p ha 1 and 100 133 kg k ha 1 respectively in conclusion higher wp was obtained with acceptable reduction in seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation however to optimize deficit irrigation in practice irrigation method and amount deficit stage climate condition soil property mulching mode and fertilization rate must be further considered keywords deficit irrigation seed cotton yield water productivity global meta analysis 1 introduction agriculture is the guarantee for human survival and water is an indispensable factor to ensure crop production approximately 70 of the global water consumption is used for crop production yang et al 2006 yawson et al 2014 60 80 by irrigation ballesteros et al 2016 however the scarcity of water resources is a great threat to the sustainable development of agriculture li et al 2017 wang et al 2018 memon et al 2021 deficit irrigation has been found to be a realistic solution which means the irrigation water applied was less than the crop water demand at some growth stages of crops du et al 2015 liu et al 2020 although it probably decreased crop yields to some degree it significantly increased crop water productivity wp cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2016 furthermore the increase in global population not only increases the demand for foods but also increases the demand for fiber product cotton is widely cultivated around the world due to its great socio economic benefits howell et al 2004 onder et al 2009 and is the most important industrial crop for fiber abdel fattah et al 2019 although cotton is drought tolerant water is still an essential factor for maintaining cotton growth and seed cotton yield can be significantly increased by proper irrigation management bordovsky et al 2015 therefore to meet the demands of growing population and sustainable agricultural development developing prudent and sustainable irrigation strategies with insignificant reduction in crop yields and increase in wp is urgent although many studies have investigated the influence of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield and wp these results were inconsistent due to the differences in experimental and environmental factors among the studies for instance some studies demonstrated that seed cotton yield was slightly reduced or rarely affected by deficit irrigation while water consumption was significantly decreased fereres and soriano 2007 liu et al 2017 papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 rao et al 2016 wanjura et al 2002 however some studies have found that wp was significantly increased but seed cotton yield was reduced daƒüdelen et al 2006 onder et al 2009 wu et al 2014 found when n p2o5 k2o was 250 100 50 kg ha 1 and irrigation amount was 80 crop evapotranspiration etc the highest wp was obtained while the seed cotton yield was only decreased by 5 compared with that under 100 etc irrigation hussein et al 2014 found that irrigation with 80 of the soil water depletion obtained the highest water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency however zhang et al 2016 indicated that irrigation with 70 etc brought significant benefits in saving irrigation water regardless of nitrogen rate additionally due to the limitations of field experiments researchers can only verify their results at one or two sites therefore it is necessary to quantitatively and systematically sum up the effects of deficit irrigation under different conditions for the better application of deficit irrigation in practice in this case a meta analysis is needed to summarize the general conclusions based on previous studies on a large scale meta analysis can be adopted to analyze data from studies with the identical research purpose hedges et al 1999 stanley and jarrell 1989 and systematically explain a complex set of trait factors that may affect dependent variables to conclude general results kaoru 1990 as a result of the superiority of meta analysis many researchers have applied it to agricultural studies for instance fan et al 2018 conducted a meta regression analysis to determine the influence of deficit irrigation on wheat and cotton yields and wp yu et al 2020 quantitatively analyzed the influence of deficit irrigation on wheat yield and wue relative to full irrigation using meta analysis zhang et al 2021 adopted meta analysis to analyze the impact of different farming practices on wp and yield of wheat maize and potato in china li et al 2021 analyzed water and nitrogen saving potentials and yields of different crops under drip fertigation relative to farmers practices although many meta analyses have been conducted the percentage changes of seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation from meta analysis is still lacking therefore this study systematically and quantitatively analyzed the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation under various conditions based on a large number of data from published papers on a global scale so as to further improve our understanding of the responses of cotton to deficit irrigation specifically the objectives of this meta analysis were to 1 explore climate and soil conditions that result in higher seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation and 2 identify the optimal field management practices irrigation method and amount deficit stage mulching mode and fertilization rate for deficit irrigation 2 data and methods 2 1

considered and marked as 2 2 data analysis the effect size lnr was used to represent the impact of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield wp compared to full irrigation hedges et al 1999 1 ln r ln x t ln x c where xt is the mean value of deficit irrigation seed cotton yield wp and xc is the mean value of full irrigation seed cotton yield wp secondly the variance of effect size lnr v was not always given which was then calculated based on the sample size mean x and sd luo et al 2006 2 ln r v s d t 2 n t x t 2 s d c 2 n c x c 2 where sdt sdc nt and nc are sd of deficit irrigation and full irrigation and the sample sizes of deficit irrigation and full irrigation respectively due to the difference in statistical precision of each study the overall effect size lnr was used to achieve greater precision curtis and wang 1998 the weight of lnr wi was also calculated luo et al 2006 3 l n r i 1 k w i l n r i 1 k w i 4 l n r w i 1 ln r v where k is the total number of studies included in

prism8 2 3 publication bias both the funnel plot and rosenthal s fail safe number n f were applied to examine the possibility of publication bias adu et al 2018 orwin 1983 the funnel plot of seed cotton yield was symmetrical while that of wp was asymmetrical forty missing effect sizes were found in the results of trim and fill method for wp although the results of trim and fill method for wp changed the magnitude it did not change the significance r 1 04 95 confidence interval ci 1 03 1 06 p 0 00 0 05 the results indicated that there was no publication bias furthermore the results of rosenthal s fail safe number n f 10 5 m 1 where m is the number of paired data was 914 224 and 6363 for seed cotton yield and wp respectively obviously the outcomes of seed cotton yield and wp were both greater than 1 which further confirmed that there was no publication bias 3 results 3 1 overall analysis in this meta analysis 74 published papers from 15 countries were collected reporting 430 and 161 observations of seed cotton yield and wp respectively among them most of seed cotton yield data were from asia 91 8 followed by africa 2 8 europe 2 6 south america 1 9 and north america 1 0 as for wp most were also from asia 92 6 followed by europe 3 7 africa 1 8 south america 1 2 and north america 0 6 fig 1 these frequency distributions of effect size of seed cotton yield and wp generally followed normal distributions fig 2a and b 3 2 irrigation practices irrigation method deficit stage and irrigation amount all significantly affected the percentage ratios of seed cotton yield and wp fig 3 the overall mean effect size of irrigation method on seed cotton yield and wp was decreased by 19 7 95 ci 20 1 to 19 3 and increased by 5 1 95 ci 4 3 6 0 compared to full irrigation respectively the smallest reduction in seed cotton yield occurred under flood irrigation 11 9 while the largest decrease was found under sprinkler irrigation 36 2 however this result needed to be further verified due to the small sample of flood irrigation n 2 the decreases of seed cotton yield under furrow irrigation and drip irrigation were similar 19 6 and 19 5 respectively fig 3a in contrast although wp was increased by 3 6 5 2 and 11 4 under furrow drip and sprinkler irrigation respectively no significant difference was obtained among these irrigation methods fig 3b deficit stage also affected the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation deficit irrigation at bud and boll opening stage caused the smallest decrease in seed cotton yield 6 6 the largest decrease in seed cotton yield was obtained under deficit irrigation throughout the whole growing season of cotton 21 7 fig 3c for wp the largest increase 16 2 occurred under deficit irrigation at the seedling and blooming stage but the 95 confidence interval of them overlapped fig 3d the overall mean of deficit stage on seed cotton yield was decreased by 19 9 95 ci 20 3 to 19 6 while wp was increased by 4 2 95 ci 3 7 4 8 fig 3a and b the effect size of seed cotton yield lnr seed cotton yield increased linearly with the increasing irrigation proportion with the slope of the fitted line of 0 68 additionally identical seed cotton yield was obtained under 94 full irrigation and full irrigation fig 4a there was significant difference in seed cotton yield among different irrigation proportions specifically the reduction in seed cotton yield was 26 8 23 9 21 2 and 7 9 under 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 full irrigation respectively fig 3e with regards to wp the total change trend of the effect size with irrigation proportion differed from that of seed cotton yield the effect size of wp increased polynomial with the increase in irrigation proportion the range of change in determination coefficient was 0 09 with the second order polynomial relationship and the inflection point was 0 92 0 05 fig 4b the highest wp 8 8 occurred under 80 100 full irrigation followed by 40 full irrigation 8 0 but no significant difference was found between them the smallest wp occurred under 60 80 full irrigation but the difference between 60 and 80 and 40 60 full irrigation was not significant fig 3f the overall mean of seed cotton yield was decreased by 19 7 and that of wp was increased by 6 6 fig 3e and f 3 3 climate conditions the percentage changes of seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation were significantly affected by seasonal precipitation and annual average temperature generally seed cotton yield was positively related to seasonal precipitation and annual average temperature while wp was oppositely related to them fig 5 the reduction in seed cotton yield was 17 5 when seasonal precipitation was 120 mm which was significantly higher than that in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm 20 0 fig 5a wp in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm 5 8 showed higher increase than that with seasonal precipitation 120 mm 3 7 but the increase was not significant fig 5b overall seasonal precipitation caused a decrease in seed cotton yield 19 4 but an increase in wp 4 8 the percentage change of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield was positively correlated to the increasing average annual temperature but the result of wp was opposite fig 5c and d although average annual temperature had influences on seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation the difference between 10 and 10 29 was not significant average annual temperature decreased seed cotton yield by 17 3 95 ci 18 2 to 16 5 but increased wp by 8 5 95 ci 6 8 10 4 3 4 soil properties both seed cotton yield and wp were significantly affected by soil bulk density and ph under deficit irrigation while the reduction in seed cotton yield and the increase in wp were not significantly affected by soil texture fig 6 specifically the percentage changes in seed cotton yield and wp were highest in the medium soil 19 3 and 5 2 respectively which were higher than those in fine and coarse soils the lowest seed cotton yield and wp were observed in the coarse soil 20 9 and 2 7 respectively fig 6a and b in terms of seed cotton yield deficit irrigation performed better in soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 but it was not significantly different from that in soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 however wp showed a significant increasing trend with the increase in soil bulk density overall deficit irrigation showed a 20 79 95 ci 21 1 to 20 3 reduction in seed cotton yield and a 4 3 95 ci 3 8 4 9 increase in wp among various soil bulk densities fig 6c and d the overall mean of seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation were affected by soil ph fig 6e and f where high soil ph 7 decreased seed cotton yield by 18 4 95 ci 19 9 to 16 8 and increased wp by 7 0 95 ci 5 9 8 2 the percentage change of seed cotton yield was significantly higher in alkaline soils ph 7 than that in acidic soils ph 7 however an opposite trend was observed for wp wp in soils with ph 7 was higher but no significant difference was found between alkaline and acidic soils due to the small sample n 2 in ph 7 the result was not conclusive fig 6e and f the application of deficit irrigation caused a significantly greater decrease in seed cotton yield in alkaline soils ph 7 and resulted in a slightly lower increase in wp the result of wp in acidic soils ph 7 needs to be further verified because of the small sample size n 2 3 5 mulching mode and fertilization rate in general mulching mode and fertilization rate significantly affected seed cotton yield and wp with overall means of seed cotton yield of 20 3 20 7 20 6 21 2 and wp of 3 2 3 9 3 8 and 3 6 respectively fig 7 seed cotton yield was greater under rpfm 18 0 and a significant difference was observed compared with that under fp 23 8 fig 7a however deficit irrigation significantly increased wp by 6 2 under rpfm compared to full irrigation which was significantly greater than that under fp 1 4 fig 7b percentage changes of seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation varied among nitrogen rates and an nitrogen rate of 300 400 kg n ha 1 obtained the smallest reduction in seed cotton yield 8 6 and the largest increase in wp 10 54 fig 7c and d the largest decrease in seed cotton yield 12 8 under deficit irrigation occurred when phosphorus rate was 79 105 kg p ha 1 which obtained the largest increase in wp 16 5 fig 7e and f except for 105 245 kg p ha 1 there were significant differences between phosphorus rates of 52 79 26 52 and 26 kg p ha 1 fig 7e the percentage changes of seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation were 14 1 6 6 19 7 23 0 and 20 2 at potassium rates of 133 166 100 133 66 100 33 66 and 33 kg k ha 1 respectively it was also found that seed cotton yield at the potassium rate of 100 133 kg k ha 1 was significantly different from those at the other potassium rates fig 7g a potassium rate of 100 133 kg k ha 1 obtained the largest increase in wp 16 2 at the potassium rate of 133 166 or 66 100 kg k ha 1 wp was higher under deficit irrigation compared with that under full irrigation but no significant difference were found between them fig 7h 3 6 best zone for application of deficit irrigation although deficit irrigation significantly improved wp of cotton it largely reduced seed cotton yield for better guiding the application of deficit irrigation the effect sizes of 161 paired data points with both seed cotton yield and wp were divided into five zones a b c d and e according to the average effect size of seed cotton yield 20 2 and zero zones a and d showed the increase and reduction in both seed cotton yield and wp respectively zone c had an increase in wp and a decrease in seed cotton yield conversely zone e exhibited the opposite trend to that of zone c as for zone b the points represented the effect size of seed cotton yield were in between the average effect size lnr 20 2 and zero the effect size of wp was higher than zero obviously zones a and b were our goal zones where wp increased and seed cotton yield increased or decreased above the average effect size specifically 46 3 of all data was in the goal zones a and b while zones c d and e included 26 3 27 5 and 0 of all data respectively fig 8 the influences of irrigation practices climate condition soil properties and field management practices on the distribution of these points in different zones were further analyzed table 1 the distribution of points in zone e was zero and it was thus ignored in table 1 the difference in the distribution of points among various subgroups was large specifically the proportion at seedling blooming stage was the largest 100 in a b region followed by throughout the season 53 4 and bud blooming boll opening stage obtained the smallest percentage 33 3 regardless of the seasonal precipitation the percentage of them was similar in a b region 42 0 and 55 2 respectively the proportions under 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 full irrigation were 25 0 9 4 40 0 and 82 7 in a b region respectively among them the proportion under 80 100 full irrigation was largest the percentage of 10 29 was more than twice than that of 10 the proportion of higher soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was higher than that of lower bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 50 5 and 34 6 respectively the proportions of medium coarse and fine soils were 50 8 46 7 and 38 2 respectively in the best zone the percentage of prfm was 50 0 which was 22 9 higher than that of fp as for nitrogen rate the largest proportion occurred at 300 400 kg n ha 1 57 1 nitrogen rates of 100 300 400 and 400 670 kg ha 1 accounted for similar proportions 40 0 4 discussion 4 1 overall analysis a total of 430 observations of seed cotton yield and 161 of wp from 74 published papers were collected to systematically explore the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation using meta analysis from the results of overall analysis deficit irrigation averagely increased wp by 5 3 but it showed a decline in seed cotton yield by 20 2 on average fig 2 besides the effect of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield and wp was also significantly affected by various irrigation practices climate conditions soil properties mulching modes and fertilization rates with varying degrees therefore there was a need to further explore how these subgroups affected wp and seed cotton yield to optimize the application of deficit irrigation 4 2 effects of irrigation practices on seed cotton yield and wp the outcomes of subgroups analysis showed that the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation varied with irrigation method deficit stage and irrigation amount fig 3 seed cotton yield under drip irrigation was slightly higher than that under furrow irrigation and significantly higher than that under sprinkler irrigation fig 3a this can be possibly due to that drip irrigation could spray water more accurately and evenly with a high frequency in comparison to furrow and sprinkler irrigation hanson and may 2006 besides in comparison with furrow and sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation moistened a small part of the soil while keeping the rest dry which helped improve the soil aeration bonachela et al 2001 kang et al 2004 and was beneficial to the absorption of soil water and nutrients similar trends have also been reported for cotton ibragimov et al 2007 √ºnl√º et al 2011 wanjura et al 2002 where drip irrigation was found to benefit seed cotton yield relative to furrow irrigation cetin and bilgel 2002 reveled that drip irrigation increased seed cotton yield compared with furrow and sprinkler irrigation with regard to wp drip irrigation performed better than furrow irrigation but worse than sprinkler irrigation however the difference among them was not significant fig 3b which was in agreement with the finding of janat 2005 the effect of irrigation method was also highly related to the management deficit sammis 1980 irrigation criterion bernstein and francois 1973 and soil texture darwish et al 2005 the comprehensive analysis of seed cotton yield and wp showed that drip irrigation was more beneficial for cotton under deficit irrigation the largest reduction in seed cotton yield occurred when deficit irrigation was applied throughout the season fig 3c primarily because that the water deficit at the bud stage blooming stage and boll opening stage caused a decrease in leaf water potential jalota et al 2006 and the number of bolls and boll mass aujla et al 2005 mert 2005 wang et al 2010 although water deficit at the seedling stage could increase tap root growth pace et al 1999 it reduced the leaf surface area in the upper canopy layer zhan et al 2015 and reduced the shoot growth of cotton plants pace et al 1999 which thus affected the seed cotton yield seriously additionally deficit irrigation occurred at the bud and boll opening stage produced the smallest seed cotton yield this result was in agreement with the finding of himanshu et al 2019 who found that water deficit at the germination and seedling emergence to squaring stage late bloom and boll opening stage had relatively smaller effect on seed cotton yield besides the result indicated that water stress throughout the season obtained the smallest wp but the difference among them was not significant this may be due to that the water stress throughout the season reduced the water consumption while it also drastically reduced the seed cotton yield additionally the degrees of the reduction in water consumption and seed cotton yield were similar wp could be increased by either increasing the yield with the same water applied or obtained the same yield with reducing water use irrigation amount also significantly affected seed cotton yield and wp the largest seed cotton yield and wp were obtained under 94 and 92 of full irrigation respectively figs 3 and 4 which was consistent with fan et al 2018 who found the irrigation amount to obtain maximum wp was less than the amount of water required to obtain maximum yield water deficit by about 6 and 8 of full irrigation could be thus considered for cotton besides the result also indicated that seed cotton yield was strongly correlated with the irrigation proportion to full irrigation fig 3e which was similar to that reported by basal et al 2010 hussein et al 2014 and yang et al 2015 when the irrigation amount was within the range of 80 100 of full irrigation seed cotton yield was largest and the difference was significant which was generally consistent with daƒüdelen et al 2006 and onder et al 2009 however basal et al 2010 found that compared to full irrigation a reduction of irrigation amount by 25 did not have significant impact on seed cotton yield it was probably due to the differences in irrigation frequency and timing and planting pattern steduto et al 2009 besides previous studies have found that a high planting density could save water without reducing seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b and the peak bloom growth stage was most sensitive to water stress himanshu et al 2019 4 3 effects of climate conditions on seed cotton yield and wp unsurprisingly the impact of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield and wp also varied with different climate factors such as precipitation and temperature fig 5 our results indicated that higher seed cotton yield was achieved in regions with higher seasonal precipitation 120 mm under deficit irrigation fig 5a which was similar to the finding of jalota et al 2006 who found that when the precipitation was 500 mm seed cotton yield increased with the increasing precipitation amount this is probably related to the fact that cotton is often planted in arid and semi arid areas and the annual precipitation is relatively low which cannot meet the growth need of cotton especially under deficit irrigation therefore when the precipitation amount increases it will increase seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation on the other hand higher wp was obtained when seasonal precipitation was 120 mm fig 5b a possible reason for this can be that lower precipitation caused a decline in crop evapotranspiration the larger reduction in seed cotton yield occurred when average annual temperature was 10 but the 95 confidence intervals overlapped between the two temperature ranges however wp increased with the decrease in average annual temperature but the difference between them was not significant fig 5c and d it may be largely related to that lower temperature prolonged the development of cotton bolls mao and dong 2003 and caused a decline in seed cotton yield wue is the coordination effect of leaf spread and photosynthetic capacity galle et al 2016 although higher temperature achieved higher seed cotton yield it also increased water use and wp thus changed insignificantly 4 4 effects of soil properties on seed cotton yield and wp our meta analysis also indicated that the reduction in seed cotton yield and increase in wp were affected by soil texture soil bulk density and soil ph with varying degrees fig 6 regarding soil texture slightly greater seed cotton yield and wp were observed in the medium soil 19 3 and 5 2 respectively than fine 19 9 and 4 5 respectively and coarse soils 20 9 and 2 7 respectively under deficit irrigation fig 6a this result can be attributed to that fine textured soils with higher clay content had poor soil aeration than medium and coarse textured soils bollmann and conrad 2004 goorahoo et al 2002 tiedje 1991 therefore it reduced cotton root respiration and caused a decrease in water and fertilizer uptake du et al 2018 in contrast the capacity of holding water and nutrients was poorer in the coarse soil compared with that in medium and fine soils lu et al 2021 however soil texture affected seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation without significant difference fig 6b indicating that deficit irrigation caused a decrease in seed cotton yield and an increase of wp among different soil textures seed cotton yield decreased with the increasing soil bulk density but there was no significant difference between the two soil bulk densities however wp significantly increased with the increase in soil bulk density fig 6c and d this result could be explained by that soils with high soil bulk density was more compacted which inhibited the root growth ityel et al 2014 besides high soil bulk density affected the absorption of water fertilizer and microelements from the root zone wolkowski and lowery 2008 resulting in a larger decline in seed cotton yield however wp was higher when cotton was planted in soils with higher soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 which was possibly because soils with low soil bulk density had obvious higher infiltration and evaporation rates wang et al 2018 and wp was thus not necessarily high 4 5 effects of mulching mode and fertilization rate on seed cotton yield and wp film mulching curtails the water evaporation from the soil and holds water near the root zone and ridges increased the ability of collecting rainwater fan et al 2014 2021 eldoma et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 2020 collecting rainwater reduced the impact of deficit irrigation on crops li et al 2019 yu et al 2018 also found ridge planting with film mulching was benefit to increasing soil temperature maintaining soil moisture and increasing yield compared with flat planting with film mulching percentage changes of seed cotton yield and water productivity under ridge planting with film mulching were larger than those under flat planting without film mulching fig 7a and b generally crop nutrient absorption comes partly from external fertilizer supply and soil fertility chuan et al 2013 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 many previous studies have demonstrated that seed cotton yield increased with the increasing fertilization rate until up to some thresholds wang et al 2018 2020 wu et al 2014 our study also found that seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation increased with the increase in fertilization rates and reached the maximum at medium to high fertilization rates fig 7c e and g this may be due to that the appropriate fertilizer application contributes to crop growth and better performance of photosynthesis albrizio et al 2010 and improves the drought resistance of cotton in addition the better coupling effect between water and fertilizer occurs at medium to high fertilization rates some studies also suggested that the appropriate fertilizer application is helpful to improve the crop water productivity xie et al 2011 aujla et al 2005 wang et al 2018 this may be due to that high fertilization rate disrupts the balance between vegetative and reproductive growth of cotton leading to overly strong nutrient uptake postponed maturity and reduced production fritschi et al 2003 this study also found that high fertilization rates all led to the reduction in water productivity with varying degree of success fig 7d f and h 4 6 limitations of this meta analysis this paper investigated the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation with regards to irrigation practices climate conditions soil properties mulching modes and fertilization rates nevertheless due to the insufficient data less than two data the responses of wp to deficit irrigation under flood irrigation and water deficit at bud and boll opening stage were not analyzed therefore more wp data under flood irrigation and water deficit at bud and boll opening stage should be further analyzed and concluded additionally analyzing the distribution of paired data points of effect sizes of seed cotton yield and wp the data of irrigation method soil ph and phosphorus and potassium fertilizer were not included because irrigation method only included drip irrigation soil was only alkaline soil 7 and there was no data of phosphorus and potassium rates of 79 105 100 133 kg ha 1 in the collected database which needs to be further investigated in this paper there were 430 and 161 observations of seed cotton yield and wp respectively however not all subgroups were listed in each paper therefore the total data of each subgroup analysis was not all equal to 430 and 161 for seed cotton yield and wp respectively besides the growth stage of cotton was not clearly given in some papers and a reasonable calculation was thus made based on days after planting provided in the paper this meta analysis investigated the effects of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield and wp nevertheless other factors such as cotton variety wan et al 2018 irrigation frequency thorp et al 2020 and planting density zhang et al 2016 might also affected the results future studies are needed to consider more factors and analyze their effect on the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation 5 conclusions deficit irrigation performed better under 80 100 full irrigation drip irrigation was more beneficial for cotton production than sprinkler and furrow irrigation under deficit irrigation deficit irrigation occurred throughout the growing season of cotton was most undesirable a significantly higher seed cotton yield was obtained in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm and average annual temperature of 10 29 however wp was higher in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm and average annual temperature 10 but there was no significant difference between them there was no significant difference in seed cotton yield and wp among soil textures wp in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was significantly higher than that with lower bulk density but there was no significant difference in seed cotton yield between the two soil bulk densities as for soil ph the alkaline soil 7 was conducive to higher seed cotton yield seed cotton yield and wp were both significantly affected by fertilization rate and seed cotton yield increased with the increasing fertilization rate until up to some thresholds the appropriate application rates of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were 300 400 kg n ha 1 79 105 kg p ha 1 and 100 133 kg k ha 1 respectively importantly the proportions of various subgroups in the goal zone a b were analyzed to provide a basis for the better application of deficit irrigation in practice declaration

9989,the scarcity of water resources has posed serious threats to the sustainable development of agriculture and promoted the need for water saving technologies deficit irrigation has been widely used as a water saving practice globally although it does facilitate the improvement in crop water productivity wp its influence on crop yield varies considerably therefore a global meta analysis was conducted to systematically and quantitatively analyze the responses of both wp and seed cotton yield to deficit irrigation and explore the optimal conditions for the better application of deficit irrigation in practice it was found that although deficit irrigation averagely increased wp by 5 3 compared with full irrigation it caused a significant decline in seed cotton yield by 20 2 on average overall deficit irrigation performed best at the seedling blooming stage of cotton under 80 100 full irrigation in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm and average annual temperature 10 cotton planted in medium textured soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 obtained highest seed cotton yield and wp seed cotton yield and wp were increased by ridge planting with film mulching additionally drip irrigation was most beneficial for seed cotton yield than sprinkler and furrow irrigations deficit irrigation throughout the whole growing season of cotton was the most undesirable measure seed cotton yield and wp were significantly affected by fertilization rate and the appropriate nitrogen phosphorus and potassium application rates were 300 400 kg n ha 1 79 105 kg p ha 1 and 100 133 kg k ha 1 respectively in conclusion higher wp was obtained with acceptable reduction in seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation however to optimize deficit irrigation in practice irrigation method and amount deficit stage climate condition soil property mulching mode and fertilization rate must be further considered keywords deficit irrigation seed cotton yield water productivity global meta analysis 1 introduction agriculture is the guarantee for human survival and water is an indispensable factor to ensure crop production approximately 70 of the global water consumption is used for crop production yang et al 2006 yawson et al 2014 60 80 by irrigation ballesteros et al 2016 however the scarcity of water resources is a great threat to the sustainable development of agriculture li et al 2017 wang et al 2018 memon et al 2021 deficit irrigation has been found to be a realistic solution which means the irrigation water applied was less than the crop water demand at some growth stages of crops du et al 2015 liu et al 2020 although it probably decreased crop yields to some degree it significantly increased crop water productivity wp cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2016 furthermore the increase in global population not only increases the demand for foods but also increases the demand for fiber product cotton is widely cultivated around the world due to its great socio economic benefits howell et al 2004 onder et al 2009 and is the most important industrial crop for fiber abdel fattah et al 2019 although cotton is drought tolerant water is still an essential factor for maintaining cotton growth and seed cotton yield can be significantly increased by proper irrigation management bordovsky et al 2015 therefore to meet the demands of growing population and sustainable agricultural development developing prudent and sustainable irrigation strategies with insignificant reduction in crop yields and increase in wp is urgent although many studies have investigated the influence of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield and wp these results were inconsistent due to the differences in experimental and environmental factors among the studies for instance some studies demonstrated that seed cotton yield was slightly reduced or rarely affected by deficit irrigation while water consumption was significantly decreased fereres and soriano 2007 liu et al 2017 papastylianou and argyrokastritis 2014 rao et al 2016 wanjura et al 2002 however some studies have found that wp was significantly increased but seed cotton yield was reduced daƒüdelen et al 2006 onder et al 2009 wu et al 2014 found when n p2o5 k2o was 250 100 50 kg ha 1 and irrigation amount was 80 crop evapotranspiration etc the highest wp was obtained while the seed cotton yield was only decreased by 5 compared with that under 100 etc irrigation hussein et al 2014 found that irrigation with 80 of the soil water depletion obtained the highest water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency however zhang et al 2016 indicated that irrigation with 70 etc brought significant benefits in saving irrigation water regardless of nitrogen rate additionally due to the limitations of field experiments researchers can only verify their results at one or two sites therefore it is necessary to quantitatively and systematically sum up the effects of deficit irrigation under different conditions for the better application of deficit irrigation in practice in this case a meta analysis is needed to summarize the general conclusions based on previous studies on a large scale meta analysis can be adopted to analyze data from studies with the identical research purpose hedges et al 1999 stanley and jarrell 1989 and systematically explain a complex set of trait factors that may affect dependent variables to conclude general results kaoru 1990 as a result of the superiority of meta analysis many researchers have applied it to agricultural studies for instance fan et al 2018 conducted a meta regression analysis to determine the influence of deficit irrigation on wheat and cotton yields and wp yu et al 2020 quantitatively analyzed the influence of deficit irrigation on wheat yield and wue relative to full irrigation using meta analysis zhang et al 2021 adopted meta analysis to analyze the impact of different farming practices on wp and yield of wheat maize and potato in china li et al 2021 analyzed water and nitrogen saving potentials and yields of different crops under drip fertigation relative to farmers practices although many meta analyses have been conducted the percentage changes of seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation from meta analysis is still lacking therefore this study systematically and quantitatively analyzed the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation under various conditions based on a large number of data from published papers on a global scale so as to further improve our understanding of the responses of cotton to deficit irrigation specifically the objectives of this meta analysis were to 1 explore climate and soil conditions that result in higher seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation and 2 identify the optimal field management practices irrigation method and amount deficit stage mulching mode and fertilization rate for deficit irrigation 2 data and methods 2 1

in the reference lists were also included which reported the impact of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield or wp keywords included cotton and deficit irrigation water stress deficit and irrigation regime furthermore articles must meet the following criteria 1 the impact of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield or wp defined as yield etc fern√°ndez et al 2020 contained side by side comparisons of deficit irrigation and full irrigation in pot rainproof or field experiments what needed to point out was that the amount of deficit irrigation was less than the total water demand of cotton and full irrigation was 100 etc or reference evapotranspiration or pan evaporation or field water capacity or local irrigation practice or a given irrigation quota 2 all target variables i e mean sample

could be any growth stage seedling stage or bud stage or blooming or boll opening stage or any combination of growth stages 4 the production was seed cotton yield instead of lint cotton yield if the data were displayed by graphs they were extracted by the get data graph digitizer program finally 74 publications 70 field experiments and 4 pot rainproof experiments from 15 countries containing 591 side by side comparisons 430 for seed cotton yield and 161 for wp were compiled into the dataset the lists of publications and data are provided in supplementary s1 and s2 furthermore subgroups

and potassium rate 33 kg k ha 1 33 66 kg k ha 1 66 100 kg k ha 1 100 133 kg k ha 1 133 166 kg k ha 1 it should be noted that if the data number of the subgroup was less than two the subgroup was not considered and marked as 2 2 data analysis the effect size lnr was used to represent the impact of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield wp compared to full irrigation hedges et al 1999 1 ln r ln x t ln x c where xt is the mean value of deficit irrigation seed cotton yield wp and xc is the mean value of full irrigation seed cotton yield wp secondly the variance of effect size lnr v was not always given which was then calculated based on the sample size mean x and sd luo et al 2006 2 ln r v s d t 2 n t x t 2 s d c 2 n c x c 2 where sdt sdc nt and nc are sd of deficit irrigation and full irrigation and the sample sizes of deficit irrigation and full irrigation respectively due to the difference in statistical precision of each study the overall effect size lnr was used to achieve greater precision curtis and wang 1998 the weight of lnr wi was also calculated luo et al 2006 3 l n r i 1 k w i l n r i 1 k w i 4 l n r w i 1 ln r v where k is the total number of studies included in this meta analysis and w i is the weight of the effect size of the ith study the variance of lnr var was calculated as the reverse of the sum of wi finally the 95 confidence intervals of lnr 95 ci were ln r 95 c i ln r 1 96 ln r v ar because the heterogeneity among studies i2 50 a random effect model was used duffy et al 2017 in order to facilitate explanation all the outcomes were expressed as the percentage changes in comparison with full irrigation r 1 100 this meta analysis was calculated using stata ic 15 1 and microsoft excel and the figures were created using origin v9 0 and graphpad prism8 2 3 publication bias both the funnel plot and rosenthal s fail safe number n f were applied to examine the possibility of publication bias adu et al 2018 orwin 1983 the funnel plot of seed cotton yield was symmetrical while that of wp was asymmetrical forty missing effect sizes were found in the results of trim and fill method for wp although the results of trim and fill method for wp changed the magnitude it did not change the significance r 1 04 95 confidence interval ci 1 03 1 06 p 0 00 0 05 the results indicated that there was no publication bias furthermore the results of rosenthal s fail safe number n f 10 5 m 1 where m is the number of paired data was 914 224 and 6363 for seed cotton yield and wp respectively obviously the outcomes of seed cotton yield and wp were both greater than 1 which further confirmed that there was no publication bias 3 results 3 1 overall analysis in this meta analysis 74 published papers from 15 countries were collected reporting 430 and 161 observations of seed cotton yield and wp respectively among them most of seed cotton yield data were from asia 91 8 followed by africa 2 8 europe 2 6 south america 1 9 and north america 1 0 as for wp most were also from asia 92 6 followed by europe 3 7 africa 1 8 south america 1 2 and north america 0 6 fig 1 these frequency distributions of effect size of seed cotton yield and wp generally followed normal distributions fig 2a and b 3 2 irrigation practices irrigation method deficit stage and irrigation amount all significantly affected the percentage ratios of seed cotton yield and wp fig 3 the overall mean effect size of irrigation method on seed cotton yield and wp was decreased by 19 7 95 ci 20 1 to 19 3 and increased by 5 1 95 ci 4 3 6 0 compared to full irrigation respectively the smallest reduction in seed cotton yield occurred under flood irrigation 11 9 while the largest decrease was found under sprinkler irrigation 36 2 however this result needed to be further verified due to the small sample of flood irrigation n 2 the decreases of seed cotton yield under furrow irrigation and drip irrigation were similar 19 6 and 19 5 respectively fig 3a in contrast although wp was increased by 3 6 5 2 and 11 4 under furrow drip and sprinkler irrigation respectively no significant difference was obtained among these irrigation methods fig 3b deficit stage also affected the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation deficit irrigation at bud and boll opening stage caused the smallest decrease in seed cotton yield 6 6 the largest decrease in seed cotton yield was obtained under deficit irrigation throughout the whole growing season of cotton 21 7 fig 3c for wp the largest increase 16 2 occurred under deficit irrigation at the seedling and blooming stage but the 95 confidence interval of them overlapped fig 3d the overall mean of deficit stage on seed cotton yield was decreased by 19 9 95 ci 20 3 to 19 6 while wp was increased by 4 2 95 ci 3 7 4 8 fig 3a and b the effect size of seed cotton yield lnr seed cotton yield increased linearly with the increasing irrigation proportion with the slope of the fitted line of 0 68 additionally identical seed cotton yield was obtained under 94 full irrigation and full irrigation fig 4a there was significant difference in seed cotton yield among different irrigation proportions specifically the reduction in seed cotton yield was 26 8 23 9 21 2 and 7 9 under 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 full irrigation respectively fig 3e with regards to wp the total change trend of the effect size with irrigation proportion differed from that of seed cotton yield the effect size of wp increased polynomial with the increase in irrigation proportion the range of change in determination coefficient was 0 09 with the second order polynomial relationship and the inflection point was 0 92 0 05 fig 4b the highest wp 8 8 occurred under 80 100 full irrigation followed by 40 full irrigation 8 0 but no significant difference was found between them the smallest wp occurred under 60 80 full irrigation but the difference between 60 and 80 and 40 60 full irrigation was not significant fig 3f the overall mean of seed cotton yield was decreased by 19 7 and that of wp was increased by 6 6 fig 3e and f 3 3 climate conditions the percentage changes of seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation were significantly affected by seasonal precipitation and annual average temperature generally seed cotton yield was positively related to seasonal precipitation and annual average temperature while wp was oppositely related to them fig 5 the reduction in seed cotton yield was 17 5 when seasonal precipitation was 120 mm which was significantly higher than that in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm 20 0 fig 5a wp in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm 5 8 showed higher increase than that with seasonal precipitation 120 mm 3 7 but the increase was not significant fig 5b overall seasonal precipitation caused a decrease in seed cotton yield 19 4 but an increase in wp 4 8 the percentage change of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield was positively correlated to the increasing average annual temperature but the result of wp was opposite fig 5c and d although average annual temperature had influences on seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation the difference between 10 and 10 29 was not significant average annual temperature decreased seed cotton yield by 17 3 95 ci 18 2 to 16 5 but increased wp by 8 5 95 ci 6 8 10 4 3 4 soil properties both seed cotton yield and wp were significantly affected by soil bulk density and ph under deficit irrigation while the reduction in seed cotton yield and the increase in wp were not significantly affected by soil texture fig 6 specifically the percentage changes in seed cotton yield and wp were highest in the medium soil 19 3 and 5 2 respectively which were higher than those in fine and coarse soils the lowest seed cotton yield and wp were observed in the coarse soil 20 9 and 2 7 respectively fig 6a and b in terms of seed cotton yield deficit irrigation performed better in soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 but it was not significantly different from that in soils with bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 however wp showed a significant increasing trend with the increase in soil bulk density overall deficit irrigation showed a 20 79 95 ci 21 1 to 20 3 reduction in seed cotton yield and a 4 3 95 ci 3 8 4 9 increase in wp among various soil bulk densities fig 6c and d the overall mean of seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation were affected by soil ph fig 6e and f where high soil ph 7 decreased seed cotton yield by 18 4 95 ci 19 9 to 16 8 and increased wp by 7 0 95 ci 5 9 8 2 the percentage change of seed cotton yield was significantly higher in alkaline soils ph 7 than that in acidic soils ph 7 however an opposite trend was observed for wp wp in soils with ph 7 was higher but no significant difference was found between alkaline and acidic soils due to the small sample n 2 in ph 7 the result was not conclusive fig 6e and f the application of deficit irrigation caused a significantly greater decrease in seed cotton yield in alkaline soils ph 7 and resulted in a slightly lower increase in wp the result of wp in acidic soils ph 7 needs to be further verified because of the small sample size n 2 3 5 mulching mode and fertilization rate in general mulching mode and fertilization rate significantly affected seed cotton yield and wp with overall means of seed cotton yield of 20 3 20 7 20 6 21 2 and wp of 3 2 3 9 3 8 and 3 6 respectively fig 7 seed cotton yield was greater under rpfm 18 0 and a significant difference was observed compared with that under fp 23 8 fig 7a however deficit irrigation significantly increased wp by 6 2 under rpfm compared to full irrigation which was significantly greater than that under fp 1 4 fig 7b percentage changes of seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation varied among nitrogen rates and an nitrogen rate of 300 400 kg n ha 1 obtained the smallest reduction in seed cotton yield 8 6 and the largest increase in wp 10 54 fig 7c and d the largest decrease in seed cotton yield 12 8 under deficit irrigation occurred when phosphorus rate was 79 105 kg p ha 1 which obtained the largest increase in wp 16 5 fig 7e and f except for 105 245 kg p ha 1 there were significant differences between phosphorus rates of 52 79 26 52 and 26 kg p ha 1 fig 7e the percentage changes of seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation were 14 1 6 6 19 7 23 0 and 20 2 at potassium rates of 133 166 100 133 66 100 33 66 and 33 kg k ha 1 respectively it was also found that seed cotton yield at the potassium rate of 100 133 kg k ha 1 was significantly different from those at the other potassium rates fig 7g a potassium rate of 100 133 kg k ha 1 obtained the largest increase in wp 16 2 at the potassium rate of 133 166 or 66 100 kg k ha 1 wp was higher under deficit irrigation compared with that under full irrigation but no significant difference were found between them fig 7h 3 6 best zone for application of deficit irrigation although deficit irrigation significantly improved wp of cotton it largely reduced seed cotton yield for better guiding the application of deficit irrigation the effect sizes of 161 paired data points with both seed cotton yield and wp were divided into five zones a b c d and e according to the average effect size of seed cotton yield 20 2 and zero zones a and d showed the increase and reduction in both seed cotton yield and wp respectively zone c had an increase in wp and a decrease in seed cotton yield conversely zone e exhibited the opposite trend to that of zone c as for zone b the points represented the effect size of seed cotton yield were in between the average effect size lnr 20 2 and zero the effect size of wp was higher than zero obviously zones a and b were our goal zones where wp increased and seed cotton yield increased or decreased above the average effect size specifically 46 3 of all data was in the goal zones a and b while zones c d and e included 26 3 27 5 and 0 of all data respectively fig 8 the influences of irrigation practices climate condition soil properties and field management practices on the distribution of these points in different zones were further analyzed table 1 the distribution of points in zone e was zero and it was thus ignored in table 1 the difference in the distribution of points among various subgroups was large specifically the proportion at seedling blooming stage was the largest 100 in a b region followed by throughout the season 53 4 and bud blooming boll opening stage obtained the smallest percentage 33 3 regardless of the seasonal precipitation the percentage of them was similar in a b region 42 0 and 55 2 respectively the proportions under 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 full irrigation were 25 0 9 4 40 0 and 82 7 in a b region respectively among them the proportion under 80 100 full irrigation was largest the percentage of 10 29 was more than twice than that of 10 the proportion of higher soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was higher than that of lower bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 50 5 and 34 6 respectively the proportions of medium coarse and fine soils were 50 8 46 7 and 38 2 respectively in the best zone the percentage of prfm was 50 0 which was 22 9 higher than that of fp as for nitrogen rate the largest proportion occurred at 300 400 kg n ha 1 57 1 nitrogen rates of 100 300 400 and 400 670 kg ha 1 accounted for similar proportions 40 0 4 discussion 4 1 overall analysis a total of 430 observations of seed cotton yield and 161 of wp from 74 published papers were collected to systematically explore the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation using meta analysis from the results of overall analysis deficit irrigation averagely increased wp by 5 3 but it showed a decline in seed cotton yield by 20 2 on average fig 2 besides the effect of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield and wp was also significantly affected by various irrigation practices climate conditions soil properties mulching modes and fertilization rates with varying degrees therefore there was a need to further explore how these subgroups affected wp and seed cotton yield to optimize the application of deficit irrigation 4 2 effects of irrigation practices on seed cotton yield and wp the outcomes of subgroups analysis showed that the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation varied with irrigation method deficit stage and irrigation amount fig 3 seed cotton yield under drip irrigation was slightly higher than that under furrow irrigation and significantly higher than that under sprinkler irrigation fig 3a this can be possibly due to that drip irrigation could spray water more accurately and evenly with a high frequency in comparison to furrow and sprinkler irrigation hanson and may 2006 besides in comparison with furrow and sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation moistened a small part of the soil while keeping the rest dry which helped improve the soil aeration bonachela et al 2001 kang et al 2004 and was beneficial to the absorption of soil water and nutrients similar trends have also been reported for cotton ibragimov et al 2007 √ºnl√º et al 2011 wanjura et al 2002 where drip irrigation was found to benefit seed cotton yield relative to furrow irrigation cetin and bilgel 2002 reveled that drip irrigation increased seed cotton yield compared with furrow and sprinkler irrigation with regard to wp drip irrigation performed better than furrow irrigation but worse than sprinkler irrigation however the difference among them was not significant fig 3b which was in agreement with the finding of janat 2005 the effect of irrigation method was also highly related to the management deficit sammis 1980 irrigation criterion bernstein and francois 1973 and soil texture darwish et al 2005 the comprehensive analysis of seed cotton yield and wp showed that drip irrigation was more beneficial for cotton under deficit irrigation the largest reduction in seed cotton yield occurred when deficit irrigation was applied throughout the season fig 3c primarily because that the water deficit at the bud stage blooming stage and boll opening stage caused a decrease in leaf water potential jalota et al 2006 and the number of bolls and boll mass aujla et al 2005 mert 2005 wang et al 2010 although water deficit at the seedling stage could increase tap root growth pace et al 1999 it reduced the leaf surface area in the upper canopy layer zhan et al 2015 and reduced the shoot growth of cotton plants pace et al 1999 which thus affected the seed cotton yield seriously additionally deficit irrigation occurred at the bud and boll opening stage produced the smallest seed cotton yield this result was in agreement with the finding of himanshu et al 2019 who found that water deficit at the germination and seedling emergence to squaring stage late bloom and boll opening stage had relatively smaller effect on seed cotton yield besides the result indicated that water stress throughout the season obtained the smallest wp but the difference among them was not significant this may be due to that the water stress throughout the season reduced the water consumption while it also drastically reduced the seed cotton yield additionally the degrees of the reduction in water consumption and seed cotton yield were similar wp could be increased by either increasing the yield with the same water applied or obtained the same yield with reducing water use irrigation amount also significantly affected seed cotton yield and wp the largest seed cotton yield and wp were obtained under 94 and 92 of full irrigation respectively figs 3 and 4 which was consistent with fan et al 2018 who found the irrigation amount to obtain maximum wp was less than the amount of water required to obtain maximum yield water deficit by about 6 and 8 of full irrigation could be thus considered for cotton besides the result also indicated that seed cotton yield was strongly correlated with the irrigation proportion to full irrigation fig 3e which was similar to that reported by basal et al 2010 hussein et al 2014 and yang et al 2015 when the irrigation amount was within the range of 80 100 of full irrigation seed cotton yield was largest and the difference was significant which was generally consistent with daƒüdelen et al 2006 and onder et al 2009 however basal et al 2010 found that compared to full irrigation a reduction of irrigation amount by 25 did not have significant impact on seed cotton yield it was probably due to the differences in irrigation frequency and timing and planting pattern steduto et al 2009 besides previous studies have found that a high planting density could save water without reducing seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b and the peak bloom growth stage was most sensitive to water stress himanshu et al 2019 4 3 effects of climate conditions on seed cotton yield and wp unsurprisingly the impact of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield and wp also varied with different climate factors such as precipitation and temperature fig 5 our results indicated that higher seed cotton yield was achieved in regions with higher seasonal precipitation 120 mm under deficit irrigation fig 5a which was similar to the finding of jalota et al 2006 who found that when the precipitation was 500 mm seed cotton yield increased with the increasing precipitation amount this is probably related to the fact that cotton is often planted in arid and semi arid areas and the annual precipitation is relatively low which cannot meet the growth need of cotton especially under deficit irrigation therefore when the precipitation amount increases it will increase seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation on the other hand higher wp was obtained when seasonal precipitation was 120 mm fig 5b a possible reason for this can be that lower precipitation caused a decline in crop evapotranspiration the larger reduction in seed cotton yield occurred when average annual temperature was 10 but the 95 confidence intervals overlapped between the two temperature ranges however wp increased with the decrease in average annual temperature but the difference between them was not significant fig 5c and d it may be largely related to that lower temperature prolonged the development of cotton bolls mao and dong 2003 and caused a decline in seed cotton yield wue is the coordination effect of leaf spread and photosynthetic capacity galle et al 2016 although higher temperature achieved higher seed cotton yield it also increased water use and wp thus changed insignificantly 4 4 effects of soil properties on seed cotton yield and wp our meta analysis also indicated that the reduction in seed cotton yield and increase in wp were affected by soil texture soil bulk density and soil ph with varying degrees fig 6 regarding soil texture slightly greater seed cotton yield and wp were observed in the medium soil 19 3 and 5 2 respectively than fine 19 9 and 4 5 respectively and coarse soils 20 9 and 2 7 respectively under deficit irrigation fig 6a this result can be attributed to that fine textured soils with higher clay content had poor soil aeration than medium and coarse textured soils bollmann and conrad 2004 goorahoo et al 2002 tiedje 1991 therefore it reduced cotton root respiration and caused a decrease in water and fertilizer uptake du et al 2018 in contrast the capacity of holding water and nutrients was poorer in the coarse soil compared with that in medium and fine soils lu et al 2021 however soil texture affected seed cotton yield and wp under deficit irrigation without significant difference fig 6b indicating that deficit irrigation caused a decrease in seed cotton yield and an increase of wp among different soil textures seed cotton yield decreased with the increasing soil bulk density but there was no significant difference between the two soil bulk densities however wp significantly increased with the increase in soil bulk density fig 6c and d this result could be explained by that soils with high soil bulk density was more compacted which inhibited the root growth ityel et al 2014 besides high soil bulk density affected the absorption of water fertilizer and microelements from the root zone wolkowski and lowery 2008 resulting in a larger decline in seed cotton yield however wp was higher when cotton was planted in soils with higher soil bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 which was possibly because soils with low soil bulk density had obvious higher infiltration and evaporation rates wang et al 2018 and wp was thus not necessarily high 4 5 effects of mulching mode and fertilization rate on seed cotton yield and wp film mulching curtails the water evaporation from the soil and holds water near the root zone and ridges increased the ability of collecting rainwater fan et al 2014 2021 eldoma et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 2020 collecting rainwater reduced the impact of deficit irrigation on crops li et al 2019 yu et al 2018 also found ridge planting with film mulching was benefit to increasing soil temperature maintaining soil moisture and increasing yield compared with flat planting with film mulching percentage changes of seed cotton yield and water productivity under ridge planting with film mulching were larger than those under flat planting without film mulching fig 7a and b generally crop nutrient absorption comes partly from external fertilizer supply and soil fertility chuan et al 2013 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 many previous studies have demonstrated that seed cotton yield increased with the increasing fertilization rate until up to some thresholds wang et al 2018 2020 wu et al 2014 our study also found that seed cotton yield under deficit irrigation increased with the increase in fertilization rates and reached the maximum at medium to high fertilization rates fig 7c e and g this may be due to that the appropriate fertilizer application contributes to crop growth and better performance of photosynthesis albrizio et al 2010 and improves the drought resistance of cotton in addition the better coupling effect between water and fertilizer occurs at medium to high fertilization rates some studies also suggested that the appropriate fertilizer application is helpful to improve the crop water productivity xie et al 2011 aujla et al 2005 wang et al 2018 this may be due to that high fertilization rate disrupts the balance between vegetative and reproductive growth of cotton leading to overly strong nutrient uptake postponed maturity and reduced production fritschi et al 2003 this study also found that high fertilization rates all led to the reduction in water productivity with varying degree of success fig 7d f and h 4 6 limitations of this meta analysis this paper investigated the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation with regards to irrigation practices climate conditions soil properties mulching modes and fertilization rates nevertheless due to the insufficient data less than two data the responses of wp to deficit irrigation under flood irrigation and water deficit at bud and boll opening stage were not analyzed therefore more wp data under flood irrigation and water deficit at bud and boll opening stage should be further analyzed and concluded additionally analyzing the distribution of paired data points of effect sizes of seed cotton yield and wp the data of irrigation method soil ph and phosphorus and potassium fertilizer were not included because irrigation method only included drip irrigation soil was only alkaline soil 7 and there was no data of phosphorus and potassium rates of 79 105 100 133 kg ha 1 in the collected database which needs to be further investigated in this paper there were 430 and 161 observations of seed cotton yield and wp respectively however not all subgroups were listed in each paper therefore the total data of each subgroup analysis was not all equal to 430 and 161 for seed cotton yield and wp respectively besides the growth stage of cotton was not clearly given in some papers and a reasonable calculation was thus made based on days after planting provided in the paper this meta analysis investigated the effects of deficit irrigation on seed cotton yield and wp nevertheless other factors such as cotton variety wan et al 2018 irrigation frequency thorp et al 2020 and planting density zhang et al 2016 might also affected the results future studies are needed to consider more factors and analyze their effect on the responses of seed cotton yield and wp to deficit irrigation 5 conclusions deficit irrigation performed better under 80 100 full irrigation drip irrigation was more beneficial for cotton production than sprinkler and furrow irrigation under deficit irrigation deficit irrigation occurred throughout the growing season of cotton was most undesirable a significantly higher seed cotton yield was obtained in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm and average annual temperature of 10 29 however wp was higher in regions with seasonal precipitation 120 mm and average annual temperature 10 but there was no significant difference between them there was no significant difference in seed cotton yield and wp among soil textures wp in soils with higher bulk density 1 35 g cm 3 was significantly higher than that with lower bulk density but there was no significant difference in seed cotton yield between the two soil bulk densities as for soil ph the alkaline soil 7 was conducive to higher seed cotton yield seed cotton yield and wp were both significantly affected by fertilization rate and seed cotton yield increased with the increasing fertilization rate until up to some thresholds the appropriate application rates of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were 300 400 kg n ha 1 79 105 kg p ha 1 and 100 133 kg k ha 1 respectively importantly the proportions of various subgroups in the goal zone a b were analyzed to provide a basis for the better application of deficit irrigation in practice declaration
