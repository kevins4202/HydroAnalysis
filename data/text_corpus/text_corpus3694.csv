18470,the concentration of silver nanoparticles nano ag in aqueous media influences the kinetics of ion release hence the transformation and stability of nano ag are also influenced the stability dissolution and further transformation of nano ag in aqueous media at predicted environmental concentrations pecs μg l may differ from that reported at higher concentrations analytical techniques characterizing nanoparticles nps at μg l have advantages and limitations including an inherent bias based on theoretical and analytical considerations as well as the matrix effects in this work we applied nanoparticle tracking analysis nta single particle icp ms sp icp ms and localized surface plasmon resonance lspr analysis to study the stability and dissolution of nano ag with different nominal sizes 20 40 80 and 100 nm at pecs in synthetic wastewater sww the influence of the main wastewater constituents such as organic matter cl s2 po4 3 and nh4 on the stability and dissolution of nano ag 40 nm at pecs was also determined diagrams of the predominant species of silver exposed to major ligands were generated using minteq after 5 h in sww 20 nm nano ag dissolved 19 27 and 40 nm nano ag dissolved 14 8 aggregates of ag particles were clearly noted for 80 and 100 nm nano ag after 5 h of exposure to sww aggregates size also ranged very similar for both techniques nta and sp icp ms 29 211 nm and 38 241 for nta and 48 210 and 50 220 nm for sp icp ms respectively monodispersed size distribution 22 85 nm and low dissolution up to 5 1 of nano ag at pecs were observed in presence of organic matter 5 800 μg l and po4 3 9 5 47 5 mg l while precipitation and higher dissolution up to 74 9 were observed in media containing either cl 0 07 10 64 g l s2 0 32 32 1 mg l or nh4 36 90 mg l respectively speciation diagrams predict the formation of ag2s s and agcl s and soluble species such as agclx x 1 agnh3 and ag nh3 2 when ag at pecs in wastewater the nta and sp icp ms were suitable techniques for sizing nano ag in wastewater at pecs at experimented nominal sizes sp icp ms was also useful to quantify the coexistence of ag and nano ag the lspr analysis served to determine the relative persistence of original nano ag at pecs in the wastewater during the first 5 h after spiking graphical abstract image 1 keywords single particle icp ms nanoparticle tracking analysis surface plasmon resonance ag np dissolution wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction silver nanoparticles nano ag are incorporated in products due to their known antibacterial activity zhang et al 2018 goods containing nano ag include water filters paints cosmetics deodorants clothing textiles food packaging functionalized plastics medical devices wound dressings among others cascio et al 2015 mcgillicuddy et al 2017 the expected release of nano ag and silver ions ag from these products has raised concerns about their potential effects with regard to health and the environment sekine et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2018 the pathways for release of nano ag and other engineered nanomaterials enms in the environment have being studied via modeling keller and lazareva 2013 lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 and via nanometrology lead et al 2018 this last approach includes physical and chemical techniques to detect quantify or characterize the enms in the environmental matrices bitragunta et al 2017 kaegi et al 2013 mitrano et al 2012 in both approaches models and nanometrology wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been considered as a crucial barrier that can remove the nps released to the wastewater before they enter the environment cao et al 2018 lazareva and keller 2014 westerhoff et al 2015 in many cases wwtps can remove over 90 of nps as the sewage passes throughout the physical chemical and biological treatment processes cervantes avilés et al 2019 kaegi et al 2013 westerhoff et al 2018 some transformation of the enms such as nano ag is expected before during and after wastewater treatment facilities in the sewer in the wwtp and later when the effluent is discharged into water bodies brunetti et al 2015 li et al 2013 ma et al 2013 therefore it is important to understand that the potential fate and health effects of the original nps may not reflect those of the materials that are discharged into the environment zhang et al 2016 the main transformation processes of nano ag in environmental media have been studied widely kaegi et al 2013 levard et al 2012 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however most studies have considered nps at mg l levels to minimize errors e g due to detection limits in several techniques applied to study the stability size dissolution and transformation processes of nps e g dynamic light scattering dls transmission electron microscopy tem scanning electron microscopy sem atomic force microscopy afm fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs and field flow fractionation fff for example a multimethod characterization at 1 30 and 100 mg l of zno and tio2 nps in environmental media showed differential aggregate formation at the various concentrations indicating that the number of particles influences their stability domingos et al 2009 since the predicted environmental concentrations pecs of many enms including nano ag in aquatic environments are at μg l levels and below lazareva and keller 2014 maurer jones et al 2013 there is a need to understand the stability and transformation of these enms under more realistic conditions in addition to the np concentration levels np size conditions and characteristics of the media can influence enm stability and dissolution rate ivask et al 2014 the stability of nano ag in aquatic environments is influenced by temperature and ph mcgillicuddy et al 2017 ultraviolet visible radiation li et al 2018 yu et al 2016 organic matter content delay et al 2011 lowry et al 2012 yu et al 2016 and ionic strength delay et al 2011 li et al 2018 the stability and dissolution of nano ag are also affected by particular ligands such as cl levard et al 2013b li et al 2018 s2 kaegi et al 2013 levard et al 2011 2013a and o2 zhang et al 2018 which form stable species of silver such as agcl ag2s and ag2o respectively lowry et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 in wastewater some of the soluble constituents can influence nano ag transformations doolette et al 2013 for example so4 2 can be anaerobically reduced to s2 in the sewer which may form ag2s when ag is present the transformation of nano ag into ag2s in a sewer channel was studied by using extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs techniques kaegi et al 2013 results showed the crystallization of ag2s and coarsening of an ag2s shell on the surface of the nano ag kaegi et al 2013 making the nps less toxic than the original nano ag levard et al 2012 2013a however sulfidization occurred at 3 8 4 8 mg l of s2 when 50 mg l nano ag were spiked into a sewer channel kaegi et al 2013 although the s2 concentrations were in the expected range for municipal wastewater 3 19 mg l metcalf and eddy 2014 the spiked ag concentration were much higher than pecs 2 18 μg l blaser et al 2008 and measured concentrations of nano ag in wastewater between 14 ng l cervantes avilés et al 2019 and 200 ng l mitrano et al 2012 since the concentration of nano ag limits the kinetics of ion release zhang et al 2018 the formation of ag2s in the presence of nano ag at the pecs may differ from studies at mg l level the interaction between cl and nano ag in water results in the precipitation of agcl s this process has a strong dependence on cl ag molar ratios but the studies were performed at 2 215 mg l of nano ag and 0 6 29 g l of nacl levard et al 2013b results at pecs may differ substantially since the cl ag molar ratios will be quite different the formation of an agcl s shell was also reported when 0 2 mg l nano ag was exposed to 0 6 g l of nacl li et al 2018 the cl concentrations expected in some aquatic environments such as wastewater reclaimed water and surface water are 0 03 0 3 g l apha 2005 which are generally lower than those used in several transformation experiments 0 6 29 g l impellitteri et al 2009 levard et al 2013b li et al 2018 since the stability and dissolution of nano ag for low cl conditions remains poorly understood studies at more realistic concentration scenarios of both cl and nano ag are needed to determine the dissolution pattern of nano ag the formation of agclx x 1 species and the size distribution of the persisting nano ag in addition to the ligands mentioned above s2 and cl wastewater contains some other major chemical compounds such as nh4 and po4 3 which can influence the stability dissolution and later transformation of nano ag during their transport in the sewage the sources of municipal wastewater flow are residential areas commercial districts facilities for recreational activities and educational institutions lusk et al 2017 metcalf and eddy 2014 the main constituents of municipal wastewater are organic and inorganic solids soluble compounds such as organic matter organic nitrogen e g urea and inorganic nitrogen e g nh4 no3 no2 organic and inorganic phosphorus cervantes avilés et al 2017 van loosdrecht et al 2016 and other major ions such as so4 2 co3 2 na and cl the concentration of wastewater constituents vary according to several factors including flowrate population and even the season jin et al 2017 liu et al 2016 information on the effects of the variability of these factors on the stability of nano ag at pec is also scarce as stated earlier the detection level of some measurement techniques has led to use np concentrations much higher than pecs during characterization experiments nevertheless the use of multiple analytical techniques when characterizing nps has been strongly recommended to differentiate their inherent bias brar and verma 2011 domingos et al 2009 louie et al 2016 due to differences in preparation techniques and fundamental principles nanoparticle tracking analysis nta carr and wright 2013 mehrabi et al 2017 and single particle inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms degueldre and favarger 2003 donovan et al 2016 laborda et al 2014 montaño et al 2014 are techniques used for particle sizing with minimum sample preparation nta has multiple applications in nanomedicine including the characterization of enms carrying drugs in complex systems carr and wright 2013 and the sizing of reference materials such as au particles mehrabi et al 2017 roesslein 2018 as with other sizing techniques sedimentation of nps may take place during the nta at mg l levels domingos et al 2009 however the advantages of nta include a lower concentration detection limit compared to dls as well as the visualization and characterization of nps at pecs korenstein et al 2013 sp icp ms is another technique that can be used to quantify and characterize nps at ng l cervantes avilés et al 2019 hadioui et al 2014 mitrano et al 2012 montaño et al 2014 and determine the ionic concentration released from the nps at pec levels in environmental and complex matrices azimzada et al 2017 the simultaneous use of sp icp ms and nta can yield new insights on the stability of nps at pecs in complex media that was not possible to observe with previous methods due to their high detection limits understanding the stability of nano ag at pecs and their transformation into soluble and insoluble ag products under realistic water conditions is relevant for the detection and quantification of nano ag in real environmental media ecotoxicological studies life cycle risk assessments and their regulation in this work we determined the stability and dissolution of nano ag with different nominal sizes 20 40 80 and 100 nm at realistic concentrations in wastewater by a multi technique approach we also studied the influence of the main ligands and other important constituents of wastewater on the stability and dissolution of nano ag the multi technique approach included the nta sp icp ms and the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr modeling of the chemical interactions between ligands and ag was also carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials deionized di water at constant 18 2 mω cm was obtained from a nanopure water purification system thermo scientific and used in all nps suspensions and solutions synthetic wastewater sww was prepared according to a previous study cervantes avilés et al 2016 in brief 380 4 mg l d glucose sigma aldrich 45 1 mg l nh4oh 14 8 m fisher scientific 14 4 mg l k2hpo4 sigma aldrich 14 2 mg l nacl sigma aldrich 8 8 mg l mgso4 7h2o fisher scientific and 3 8 mg l cacl2 2h2o fisher scientific were mixed nacl k2hpo4 and nh4oh were also used in selected experiments naoh sigma aldrich and hno3 bdh aristar ultra grade were used to adjust ph at 7 of sww and experiments na2s fisher scientific was dehydrated at 105 c for 24 h before use suwannee river natural organic matter srnom was obtained from the international humic substances society and used as natural organic matter nom source in selected experiments a 50 mg l suspension of au nanoparticles with nominal size of 60 nm in 2 mm sodium citrate was purchased from nanocomposix inc and used for calibration in the nta studies and as reference material in sp icp ms measurements stock aqueous suspensions 20 mg l of nano ag coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone ag pvp with nominal sizes of 20 40 80 and 100 nm were purchased from sigma aldrich ethanol 99 5 acs reagent absolute acros organics for cleaning of the lm10 viewing unit in the nta certified ionic standards of au 100 μg ml and ag 10 μg ml in 2 hcl and 2 hno3 agilent technologies inc respectively were used as the corresponding elemental response factor during sp icp ms measurements hcl 34 37 and hno3 67 70 of ultra high purity for quantitative trace metal analysis at the parts per trillion ng l level bdh aristar ultra grade were used to dilute the calibration ionic standards chelex 100 resin with 50 100 mesh and a capacity of 0 7 meq ml was acquired from sigma aldrich and used to remove the ionic form of silver immediately before sp icp ms measurements polypropylene tubes with 1 6 mm of internal diameter and 14 cm of effective length were used as a column for the chelex 100 resin glass wool sigma aldrich was placed at the beginning and end of the columns all solutions and suspensions were prepared in metal free polypropylene tubes 2 2 ag nanoparticles characterization the ag pvp np suspensions 1 mg l in di water of all the sizes were characterized in terms of the zeta potential zp lspr uv 1800 shimadzu and size before analysis ag pvp np suspensions were sonicated for 20 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz by using an ultrasonic bath bransonic emerson zp was determined by laser doppler velocimetry zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical ltd lspr was determined by the absorption spectra 300 600 nm in the uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu which was equipped with a halogen lamp size was determined via nta nanosight lm10 malvern panalytical ltd ethanol 99 5 was used to clean the lm10 viewing unit in between samples 2 3 nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nta was used to determine the size distribution of ag pvp nps in sww and in the particular water constituents such as nom cl s2 po4 3 and nh4 measurements were performed in the nanosight lm10 with a laser output of 65 mw at 405 nm the nanosight was equipped with a scientific cmos camera which worked at 20x magnification during all experiments size calibration was performed using nano ag 40 nm and au nps 60 nm at 100 μg l in di water which were measured during pre processing of samples to optimize the parameters in terms of particle concentration and size the operating parameters are reported in table 1 and were according to the parameters validated by the european nanomedicine characterisation laboratory euncl for nta roesslein 2018 samples were measured five times with 30 s captures data collection and further analysis were conducted by using the nta 2 3 analytical software around 2 000 frames were processed for each sample with at least 6 000 tracks per run the inlet and outlet ports of the lm10 cell were capped after uploading the samples nta studies were performed no more than 1 h after sample preparation the results reflect the size distribution that occur 90 and 50 of the time as well as the median size 2 4 single particle icp ms sp icp ms analysis the concentration of the nano ag and their size distribution after exposure to sww and the different solutions nom cl s2 po4 3 and nh4 were determined using an agilent 7900 icp ms santa clara ca usa with the sp icp ms software module the instrument was equipped with an auto sampler and a standard peristaltic pump standard glass concentric nebulizer quartz spray chamber and quartz torch standard nickel sampling and skimmer cones analyses were performed in time resolved analysis tra mode using a dwell time of 100 μs per point without settling time between measurements as previously reported keller et al 2018 montaño et al 2014 the transport efficiencies for au and ag are almost identical however au nps are more stable than nano ag wimmer et al 2018 therefore we used au nps 60 nm in diameter in sodium citrate buffer nanocomposix inc diluted to 100 ng l with di water to evaluate the nebulization efficiency which was used for data conversion from raw signal to np size the ag ionic standard was diluted to 1 μg l with 1 hno3 and was used to determine the elemental response factor the instrument settings used for the sp icp ms analysis are summarized in table 2 the samples were diluted with di water to ensure the nano ag concentrations were between 50 and 500 ng l to make sure that the samples were fully homogenized after dilution they were vortexed at 5 000 rpm for 2 min then the samples were passed throughout a chelex 100 column to avoid false positives by ionic silver during sp icp ms measurements azimzada et al 2017 hadioui et al 2014 before each sample chelex 100 column was regenerated by washing with 5 beds volumes of 1 n hcl 5 bed volumes of di water at ph 7 5 bed volumes of 1 n naoh and 5 bed volumes of di water at ph 7 the sp icp ms method setup data collection and analysis were controlled via the single nanoparticle application module method wizard in the agilent icp ms masshunter software version c 01 03 build 505 16 patch 3 as in our previous study cervantes avilés et al 2019 results of nano ag correspond to the mean and standard deviation of triplicate measurements ag form i e dissolved ag was calculated from the difference between the initial ag load of the samples and the nano ag concentration measured 2 5 stability of ag pvp nps in synthetic wastewater sww over time the size distribution of ag pvp nps and the dissolved ag in sww were evaluated at times 0 and 5 h for each nominal size of 20 40 80 and 100 nm two sets of tubes containing sww were prepared for each nominal size tubes were spiked with 100 μg l ag pvp nps of their respective nominal size all tubes were sonicated for 15 min one set of tubes of each nominal size was left to stand for 5 h and the other was analyzed immediately in both sets of tubes ag pvp nps were sized by both nta and sp icp ms analysis sedimentation was monitored during the 5 h by using the uv vis spectrophotometer which measured the absorbance at lspr of the nanoparticles every min for 300 min 5 h in sww and in di water as control the experiments were performed in triplicate and the results presented are the average of the runs 2 6 influence of nom and cl on the size and surface charge of ag pvp nps the effects of nom 5 800 μg l and cl 0 07 10 64 g l on 40 nm ag pvp nps were evaluated by measuring zp size as well as the dissolved ag from ag particles particle size distribution was measured via nta all experiments containing either nom or cl were spiked by the same concentration of ag pvp nps 100 μg l tubes were sonicated for 15 min and left to stand 1 h then samples were collected for size zp and silver determinations speciation diagrams based on the experimental concentrations of cl and ag in aqueous media were created in minteq 3 1 2 7 size distribution and dissolution of ag pvp nps in specific wastewater constituents the influence of po4 3 9 5 47 5 mg l nh4 36 90 mg l and s2 0 32 32 mg l on the stability of ag pvp nps with nominal size of 40 nm was studied in terms of size distribution and ag dissolution by using the nta and sp icp ms respectively stock solutions of nh4oh 3 5 g l k2hpo4 1 74 g l and na2s 0 156 g l were prepared and adjusted to ph 7 0 2 with 2 hno3 aliquots from stocks were diluted with di water to reach the experimental concentrations then ag pvp nps were spiked to achieve 100 μg l solutions used in experiments containing s2 were flushed with n2 during 20 min to remove the dissolved oxygen and provide anoxic conditions cervantes avilés et al 2018 all the tubes were sonicated during 15 min and left to stand 1 h until analysis speciation diagrams for experimental concentrations of s2 and ag were created in minteq 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the nta and sp icp ms the concentration used in the calibration of nta was 100 μg l for both ag pvp nps 40 nm and au 60 nm according to the manufacturer these concentrations correspond theoretically to 2 84 108 and 4 58 107 particles ml respectively measured concentrations via nta for ag and au nps were 3 93 108 and 6 80 107 particles ml respectively which represent 1 4 and 1 5 times higher than theoretical particle concentrations see supplementary information fig s1 the overestimation in particle number has already been reported elsewhere for similar concentrations of au nps mehrabi et al 2017 tracking up to 3 times more particles in di water and 2 times in landfill leachate our results indicate that the over counting of particles is also observed for ag pvp nps even though they are less stable than au nps and some dissolution may take place wimmer et al 2018 the median sizes were 41 5 nm for ag pvp and 58 3 nm for au fig s1 in line with the nominal size hence the overestimation in particle number of ag pvp and au nps did not affect the median size determination of either particle type the size distribution for 90 of particles were between 26 and 67 nm for ag and 40 75 nm for the au particles the amplitude of the size distribution also reflects that au particles are more stable than ag to calibrate the sp icp ms 100 ng l of 60 nm au nps were used during calibration nanoparticle counts were clearly differentiated from the background ionic concentration fig s2 a dwell time of 100 μs per point was suitable to distinguish the number of events particles from the ionic noise the ability of microsecond sp icp ms to improve the signal to noise ratio has been demonstrated for metal nps montaño et al 2014 the size distribution for the au nps 60 nm used as reference material was quite symmetric and the median experimental size coincided with the nominal size fig s2 3 2 ag pvp nps characterization all nominal ag pvp nps were negatively charged in di water with zp between 19 7 and 23 8 mv fig 1 a similar to other pvp coated nano ag auvinen et al 2017 the lspr of ag pvp nps clearly showed a size dependence fig 1b high linearity r2 0 98 was observed between nominal size of the ag pvp nps and the corresponding lspr fig 1c which moves towards the visible region as size increases this indicates that ag pvp nps smaller than 20 nm are more sensitive to ultraviolet radiation while larger ones are optically sensitive in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum for the nominal 20 40 80 and 100 nm ag pvp nps the median sizes measured via nta were all in nm 28 4 41 5 75 8 and 99 4 and the sizes of 90 of the particles ranged from all in nm 18 55 26 67 45 119 and 76 138 respectively fig s3 it was observed that for all nominal ag pvp nps the measured particle concentrations were also higher than the theoretical concentrations fig s3 the over counting of particle concentration in the nta can be also influenced by the particle size 3 3 stability of ag pvp nps in synthetic wastewater over time the response of lspr of ag particles with nominal sizes of 20 40 80 and 100 nm in sww over time is observed in fig 2 according to lspr the persistence of ag pvp nps in sww was higher for those with nominal size of 80 and 100 nm followed by 40 nm and lowest for the 20 nm ag pvp nps fig 2 which was unexpected the symbols of ag pvp nps with 40 nm in fig 2 are behind those for 80 nm since both trends were very similar up to 150 min since the absorbance reflects only the persistence of original nps the missing fraction of the ag pvp nps for all nominal sizes 1 a a0 can be attributed to both the partial dissolution of the ag pvp nps and the precipitation of aggregates in sww the aggregates formation was noted in the nta measurements fig 3 the size distribution for all nominal sizes was broader 5 h after spiking the ag pvp nps especially in the upper size range which may contain aggregates fig 3 in experiments with particles of nominal size of 80 and 100 nm the amplitude in the size distribution for the 90 of the particles was 29 211 nm and 38 241 nm respectively the median size observed for 80 and 100 nm increased to 91 and 125 respectively while that for 20 and 40 nm particles did not change substantially after 5 h fig 3 aggregate formation of ag particles in sww was also observed via the sp icp ms measurements fig 4 in experiments containing ag particles with nominal size of 80 and 100 nm aggregates up to 210 and 220 nm were detected respectively which is in line with nta measurements for 40 nm ag particles the size distribution shifted to smaller sizes with particles of 30 nm as the most frequent size although a few aggregates between 60 and 100 nm were observed in the case of 20 nm ag pvp nps in sww a few aggregates were also detected in the range of 60 120 nm compared to nta sp icp ms showed a limitation for sizing nano ag below 18 nm this has been already observed when nano ag are quantified and characterized in water or wastewater azimzada et al 2017 cervantes avilés et al 2019 hadioui et al 2014 lee et al 2014 hence characterizing nano ag smaller than 20 nm by sp icp ms is highly sensitive even when using ion exchange resin column the percentage of dissolved ag immediately after spiking the ag pvp nps into sww was between 4 06 and 10 96 for all particles at time 0 h table 3 after 5 h of exposure to sww the dissolved fraction of silver was between 8 7 and 19 27 dissolution of ag from ag pvp nps at pecs increased over time 0 5 h for all nominal sizes 20 40 80 and 100 nm however the highest dissolution was observed for the smaller particles 20 nm hence the decrease in the intensity of the lspr for these nps fig 2 can be attributed mainly to the dissolution of particles the dissolution of 40 nm ag pvp was also noticeable 14 8 after 5 h of contact with sww based on the sp icp ms measurements the median and the most frequent size of these particles became smaller table 3 the nominal particle size with less dissolved fraction at pecs were the 80 and 100 nm which is in line with lspr analysis fig 2 and indicates that these particles persisted more in suspension in sww than smaller nominal sizes as it is observed in table 3 the median size of the 80 and 100 nm ag pvp nps increased after 5 h which also agrees with the nta measurements the partial dissolution of ag pvp nps is inferred by the particle concentration measured in the nta which decreased for all particle sizes at 5 h fig s4 in the case of ag pvp nps of 20 and 40 nm the particles concentrations presented a clear peak of the most frequent size at 20 and 35 nm respectively for particles with nominal size of 80 and 100 nm the particle concentration was distributed in a wide range from 25 to 250 nm indicating both partial dissolution and aggregate formation increasing size aggregate formation and dissolution of ag are a function of the wastewater composition since 40 nm ag pvp nps exhibited both aggregation and dissolution this nominal size was selected to study the effects of specific wastewater constituents nom cl s2 po4 3 and nh4 on the stability and dissolution of nag 3 4 influence of nom and chloride on the size and surface charge of ag pvp nps nom and cl are important components in wastewater and in many environmental water matrices based on the nta measurements the presence of nom in aqueous media did not significantly affect the size distribution of nominal 40 nm ag pvp nps fig 5 a while the median size of the ag pvp nps at different nom concentrations remained close to the nominal size 40 nm size distributions were in the range of 22 85 nm although nano ag are already functionalized increasing nom concentration resulted in a more negative zp fig 6 a nom may become entangled with pvp in the surface of nps yu et al 2014 the observed stability of ag pvp nps at pecs in combination with nom 5 μg l may favor their transport along the wwtp and other environmental water matrices such as lentic lotic and coastal ecosystems in the case of ag pvp nps exposed to cl their size distributions became much broader fig 5b than in the nom experiments the amplitude 5 95 percentiles of the size distributions for all cl tested were between 98 and 142 nm with a maximum of up to 210 nm in contrast to nom experiments the median size of the ag pvp particles increased by almost 3 times as the concentration of cl increased from 0 07 to 10 64 g l while zp tended to zero as the cl concentration increased fig 6b the concentration of ag particles decreased in the presence of cl except in the presence of 0 71 1 42 and 2 13 g cl l fig s5 this further suggests that as ag was dissolving it was rapidly precipitated around the core of the remaining nps the speciation diagrams created in minteq fig s6 may help to understand three key points of this experiment i agcl s is formed in the presence of 1 42 g cl l at low ag concentrations 140 μg l ii the precipitation of agcl s in the presence of 2 13 g cl l is not thermodynamically favored and iii the formation of agclx x 1 species for all tested cl concentrations can explain the partial dissolution of particles based on these points one can infer the release of ag the equilibrium of the agclx x 1 species and the formation of agcl s as the shell growth of the particles likely the deposition of an agcl ag2o layer our results indicate that the formation of agcl s could take place for molar ratios cl ag 2100 at 0 07 g cl l when nano ag are present at pecs at higher nano ag concentration mg l the formation of agcl s was observed at lower cl ag 535 levard et al 2013b dissolved ag from ag particles in the presence of nom or cl exhibited an opposite behavior fig 7 dissolution of ag pvp nps at pecs decreased from 42 2 to 5 1 as nom increased from 10 μg l to 300 μg l after 1 h of exposure fig 7 probably because nom entangled with pvp inhibits the release of ag yu et al 2014 or that nom plays an important role in binding free ag wang et al 2015 in either case free ag would likely be at low concentrations in environments rich in nom in saline media the dissolved ag increased 38 4 74 9 in 1 h as the concentration of cl increased dissolved ag from ag pvp nps at pecs in saline media can rapidly form agcl s and some of the soluble agclx x 1 species however the overall dissolution in the environment can be higher since the residence time in many ecosystems is longer 3 5 effect of wastewater constituents po4 3 nh4 and s2 on the stability of ag pvp nps in addition to organic matter and chloride other wastewater constituents such as po4 3 nh4 and s2 can play an important role in the aggregation and dissolution of ag pvp nps the size distribution of ag pvp nps in aqueous media at low 9 5 mg l and high 47 5 mg l po4 3 did not reflect significant differences compared with that of ag pvp nps in di water fig 8 a this is in contrast to other nps such as zno cuo and fe oxides which interact significantly with po4 3 to form stable forms of phosphate daou et al 2007 herrmann et al 2014 ortelli et al 2017 for ag pvp nps exposed to a high phosphate concentration the size distribution and particle concentration were similar to ag pvp nps in the control phosphate free nanopure water fig s7 in addition the dissolved ag was lower in the presence of a high concentration of phosphate fig 9 a indicating that ag pvp nps remain stable without significant dissolution at a high po4 3 concentration in the case of nh4 the median size of ag pvp nps did not change substantially at low 36 mg l nh4 concentration but was noticeably increased at a high 90 mg l nh4 level the size distribution of ag particles was broader at both low and high nh4 concentrations relative to nanopure water with some particles larger than 200 nm fig 8a the particle concentration indicates that the number of particles between 50 and 200 nm increased as the ammonium concentration increased fig s7 and there were fewer particles below 50 nm dissolution in 1 h was 26 3 and 48 5 of the initial load of nano ag for low and high ammonium concentration respectively fig 9a based on the speciation diagrams the formation of agnh3 and ag nh3 2 may take place in these experimental conditions fig s8 the influence of sulfide on ag pvp nps at pecs reflected a wider size distribution of ag pvp nps with nominal size of 40 nm fig 8b the median size did not change significantly 55 nm in average for all s2 concentrations fig 8b this was also observed in the particle concentration plots where the peaks were between 50 and 60 nm for all s2 concentrations fig s7 besides the particle concentration increased as the concentration of s2 in the media increased fig s7 if we consider that the concentration of ag decreased as the sulfide present in media increased fig 9b and that the speciation diagrams performed in minteq predicted that more than 99 of the ag forms stable ag2s s at these experimental s2 concentrations fig s9 then the increased size of the ag particles at pecs is attributed to the formation of an ag2s s shell this experiment confirms that ag2s s formation on nano ag at pecs is very likely in wastewater with 0 32 mg l of sulfide the coarsening of ag particles with ag2s s has been already reported in previous experiments which were performed at concentrations much higher than the pecs namely 50 mg l kaegi et al 2013 and 97 mg l levard et al 2011 4 conclusions in this work we applied nta sp icp ms and lspr to study the stability and dissolution of ag pvp nps with nominal sizes of 20 40 80 and 100 nm at pecs in wastewater and its important constituents such as nom cl po4 3 nh4 and s2 although dissolution of nano ag at pecs in sww was observed for all nominal sizes smaller nanoparticles were dissolved more after 5 h of exposure 14 8 and 19 27 of initial load of 40 and 20 nm nano ag respectively the lspr analysis was in line with the dissolution levels measured indicating that ag particles with nominal size of 80 and 100 nm were more persistent than those with nominal size of 20 and 40 nm nta and sp icp ms resulted in very similar size distributions of nano ag at pecs in sww both techniques detected aggregate formation in sww after 5 h especially for 80 and 100 nm nano ag which ranged in nta from 29 to 211 nm and 38 241 nm respectively and via sp icp ms from 48 to 210 nm and 50 220 nm respectively with regards to the effect of wastewater constituents on the stability and dissolution of ag pvp nps at pecs even at low concentrations of nom 5 μg l and po4 3 9 5 mg l the dissolution of ag decreased and their presence served to stabilize the ag pvp nps the presence of nh4 led the dissolution of 26 3 and 48 5 of the initial load of ag pvp nps for low and high ammonium concentration in water mainly forming soluble agnh3 and ag nh3 2 however cl and s2 drive the dissolution and precipitation of newly formed solids either in the shell of the original nps or as separate particles our experiments indicated that agcl s may form preferentially at molar ratios cl ag 2100 at pecs and that ag2s s formation can be a strong pattern in wastewater with 0 32 mg l of sulfide for nano ag at pecs in all cases including the sww full dissolution of the ag particles was not observed even at pecs within the timeframe of these experiments 0 5 h hence a fraction of the original particles possibly with a stabilizing shell could pass through the wwtp onto the aquatic environment additional insights are gained when performing these experiments at pecs such as the interactions with the main wastewater constituents the combined use of nta and sp icp ms can serve to better understand the size distributions and particles concentrations over time as well as the

18470,the concentration of silver nanoparticles nano ag in aqueous media influences the kinetics of ion release hence the transformation and stability of nano ag are also influenced the stability dissolution and further transformation of nano ag in aqueous media at predicted environmental concentrations pecs μg l may differ from that reported at higher concentrations analytical techniques characterizing nanoparticles nps at μg l have advantages and limitations including an inherent bias based on theoretical and analytical considerations as well as the matrix effects in this work we applied nanoparticle tracking analysis nta single particle icp ms sp icp ms and localized surface plasmon resonance lspr analysis to study the stability and dissolution of nano ag with different nominal sizes 20 40 80 and 100 nm at pecs in synthetic wastewater sww the influence of the main wastewater constituents such as organic matter cl s2 po4 3 and nh4 on the stability and dissolution of nano ag 40 nm at pecs was also determined diagrams of the predominant species of silver exposed to major ligands were generated using minteq after 5 h in sww 20 nm nano ag dissolved 19 27 and 40 nm nano ag dissolved 14 8 aggregates of ag particles were clearly noted for 80 and 100 nm nano ag after 5 h of exposure to sww aggregates size also ranged very similar for both techniques nta and sp icp ms 29 211 nm and 38 241 for nta and 48 210 and 50 220 nm for sp icp ms respectively monodispersed size distribution 22 85 nm and low dissolution up to 5 1 of nano ag at pecs were observed in presence of organic matter 5 800 μg l and po4 3 9 5 47 5 mg l while precipitation and higher dissolution up to 74 9 were observed in media containing either cl 0 07 10 64 g l s2 0 32 32 1 mg l or nh4 36 90 mg l respectively speciation diagrams predict the formation of ag2s s and agcl s and soluble species such as agclx x 1 agnh3 and ag nh3 2 when ag at pecs in wastewater the nta and sp icp ms were suitable techniques for sizing nano ag in wastewater at pecs at experimented nominal sizes sp icp ms was also useful to quantify the coexistence of ag and nano ag the lspr analysis served to determine the relative persistence of original nano ag at pecs in the wastewater during the first 5 h after spiking graphical abstract image 1 keywords single particle icp ms nanoparticle tracking analysis surface plasmon resonance ag np dissolution wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction silver nanoparticles nano ag are incorporated in products due to their known antibacterial activity zhang et al 2018 goods containing nano ag include water filters paints cosmetics deodorants clothing textiles food packaging functionalized plastics medical devices wound dressings among others cascio et al 2015 mcgillicuddy et al 2017 the expected release of nano ag and silver ions ag from these products has raised concerns about their potential effects with regard to health and the environment sekine et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2018 the pathways for release of nano ag and other engineered nanomaterials enms in the environment have being studied via modeling keller and lazareva 2013 lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 and via nanometrology lead et al 2018 this last approach includes physical and chemical techniques to detect quantify or characterize the enms in the environmental matrices bitragunta et al 2017 kaegi et al 2013 mitrano et al 2012 in both approaches models and nanometrology wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been considered as a crucial barrier that can remove the nps released to the wastewater before they enter the environment cao et al 2018 lazareva and keller 2014 westerhoff et al 2015 in many cases wwtps can remove over 90 of nps as the sewage passes throughout the physical chemical and biological treatment processes cervantes avilés et al 2019 kaegi et al 2013 westerhoff et al 2018 some transformation of the enms such as nano ag is expected before during and after wastewater treatment facilities in the sewer in the wwtp and later when the effluent is discharged into water bodies brunetti et al 2015 li et al 2013 ma et al 2013 therefore it is important to understand that the potential fate and health effects of the original nps may not reflect those of the materials that are discharged into the environment zhang et al 2016 the main transformation processes of nano ag in environmental media have been studied widely kaegi et al 2013 levard et al 2012 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however most studies have considered nps at mg l levels to minimize errors e g due to detection limits in several techniques applied to study the stability size dissolution and transformation processes of nps e g dynamic light scattering dls transmission electron microscopy tem scanning electron microscopy sem atomic force microscopy afm fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs and field flow fractionation fff for example a multimethod characterization at 1 30 and 100 mg l of zno and tio2 nps in environmental media showed differential aggregate formation at the various concentrations indicating that the number of particles influences their stability domingos et al 2009 since the predicted environmental concentrations pecs of many enms including nano ag in aquatic environments are at μg l levels and below lazareva and keller 2014 maurer jones et al 2013 there is a need to understand the stability and transformation of these enms under more realistic conditions in addition to the np concentration levels np size conditions and characteristics of the media can influence enm stability and dissolution rate ivask et al 2014 the stability of nano ag in aquatic environments is influenced by temperature and ph mcgillicuddy et al 2017 ultraviolet visible radiation li et al 2018 yu et al 2016 organic matter content delay et al 2011 lowry et al 2012 yu et al 2016 and ionic strength delay et al 2011 li et al 2018 the stability and dissolution of nano ag are also affected by particular ligands such as cl levard et al 2013b li et al 2018 s2 kaegi et al 2013 levard et al 2011 2013a and o2 zhang et al 2018 which form stable species of silver such as agcl ag2s and ag2o respectively lowry et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 in wastewater some of the soluble constituents can influence nano ag transformations doolette et al 2013 for example so4 2 can be anaerobically reduced to s2 in the sewer which may form ag2s when ag is present the transformation of nano ag into ag2s in a sewer channel was studied by using extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs techniques kaegi et al 2013 results showed the crystallization of ag2s and coarsening of an ag2s shell on the surface of the nano ag kaegi et al 2013 making the nps less toxic than the original nano ag levard et al 2012 2013a however sulfidization occurred at 3 8 4 8 mg l of s2 when 50 mg l nano ag were spiked into a sewer channel kaegi et al 2013 although the s2 concentrations were in the expected range for municipal wastewater 3 19 mg l metcalf and eddy 2014 the spiked ag concentration were much higher than pecs 2 18 μg l blaser et al 2008 and measured concentrations of nano ag in wastewater between 14 ng l cervantes avilés et al 2019 and 200 ng l mitrano et al 2012 since the concentration of nano ag limits the kinetics of ion release zhang et al 2018 the formation of ag2s in the presence of nano ag at the pecs may differ from studies at mg l level the interaction between cl and nano ag in water results in the precipitation of agcl s this process has a strong dependence on cl ag molar ratios but the studies were performed at 2 215 mg l of nano ag and 0 6 29 g l of nacl levard et al 2013b results at pecs may differ substantially since the cl ag molar ratios will be quite different the formation of an agcl s shell was also reported when 0 2 mg l nano ag was exposed to 0 6 g l of nacl li et al 2018 the cl concentrations expected in some aquatic environments such as wastewater reclaimed water and surface water are 0 03 0 3 g l apha 2005 which are generally lower than those used in several transformation experiments 0 6 29 g l impellitteri et al 2009 levard et al 2013b li et al 2018 since the stability and dissolution of nano ag for low cl conditions remains poorly understood studies at more realistic concentration scenarios of both cl and nano ag are needed to determine the dissolution pattern of nano ag the formation of agclx x 1 species and the size distribution of the persisting nano ag in addition to the ligands mentioned above s2 and cl wastewater contains some other major chemical compounds such as nh4 and po4 3 which can influence the stability dissolution and later transformation of nano ag during their transport in the sewage the sources of municipal wastewater flow are residential areas commercial districts facilities for recreational activities and educational institutions lusk et al 2017 metcalf and eddy 2014 the main constituents of municipal wastewater are organic and inorganic solids soluble compounds such as organic matter organic nitrogen e g urea and inorganic nitrogen e g nh4 no3 no2 organic and inorganic phosphorus cervantes avilés et al 2017 van loosdrecht et al 2016 and other major ions such as so4 2 co3 2 na and cl the concentration of wastewater constituents vary according to several factors including flowrate population and even the season jin et al 2017 liu et al 2016 information on the effects of the variability of these factors on the stability of nano ag at pec is also scarce as stated earlier the detection level of some measurement techniques has led to use np concentrations much higher than pecs during characterization experiments nevertheless the use of multiple analytical techniques when characterizing nps has been strongly recommended to differentiate their inherent bias brar and verma 2011 domingos et al 2009 louie et al 2016 due to differences in preparation techniques and fundamental principles nanoparticle tracking analysis nta carr and wright 2013 mehrabi et al 2017 and single particle inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry sp icp ms degueldre and favarger 2003 donovan et al 2016 laborda et al 2014 montaño et al 2014 are techniques used for particle sizing with minimum sample preparation nta has multiple applications in nanomedicine including the characterization of enms carrying drugs in complex systems carr and wright 2013 and the sizing of reference materials such as au particles mehrabi et al 2017 roesslein 2018 as with other sizing techniques sedimentation of nps may take place during the nta at mg l levels domingos et al 2009 however the advantages of nta include a lower concentration detection limit compared to dls as well as the visualization and characterization of nps at pecs korenstein et al 2013 sp icp ms is another technique that can be used to quantify and characterize nps at ng l cervantes avilés et al 2019 hadioui et al 2014 mitrano et al 2012 montaño et al 2014 and determine the ionic concentration released from the nps at pec levels in environmental and complex matrices azimzada et al 2017 the simultaneous use of sp icp ms and nta can yield new insights on the stability of nps at pecs in complex media that was not possible to observe with previous methods due to their high detection limits understanding the stability of nano ag at pecs and their transformation into soluble and insoluble ag products under realistic water conditions is relevant for the detection and quantification of nano ag in real environmental media ecotoxicological studies life cycle risk assessments and their regulation in this work we determined the stability and dissolution of nano ag with different nominal sizes 20 40 80 and 100 nm at realistic concentrations in wastewater by a multi technique approach we also studied the influence of the main ligands and other important constituents of wastewater on the stability and dissolution of nano ag the multi technique approach included the nta sp icp ms and the localized surface plasmon resonance lspr modeling of the chemical interactions between ligands and ag was also carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials deionized di water at constant 18 2 mω cm was obtained from a nanopure water purification system thermo scientific and used in all nps suspensions and solutions synthetic wastewater sww was prepared according to a previous study cervantes avilés et al 2016 in brief 380 4 mg l d glucose sigma aldrich 45 1 mg l nh4oh 14 8 m fisher scientific 14 4 mg l k2hpo4 sigma aldrich 14 2 mg l nacl sigma aldrich 8 8 mg l mgso4 7h2o fisher scientific and 3 8 mg l cacl2 2h2o fisher scientific were mixed nacl k2hpo4 and nh4oh were also used in selected experiments naoh sigma aldrich and hno3 bdh aristar ultra grade were used to adjust ph at 7 of sww and experiments na2s fisher scientific was dehydrated at 105 c for 24 h before use suwannee river natural organic matter srnom was obtained from the international humic substances society and used as natural organic matter nom source in selected experiments a 50 mg l suspension of au nanoparticles with nominal size of 60 nm in 2 mm sodium citrate was purchased from nanocomposix inc and used for calibration in the nta studies and as reference material in sp icp ms measurements stock aqueous suspensions 20 mg l of nano ag coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone ag pvp with nominal sizes of 20 40 80 and 100 nm were purchased from sigma aldrich ethanol 99 5 acs reagent absolute acros organics for cleaning of the lm10 viewing unit in the nta certified ionic standards of au 100 μg ml and ag 10 μg ml in 2 hcl and 2 hno3 agilent technologies inc respectively were used as the corresponding elemental response factor during sp icp ms measurements hcl 34 37 and hno3 67 70 of ultra high purity for quantitative trace metal analysis at the parts per trillion ng l level bdh aristar ultra grade were used to dilute the calibration ionic standards chelex 100 resin with 50 100 mesh and a capacity of 0 7 meq ml was acquired from sigma aldrich and used to remove the ionic form of silver immediately before sp icp ms measurements polypropylene tubes with 1 6 mm of internal diameter and 14 cm of effective length were used as a column for the chelex 100 resin glass wool sigma aldrich was placed at the beginning and end of the columns all solutions and suspensions were prepared in metal free polypropylene tubes 2 2 ag nanoparticles characterization the ag pvp np suspensions 1 mg l in di water of all the sizes were characterized in terms of the zeta potential zp lspr uv 1800 shimadzu and size before analysis ag pvp np suspensions were sonicated for 20 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz by using an ultrasonic bath bransonic emerson zp was determined by laser doppler velocimetry zetasizer nano zs90 malvern panalytical ltd lspr was determined by the absorption spectra 300 600 nm in the uv vis spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu which was equipped with a halogen lamp size was determined via nta nanosight lm10 malvern panalytical ltd ethanol 99 5 was used to clean the lm10 viewing unit in between samples 2 3 nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nta was used to determine the size distribution of ag pvp nps in sww and in the particular water constituents such as nom cl s2 po4 3 and nh4 measurements were performed in the nanosight lm10 with a laser output of 65 mw at 405 nm the nanosight was equipped with a scientific cmos camera which worked at 20x magnification during all experiments size calibration was performed using nano ag 40 nm and au nps 60 nm at 100 μg l in di water which were measured during pre processing of samples to optimize the parameters in terms of particle concentration and size the operating parameters are reported in table 1 and were according to the parameters validated by the european nanomedicine characterisation laboratory euncl for nta roesslein 2018 samples were measured five times with 30 s captures data collection and further analysis were conducted by using the nta 2 3 analytical software around 2 000 frames were processed for each sample with at least 6 000 tracks per run the inlet and outlet ports of the lm10 cell were capped after uploading the samples nta studies were performed no more than 1 h after sample preparation the results reflect the size distribution that occur 90 and 50 of the time as well as the median size 2 4 single particle icp ms sp icp ms analysis the concentration of the nano ag and their size distribution after exposure to sww and the different solutions nom cl s2 po4 3 and nh4 were determined using an agilent 7900 icp ms santa clara ca usa with the sp icp ms software module the instrument was equipped with an auto sampler and a standard peristaltic pump standard glass concentric nebulizer quartz spray chamber and quartz torch standard nickel sampling and skimmer cones analyses were performed in time resolved analysis tra mode using a dwell time of 100 μs per point without settling time between measurements as previously reported keller et al 2018 montaño et al 2014 the transport efficiencies for au and ag are almost identical however au nps are more stable than nano ag wimmer et al 2018 therefore we used au nps 60 nm in diameter in sodium citrate buffer nanocomposix inc diluted to 100 ng l with di water to evaluate the nebulization efficiency which was used for data conversion from raw signal to np size the ag ionic standard was diluted to 1 μg l with 1 hno3 and was used to determine the elemental response factor the instrument settings used for the sp icp ms analysis are summarized in table 2 the samples were diluted with di water to ensure the nano ag concentrations were between 50 and 500 ng l to make sure that the samples were fully homogenized after dilution they were vortexed at 5 000 rpm for 2 min then the samples were passed throughout a chelex 100 column to avoid false positives by ionic silver during sp icp ms measurements azimzada et al 2017 hadioui et al 2014 before each sample chelex 100 column was regenerated by washing with 5 beds volumes of 1 n hcl 5 bed volumes of di water at ph 7 5 bed volumes of 1 n naoh and 5 bed volumes of di water at ph 7 the sp icp ms method setup data collection and analysis were controlled via the single nanoparticle application module method wizard in the agilent icp ms masshunter software version c 01 03 build 505 16 patch 3 as in our previous study cervantes avilés et al 2019 results of nano ag correspond to the mean and standard deviation of triplicate measurements ag form i e dissolved ag was calculated from the difference between the initial ag load of the samples and the nano ag concentration measured 2 5 stability of ag pvp nps in synthetic wastewater sww over time the size distribution of ag pvp nps and the dissolved ag in sww were evaluated at times 0 and 5 h for each nominal size of 20 40 80 and 100 nm two sets of tubes containing sww were prepared for each nominal size tubes were spiked with 100 μg l ag pvp nps of their respective nominal size all tubes were sonicated for 15 min one set of tubes of each nominal size was left to stand for 5 h and the other was analyzed immediately in both sets of tubes ag pvp nps were sized by both nta and sp icp ms analysis sedimentation was monitored during the 5 h by using the uv vis spectrophotometer which measured the absorbance at lspr of the nanoparticles every min for 300 min 5 h in sww and in di water as control the experiments were performed in triplicate and the results presented are the average of the runs 2 6 influence of nom and cl on the size and surface charge of ag pvp nps the effects of nom 5 800 μg l and cl 0 07 10 64 g l on 40 nm ag pvp nps were evaluated by measuring zp size as well as the dissolved ag from ag particles particle size distribution was measured via nta all experiments containing either nom or cl were spiked by the same concentration of ag pvp nps 100 μg l tubes were sonicated for 15 min and left to stand 1 h then samples were collected for size zp and silver determinations speciation diagrams based on the experimental concentrations of cl and ag in aqueous media were created in minteq 3 1 2 7 size distribution and dissolution of ag pvp nps in specific wastewater constituents the influence of po4 3 9 5 47 5 mg l nh4 36 90 mg l and s2 0 32 32 mg l on the stability of ag pvp nps with nominal size of 40 nm was studied in terms of size distribution and ag dissolution by using the nta and sp icp ms respectively stock solutions of nh4oh 3 5 g l k2hpo4 1 74 g l and na2s 0 156 g l were prepared and adjusted to ph 7 0 2 with 2 hno3 aliquots from stocks were diluted with di water to reach the experimental concentrations then ag pvp nps were spiked to achieve 100 μg l solutions used in experiments containing s2 were flushed with n2 during 20 min to remove the dissolved oxygen and provide anoxic conditions cervantes avilés et al 2018 all the tubes were sonicated during 15 min and left to stand 1 h until analysis speciation diagrams for experimental concentrations of s2 and ag were created in minteq 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the nta and sp icp ms the concentration used in the calibration of nta was 100 μg l for both ag pvp nps 40 nm and au 60 nm according to the manufacturer these concentrations correspond theoretically to 2 84 108 and 4 58 107 particles ml respectively measured concentrations via nta for ag and au nps were 3 93 108 and 6 80 107 particles ml respectively which represent 1 4 and 1 5 times higher than theoretical particle concentrations see supplementary information fig s1 the overestimation in particle number has already been reported elsewhere for similar concentrations of au nps mehrabi et al 2017 tracking up to 3 times more particles in di water and 2 times in landfill leachate our results indicate that the over counting of particles is also observed for ag pvp nps even though they are less stable than au nps and some dissolution may take place wimmer et al 2018 the median sizes were 41 5 nm for ag pvp and 58 3 nm for au fig s1 in line with the nominal size hence the overestimation in particle number of ag pvp and au nps did not affect the median size determination of either particle type the size distribution for 90 of particles were between 26 and 67 nm for ag and 40 75 nm for the au particles the amplitude of the size distribution also reflects that au particles are more stable than ag to calibrate the sp icp ms 100 ng l of 60 nm au nps were used during calibration nanoparticle counts were clearly differentiated from the background ionic concentration fig s2 a dwell time of 100 μs per point was suitable to distinguish the number of events particles from the ionic noise the ability of microsecond sp icp ms to improve the signal to noise ratio has been demonstrated for metal nps montaño et al 2014 the size distribution for the au nps 60 nm used as reference material was quite symmetric and the median experimental size coincided with the nominal size fig s2 3 2 ag pvp nps characterization all nominal ag pvp nps were negatively charged in di water with zp between 19 7 and 23 8 mv fig 1 a similar to other pvp coated nano ag auvinen et al 2017 the lspr of ag pvp nps clearly showed a size dependence fig 1b high linearity r2 0 98 was observed between nominal size of the ag pvp nps and the corresponding lspr fig 1c which moves towards the visible region as size increases this indicates that ag pvp nps smaller than 20 nm are more sensitive to ultraviolet radiation while larger ones are optically sensitive in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum for the nominal 20 40 80 and 100 nm ag pvp nps the median sizes measured via nta were all in nm 28 4 41 5 75 8 and 99 4 and the sizes of 90 of the particles ranged from all in nm 18 55 26 67 45 119 and 76 138 respectively fig s3 it was observed that for all nominal ag pvp nps the measured particle concentrations were also higher than the theoretical concentrations fig s3 the over counting of particle concentration in the nta can be also influenced by the particle size 3 3 stability of ag pvp nps in synthetic wastewater over time the response of lspr of ag particles with nominal sizes of 20 40 80 and 100 nm in sww over time is observed in fig 2 according to lspr the persistence of ag pvp nps in sww was higher for those with nominal size of 80 and 100 nm followed by 40 nm and lowest for the 20 nm ag pvp nps fig 2 which was unexpected the symbols of ag pvp nps with 40 nm in fig 2 are behind those for 80 nm since both trends were very similar up to 150 min since the absorbance reflects only the persistence of original nps the missing fraction of the ag pvp nps for all nominal sizes 1 a a0 can be attributed to both the partial dissolution of the ag pvp nps and the precipitation of aggregates in sww the aggregates formation was noted in the nta measurements fig 3 the size distribution for all nominal sizes was broader 5 h after spiking the ag pvp nps especially in the upper size range which may contain aggregates fig 3 in experiments with particles of nominal size of 80 and 100 nm the amplitude in the size distribution for the 90 of the particles was 29 211 nm and 38 241 nm respectively the median size observed for 80 and 100 nm increased to 91 and 125 respectively while that for 20 and 40 nm particles did not change substantially after 5 h fig 3 aggregate formation of ag particles in sww was also observed via the sp icp ms measurements fig 4 in experiments containing ag particles with nominal size of 80 and 100 nm aggregates up to 210 and 220 nm were detected respectively which is in line with nta measurements for 40 nm ag particles the size distribution shifted to smaller sizes with particles of 30 nm as the most frequent size although a few aggregates between 60 and 100 nm were observed in the case of 20 nm ag pvp nps in sww a few aggregates were also detected in the range of 60 120 nm compared to nta sp icp ms showed a limitation for sizing nano ag below 18 nm this has been already observed when nano ag are quantified and characterized in water or wastewater azimzada et al 2017 cervantes avilés et al 2019 hadioui et al 2014 lee et al 2014 hence characterizing nano ag smaller than 20 nm by sp icp ms is highly sensitive even when using ion exchange resin column the percentage of dissolved ag immediately after spiking the ag pvp nps into sww was between 4 06 and 10 96 for all particles at time 0 h table 3 after 5 h of exposure to sww the dissolved fraction of silver was between 8 7 and 19 27 dissolution of ag from ag pvp nps at pecs increased over time 0 5 h for all nominal sizes 20 40 80 and 100 nm however the highest dissolution was observed for the smaller particles 20 nm hence the decrease in the intensity of the lspr for these nps fig 2 can be attributed mainly to the dissolution of particles the dissolution of 40 nm ag pvp was also noticeable 14 8 after 5 h of contact with sww based on the sp icp ms measurements the median and the most frequent size of these particles became smaller table 3 the nominal particle size with less dissolved fraction at pecs were the 80 and 100 nm which is in line with lspr analysis fig 2 and indicates that these particles persisted more in suspension in sww than smaller nominal sizes as it is observed in table 3 the median size of the 80 and 100 nm ag pvp nps increased after 5 h which also agrees with the nta measurements the partial dissolution of ag pvp nps is inferred by the particle concentration measured in the nta which decreased for all particle sizes at 5 h fig s4 in the case of ag pvp nps of 20 and 40 nm the particles concentrations presented a clear peak of the most frequent size at 20 and 35 nm respectively for particles with nominal size of 80 and 100 nm the particle concentration was distributed in a wide range from 25 to 250 nm indicating both partial dissolution and aggregate formation increasing size aggregate formation and dissolution of ag are a function of the wastewater composition since 40 nm ag pvp nps exhibited both aggregation and dissolution this nominal size was selected to study the effects of specific wastewater constituents nom cl s2 po4 3 and nh4 on the stability and dissolution of nag 3 4 influence of nom and chloride on the size and surface charge of ag pvp nps nom and cl are important components in wastewater and in many environmental water matrices based on the nta measurements the presence of nom in aqueous media did not significantly affect the size distribution of nominal 40 nm ag pvp nps fig 5 a while the median size of the ag pvp nps at different nom concentrations remained close to the nominal size 40 nm size distributions were in the range of 22 85 nm although nano ag are already functionalized increasing nom concentration resulted in a more negative zp fig 6 a nom may become entangled with pvp in the surface of nps yu et al 2014 the observed stability of ag pvp nps at pecs in combination with nom 5 μg l may favor their transport along the wwtp and other environmental water matrices such as lentic lotic and coastal ecosystems in the case of ag pvp nps exposed to cl their size distributions became much broader fig 5b than in the nom experiments the amplitude 5 95 percentiles of the size distributions for all cl tested were between 98 and 142 nm with a maximum of up to 210 nm in contrast to nom experiments the median size of the ag pvp particles increased by almost 3 times as the concentration of cl increased from 0 07 to 10 64 g l while zp tended to zero as the cl concentration increased fig 6b the concentration of ag particles decreased in the presence of cl except in the presence of 0 71 1 42 and 2 13 g cl l fig s5 this further suggests that as ag was dissolving it was rapidly precipitated around the core of the remaining nps the speciation diagrams created in minteq fig s6 may help to understand three key points of this experiment i agcl s is formed in the presence of 1 42 g cl l at low ag concentrations 140 μg l ii the precipitation of agcl s in the presence of 2 13 g cl l is not thermodynamically favored and iii the formation of agclx x 1 species for all tested cl concentrations can explain the partial dissolution of particles based on these points one can infer the release of ag the equilibrium of the agclx x 1 species and the formation of agcl s as the shell growth of the particles likely the deposition of an agcl ag2o layer our results indicate that the formation of agcl s could take place for molar ratios cl ag 2100 at 0 07 g cl l when nano ag are present at pecs at higher nano ag concentration mg l the formation of agcl s was observed at lower cl ag 535 levard et al 2013b dissolved ag from ag particles in the presence of nom or cl exhibited an opposite behavior fig 7 dissolution of ag pvp nps at pecs decreased from 42 2 to 5 1 as nom increased from 10 μg l to 300 μg l after 1 h of exposure fig 7 probably because nom entangled with pvp inhibits the release of ag yu et al 2014 or that nom plays an important role in binding free ag wang et al 2015 in either case free ag would likely be at low concentrations in environments rich in nom in saline media the dissolved ag increased 38 4 74 9 in 1 h as the concentration of cl increased dissolved ag from ag pvp nps at pecs in saline media can rapidly form agcl s and some of the soluble agclx x 1 species however the overall dissolution in the environment can be higher since the residence time in many ecosystems is longer 3 5 effect of wastewater constituents po4 3 nh4 and s2 on the stability of ag pvp nps in addition to organic matter and chloride other wastewater constituents such as po4 3 nh4 and s2 can play an important role in the aggregation and dissolution of ag pvp nps the size distribution of ag pvp nps in aqueous media at low 9 5 mg l and high 47 5 mg l po4 3 did not reflect significant differences compared with that of ag pvp nps in di water fig 8 a this is in contrast to other nps such as zno cuo and fe oxides which interact significantly with po4 3 to form stable forms of phosphate daou et al 2007 herrmann et al 2014 ortelli et al 2017 for ag pvp nps exposed to a high phosphate concentration the size distribution and particle concentration were similar to ag pvp nps in the control phosphate free nanopure water fig s7 in addition the dissolved ag was lower in the presence of a high concentration of phosphate fig 9 a indicating that ag pvp nps remain stable without significant dissolution at a high po4 3 concentration in the case of nh4 the median size of ag pvp nps did not change substantially at low 36 mg l nh4 concentration but was noticeably increased at a high 90 mg l nh4 level the size distribution of ag particles was broader at both low and high nh4 concentrations relative to nanopure water with some particles larger than 200 nm fig 8a the particle concentration indicates that the number of particles between 50 and 200 nm increased as the ammonium concentration increased fig s7 and there were fewer particles below 50 nm dissolution in 1 h was 26 3 and 48 5 of the initial load of nano ag for low and high ammonium concentration respectively fig 9a based on the speciation diagrams the formation of agnh3 and ag nh3 2 may take place in these experimental conditions fig s8 the influence of sulfide on ag pvp nps at pecs reflected a wider size distribution of ag pvp nps with nominal size of 40 nm fig 8b the median size did not change significantly 55 nm in average for all s2 concentrations fig 8b this was also observed in the particle concentration plots where the peaks were between 50 and 60 nm for all s2 concentrations fig s7 besides the particle concentration increased as the concentration of s2 in the media increased fig s7 if we consider that the concentration of ag decreased as the sulfide present in media increased fig 9b and that the speciation diagrams performed in minteq predicted that more than 99 of the ag forms stable ag2s s at these experimental s2 concentrations fig s9 then the increased size of the ag particles at pecs is attributed to the formation of an ag2s s shell this experiment confirms that ag2s s formation on nano ag at pecs is very likely in wastewater with 0 32 mg l of sulfide the coarsening of ag particles with ag2s s has been already reported in previous experiments which were performed at concentrations much higher than the pecs namely 50 mg l kaegi et al 2013 and 97 mg l levard et al 2011 4 conclusions in this work we applied nta sp icp ms and lspr to study the stability and dissolution of ag pvp nps with nominal sizes of 20 40 80 and 100 nm at pecs in wastewater and its important constituents such as nom cl po4 3 nh4 and s2 although dissolution of nano ag at pecs in sww was observed for all nominal sizes smaller nanoparticles were dissolved more after 5 h of exposure 14 8 and 19 27 of initial load of 40 and 20 nm nano ag respectively the lspr analysis was in line with the dissolution levels measured indicating that ag particles with nominal size of 80 and 100 nm were more persistent than those with nominal size of 20 and 40 nm nta and sp icp ms resulted in very similar size distributions of nano ag at pecs in sww both techniques detected aggregate formation in sww after 5 h especially for 80 and 100 nm nano ag which ranged in nta from 29 to 211 nm and 38 241 nm respectively and via sp icp ms from 48 to 210 nm and 50 220 nm respectively with regards to the effect of wastewater constituents on the stability and dissolution of ag pvp nps at pecs even at low concentrations of nom 5 μg l and po4 3 9 5 mg l the dissolution of ag decreased and their presence served to stabilize the ag pvp nps the presence of nh4 led the dissolution of 26 3 and 48 5 of the initial load of ag pvp nps for low and high ammonium concentration in water mainly forming soluble agnh3 and ag nh3 2 however cl and s2 drive the dissolution and precipitation of newly formed solids either in the shell of the original nps or as separate particles our experiments indicated that agcl s may form preferentially at molar ratios cl ag 2100 at pecs and that ag2s s formation can be a strong pattern in wastewater with 0 32 mg l of sulfide for nano ag at pecs in all cases including the sww full dissolution of the ag particles was not observed even at pecs within the timeframe of these experiments 0 5 h hence a fraction of the original particles possibly with a stabilizing shell could pass through the wwtp onto the aquatic environment additional insights are gained when performing these experiments at pecs such as the interactions with the main wastewater constituents the combined use of nta and sp icp ms can serve to better understand the size distributions and particles concentrations over time as well as the

18471,in this work a hybrid organic inorganic adsorbent based on polyelectrolyte copolymers of poly 4 vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium chloride co 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate microspheres mixed with a hydrous zirconium oxide phase were applied to remove arsenic species from aqueous solutions the hybrid adsorbent was synthesized in a two step procedure first the polymeric microspheres were obtained through emulsion radical copolymerization and then the microspheres were impregnated with a zirconium oxide precursor followed by the subsequent sol gel reaction the purpose of this hybrid material was to combine properties of each component in the interaction with arsenic oxoanions and compare its performance with commercial adsorbents the polymer hybrid microspheres were shown to remove arsenate and the presence of the inorganic phase also allowed for the removal of arsenite the hybrid adsorbent exhibited arsenic sorption independent of ph is able to regenerate displays fast kinetics and has the ability to reduce arsenic concentration in treated water below 10 μg l 1 even in real samples with an initial concentration as high as 380 μg l 1 graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic hybrid adsorbent zirconium 1 introduction groundwater constitutes 97 of the world s fresh water and provides water to rivers during periods without rain millions of people depend directly on drinking water aquifers and 40 of the world s food is produced by irrigated agriculture which depends on groundwater various organic and inorganic contaminants are present in water sources used for human consumption with arsenic organic and inorganic being one with the highest toxicity exposure to high levels of arsenic can result in severe damage to health causing cardiovascular diseases diabetes and cancer of the skin tongue lung and gallbladder among others bissen and frimmel 2003 kenyon and hughes 2001 valko et al 2005 arsenic contamination is a concern around the world in some countries such as china tibet mongolia india bangladesh vietnam cambodia thailand taiwan argentina chile and mexico a large portion of the water is contaminated with arsenic in levels from 100 to more than 2000 μg l 1 this situation is especially severe in west bengal india and bangladesh where the concentration is within the range of 10 196 mg l 1 and 9 0 28 mg l 1 respectively it has been estimated that a population of more than 100 million people is exposed to drinking groundwater with arsenic concentrations higher than 50 μg l 1 in chile it has been observed that the highest occurrence of arsenic is between the parallels 17 30 and 26 05 south latitude and between the west longitude 67 00 and the pacific ocean including the cities antofagasta calama santiago rancagua taltal tocopilla and san pedro de atacama with the highest exposure to this metalloid in concentrations as high as 1000 μg l 1 silva pinto et al 2010 to reduce the risk to human health the environmental protection agency epa of the united states and the world health organization who implemented a standard of arsenic in drinking water reducing the level allowed from 50 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 who 2004 the strategies or methods for arsenic removal are diverse however only a few have reached practical application for example oxidation precipitation filtration zheng et al 2004 coagulation flocculation bilici baskan and pala 2010 adsorption goh et al 2008 huang et al 2014 and membrane processing ning 2002 are the most developed whereas other processes such as electrocoagulation hansen et al 2006 photocatalysis lescano et al 2015 phytoremediation iriel et al 2015 and electrochemical remediation ecar amrose et al 2014 have been developed more recently but their practical application is limited due to their high cost and complexity of operation among others on the other hand adsorption processes in materials based on alumina han et al 2013 activated carbon oliveira et al 2008 iron oxides sun et al 2013 zeolites swarnkar and tomar 2011 and clays tiwari and lee 2012 have presented a significant development at the scientific academic and industrial level it can be highlighted that these processes do not use large amounts of additional chemicals are easy to install jang et al 2008 and do not produce polluting byproducts zhang et al 2005 among them adsorbents based on granular iron oxide gfo such as bayoxide e33 and geh 102 have been developed and commercialized on a large scale the success achieved with these adsorbents lies in the low cost and the nature of the mechanism of interaction with arsenic oxide through the formation of inner and outer sphere complexes which provides stability to the interaction and selectivity to the adsorbent compared to ion exchange resins hristovski and markovski 2017 due to the irreversible nature of the interaction iron oxide based adsorbents are weakly regenerated however some elution can be observed because the sorbent can partially dissolve leading to iron release to the solution parschova et al 2015 for this reason composite adsorbents based on iron oxide nanoparticles loaded into a polymer matrix that combine the advantages of both materials have been developed cumbal and sengupta 2005 gupta et al 2012 he et al 2016 and some of them have even reached the market e g arsenxpnp lewatit fo 36 as an alternative to iron oxide based materials several authors have reported the use of zirconium oxide as an arsenic adsorbent with excellent results bortun et al 2010 cui et al 2012 2013 hang et al 2012 zirconium oxides are stable nontoxic do not dissolve in water are environmentally benign and are believed to be far more chemically stable in the presence of acid organic ligands and oxidants than iron hydro oxides hang et al 2012 pan et al 2014 moreover similarly to polymer iron oxide composite adsorbents composite adsorbents based on zirconium oxide have also been developed biswas et al 2008 pan et al 2013 2014 zhu and jyo 2001 the aim of this work is to obtain a hybrid material that allows for the removal of pentavalent and trivalent arsenic species directly without the need for a prior oxidation process the hybrid adsorbent will consist of two phases a central system corresponding to a functionalized crosslinked copolymer and another phase comprising a hydrous zirconium oxide network dispersed in the polymer phase this hybrid material combines the properties of each component in the interaction with arsenic oxoanions although each phase maintains its individual chemical properties its combination can result in synergism that improves the performance of the adsorbent 2 experimental part 2 1 materials the synthesis of the hybrid adsorbent was performed using the following

hybrid adsorbent synthesis of the adsorbent was performed following a procedure reported previously toledo et al 2018 briefly the hybrid adsorbent was synthesized in a two step procedure first the polymeric microspheres were obtained through emulsion radical copolymerization of 20 vol of h2o in n heptane the aqueous phase was composed of the monomers 4 vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium chloride and 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate in a mole ratio of 3 1 2 80 and 0 93 mol l 1 respectively n n methylene bis acrylamide as crosslinker 18 0 mol respect to monomer and the redox initiation system aps temed at concentrations of 1 0 mol and 2 0 mol respectively the organic phase was composed of n heptane and span 80 0 025 mol l 1 the polymerization was performed under constant stirring at 400 rpm for 30 min at 70 c later the temperature of the system was reduced and copolymer p clvbta co hema was isolated and washed by soxhlet extraction soxtherm se 412 gerhardt first with n heptane and then with ethanol for 8 h each finally the sample was dried at 40 c for 24 h and sieved to obtain a particle size in the range 75 180 μm the second step consisted of the impregnation of p clvbta co hema microspheres with the inorganic precursor ip zr buto 4 at a concentration of 70 wt diluted with ethanol for 48 h and the subsequent sol gel reaction in ethanol water 1 1 for 24 h to obtain the oxide on the polymer network with the aim to remove all weakly bound oxides the composite microspheres were exhaustively washed with methanol sonicated sieved using nylon filters ny80 millipore and dried in an oven at 60 c hereinafter the hybrid adsorbent will be referred to as ms hzo 2 3 adsorption experiments to assess the arsenic sorption capacity of the hybrid adsorbent together with commercial adsorbents several parameters were studied namely ph dependence sorption isotherms and kinetics sorption elution and selectivity finally as a first approach to the usability of the hybrid in real field conditions aqueous samples were treated in columns using the hybrid adsorbent the effect of ph was assessed by contacting the adsorbent with solutions of as iii and v at a concentration of 10 mg l 1 and a dose of 0 16 ml mg for 24 h at 25 c and constant stirring sorption isotherms were studied at temperatures of 25 35 and 45 c contacting the adsorbent dose of 1 0 ml mg 1 with arsenic solutions of variable concentration 0 05 10 mg l 1 at ph 6 0 for 24 h under constant stirring kinetic sorption studies were performed contacting the hybrid with an arsenic solution of concentration 10 mg l 1 ph 6 0 dose of 1 0 ml mg 1 at 25 c and stirring at 150 rpm in a time range of 0 24 h selectivity studies were performed assessing the effect on arsenic adsorption on the following anions cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 in concentrations of 50 100 and 300 mg l 1 the experiments were performed at 25 c at a dose of 0 16 ml mg 1 stirring at 150 rpm for 24 h the following general procedure was performed for all sorption experiments presented once the time of contact was completed the contact tube was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 3 min and then an aliquot of supernatant was extracted and the concentration of arsenic was measured sorption desorption cycles of the hybrid adsorbent were conducted to determine the reusability capacity for this purpose 50 mg of the adsorbent were contacted with 40 ml of arsenic solution at 10 mg l 1 and ph 6 0 for 5 h subsequently the sorbent was separated from the solution through centrifugation washed with 30 ml of distilled water at ph 6 0 to remove the unbound arsenic and dried overnight at 60 c later arsenic elution was performed by contacting the loaded adsorbent with a solution of 5 0 wt naoh 5 0 wt nacl for 5 h at 25 c under constant stirring at 150 rpm repeating the cycle up to three times the above presented sorption experiments were also performed using commercial adsorbent such as nxt 2 geh 102 and lewatit fo36 for comparison to determine the stability of the adsorbent over time and the potential oxide leaching was assessed for this purpose a mass of the hybrid adsorbent was weighed and contacted with 25 ml of as iii at the concentration of 30 μg l the dispersions were prepared in triplicate and stirred for 3 6 and 9 days heidolph unimax 1010 at 100 rpm after mixing the supernatant solution was removed and the adsorbent dried for 24 h at 50 c and then calcined in a muffle oven jsr model jsms 45t at 600 c for 6 h the percentage of oxide was determined from the ashes after the calcination additionally the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy to observe the changes in the microspheres and by edx the zr cl ratio was determined at 3 6 and 9 days finally sorption experiments were conducted in a continuous column system using the hybrid adsorbent to this natural water samples from two regions of chile antofagasta and lampa with arsenic concentration above the maximum concentration limit 10 μg l 1 were treated to assess the efficiency of the hybrid material as an adsorbent the experiments were performed in a column with a diameter of 10 mm and length of 40 mm connected to a peristaltic pump krosflo research i spectrum labs to reach a constant flux of 1 2 ml min 1 approximately 3 l of water samples were passed through the column and at different time intervals aliquots of purified water were withdrawn for further analysis by aas hg 2 4 characterization techniques infrared spectroscopy the copolymer microspheres were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy using a perkinelmer model 1760 x in a range of 4000 400 cm 1 using kbr pellets with this technique the presence of the characteristic vibrational peaks and of the copolymer functional groups were confirmed scanning electron microscopy both copolymer and hybrid microspheres were analyzed by this technique using a jeol probe cameca model su 30 equipped with energy dispersed x ray spectroscopy the samples were coated with gold prior to analysis except for the hybrid microspheres due to interference of the au emission line mα 2 123 kev and the emission line of zr 2 044 kev n2 adsorption isotherms the specific surface of the hybrid materials was determined using a micromeritics asap 2010 apparatus at 77 k specimens were degassed for 2 h at 100 c prior to analysis and the isotherms were analyzed using the brunauer emmett teller bet method to determine the sample area measurements of arsenic concentration were performed through atomic absorption spectroscopy aas perkinelmer pinaacle 900f usa and hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy hg aas fias 100 for hg aas measurements the aqueous samples were pretreated with 30 0 vol hcl 20 0 wt vol potassium iodide 2 and 10 0 wt vol ascorbic acid for at least 45 min during analysis 0 2 wt vol nabh4 in 0 05 wt vol naoh was used as the reducing agent the detection limit lod and limit of quantification loq determined for this technique were 0 190 mg l 1 and 0 576 mg l 1 for aas respectively whereas the values for hg aas were 0 024 μg l 1 and 0 074 μg l 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of the hybrid adsorbent synthesis of the hybrid adsorbent was performed in a two step process the first stage consisted of synthesis of polymeric microspheres with a functional group such as quaternary amine commonly found in ion exchange resins for arsenate removal for this purpose the monomer 4 vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium chloride which possesses the ammonium group was used allowing for the introduction of functional groups directly during the polymerization and avoiding postsynthesis reactions additionally the comonomer 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate was used because hydroxyl groups i provide additional stability to the polymer particles through hydrogen bonding and ii could covalently bond with the inorganic phase during the subsequent sol gel reaction li et al 2007 the first step of synthesis consisted of inverse emulsion polymerization which obtains hydrophilic polymer microspheres both optical and scanning electron images confirm the sphericity of the copolymers with a uniform surface fig 1 a and b analysis of the microspheres revealed a wide unimodal size distribution ranging from 50 to 150 μm and centered at 80 μm see fig 1c after obtaining the microspheres the second stage consisted of adding the inorganic moiety to the polymer beads the strategy followed was to use a solution of 80 zr buto 4 inorganic precursor in 1 butanol and further dilute this solution with a more polar solvent such as ethanol the use of a cosolvent with a dielectric constant higher than that of 1 butanol implies an increase in the polarity medium and considering the hydrophilic characteristics of the polymeric microspheres these conditions are favorable for swelling and allow access of the ip compound into the polymer toledo et al 2018 in addition the viscosity of the solution decreases from 2 52 mpa s pure 1 butanol to 1 18 mpa s for 1 butanol ethanol in the molar fraction of 0 803 cano gómez et al 2012 in this way the solvent mixture would promote swelling of the microspheres and entry of the inorganic precursor into the polymer network once the microspheres were impregnated formation of the hydrated oxide occurred by means of a sol gel reaction by contacting the beads loaded with an inorganic precursor with water ethanol see eqs 1 3 due to the water content of ethanol at the impregnation step it is possible to assume that the sol gel process begins however the process is completed through contact with ethanol leading to the hydrous zirconium oxide hzo moiety 1 zr buto 4 h2o zr buto 3oh butoh 2 zr buto 3oh zr buto 3oh buto 3zr o zr buto 3 h2o 3 zr buto 3oh zr buto 4 oh buto 2zr o zr buto 3 butoh fig 2 presents the infrared spectrum of the hybrid adsorbent displaying the characteristics signals of the polymer and inorganic moieties signals ascribed to the copolymer are 2931 cm 1 c h st 1711 cm 1 co st 1634 cm 1 cc aromatic st and 1477 cm 1 n ch3 3 st while the signals at 1534 and 1371 cm 1 were assigned to the bending vibration of zr oh groups and the signal at 473 cm 1 was assigned to zr o cui et al 2012 luo et al 2013 the presence of these signals confirms that copolymer and zirconium moieties exist to provide visual evidence of obtaining hybrid microspheres scanning electron microscopy equipped with an edxs device was used for analysis fig 3 a shows sem images of the microspheres after impregnation importantly the particles maintain their sphericity after the steps of zr buto 4 impregnation and the sol gel reaction in addition the microspheres have a greater roughness than before impregnation which can be attributed to a layer of hzo on the surface of the beads elemental analysis of the particle surface composition was determined using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy which showed the presence of signals at 0 28 0 53 and 2 63 kev corresponding to the kα emission lines of the elements carbon oxygen and chlorine which are associated with the elements of the repetitive units of the polymer the signal at 2 05 kev corresponds to the emission line lα of zirconium confirming the presence of the element on the surface of the microspheres to determine the content of inorganic moieties samples of the hybrid were calcinated at 500 c for 5 h and at 800 c for 3 h resulting in residual masses of 11 15 1 44 and 4 38 1 89 respectively which can be attributed to the inorganic component an important property of this type of material is swelling the absorption of aqueous solution allows access of the pollutants into the polymer bead and sets out the active site for arsenic oxyanions however excessive swelling could affect the mechanical stability of the particles fig 3c shows images obtained with an optical microscope of the hybrid beads before and after swelling before solvent contact the beads appear to be solid like but after contact with water the particles obtain a gel like appearance because of the solvent content as a consequence the size of the bead increases from 60 μm to 85 μm see fig 3d 3 2 arsenic sorption experiments the first experiment of arsenic sorption assessed the effect of the zirconium phase on the sorption properties of the novel adsorbent for this purpose both copolymer microspheres prior to impregnation with inorganic precursor poly clvbta co hema and the hybrid adsorbent were contacted with arsenate and arsenite solutions see fig 4 a arsenate was observed to be removed by both adsorbents efficiently but only the hybrid adsorbent displayed high arsenite sorption these results confirm the enhanced performance of ms hzo due to the inorganic phase moiety the performance of the hybrid adsorbent was compared to commercially established adsorbents such as ira 400 geh 102 nxt 2 and lewatit fo36 using arsenite and arsenate solutions table 1 reports the characteristics of the adsorbents studied ira 400 is a macroporous strong base anion exchange resin based on poly styrene co divinylbenzene and quaternary ammonium groups geh 102 is an adsorbent widely used in industry for arsenic removal that consists of irregular particles of iron oxide while nxt 2 is an adsorbent based on mixed lanthanum and iron oxides lewatit fo 36 is a weakly basic macroporous anion exchanger based on polystyrene divinylbenzene that contains weak amine functional groups and iron oxide nanoparticles fig 4b shows the results of arsenic adsorption as a function of ph ms hzo and geh 102 were not affected by ph exhibiting constant sorption in the entire ph range whereas nxt 2 displayed slightly decreased sorption under acidic conditions it should be noted that when considering the chemistry of arsenate arsenic acid has three dissociation constants pk1 2 3 pk2 6 8 and pk3 11 6 and therefore arsenate charged species such as h2aso4 haso4 2 and aso4 3 can interact on the surface of the adsorbent as mentioned above arsenate and arsenite can form inner and outer sphere complexes on the oxide surface hristovski and markovski 2017 the last interaction occurs mainly via electrostatic forces between solvated arsenate ions and the charged oxide surface and is therefore ph dependent the corresponding point of zero charge occurs when the surface charge density is zero when ph phpzc the terminating hydroxyl groups on the surface protonate originating positive charges in contrast when ph phpzc the terminating hydroxyl groups on the surface deprotonate producing a negative charge on the surface the reported pzc values of geh 102 β feo oh nxt 2 and hzo are 7 3 kosmulski 2009 12 epminerals 2018 and 6 0 8 6 kosmulski 2002 respectively and hence the sorption observed a low ph is associated with the electrostatic interaction between arsenate ions and the positively charged surface whereas above pzc the inner sphere complexes predominate a very different performance was evidenced for the ira 400 resin where the removal capacity was shown to decrease markedly at ph values lower than 6 because exchange resins of this type have a higher affinity towards the divalent arsenate species that predominates at ph 9 0 clifford and ghurye 2002a fig 4c shows the adsorption of as iii as a function of ph first ira 400 does not exhibit arsenite removal between ph 2 10 and adsorption only occurs in a highly alkaline solution this can be explained because arsenous acid has three dissociation constants pk1 9 1 pk2 12 1 and pk3 13 4 therefore at ph above 10 it is possible to find a high concentration of monovalent anionic species h2aso3 in solution that allow ion exchange with the chloride ions of the ammonium group below ph 9 0 the predominant species of arsenite arsenous acid do not have a charge and therefore it is not possible to remove them with ira 400 in contrast ph was not observed to affect arsenite adsorption of inorganic adsorbents and the hybrid in this case the mechanism involved in sorption could be the formation of inner sphere complexes which is consistent with evidence provided by some authors using iron oxide and zirconium oxides manning et al 1998 ren et al 2011 sverjensky and fukushi 2006 geh 102 and nxt 2 presented the highest removal capacities for both types of arsenic and this was mainly ascribed to the high specific area of these adsorbents however it is important to note that ms hzo presented slightly lower capacity than these adsorbents throughout the ph range even though the oxide content in ms hzo does not exceed 5 the hybrid displayed an outstanding performance for both arsenics overall hydrous zirconium oxide is found mainly on the surface of the microspheres and is responsible for arsenate but mainly arsenite sorption arsenate interacts via electrostatic forces a low ph with the inorganic moiety because the pzc while at higher ph can occur the formation of inner sphere complexes with hzo despite of that the most predominant interaction of arsenate is with the polymer through an ion exchange mechanism at the ammonium groups similar to that observed in strong base anion exchange resins on the contrary the sorption of arsenite occurs excl usively on the hzo moiety because of its uncharged nature through the formation of inner sphere complexes with the oxygens at the surface of the oxide ren et al 2011 it is worth noting that an effective removal process close to neutral ph 6 8 greatly benefits the application of the adsorbent in natural waters and for this reason further sorption experiments will be conducted at ph 6 0 3 3 sorption isotherms adsorption isotherms were performed with the purpose of obtaining useful information about the adsorbent adsorbate interaction by keeping the adsorbent mass constant and varying the concentration of arsenic in solution fig 5 shows the adsorption isotherms of arsenate and arsenite in general all adsorbents were observed to have a greater affinity towards arsenate than arsenite because they have a higher adsorption capacity at lower equilibrium concentrations in particular the commercial adsorbents nxt 2 and geh 102 present more efficient adsorption because of the larger specific area available to interact with the adsorbate see table 2 as expected the hybrid adsorbent presented a performance more similar to the commercial adsorbent lewatit fo36 and judged by the isotherms the hybrid has a higher affinity for arsenate and a similar affinity for arsenite to provide more insight about the adsorption process the isotherms were adjusted to the langmuir isotherm model the following expression gives the langmuir isotherm 4 q e q max b c e 1 b c e where c e mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration q e mg g 1 corresponds to the adsorption capacity at equilibrium q max mg g 1 is the monolayer capacity and b l mg 1 corresponds to the langmuir constant whose meaning is related to adsorption free energy table 2 shows the langmuir isotherm parameters obtained from the nonlinear fitting of the arsenic adsorption isotherms the values of the correlation coefficient indicate good agreement between the experimental data and the isotherm model on the other hand q max confirms that all adsorbents have a greater adsorption capacity for arsenate than arsenite and better performance at higher temperatures except for geh suggesting that adsorption is endothermic in detail nxt and geh achieve a higher arsenate and arsenite removal capacity than the other adsorbents and this is most likely attributed to the fact that both adsorbents have a larger specific area similarly the langmuir constants for these adsorbents are also higher which reveals a higher affinity of the adsorbate adsorbent these structural characteristics of the composite adsorbent can explain the differences observed concerning the other adsorbent on the other hand the parameters of the langmuir isotherm for ms hzo reveal that its performance is similar to that exhibited by lewatit with a slight decrease in q max following the isothermal curves however the langmuir constants for arsenate are much higher than those presented by lewatit fo36 which confirms that there is a higher affinity between ms hzo and arsenate in the case of arsenite ms hzo exhibited an adsorption capacity lower than fo36 but a higher affinity towards adsorbate the higher affinity of arsenic ms hzo compared with lewatit fo36 can be attributed to the structural characteristics of the adsorbents whereas lewatit fo36 corresponds to a weak anion exchange resin it possesses tertiary amines as a functional group and the base structure of the polymer consisting of polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene provides hydrophobicity to the microspheres and the inorganic phase consists of iron oxide nanoparticles located on the internal surfaces of the macroporous adsorbent and a low specific area lanxess 2014 in contrast ms hzo has a more hydrophilic structure that favors the access of analyte to the adsorbent moreover hydrated zirconium oxide is found mainly on the surface of the microspheres favoring arsenite adsorption since the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent is considered a mainly superficial process and in order to make an appropriate comparison between adsorbents with different specific areas it is necessary to normalize the value of q max and express the capacity of adsorption as adsorbate mass per area q norm mg m 2 table 2 shows that the hybrid microspheres prepared for this study have a better performance than previously described calculating a q norm equal to 48 1 mg m 2 at 25 c which is much higher than the rest of the adsorbents thermodynamic considerations of an adsorption process are necessary to conclude whether the process is spontaneous or not the gibbs free energy change δg is an important parameter to evaluate the spontaneity of a process a negative value of δg indicates that the reactions occur spontaneously the free energy of arsenic sorption considering the adsorption equilibrium constant obtained from the langmuir isotherm is given by the following equation 5 δ g 0 r t l n b the thermodynamic parameters δh and δs were obtained using the van t hoff equation 6 log b δ s 0 2 303 r δ h 0 2 303 r t a plot of log b vs 1 t then allows the values of δh and δs to be determined from the slope and intercept respectively see fig 6 table 3 provides the thermodynamic functions δg δh and δs for arsenate and arsenite sorption obtained from the equation 6 for as v all adsorbents displayed negative and similar values of gibbs free energy indicating a spontaneous sorption process similarly the sorption entropy gave values slightly above zero suggesting an increase of the number of molecules after sorption moreover the values of standard enthalpy confirm that ms hzo nxt 2 and geh 102 exhibit an endothermic process in nature while the sorption onto lewatit is exothermic interestingly the values provide information about the nature of the interaction hence the adsorption of as v onto nxt 2 suggest a physical adsorption on the contrary geh 102 revealed an enthalpy above 100 kj mol 1 suggesting a chemisorption process consistent with the formation of a covalent bond associated with the formation of inner sphere complexes notably hybrid adsorbents ms hzo and lewatit fo36 displayed intermediate values of δh associated with physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms the physisorption mechanism is associated with the polymer moiety through an electrostatic interaction between the arsenate oxyanions and the ammonium group of the polymer whereas chemisorption is associated with the formation of inner sphere complexes for as iii the gibbs free energy values were slightly positive indicating a nonspontaneous process while the values of enthalpy indicate both physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms 3 4 sorption kinetics arsenic adsorption as a function of time for the different adsorbents was examined to obtain information about the adsorption kinetics of the hybrid adsorbent and to evaluate its performance concerning other materials fig 7shows the kinetic curves of adsorption all adsorbents were observed to reach maximum capacity in short contact time however analysis of the arsenate adsorption curves at a time less than 1 h reveals that ms hzo has faster adsorption kinetics than the other adsorbents while for the adsorption of arsenite ms hzo presents kinetics of adsorption similar to the other adsorbents but with a lower removal capacity the pseudo second order model pso has been widely used to understand the adsorption process of many systems ho 2006 the equation can be expressed as follows 7 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t and q e correspond to the amounts of arsenic adsorbed mg g at time t and at equilibrium respectively and k 2 is the rate constant of adsorption g mg h fig 7 shows curves of the nonlinear fitting of the model to the experimental data while table 4 shows the parameters of the model that describe adsorption in the case of the adsorption of as v the results show that both the hybrid adsorbents and inorganic adsorbents reach a similar maximum adsorption capacity with a slight advantage from the adsorbents nxt 2 and geh 102 however the rate constant k 2 reveals that the ms hzo hybrid has a rate constant significantly higher than the other adsorbents which explains faster arsenic removal similarly the removal of arsenite by ms hzo showed a higher rate constant than the other adsorbents an additional way to evaluate the rate of adsorption is through the determination of the time necessary to reach a certain percentage of removal by the following expression urbano et al 2012 2015 8 t x w k 2 q e where t x is the necessary time to reach an adsorption equivalent to the fraction x w x 1 x k 2 and q e is the constant of speed and adsorption in equilibrium respectively determined by the pso model thus as the system approaches equilibrium x 1 w and t x table 4 shows the necessary times to reach 50 t 0 5 and 99 t 0 99 arsenic adsorption for arsenate ms hzo needs significantly lower adsorption times to reach the determined percentages while for arsenite although ms hzo presented similar values with fo36 the adsorption was much faster than for the inorganic adsorbents the structural characteristic of the adsorbents can explain these differences ms hzo has a low specific surface and corresponds to a gel like resin where the porous structure appears when the resin swells in a polar solvent thus the hydrophilic resin when in contact with an aqueous solution of arsenic absorbs the solution promoting the meeting of the arsenic oxyanions with the adsorbent active sites in contrast the other adsorbents have a porous and more rigid structure and therefore diffusion of arsenic in the pores of the adsorbent is expected to consume more time 3 5 competing ions studying the adsorption process in the presence of interfering species is significant given that it allows for simulating a real situation in which the effluents are treated which naturally can have a high concentration of other dissolved anions that compete and interfere with arsenic adsorption in this study the effect on the adsorption of arsenate and arsenite in the presence of chloride cl nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 at varying concentrations 50 300 mg l 1 was evaluated at a constant concentration of arsenic 10 mg l 1 fig 8 shows percentages of arsenic removal for the hybrid and commercial adsorbent generally removal of arsenate was observed to present high efficiency for most of the adsorbent and only when the concentration of sulfate is sufficiently high ms hzo presents a slight decrease in adsorption which is attributed to the high affinity of ammonium groups towards sulfate instead of arsenate so4 2 haso4 2 co3 2 cl h2aso4 clifford and ghurye 2002b similarly at high phosphate concentrations geh102 and lewatit exhibited a decrease in arsenate sorption that is in agreement with previous studies using iron oxide where phosphate exhibited the larger effect hongshao and stanforth 2001 kanel et al 2006 on the other hand the performance of the adsorbent in removing arsenite was lower except for the adsorbent nxt 2 which maintained a removal capacity close to 100 for all concentrations of competing anions in this case geh102 and lewatit fo36 showed a significant decrease in removal when the concentration of phosphate and sulfate reached a concentration of 100 mg l 1 respectively in the case of the hybrid adsorbent the presence of competing ions presented a more marked effect than other adsorbents producing a significant decrease in removal and decreasing sorption to 70 especially for sulfate and phosphate these results are in agreement with those reported for zro2 nh2o nanoparticles where phosphate displayed a strong effect on arsenate and arsenic sorption hang et al 2012 pan et al 2014 the anions that have the most interfering effect in arsenic removal are sulfate and phosphate due to their structural similarity with arsenic oxyanions and their negative charge 3 6 adsorption desorption reuse of the adsorbent is a critical variable when scaling an adsorption process and corresponds to one of the essential properties of a polymer type adsorbent ion exchange resin three cycles of adsorption and elution of arsenic v and arsenic iii were performed to evaluate the regeneration capacity of the hybrid adsorbent and the results were compared with the adsorbent geh 102 see fig 9 for the adsorption of as v the hybrid adsorbent displayed a higher performance than the commercial adsorbent showing an approximate decrease of only 10 after three cycles of adsorption while in geh 102 the percentage of adsorption decreased approximately 30 regarding the elution of arsenic in each adsorption cycle it was determined that the hybrid eluted up to 80 of adsorbed as v and on the contrary the commercial adsorbent presented a much lower performance reaching only an elution of 20 during the third cycle of use these results demonstrate the hybrid s high capacity of regeneration and its capacity of reuse due to the mainly electrostatic resin arsenate interaction that is therefore reversible the adsorption of arsenite in the hybrid showed similar results with geh 102 since the adsorption for this compound occurs on the surface of zirconium oxide and iron respectively although in ms hzo only a fraction of the material is composed of zirconium oxide similar removal percentages were achieved with geh 102 which is a 100 adsorbent based on iron oxide demonstrating the excellent performance of the hybrid like adsorption elution of arsenic iii from the hybrid material presented similar percentages of the commercial adsorbent approximately 35 in natural waters underground and surface the proportion of arsenic v is generally higher than arsenic iii and in actively reducing environments the ratio of as iii as v varies between approximately 0 4 0 6 thus the hybrid adsorbent has a more efficient performance than the commercial adsorbent fig 10 shows the study of the durability of the hybrid adsorbent experiments were performed by contacting the adsorbent with an arsenite solution at 30 μg l for 3 6 and 9 days to assess the loss of the inorganic phase the analysis of oxide content carried out by calcination revealed that there is no significant decrease in the oxide content compared to the control adsorbent without treatment similarly the change on the surface of microspheres was assessed determining the zr cl ratio zr associated with the oxide phase and chloride to the polymer phase by eds showing that zr content does not change significantly after the treatment these results are confirmed visually in the sem images of the adsorbents showing that after several days of treatment there are no changes in the surface characteristics on microspheres these results are consistent with what was observed in the sorption desorption experiments fig 9b where the hybrid adsorbent still reaches 60 uptake after the third adsorption cycle the high durability of the adsorbent can be attributed to the covalent bond formed between the copolymer and the inorganic phase occurred through the condensation reaction between the alcohol group of the phema and the inorganic precursor hydrolyzed at the sol gel step 3 7 column studies the removal of arsenic in real samples exhibits a greater complexity than synthetic samples due to variation in its composition depending on the source of origin for this reason the ms hzo adsorbent was studied in its ability to remove arsenic from real groundwater samples sample 1 corresponds to a sample taken from the area of el juncal quilicura metropolitan region chile with the following composition total as 59 6 μg l 1 so4 2 41 1 mg l 1 po4 3 0 17 mg l 1 sio2 12 6 mg l 1 cl 91 1 mg l 1 ph 8 4 sample 2 comes from the city of lampa metropolitan region with the following composition total as 61 3 μg l 1 so4 2 45 5 mg l 1 po4 3 0 1 mg l 1 no3 9 35 mg l 1 cl 19 2 mg l 1 ph 8 5 both samples showed a concentration above the maximum concentration limit mcl recommended by who of 10 μg l 1 the hybrid adsorbent was contacted with the groundwater samples for 5 h at 20 c and a final concentration of 0 58 0 065 μg l 1 was reached for sample a and 0 69 0 057 μg l 1 for sample b see fig 11 a these results indicate that the hybrid adsorbent presented efficient performance in arsenic removal reaching final concentrations lower than the mcl finally the sample from lampa and a third water sample with a higher concentration of arsenic from a city north of chile called antofagasta were studied by a small column procedure the composition of this sample was total as 384 μg l 1 so4 2 150 5 mg l 1 cl 540 mg l 1 ph 8 3 fig 11b displays the arsenic concentration in the solution after passing through the column filled with ms hzo adsorbent the breakthrough curve shows that is possible to treat approximately 1 5 l of real sample maintaining a concentration below 10 μg l with an approximate mass of adsorbent of 0 5 g as expected for the antofagasta sample the mcl was exceeded at a lower volume of sample because the sample had a higher concentration of arsenic and consequently saturated the adsorbent more rapidly finally regeneration of the adsorbent bed was performed using a solution of 5 naoh nacl reaching an efficient elution using less than 100 ml of solution see fig 11c 4 conclusions hybrid microspheres were successfully synthesized in two stages i synthesis of copolymeric microspheres and ii impregnation and sol gel of a zirconium tetrabutoxide inorganic precursor it was confirmed that the zirconium moiety was located mainly on the surface of copolymer microspheres with a diameter of approximately of 80 μm the hybrid material presented advantageous characteristics of both materials on one hand hzo allowed for arsenite removal with the need for pre oxidation to arsenate while the arsenates are retained by the cationic polymer reaching arsenic concentrations below 10 μg l 1 in real samples with initial concentrations as high as 380 μg l 1 comparison of the sorption performance of the hybrid with commercial adsorbents revealed that ms hzo displayed outstanding sorption considering that the responsible phase of as iii sorption was less than 5 wt and the commercial adsorbents such as geh 102 and nxt 2 were 100 inorganic materials declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18471,in this work a hybrid organic inorganic adsorbent based on polyelectrolyte copolymers of poly 4 vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium chloride co 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate microspheres mixed with a hydrous zirconium oxide phase were applied to remove arsenic species from aqueous solutions the hybrid adsorbent was synthesized in a two step procedure first the polymeric microspheres were obtained through emulsion radical copolymerization and then the microspheres were impregnated with a zirconium oxide precursor followed by the subsequent sol gel reaction the purpose of this hybrid material was to combine properties of each component in the interaction with arsenic oxoanions and compare its performance with commercial adsorbents the polymer hybrid microspheres were shown to remove arsenate and the presence of the inorganic phase also allowed for the removal of arsenite the hybrid adsorbent exhibited arsenic sorption independent of ph is able to regenerate displays fast kinetics and has the ability to reduce arsenic concentration in treated water below 10 μg l 1 even in real samples with an initial concentration as high as 380 μg l 1 graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic hybrid adsorbent zirconium 1 introduction groundwater constitutes 97 of the world s fresh water and provides water to rivers during periods without rain millions of people depend directly on drinking water aquifers and 40 of the world s food is produced by irrigated agriculture which depends on groundwater various organic and inorganic contaminants are present in water sources used for human consumption with arsenic organic and inorganic being one with the highest toxicity exposure to high levels of arsenic can result in severe damage to health causing cardiovascular diseases diabetes and cancer of the skin tongue lung and gallbladder among others bissen and frimmel 2003 kenyon and hughes 2001 valko et al 2005 arsenic contamination is a concern around the world in some countries such as china tibet mongolia india bangladesh vietnam cambodia thailand taiwan argentina chile and mexico a large portion of the water is contaminated with arsenic in levels from 100 to more than 2000 μg l 1 this situation is especially severe in west bengal india and bangladesh where the concentration is within the range of 10 196 mg l 1 and 9 0 28 mg l 1 respectively it has been estimated that a population of more than 100 million people is exposed to drinking groundwater with arsenic concentrations higher than 50 μg l 1 in chile it has been observed that the highest occurrence of arsenic is between the parallels 17 30 and 26 05 south latitude and between the west longitude 67 00 and the pacific ocean including the cities antofagasta calama santiago rancagua taltal tocopilla and san pedro de atacama with the highest exposure to this metalloid in concentrations as high as 1000 μg l 1 silva pinto et al 2010 to reduce the risk to human health the environmental protection agency epa of the united states and the world health organization who implemented a standard of arsenic in drinking water reducing the level allowed from 50 μg l 1 to 10 μg l 1 who 2004 the strategies or methods for arsenic removal are diverse however only a few have reached practical application for example oxidation precipitation filtration zheng et al 2004 coagulation flocculation bilici baskan and pala 2010 adsorption goh et al 2008 huang et al 2014 and membrane processing ning 2002 are the most developed whereas other processes such as electrocoagulation hansen et al 2006 photocatalysis lescano et al 2015 phytoremediation iriel et al 2015 and electrochemical remediation ecar amrose et al 2014 have been developed more recently but their practical application is limited due to their high cost and complexity of operation among others on the other hand adsorption processes in materials based on alumina han et al 2013 activated carbon oliveira et al 2008 iron oxides sun et al 2013 zeolites swarnkar and tomar 2011 and clays tiwari and lee 2012 have presented a significant development at the scientific academic and industrial level it can be highlighted that these processes do not use large amounts of additional chemicals are easy to install jang et al 2008 and do not produce polluting byproducts zhang et al 2005 among them adsorbents based on granular iron oxide gfo such as bayoxide e33 and geh 102 have been developed and commercialized on a large scale the success achieved with these adsorbents lies in the low cost and the nature of the mechanism of interaction with arsenic oxide through the formation of inner and outer sphere complexes which provides stability to the interaction and selectivity to the adsorbent compared to ion exchange resins hristovski and markovski 2017 due to the irreversible nature of the interaction iron oxide based adsorbents are weakly regenerated however some elution can be observed because the sorbent can partially dissolve leading to iron release to the solution parschova et al 2015 for this reason composite adsorbents based on iron oxide nanoparticles loaded into a polymer matrix that combine the advantages of both materials have been developed cumbal and sengupta 2005 gupta et al 2012 he et al 2016 and some of them have even reached the market e g arsenxpnp lewatit fo 36 as an alternative to iron oxide based materials several authors have reported the use of zirconium oxide as an arsenic adsorbent with excellent results bortun et al 2010 cui et al 2012 2013 hang et al 2012 zirconium oxides are stable nontoxic do not dissolve in water are environmentally benign and are believed to be far more chemically stable in the presence of acid organic ligands and oxidants than iron hydro oxides hang et al 2012 pan et al 2014 moreover similarly to polymer iron oxide composite adsorbents composite adsorbents based on zirconium oxide have also been developed biswas et al 2008 pan et al 2013 2014 zhu and jyo 2001 the aim of this work is to obtain a hybrid material that allows for the removal of pentavalent and trivalent arsenic species directly without the need for a prior oxidation process the hybrid adsorbent will consist of two phases a central system corresponding to a functionalized crosslinked copolymer and another phase comprising a hydrous zirconium oxide network dispersed in the polymer phase this hybrid material combines the properties of each component in the interaction with arsenic oxoanions although each phase maintains its individual chemical properties its combination can result in synergism that improves the performance of the adsorbent 2 experimental part 2 1 materials the synthesis of the hybrid adsorbent was performed using the following

hybrid adsorbent synthesis of the adsorbent was performed following a procedure reported previously toledo et al 2018 briefly the hybrid adsorbent was synthesized in a two step procedure first the polymeric microspheres were obtained through emulsion radical copolymerization of 20 vol of h2o in n heptane the aqueous phase was composed of the monomers 4 vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium chloride and

at concentrations of 1 0 mol and 2 0 mol respectively the organic phase was composed of n heptane and span 80 0 025 mol l 1 the polymerization was performed under constant stirring at 400 rpm for 30 min at 70 c later the temperature of the system was reduced and copolymer p clvbta co hema was isolated and washed by soxhlet extraction soxtherm se 412 gerhardt first with n heptane and then with ethanol for 8 h each finally the sample was dried at 40 c for 24 h and sieved to obtain a particle size in the range 75 180 μm the second step consisted of the impregnation of p clvbta co hema microspheres with the inorganic precursor ip zr buto 4 at a concentration of 70 wt diluted with ethanol for 48 h and the subsequent sol gel reaction in ethanol water 1 1 for 24 h to obtain the oxide on the polymer network with the aim to remove all weakly bound oxides the composite microspheres were exhaustively washed with methanol sonicated sieved using nylon filters ny80 millipore and dried in an oven at 60 c hereinafter the hybrid adsorbent will be referred to as ms hzo 2 3 adsorption experiments to assess the arsenic sorption capacity of the hybrid adsorbent together with commercial adsorbents several parameters were studied namely ph dependence sorption isotherms and kinetics sorption elution and selectivity finally as a first approach to the usability of the hybrid in real field conditions aqueous samples were treated in columns using the hybrid adsorbent the effect of ph was assessed by contacting the adsorbent with solutions of as iii and v at a concentration of 10 mg l 1 and a dose of 0 16 ml mg for 24 h at 25 c and constant stirring sorption isotherms were studied at temperatures of 25 35 and 45 c contacting the adsorbent dose of 1 0 ml mg 1 with arsenic solutions of variable concentration 0 05 10 mg l 1 at ph 6 0 for 24 h under constant stirring kinetic sorption studies were performed contacting the hybrid with an arsenic solution of concentration 10 mg l 1 ph 6 0 dose of 1 0 ml mg 1 at 25 c and stirring at 150 rpm in a time range of 0 24 h selectivity studies were performed assessing the effect on arsenic adsorption on the following anions cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 in concentrations of 50 100 and 300 mg l 1 the experiments were performed at 25 c at a dose of 0 16 ml mg 1 stirring at 150 rpm for 24 h the following general procedure was performed for all sorption experiments presented once the time of contact was completed the contact tube was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 3 min and then an aliquot of supernatant was extracted and the concentration of arsenic was measured sorption desorption cycles of the hybrid adsorbent were conducted to determine the reusability capacity for this purpose 50 mg of the adsorbent were contacted with 40 ml of arsenic solution at 10 mg l 1 and ph 6 0 for 5 h subsequently the sorbent was separated from the solution through centrifugation washed with 30 ml of distilled water at ph 6 0 to remove the unbound arsenic and dried overnight at 60 c later arsenic elution was performed by contacting the loaded adsorbent with a solution of 5 0 wt naoh 5 0 wt nacl for 5 h at 25 c under constant stirring at 150 rpm repeating the cycle up to three times the above presented sorption experiments were also performed using commercial adsorbent such as nxt 2 geh 102 and lewatit fo36 for comparison to determine the stability of the adsorbent over time and the potential oxide leaching was assessed for this purpose a mass of the hybrid adsorbent was weighed and contacted with 25 ml of as iii at the concentration of 30 μg l the dispersions were prepared in triplicate and stirred for 3 6 and 9 days heidolph unimax 1010 at 100 rpm after mixing the supernatant solution was removed and the adsorbent dried for 24 h at 50 c and then calcined in a muffle oven jsr model jsms 45t at 600 c for 6 h the percentage of oxide was determined from the ashes after the calcination additionally the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy to observe the changes in the microspheres and by edx the zr cl ratio was determined at 3 6 and 9 days finally sorption experiments were conducted in a continuous column system using the hybrid adsorbent to this natural water samples from two regions of chile antofagasta and lampa with arsenic concentration above the maximum concentration limit 10 μg l 1 were treated to assess the efficiency of the hybrid material as an adsorbent the experiments were performed in a column with a diameter of 10 mm and length of 40 mm connected to a peristaltic pump krosflo research i spectrum labs to reach a constant flux of 1 2 ml min 1 approximately 3 l of water samples were passed through the column and at different time intervals aliquots of purified water were withdrawn for further analysis by aas hg 2 4 characterization techniques infrared spectroscopy the copolymer microspheres were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy using a perkinelmer model 1760 x in a range of 4000 400 cm 1 using kbr pellets with this technique the presence of the characteristic vibrational peaks and of the copolymer functional groups were confirmed scanning electron microscopy both copolymer and hybrid microspheres were analyzed by this technique using a jeol probe cameca model su 30 equipped with energy dispersed x ray spectroscopy the samples were coated with gold prior to analysis except for the hybrid microspheres due to interference of the au emission line mα 2 123 kev and the emission line of zr 2 044 kev n2 adsorption isotherms the specific surface of the hybrid materials was determined using a micromeritics asap 2010 apparatus at 77 k specimens were degassed for 2 h at 100 c prior to analysis and the isotherms were analyzed using the brunauer emmett teller bet method to determine the sample area measurements of arsenic concentration were performed through atomic absorption spectroscopy aas perkinelmer pinaacle 900f usa and hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy hg aas fias 100 for hg aas measurements the aqueous samples were pretreated with 30 0 vol hcl 20 0 wt vol potassium iodide 2 and 10 0 wt vol ascorbic acid for at least 45 min during

for aas respectively whereas the values for hg aas were 0 024 μg l 1 and 0 074 μg l 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of the hybrid adsorbent synthesis of the hybrid adsorbent was performed in a two step process the first stage consisted of synthesis of polymeric microspheres with a functional group such as quaternary amine commonly found in ion exchange resins for arsenate removal for this purpose the monomer 4 vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium chloride which possesses the ammonium group was used allowing for the introduction of functional groups directly during the polymerization and avoiding postsynthesis reactions additionally the comonomer 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate was used because hydroxyl groups i provide additional stability to the polymer particles through hydrogen bonding and ii could covalently bond with the inorganic phase during the subsequent sol gel reaction li et al 2007 the first step of synthesis consisted of inverse emulsion polymerization which obtains hydrophilic polymer microspheres both optical and scanning electron images confirm the sphericity of the copolymers with a uniform surface fig 1 a and b analysis of the microspheres revealed a wide unimodal size distribution ranging from 50 to 150 μm and centered at 80 μm see fig 1c after obtaining the microspheres the second stage consisted of adding the inorganic moiety to the polymer beads the strategy followed was to use a solution of 80 zr buto 4 inorganic precursor in 1 butanol and further dilute this solution with a more polar solvent such as ethanol the use of a cosolvent with a dielectric constant higher than that of 1 butanol implies an increase in the polarity medium and considering the hydrophilic characteristics of the polymeric microspheres these conditions are favorable for swelling and allow access of the ip compound into the polymer toledo et al 2018 in addition the viscosity of the solution decreases from 2 52 mpa s pure 1 butanol to 1 18 mpa s for 1 butanol ethanol in the molar fraction of 0 803 cano gómez et al 2012 in this way the solvent mixture would promote swelling of the microspheres and entry of the inorganic precursor into the polymer network once the microspheres were impregnated formation of the hydrated oxide occurred by means of a sol gel reaction by contacting the beads loaded with an inorganic precursor with water ethanol see eqs 1 3 due to the water content of ethanol at the impregnation step it is possible to assume that the sol gel process begins however the process is completed through contact with ethanol leading to the hydrous zirconium oxide hzo moiety 1 zr buto 4 h2o zr buto 3oh butoh 2 zr buto 3oh zr buto 3oh buto 3zr o zr buto 3 h2o 3 zr buto 3oh zr buto 4 oh buto 2zr o zr

h st 1711 cm 1 co st 1634 cm 1 cc aromatic st and 1477 cm 1 n ch3 3 st while the signals at 1534 and 1371 cm 1 were assigned to the bending vibration of zr oh groups and the signal at 473 cm 1 was assigned to zr o cui et al 2012 luo et al 2013 the presence of these signals confirms that copolymer and zirconium moieties exist to provide visual evidence of obtaining hybrid microspheres scanning electron microscopy equipped with an edxs device was used for analysis fig 3 a shows sem images of the microspheres after impregnation importantly the particles maintain their sphericity after the steps of zr buto 4 impregnation and the sol gel reaction in addition the microspheres have a greater roughness than before impregnation which can be attributed to a layer of hzo on the surface of the beads elemental analysis of the particle surface composition was determined using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy which showed the presence of signals at 0 28 0 53 and 2 63 kev corresponding to the kα emission lines of the elements carbon oxygen and chlorine which are associated with the elements of the repetitive units of the polymer the signal at 2 05 kev corresponds to the emission line lα of zirconium confirming the presence of the element on the surface of the microspheres to determine the content of inorganic moieties samples of the hybrid were calcinated at 500 c for 5 h and at 800 c for 3 h resulting in residual masses of 11 15 1 44 and 4 38 1 89 respectively which can be attributed to the inorganic component an important property of this type of material is swelling the absorption of aqueous solution allows access of the pollutants into the polymer bead and sets out the active site for arsenic oxyanions however excessive swelling could affect the mechanical stability of the particles fig 3c shows images obtained with an optical microscope of the hybrid beads before and after swelling before solvent contact the beads appear to be solid like but after contact with water the particles obtain a gel like appearance because of the solvent content as a consequence the size of the bead increases from 60 μm to 85 μm see fig 3d 3 2 arsenic sorption experiments the first experiment of arsenic sorption assessed the effect of the zirconium phase on the sorption properties of the novel adsorbent for this purpose both copolymer microspheres prior to impregnation with inorganic precursor poly clvbta co hema and the hybrid adsorbent were contacted with arsenate and arsenite solutions see fig 4 a arsenate was observed to be removed by both adsorbents efficiently but only the hybrid adsorbent displayed high arsenite sorption these results confirm the enhanced performance of ms hzo due to the inorganic phase moiety the performance of the hybrid adsorbent was compared to commercially established adsorbents such as ira 400 geh 102 nxt 2 and lewatit fo36 using arsenite and arsenate solutions table 1 reports the characteristics of the adsorbents studied ira 400 is a macroporous strong base anion exchange resin based on poly styrene co divinylbenzene and quaternary ammonium groups geh 102 is an adsorbent widely used in industry for arsenic removal that consists of irregular particles of iron oxide while nxt 2 is an adsorbent based on mixed lanthanum and iron oxides lewatit fo 36 is a weakly basic macroporous anion exchanger based on polystyrene divinylbenzene that contains weak amine functional groups and iron oxide nanoparticles fig 4b shows the results of arsenic adsorption as a function of ph ms hzo and geh 102 were not affected by ph exhibiting constant sorption in the entire ph range whereas nxt 2 displayed slightly decreased sorption under acidic conditions it should be noted that when considering the chemistry of arsenate arsenic acid has three dissociation constants pk1 2 3 pk2 6 8 and pk3 11 6 and therefore arsenate charged species such as h2aso4 haso4 2 and aso4 3 can interact on the surface of the adsorbent as mentioned above arsenate and arsenite can form inner and outer sphere complexes on the oxide surface hristovski and markovski 2017 the last interaction occurs mainly via electrostatic forces between solvated arsenate ions and the charged oxide surface and is therefore ph dependent the corresponding point of zero charge occurs when the surface charge density is zero when ph phpzc the terminating hydroxyl groups on the surface protonate originating positive charges in contrast when ph phpzc the terminating hydroxyl groups on the surface deprotonate producing a negative charge on the surface the reported pzc values of geh 102 β feo oh nxt 2 and hzo are 7 3 kosmulski 2009 12 epminerals 2018 and 6 0 8 6 kosmulski 2002 respectively and hence the sorption observed a low ph is associated with the electrostatic interaction between arsenate ions and the positively charged surface whereas above pzc the inner sphere complexes predominate a very different performance was evidenced for the ira 400 resin where the removal capacity was shown to decrease markedly at ph values lower than 6 because exchange resins of this type have a higher affinity towards the divalent arsenate species that predominates at ph 9 0 clifford and ghurye 2002a fig 4c shows the adsorption of as iii as a function of ph first ira 400 does not exhibit arsenite removal between ph 2 10 and adsorption only occurs in a highly alkaline solution this can be explained because arsenous acid has three dissociation constants pk1 9 1 pk2 12 1 and pk3 13 4 therefore at ph above 10 it is possible to find a high concentration of monovalent anionic species h2aso3 in solution that allow ion exchange with the chloride ions of the ammonium group below ph 9 0 the predominant species of arsenite arsenous acid do not have a charge and therefore it is not possible to remove them with ira 400 in contrast ph was not observed to affect arsenite adsorption of inorganic adsorbents and the hybrid in this case the mechanism involved in sorption could be the formation of inner sphere complexes which is consistent with evidence provided by some authors using iron oxide and zirconium oxides manning et al 1998 ren et al 2011 sverjensky and fukushi 2006 geh 102 and nxt 2 presented the highest removal capacities for both types of arsenic and this was mainly ascribed to the high specific area of these adsorbents however it is important to note that ms hzo presented slightly lower capacity than these adsorbents throughout the ph range even though the oxide content in ms hzo does not exceed 5 the hybrid displayed an outstanding performance for both arsenics overall hydrous zirconium oxide is found mainly on the surface of the microspheres and is responsible for arsenate but mainly arsenite sorption arsenate interacts via electrostatic forces a low ph with the inorganic moiety because the pzc while at higher ph can occur the formation of inner sphere complexes with hzo despite of that the most predominant interaction of arsenate is with the polymer through an ion exchange mechanism at the ammonium groups similar to that observed in strong base anion exchange resins on the contrary the sorption of arsenite occurs excl usively on the hzo moiety because of its uncharged nature through the formation of inner sphere complexes with the oxygens at the surface of the oxide ren et al 2011 it is worth noting that an effective removal process close to neutral ph 6 8 greatly benefits the application of the adsorbent in natural waters and for this reason further sorption experiments will be conducted at ph 6 0 3 3 sorption isotherms adsorption isotherms were performed with the purpose of obtaining useful information about the adsorbent adsorbate interaction by keeping the adsorbent mass constant and varying the concentration of arsenic in solution fig 5 shows the adsorption isotherms of arsenate and arsenite in general all adsorbents were observed to have a greater affinity towards arsenate than arsenite because they have a higher adsorption capacity at lower equilibrium concentrations in particular the commercial adsorbents nxt 2 and geh 102 present more efficient adsorption because of the larger specific area available to interact with the adsorbate see table 2 as expected the hybrid adsorbent presented a performance more similar to the commercial adsorbent lewatit fo36 and judged by the isotherms the hybrid has a higher affinity for arsenate and a similar affinity for arsenite to provide more insight about the adsorption process the isotherms were adjusted to the langmuir isotherm model the following expression gives the langmuir isotherm 4 q e q max b c e 1 b c e where c e mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration q e mg g 1 corresponds to the adsorption capacity at equilibrium q max mg g 1 is the monolayer capacity and b l mg 1 corresponds to the langmuir constant whose meaning is related to adsorption free energy table 2 shows the langmuir isotherm parameters obtained from the nonlinear fitting of the arsenic adsorption isotherms the values of the correlation coefficient indicate good agreement between the experimental data and the isotherm model on the other hand q max confirms that all adsorbents have a greater adsorption capacity for arsenate than arsenite and better performance at higher temperatures except for geh suggesting that adsorption is endothermic in detail nxt and geh achieve a higher arsenate and arsenite removal capacity than the other adsorbents and this is most likely attributed to the fact that both adsorbents have a larger specific area similarly the langmuir constants for these adsorbents are also higher which reveals a higher affinity of the adsorbate adsorbent these structural characteristics of the composite adsorbent can explain the differences observed concerning the other adsorbent on the other hand the parameters of the langmuir isotherm for ms hzo reveal that its performance is similar to that exhibited by lewatit with a slight decrease in q max following the isothermal curves however the langmuir constants for arsenate are much higher than those presented by lewatit fo36 which confirms that there is a higher affinity between ms hzo and arsenate in the case of arsenite ms hzo exhibited an adsorption capacity lower than fo36 but a higher affinity towards adsorbate the higher affinity of arsenic ms hzo compared with lewatit fo36 can be attributed to the structural characteristics of the adsorbents whereas lewatit fo36 corresponds to a weak anion exchange resin it possesses tertiary amines as a functional group and the base structure of the polymer consisting of polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene provides hydrophobicity to the microspheres and the inorganic phase consists of iron oxide nanoparticles located on the internal surfaces of the macroporous adsorbent and a low specific area lanxess 2014 in contrast ms hzo has a more hydrophilic structure that favors the access of analyte to the adsorbent moreover hydrated zirconium oxide is found mainly on the surface of the microspheres favoring arsenite adsorption since the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent is considered a mainly superficial process and in order to make an appropriate comparison between adsorbents with different specific areas it is necessary to normalize the value of q max and express the capacity of adsorption as adsorbate mass per area q norm mg m 2 table 2 shows that the hybrid microspheres prepared for this study have a better performance than previously described calculating a q norm equal to 48 1 mg m 2 at 25 c which is much higher than the rest of the adsorbents thermodynamic considerations of an adsorption process are necessary to conclude whether the process is spontaneous or not the gibbs free energy change δg is an important parameter to evaluate the spontaneity of a process a negative value of δg indicates that the reactions occur spontaneously the free energy of arsenic sorption considering the adsorption equilibrium constant obtained from the langmuir isotherm is given by the following equation 5 δ g 0 r t l n b the thermodynamic parameters δh and δs were obtained using the van t hoff equation 6 log b δ s 0 2 303 r δ h 0 2 303 r t a plot of log b vs 1 t then allows the values of δh and δs to be determined from the slope and intercept respectively see fig 6 table 3 provides the thermodynamic functions δg δh and δs for arsenate and arsenite sorption obtained from the equation 6 for as v all adsorbents displayed negative and similar values of gibbs free energy indicating a spontaneous sorption process similarly the sorption entropy gave values slightly above zero suggesting an increase of the number of molecules after sorption moreover the values of standard enthalpy confirm that ms hzo nxt 2 and geh 102 exhibit an endothermic process in nature while the sorption onto lewatit is exothermic interestingly the values provide information about the nature of the interaction hence the adsorption of as v onto nxt 2 suggest a physical adsorption on the contrary geh 102 revealed an enthalpy above 100 kj mol 1 suggesting a chemisorption process consistent with the formation of a covalent bond associated with the formation of inner sphere complexes notably hybrid adsorbents ms hzo and lewatit fo36 displayed intermediate values of δh associated with physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms the physisorption mechanism is associated with the polymer moiety through an electrostatic interaction between the arsenate oxyanions and the ammonium group of the polymer whereas chemisorption is associated with the formation of inner sphere complexes for as iii the gibbs free energy values were slightly positive indicating a nonspontaneous process while the values of enthalpy indicate both physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms 3 4 sorption kinetics arsenic adsorption as a function of time for the different adsorbents was examined to obtain information about the adsorption kinetics of the hybrid adsorbent and to evaluate its performance concerning other materials fig 7shows the kinetic curves of adsorption all adsorbents were observed to reach maximum capacity in short contact time however analysis of the arsenate adsorption curves at a time less than 1 h reveals that ms hzo has faster adsorption kinetics than the other adsorbents while for the adsorption of arsenite ms hzo presents kinetics of adsorption similar to the other adsorbents but with a lower removal capacity the pseudo second order model pso has been widely used to understand the adsorption process of many systems ho 2006 the equation can be expressed as follows 7 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t and q e correspond to the amounts of arsenic adsorbed mg g at time t and at equilibrium respectively and k 2 is the rate constant of adsorption g mg h fig 7 shows curves of the nonlinear fitting of the model to the experimental data while table 4 shows the parameters of the model that describe adsorption in the case of the adsorption of as v the results show that both the hybrid adsorbents and inorganic adsorbents reach a similar maximum adsorption capacity with a slight advantage from the adsorbents nxt 2 and geh 102 however the rate constant k 2 reveals that the ms hzo hybrid has a rate constant significantly higher than the other adsorbents which explains faster arsenic removal similarly the removal of arsenite by ms hzo showed a higher rate constant than the other adsorbents an additional way to evaluate the rate of adsorption is through the determination of the time necessary to reach a certain percentage of removal by the following expression urbano et al 2012 2015 8 t x w k 2 q e where t x is the necessary time to reach an adsorption equivalent to the fraction x w x 1 x k 2 and q e is the constant of speed and adsorption in equilibrium respectively determined by the pso model thus as the system approaches equilibrium x 1 w and t x table 4 shows the necessary times to reach 50 t 0 5 and 99 t 0 99 arsenic adsorption for arsenate ms hzo needs significantly lower adsorption times to reach the determined percentages while for arsenite although ms hzo presented similar values with fo36 the adsorption was much faster than for the inorganic adsorbents the structural characteristic of the adsorbents can explain these differences ms hzo has a low specific surface and corresponds to a gel like resin where the porous structure appears when the resin swells in a polar solvent thus the hydrophilic resin when in contact with an aqueous solution of arsenic absorbs the solution promoting the meeting of the arsenic oxyanions with the adsorbent active sites in contrast the other adsorbents have a porous and more rigid structure and therefore diffusion of arsenic in the pores of the adsorbent is expected to consume more time 3 5 competing ions studying the adsorption process in the presence of interfering species is significant given that it allows for simulating a real situation in which the effluents are treated which naturally can have a high concentration of other dissolved anions that compete and interfere with arsenic adsorption in this study the effect on the adsorption of arsenate and arsenite in the presence of chloride cl nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 at varying concentrations 50 300 mg l 1 was evaluated at a constant concentration of arsenic 10 mg l 1 fig 8 shows percentages of arsenic removal for the hybrid and commercial adsorbent generally removal of arsenate was observed to present high efficiency for most of the adsorbent and only when the concentration of sulfate is sufficiently high ms hzo presents a slight decrease in adsorption which is attributed to the high affinity of ammonium groups towards sulfate instead of arsenate so4 2 haso4 2 co3 2 cl h2aso4 clifford and ghurye 2002b similarly at high phosphate concentrations geh102 and lewatit exhibited a decrease in arsenate sorption that is in agreement with previous studies using iron oxide where phosphate exhibited the larger effect hongshao and stanforth 2001 kanel et al 2006 on the other hand the performance of the adsorbent in removing arsenite was lower except for the adsorbent nxt 2 which maintained a removal capacity close to 100 for all concentrations of competing anions in this case geh102 and lewatit fo36 showed a significant decrease in removal when the concentration of phosphate and sulfate reached a concentration of 100 mg l 1 respectively in the case of the hybrid adsorbent the presence of competing ions presented a more marked effect than other adsorbents producing a significant decrease in removal and decreasing sorption to 70 especially for sulfate and phosphate these results are in agreement with those reported for zro2 nh2o nanoparticles where phosphate displayed a strong effect on arsenate and arsenic sorption hang et al 2012 pan et al 2014 the anions that have the most interfering effect in arsenic removal are sulfate and phosphate due to their structural similarity with arsenic oxyanions and their negative charge 3 6 adsorption desorption reuse of the adsorbent is a critical variable when scaling an adsorption process and corresponds to one of the essential properties of a polymer type adsorbent ion exchange resin three cycles of adsorption and elution of arsenic v and arsenic iii were performed to evaluate the regeneration capacity of the hybrid adsorbent and the results were compared with the adsorbent geh 102 see fig 9 for the adsorption of as v the hybrid adsorbent displayed a higher performance than the commercial adsorbent showing an approximate decrease of only 10 after three cycles of adsorption while in geh 102 the percentage of adsorption decreased approximately 30 regarding the elution of arsenic in each adsorption cycle it was determined that the hybrid eluted up to 80 of adsorbed as v and on the contrary the commercial adsorbent presented a much lower performance reaching only an elution of 20 during the third cycle of use these results demonstrate the hybrid s high capacity of regeneration and its capacity of reuse due to the mainly electrostatic resin arsenate interaction that is therefore reversible the adsorption of arsenite in the hybrid showed similar results with geh 102 since the adsorption for this compound occurs on the surface of zirconium oxide and iron respectively although in ms hzo only a fraction of the material is composed of zirconium oxide similar removal percentages were achieved with geh 102 which is a 100 adsorbent based on iron oxide demonstrating the excellent performance of the hybrid like adsorption elution of arsenic iii from the hybrid material presented similar percentages of the commercial adsorbent approximately 35 in natural waters underground and surface the proportion of arsenic v is generally higher than arsenic iii and in actively reducing environments the ratio of as iii as v varies between approximately 0 4 0 6 thus the hybrid adsorbent has a more efficient performance than the commercial adsorbent fig 10 shows the study of the durability of the hybrid adsorbent experiments were performed by contacting the adsorbent with an arsenite solution at 30 μg l for 3 6 and 9 days to assess the loss of the inorganic phase the analysis of oxide content carried out by calcination revealed that there is no significant decrease in the oxide content compared to the control adsorbent without treatment similarly the change on the surface of microspheres was assessed determining the zr cl ratio zr associated with the oxide phase and chloride to the polymer phase by eds showing that zr content does not change significantly after the treatment these results are confirmed visually in the sem images of the adsorbents showing that after several days of treatment there are no changes in the surface characteristics on microspheres these results are consistent with what was observed in the sorption desorption experiments fig 9b where the hybrid adsorbent still reaches 60 uptake after the third adsorption cycle the high durability of the adsorbent can be attributed to the covalent bond formed between the copolymer and the inorganic phase occurred through the condensation reaction between the alcohol group of the phema and the inorganic precursor hydrolyzed at the sol gel step 3 7 column studies the removal of arsenic in real samples exhibits a greater complexity than synthetic samples due to variation in its composition depending on the source of origin for this reason the ms hzo adsorbent was studied in its ability to remove arsenic from real groundwater samples sample 1 corresponds to a sample taken from the area of el juncal quilicura metropolitan region chile with the following composition total as 59 6 μg l 1 so4 2 41 1 mg l 1 po4 3 0 17 mg l 1 sio2 12 6 mg l 1 cl 91 1 mg l 1 ph 8 4 sample 2 comes from the city of lampa metropolitan region with the following composition total as 61 3 μg l 1 so4 2 45 5 mg l 1 po4 3 0 1 mg l 1 no3 9 35 mg l 1 cl 19 2 mg l 1 ph 8 5 both samples showed a concentration above the maximum concentration limit mcl recommended by who of 10 μg l 1 the hybrid adsorbent was contacted with the groundwater samples for 5 h at 20 c and a final concentration of 0 58 0 065 μg l 1 was reached for sample a and 0 69 0 057 μg l 1 for sample b see fig 11 a these results indicate that the hybrid adsorbent presented efficient performance in arsenic removal reaching final concentrations lower than the mcl finally the sample from lampa and a third water sample with a higher concentration of arsenic from a city north of chile called antofagasta were studied by a small column procedure the composition of this sample was total as 384 μg l 1 so4 2 150 5 mg l 1 cl 540 mg l 1 ph 8 3 fig 11b displays the arsenic concentration in the solution after passing through the column filled with ms hzo adsorbent the breakthrough curve shows that is possible to treat approximately 1 5 l of real sample maintaining a concentration below 10 μg l with an approximate mass of adsorbent of 0 5 g as expected for the antofagasta sample the mcl was exceeded at a lower volume of sample because the sample had a higher concentration of arsenic and consequently saturated the adsorbent more rapidly finally regeneration of the adsorbent bed was performed using a solution of 5 naoh nacl reaching an efficient elution using less than 100 ml of solution see fig 11c 4 conclusions hybrid microspheres were successfully synthesized in two stages i synthesis of copolymeric microspheres and ii impregnation and sol gel of a zirconium tetrabutoxide inorganic precursor it was confirmed that the zirconium moiety was located mainly on the surface of copolymer microspheres with a diameter of approximately of 80 μm the hybrid material presented advantageous characteristics of both materials on one hand hzo allowed for arsenite removal with the need for pre oxidation to arsenate while the arsenates are retained by the cationic polymer reaching arsenic concentrations below 10 μg l 1 in real samples with initial concentrations as high as 380 μg l 1 comparison of the sorption performance of the hybrid with commercial adsorbents revealed that ms hzo displayed outstanding sorption considering that the responsible phase of as iii sorption was less than 5 wt and the commercial adsorbents such as geh 102 and nxt 2 were 100 inorganic materials declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

dalecarlia drinking water treatment plant in washington d c the second wtr was sourced from an aqua america drinking water treatment plant in philadelphia pa at a mc of 3 51 0 11 g wet g dry 71 1 the dalecarlia wtr d and aqua america wtr aa wtrs are aluminum based resulting from the coagulation flocculation and settling process using alum addition the aqua america treatment plant also adds

each kg contains 905 g shale 85 g wtr and 10 g psyllium by oven dry mass this ratio was selected based on experimentation with different mix proportions more wtr could be used in the mix but there is a trade off between wtr content and hydraulic conductivity for example doubling the wtr decreased the hydraulic conductivity by 68 from 9 0 10 4 m s ostrom et al 2019 to 2 9 10 4 m s supplemental data

were placed at the bottom of each box for effluent sampling approximately 1 5 cm of water washed pea gravel filled the space around and to the top of the drainage pipes and a 5 cm layer of hpmm was placed on top of the pea gravel layer hpmm used in mesocosm testing was determined to have bulk density of 0 72 g cm3 each mesocosm therefore contained 0 015 m3 and 11 1 kg of hpmm hpmm d was placed in box 1 and hpmm aa was placed in box 2 a single paverguide grid was then placed over the hpmm layer paverguide is a proprietary geosynthetic product which can replace the typical stone base in permeable pavements rainfall was simulated using misting devices positioned at the top corners of each box and fed by individual flow lines using peristaltic pumps synthetic stormwater was prepared by adding representative urban runoff constituents to tap water table 1 no additional p was added as the tap water was found to contain levels approximately equal to those reported in stormwater runoff pitt and maestre 2005 only tp and tdp were analyzed in this study however work by mangum et al 2019 using the same tap water source and influent composition found tdp to be nearly 100 soluble reactive phosphorus srp considered as orthophosphate this experimental design simulates rainfall applied directly to a pavement surface i e no run on flow at different rainfall intensities water infiltrated into a permeable pavement from direct rainfall would contain only the pollutants washed from the pavement surface past studies have shown pollutant accumulation on pavements to be site specific and to vary with use gilbert and clausen 2006 dietz 2007 bean et al 2007 three sets of storm simulations were carried out the first set consisted of 12 simulations conducted on box 1 containing hpmm d configuration d the second set of 12 simulations was conducted on box 1 containing hpmm d configuration d iws and box 2 containing hpmm aa configuration aa simultaneously for the second set the outflow tube in box 1 was elevated to maintain the water level inside the mesocosm at the top of the hpmm layer thus creating a 5 cm iws zone in the third set an additional 5 storm simulations were carried out on box 1 and 2 simultaneously configurations d iws and aa respectively this set consisted of storm simulations conducted to test reproducibility of results and investigate effects of increased carbon concentration on n treatment each storm was conducted under a predetermined combination of rainfall intensity i 0 66 0 02 1 34 0 06 1 95 0 05 or 2 62 0 10 cm h and influent ph 5 97 0

to 27 l 3 9 8 7 cm of influent was used in each simulation resulting in 6 4 and 3 hour storm durations a total depth of 78 cm was applied to configuration d and 113 cm of water was applied to each of configurations d iws and aa this represents 0 70 and 1 02 years of annual rainfall respectively using the long term average 111 cm yr for college park md usa arguez et al 2010 simulations were conducted regularly to maintain an average antecedent dry period adp of 11 8 days range 4 46 days for each simulation 4 12 effluent samples were collected at even intervals apart from sample 1 which was collected as outflow first occurred the delay between the start of influent and effluent flow indicates some amount of storage within the mesocosm setup likely in the bottom of the box and in moisture retained by the hpmm as noted by the as received moisture content wtr can retain significant water above a 3 1 wet to dry mass ratio samples were analyzed for ph tp total dp tdp total n tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and total al cu fe pb and zn as detailed in section 2 3 event mean concentration emc is defined as 1 e m c t i t f q t c t d t t i t f q t d t where c t concentration in sample collected at time t q t flow rate at time t and ti and tf represent time at the start and end of flow respectively the integral was approximated using the trapezoidal rule emc for ph was calculated by converting individual ph measurements to h ion concentration h inputting h into equation 1 and converting the emc back to ph units 2 3 analytical procedures sample ph was measured using a glass electrode probe with ag agcl reference to an accuracy of 0 01 units oxidation reduction potential orp was measured using an orp probe mettler toledo ma235 greifensee switzerland the orp probe was installed at the outlet of box 1 after an iws zone was created this allowed for the probe to be permanently submerged while taking readings of effluent from the mesocosm tp and tdp concentrations were determined to a detection limit of 0 01 mg l p as described in ostrom et al 2019 using standard method 4500 p apha et al 2012 and a method modified from wolf and baker 1990 tn was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer with a total nitrogen measuring unit toc analyzer shimazdu kyoto japan the detection limit was 0 05 mg l as n nh4 n concentrations were measured using the phenate method from standard method 4500 nh3 apha et al 2012 absorbance was measured with a 1 cm path length cuvette at 640 nm in a uv visible spectrophotometer to a detection limit of 0 05 mg l as n samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm ceramic filter prior to nitrate and nitrite analysis no3 n was measured using ion chromatography ics 1100 dionex sunnyvale ca following standard method 4110 a 4 5 mm na2co3

flow rate of 1 2 ml min the detection limit was 0 1 mg l as n no2 n was analyzed colorimetrically in a uv visible spectrophotometer at 543 nm following standard method 4500 no2 apha et al 2012 with a 1 cm path length cuvette to a detection limit of 0 01 mg l as n no2 n consistently accounted for less than 3 of tn and is therefore excluded from discussion total al cu fe pb and zn concentrations of samples acidified with trace metal grade nitric acid were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icpe 9000 plasma atomic emission spectrometer shimazdu kyoto japan at wavelengths of 394 403 324 754 259 940 220 353 and 213 856 nm respectively the detection limit for al fe and pb was 25 μg l and for cu and zn the limit was 10 μg l all pb samples were below the detection limit therefore pb results are not discussed here values below corresponding detection limits for all parameters have been assigned following the probability plot method from helsel and hirsch 2002 and helsel 2005 the two sided wilcoxon mann whitney rank sum test was employed to determine statistically significant difference at the 95 confidence level α 0 05 this non parametric test is appropriate for small sample sizes regardless of distribution helsel and hirsch 2002 kendall s tau τ was used to test for significance of correlations at the 95 confidence level α 0 05 with values of τ ranging from 1 to 1 indicating relatively stronger negative and positive correlations respectively helsel and hirsch 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus measured influent and effluent tdp concentrations for all storm simulations are presented in fig 1 effluent tdp concentration was lower than influent for all samples effluent concentrations of individual samples remained stable throughout most simulations with standard deviation sd less than 0 02 mg l p for 80 of the 36 storms the remaining 20 of storms exhibited greater variation however no consistent trend e g initial flush of higher concentrations is apparent across storms simulations to assess overall performance tdp emcs for each set of 12 storms were grouped by configuration and are presented in fig 2 effluent tdp emc was observed between 0 01 and 0 15 mg l p fig 2a while event removal efficiency ranged from 48 to 98 the median effluent tdp emcs were 0 05 0 045 and 0 045 mg l p for configurations d aa and d iws respectively these were significantly lower p 3 42 10 5 p 3 36 10 5 p 3 46 10 5 compared to influent while no significant difference p 0 502 for d and aa p 0 522 for d and d iws p 0 930 for aa and d iws was observed among configurations effluent tdp emc concentrations were below the epa recommended 0 03656 mg l tp for rivers and streams in ecoregion xiv usepa 2000 for all but one storm at rainfall intensity i 0 66 cm h this i is just lower than the 1 yr average return interval ari event averaged storm intensity for a 6 h storm for college park md 0 8 cm h bonnin et al 2006 it also exceeds the rainfall intensity of at least 61 of maryland storms analyzed by kreeb 2003 tp was measured in a subset of samples and was consistently 10 greater than tdp if tdp emc results were increased by 10 to approximate tp emc all but the same single storm event at i 0 66 cm h still fell below the epa recommended level for tp the data therefore support the hypothesis that hpmm can achieve effective p retention for storm intensities in this range a statistically significant positive trend toward higher effluent tdp emc at higher rainfall intensity is apparent for configurations d τ 0 769 p 0 006 and aa τ 0 467 p 0 047 fig 3 a a positive linear relationship between tdp emc and rainfall intensity is not statistically significant for d iws τ 0 244 p 0 293 this supports the hypothesis that dp retention will decrease as rainfall intensity increases weaker correlation between tdp emc and rainfall intensity for configuration d iws is likely due to differences in the flow regime of this configuration because the outlet is elevated water saturates the media layer following each storm and remains there until the start of the next storm as new influent is applied water retained from the previous storm is pushed out of the outlet contact time for this old water with the media is a function of the time between storms rather than the rainfall intensity of the current storm simulation additionally flow in the d iws configuration occurs under saturated conditions in contrast to the d and aa configurations for which flow is through unsaturated media these differences in flow regime appear to result in a damping of the effect of rainfall intensity on dp retention in the d iws configuration correlations between effluent tdp emc and effluent ph emc for configurations d τ 0 295 p 0 285 and aa τ 0 226 p 0 325 are not statistically significant the scatter and distribution indicate the relationship is influenced by extreme points in the data set or the relationship may not be linear a statistically significant positive correlation was found for configuration d iws τ 0 537 p 0 021 it was hypothesized that p retention would decrease with increased ph based on previous research demonstrating this ph effect on phosphate adsorption onto aluminum oxide materials goldberg and sposito 1984 tanada et al 2003 recall that tdp in this study was present as srp orthophosphate orthophosphate is a triprotic acid and its speciation is ph dependent with h2po4 and hpo4 2 being the predominant dissolved species at ph typical of urban runoff 7 50 0 75 stumm and morgan 1996 clary et al 2017 higher ph causes the alumina surface to be more negatively charged increasing the repulsive force acting on negatively charged h2po4 and hpo4 2 chen et al 1973b adsorption of anions is also a competitive process surface complexation i e adsorption of phosphate species onto metal hydroxides occurs primarily through ligand exchange where phosphate anions replace hydroxyl oh ions bound to the adsorptive surface this buffering by the media resulted in effluent ph values that did not vary as much as influent ph greater oh ion concentration at higher ph however can result in reduced adsorption of phosphate brattebø and ødegaard 1986 stumm and morgan 1996 some of the anticipated correlation between effluent tdp and effluent ph may have been masked by the relatively stronger effect of rainfall intensity on effluent tdp particularly for configurations d and aa for which tdp and i were significantly correlated fig 3a a model developed by ostrom et al 2019 to describe dp retention by hpmm was employed to describe the effect of rainfall intensity on effluent tdp in the mesocosms the model shown in equation 2 was developed based on known p adsorption mechanisms and assuming plug flow conditions for flow through the media 2 c o u t c i n 1 e β 0 m e β 0 m β 1 v m q cout and cin represent effluent and influent tdp concentrations respectively equation 2 was calibrated using data from long term p loading experiments to obtain values for the fitting parameter β0 related to long term adsorption capacity of the media cumulative dp loading in mg p kg media is represented by σm as adsorption sites on the media surface become occupied with increased dp loading the gradient between the dp concentration in equilibrium with the reactive surface and the dp concentration in the bulk fluid decreases resulting in lower dp removal this effect was verified through long term column testing in which a scaled down shale 2 mm version of the hpmm d used in the present study was subjected to continuous flow of synthetic stormwater ostrom et al 2019 that study showed dp retention to decay exponentially with increased cumulative dp loading β1 is a parameter used to describe rates of short term adsorption onto hpmm as a function of media specific adsorption kinetics and media reactive surface area vm is the bulk media volume and q is volumetric flowrate first order kinetics were assumed to describe the effect of contact time vm q on p adsorption equation 2 was used to calculate β1 for the specific cout cin and q of each of 12 storm simulations from the present study using tdp emcs cumulative p loading σm was set to zero because loading from 12 storm simulations represents less than 1 m of rainfall loading which is insignificant compared to the projected loading capacity of over 600 m before reaching p saturation of the media found by ostrom et al 2019 in long term column studies calculated β1 values were plotted against effluent ph emc fig 4 β1 relates to adsorption rates with higher values corresponding to faster adsorption a negative correlation between β1 and ph is observed for all configurations with the relationship statistically significant for d τ 0 611 p 0 025 and d iws τ 0 457 p 0 044 but not aa τ 0 242 p 0 311 β1 increases as ph decreases indicating faster adsorption at lower ph this result is consistent with previous studies with aluminum oxide materials showing an increase in phosphate removal rate as ph decreased chen et al 1973a and supports the hypothesis that dp retention by hpmm as used in a permeable pavement base layer is negatively correlated with ph equation 2 can be modified to include the ph dependence of β 1 a linear model is assumed for simplicity where β 1 a 0 a 1 p h 3 c o u t c i n 1 e β 0 m e β 0 m a 0 a 1 p h d v equation 3 also expresses v m q in terms of media depth d and actual fluid velocity through the media v this representation is used because flow velocity controls advective transport through the media and is expected to influence p retention rate actual velocity was not directly measured in these experiments and may be influenced by several factors as described by the horton and green ampt models for soil infiltration horton 1941 discussed a variety of factors which may influence the rate of rain infiltration into a soil these factors include temperature rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture or rainfall horton 1941 also described the exponential decrease in infiltration rate with rain duration the infiltration rate approaches a constant value as unsaturated conditions such as those encountered under configurations d and aa in the present mesocosm experiments become saturated under saturated flow conditions velocity is related to saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat as described by darcy s law mccuen 2005 to account for these factors velocity v is expressed in equation 4 as a simple linear function of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and rainfall intensity i where v b 0 k s a t b 1 i the resulting model is an improvement over equation 2 by integrating additional mechanistic considerations related to ph and rainfall intensity 4 c o u t c i n 1 e β 0 m e β 0 m a 0 a 1 p h d b 0 k s a t b 1 i it should be noted that the flow regime in configuration d iws is not well represented by equation 4 because the contact time between storm events is not considered equation 4 improves on the description of adsorption developed in ostrom et al 2019 i e equation 2 by better describing the effect of short term kinetic rates and considering the effect of ph and rainfall intensity on dp retention experimental data from the present mesocosm study can be used to parameterize the short term kinetic components through the fitting parameters a0 a1 b0 and b1 operational conditions and measured parameters i e d ksat i influent tdp emc effluent ph emc for all 12 storm simulations were input into equation 4 to predict effluent tdp emc the ksat value reported in ostrom et al 2019 for hpmm d 324 cm h 9 0 10 4 m s was used for all configurations because hydraulic conductivity was not assessed for hpmm aa because σm was set to zero for the mesocosm study the value of β0 is inconsequential to this calibration step fitting parameters a0 a1 b0 and b1 were varied using excel s solver function with the grg nonlinear method to find the best fit by maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse resulting fitting parameter and nse values are summarized in table 2 as expected a0 values were positive and a1 negative resulting in a model indicating decreasing adsorption as ph increases which was the trend observed in measured data shown in fig 4 the velocity related parameters b0 and b1 were both positive which affirms the expectation that increased hydraulic conductivity and rainfall intensity should result in higher velocity of flow through the media the b1 value for configuration d is also two orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding values for d iws and aa which reflects the relatively stronger influence of rainfall intensity on tdp removal for configuration d as shown in fig 3a and helps explain the better model fit for configuration d because of the limited data available equation 4 was calibrated using data from all 12 storm simulations in each configuration to generate values for the fitting parameters a0 a1 b0 and b1 related to ph hydraulic conductivity and rainfall intensity despite this limitation the nse can be used to assess the goodness of fit of equation 4 to calibration data good model fit and agreement was found between modeled and measured values for configuration d fig 5 the relationship was found to be 1 03 to 1 with an nse value of 0 91 equation 4 slightly underestimates effluent tdp for configurations aa and d iws with a 0 92 1 ratio of modeled to measured concentrations for the former and a 0 89 1 ratio for the latter nse values of 0 48 and 0 59 for configurations aa and d iws respectively also indicate good model fit though not as good as for configuration d the better model fit for configuration d was driven by greater sensitivity to rainfall intensity under this configuration a flatter tdp distribution with respect to rainfall intensity was found for configurations aa and d iws this can be explained for configuration d iws by the damping effect on rainfall intensity as described above from the different flow regime created by the iws zone differences in treatment effectiveness for configuration aa may have been due to differences in the wtr source and composition results from oxalate extractions table 3 demonstrated wtr d and wtr aa to have similar oxalate ratios which has been shown to correspond to p treatment capacity yan et al 2018 therefore or is unlikely to explain the difference in treatment performance between these wtrs wtr aa contains an activated carbon coagulant aid and organic polymer flocculant aid which wtr d does not coagulant and flocculant aids generally result in stickier and larger flocs being formed crittenden et al 2012 the presence of these components may have resulted in wtr aggregation causing narrowing of flow paths through the hpmm which could weaken the influence of rainfall intensity on flow velocity this appeared to be the case based on visual inspection of hpmm aa and hpmm d hpmm d contains higher amorphous al and fe than expected based on oxalate extractions of wtr d table 3 this may be due to al and fe contained in the expanded shale chemical analysis provided by the supplier shows a typical shale composition to include 19 alumina and 4 ferric oxide p content was also lower than projected expanded shale creates a dilution effect in which the shale contributes total mass but not p oxalate extraction results also showed increased p content in media after rainfall simulations compared to freshly mixed hpmm table 3 the p content of hpmm d increased from 1 53 to 6 76 mmol kg hpmm this increase supports the hypothesis that hpmm will retain p 3 1 1 design tool model application the model given by equation 4 can inform design decisions for permeable paving installations using hpmm as a base material equation 4 combines understanding of the importance of long term p adsorption capacity and short term adsorption kinetic rates for p removal long term p adsorption capacity controls the volume of stormwater that can be treated before reaching p saturation and therefore the length of service this was explored by ostrom et al 2019 through long term column adsorption studies with hpmm subjected to over 600 m of synthetic stormwater the model utility is broadened and evaluated under more realistic simulations in the present study resulting in a model representative of hpmm treatment effectiveness fig 6 shows predicted tdp removal using equation 4 for a 5 cm base layer of hpmm d at different loading ratios using assumptions representative of conditions in college park maryland assumptions include c0 0 20 mg l tdp rainfall intensity 1 27 cm h ph 7 0 annual precipitation 1 11 m arguez et al 2010 k 324 cm h and hpmm density 719 kg m3 under these assumptions an initial tdp removal efficiency of 80 90 is expected diminishing after 80 years to 60 70 for a 1 1 loading ratio loading ratio is defined as the ratio of contributing area to treatment surface area with 1 1 representing a pavement treating only rainfall falling directly onto the pavement and higher ratios including adjacent areas contributing runoff to permeable pavement removal efficiency drops more sharply under higher loading ratios with a 20 1 loading ratio predicted to result in p saturation of the media and removal efficiency near zero after 50 years a designer may use the tool to strike the desired balance between loading ratio removal efficiency and pavement lifetime the uniform rainfall intensity of 1 27 cm h 0 5 in h used for the design tool is representative of a 5 yr ari 6 h duration precipitation event in college park md and is near the range of most frequently observed storm sizes and durations in maryland based on analysis by kreeb 2003 it is also representative of a storm intensity likely to generate substantial throughflow because homogenous conditions are modeled over a long time a range 10 is given around the predicted removal efficiency to account for fluctuations in removal resulting from variations in influent dp concentration ph rainfall intensity and other parameters that will vary from storm to storm this uncertainty also reflects expected variation under field conditions which may result from differences in parameters controlled under lab conditions e g temperature adp scm design lab performance and models describing treatment have differed from field performance in past studies of scms erickson et al 2012 huang et al 2016 the model developed here could potentially be expanded with further data to include other treatment media this could enable better informed decisions and improve estimates from watershed scale models incorporating scms 3 2 nitrogen effluent n emcs were higher than influent for configurations d and aa across all storm events simulated this was true for tn nh4 n and no3 n n data are only available across all three configurations for a subset of 6 storm events consisting of the 3rd through 9th storms for each configuration examining this subset the median of emcs for tn increased from 3 95 to 4 61 mg l for d and 3 99 5 07 mg l for aa and decreased from 3 99 to 3 88 mg l for d iws fig 2 the increase in tn emcs was statistically significant for configurations d p 0 045 and aa p 0 037 but the decrease for d iws p 0 897 was not as hypothesized inclusion of an iws in configuration d iws did improve n treatment but this effect was not consistent across all storm simulations the data do not support the hypothesis that configuration aa will improve n retention compared to configuration d in fact the median effluent emc was higher in configuration aa than in d for both tn p 0 630 and no3 n p 0 230 though the increase in emcs was not significant median effluent nh4 n emc was lower in aa than in d but the decrease was also not significant p 0 784 influent n was added as nitrate nano3 and organic n glycine in a 1 2 n ratio effluent n was dominated by nitrate under configurations d and aa fig 7 effluent ammonium concentrations also increased slightly from influent this indicates mineralization and nitrification likely occurred in these mesocosms transforming organic n to nh4 n and ultimately to no3 n higher effluent tn concentrations are indicative of n leaching from scm media and has been observed in past studies li and davis 2014 leached n also appears to have been flushed from the media at the start of each storm with effluent tn and no3 n concentrations initially higher than influent these initially elevated concentrations approached influent levels toward the end of each storm event this is further evidence of mineralization and nitrification occurring between storm events enabling flushing of soluble no3 n in subsequent storm simulations stabilizer was evaluated as a source of this leached n stabilizer dissolved in a 5 acetone solution was analyzed for tn and found to contain 61 4 mg n per kg wtr however is more likely the significant n source studies by others have found wtr to contain up to 500 mg n kg wtr dayton and basta 2001 lei and davis 2019 at this concentration hpmm is estimated to contain 42 5 mg n from wtr and only 0 6 mg n from stabilizer per kg of hpmm each mesocosm box contains an estimated 472 mg n this mass of n equates to approximately one third of the influent tn load under conditions simulated in the present study i e 100 cm of synthetic stormwater applied at 4 mg l tn previous studies have been undertaken using wtr as an scm media amendment but typically these have been in contexts with n export from other sources masking n export from wtr specifically or n has not been a focus of the study lucas and greenway 2011 liu et al 2014 treatment performance in configuration d iws can be divided into three subsets based on effluent tn concentrations the first includes 4 of 17 total storm simulations shaded in fig 7b in which tn was lower in all effluent samples than in influent this subset consisting of two separate periods is defined by n removal occurring throughout each storm simulation a second subset includes 10 of 17 storms in which tn was higher in effluent than in influent for all samples this subset is characterized by n export the third subset includes each storm immediately before and after a n removal period a total of 3 storms this subset is designated to clearly differentiate between the other two subsets fig 8 provides a comparative illustration of n transformations during periods with n export fig 8a and periods with n removal fig 8b in the former tn total mass load increased by 12 from influent to effluent with no3 n constituting over 90 of effluent n load as discussed previously for configurations d and aa mineralization of organic n to nh4 n and nitrification of nh4 n to no3 n are thought to have been the dominant n transformation process for this subset of d iws simulations this is supported by an 82 decrease in organic n load from influent to effluent accompanied by a 72 increase in discharge no3 n load over these 10 storms these storms also exhibited the same flushing trend found in configurations d and aa with elevated effluent tn and no3 n at the start of each simulation decreasing to approach influent concentrations by the end fig 7b in the subset exhibiting n removal tn load decreased by 33 from influent to effluent fig 8b the median of effluent tn emcs for these 4 storms was 3 39 mg l which still exceeds the epa water quality criterion of 0 69 mg l usepa 2000 but represents a significant reduction p 0 030 from influent tn emcs with a median value of 4 00 mg l mineralization of organic n to nh4 n likely occurred during this subset of storms as evidenced by a 37 decrease in organic n and 16 increase in nh4 n load no3 n load decreased by 34 likely due to denitrification occurring in the mesocosm to advance denitrification reducing conditions and an electron donor such as an appropriate carbon source are required orp can be used as a gauge for the presence of reducing conditions peterson et al 2015 drift was observed in the orp probe fig 7d making it difficult to conclude whether reducing conditions were present or not in the d iws mesocosm there is however a consistent trend on a storm by storm basis of orp dropping between storm events and increasing rapidly at the start of each storm as oxygenated influent water flushed the old water from the iws zone effluent tn and no3 n concentrations also followed this flushing trend in the n removal subset of simulations the lowest concentrations were observed at the start and approached influent levels near the end of each simulation this suggests conditions were conducive to denitrification during the inter storm periods when retention time was much longer than during storm simulations lopez ponnada et al 2017 additional evidence of the presence of reducing conditions comes from metals data total fe concentrations were below the 25 μg l detection limit for all samples except those from the second storm simulation in configuration d iws when the mesocosm is thought to have been transitioning from oxidizing to reducing conditions and the initial n removal period began elevated effluent fe concentrations may indicate reducing conditions in which insoluble fe iii was converted to soluble fe ii and flushed out of the system denitrification is thought to have been limited by carbon availability which has been shown to be a controlling factor in denitrification in scm studies peterson et al 2015 waller et al 2018 wtr is presumed to be the c source in this system an initial period of putative denitrification occurred between the third and fifth storm events it is hypothesized that this initial n removal period ceased as the om in the wtr was exhausted as a c source and the system became c limited analysis by dayton et al 2003 found a low median organic c content of 63 0 g kg 6 3 in a study of wtrs from 21 different sources despite the presence of reducing conditions following the fifth storm event denitrification was not apparent because of this c limitation and n removal was not observed in the final two storm simulations influent c was increased by a factor of 10 to 13 mg l as c by adding sodium acetate this stimulated a second n removal period for the final storm in which tn and no3 n concentrations were again lower for effluent samples compared to influent for long term n removal to be viable in this system a more significant c source than the om present in wtr is required for example peterson et al 2015 used woodchips with c content on the order of 50 and ashoori et al 2019 further amended a woodchip reactor with biochar at 78 c it may be possible to integrate these or other low cost materials into hpmm as long term c sources to improve n removal 3 3 metals the primary metal of concern for leaching from the test media is al because hpmm uses al based wtr table 3 mesocosm results indicate low al leaching under conditions representative of stormwater runoff effluent al emcs were below the 25 μg l detection limit for all storms simulated across all configurations these concentrations are well below the epa ambient water quality criterion for al 87 μg l for freshwater at ph between 6 5 and 9 0 usepa 1988 all effluent samples from configurations aa and d iws had total al concentrations below 25 μg l while a few individual effluent samples were found above 25 μg l in earlier storm events simulated in configuration d the highest concentration 123 μg l occurred in the first sample collected and was the only sample to exceed the epa limit it is likely the few elevated al concentrations were due to initial wash out of fines containing powdered wtr or shale from the newly established media rather than from al being solubilized because ph remained between 6 and 8 for all effluent samples al solubility is minimal approximately 9 μg l 10 6 5 m total al at ph in this range stumm and morgan 1996 ippolito et al 2011 the observed wash out indicates the importance of mix preparation in binding fines into the media total fe emcs decreased from influent to effluent for all configurations the decrease from median values of 28 to 16 μg l was not statistically significant for configuration d p 0 054 while both influent and effluent median emc were below the 25 μg l detection limit for configurations aa and d iws the epa sets ambient water quality criteria for fe at 1000 μg l usepa 1986 effluent total fe was far below this level for all samples across all storm simulations and under all configurations influent was spiked with cu and zn to determine if hpmm can remove these potentially toxic water pollutants from stormwater results indicate effective and consistent cu and zn removal this removal is likely due to a combination of sorption to om and complexation with al oxides in the wtr castaldi et al 2015 emcs were significantly lower for effluent compared to influent across configurations d aa and d iws for both metals fig 2e and f cu p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 001 zn p 1 82 10 4 p 3 66 10 5 p 8 06 10 5 effluent total cu emc averaged 30 24 and 18 μg l for configurations d aa and d iws respectively the mean of effluent total zn emcs was 67 92 and 47 μg l for the same configurations the concentrations are relative to overall mean influent concentrations of 61 81 and 73 μg l cu and 255 499 and 458 μg l zn for d aa and d iws respectively water quality criteria for cu are highly site and species specific but typically are on the order of a few μg l usepa 2016 zn levels in all three configurations were below the epa criterion for acute toxicity to freshwater aquatic life of 133 μg l usepa 1996 metals toxicity can depend on water chemistry of the receiving water including factors such as ph hardness alkalinity and om concentrations the fraction of the metal in dissolved form can also be important as can specific aquatic life of concern in the local area usepa 2016 with these complications in mind it can be concluded that hpmm does not present a concern for al or fe leaching under conditions typical of stormwater runoff hpmm can effectively and consistently reduce cu and zn concentrations this reduction is sufficient to attain water quality standards for zn but is likely insufficient to meet very stringent cu standards 4 conclusions a novel stormwater treatment media hpmm was shown effective at reducing dp and total metals concentrations in stormwater under simulated rainfall events dp retention increased at lower rainfall intensity and lower ph al leaching from the wtr containing media was not found to be an issue the media is a potential source of n export but demonstrated capacity to reduce n concentrations by including an iws zone if adequate c is available differences in wtr source did not significantly influence n retention a 5 cm layer of hpmm reduced influent tdp emcs from an average of 0 22 mg l to a maximum of 0 05 mg l p for storm simulations with 0 66 cm h rainfall intensity at ph between 5 86 and 8 23 typical of stormwater ph for 9 simulations at this rainfall intensity 8 fell below the epa water quality criteria of 0 03656 mg l for tp this intensity is slightly lower than the 1 yr ari for college park md and likely exceeds the intensity of at least 2 3 of maryland storms hpmm did not remove n under aerobic conditions and the wtr contained in it may be a source of n export an iws zone however was successful in decreasing effluent n when adequate c was present to advance denitrification a 33 decrease in tn load and 34 decrease in no3 n load was achieved in this case wtr was shown to be a limited c source for denitrification and wtr source had no significant impact on n retention no leaching of cu fe or zn from hpmm was found under the conditions tested in this study e g ph between 6 and 9 influent cu and zn concentrations were lowered significantly using hpmm additional treatment may be necessary to further lower cu concentrations to avoid toxic effects if that is a target metal effluent total al emcs were found to be below the 25 μg l detection limit for all storm simulations initial export of al was observed in a few samples however but rapidly ceased this can likely be mitigated through careful mix preparation ensuring complete binding of fines to the media a model developed in previous work with long term column studies equation 4 was refined with further mechanistic understanding of the effect of rainfall intensity and ph on short term p adsorption kinetics it was fit to mesocosm experimental data to predict effluent tdp concentration from hpmm as a function of ph hydraulic conductivity rainfall intensity cumulative p loading and media depth excellent model fit was found for configuration d with an nse value of 0 91 configurations aa and d iws had good but poorer model fit with nse values of 0 48 and 0 59 respectively equation 4 can be used to inform permeable pavement base design decisions including balancing desired removal efficiency with loading ratio and design

18472,an enhanced stormwater treatment media developed previously by the authors was shown to effectively retain dissolved phosphorus dp and total cu and zn under simulated rainfall the media comprises expanded shale aggregate aluminum based water treatment residual wtr and a psyllium based binder a 5 cm layer of media was installed as a permeable pavement base layer in a laboratory mesocosm and subjected to rainfall simulations using synthetic stormwater at rainfall intensity of 0 66 cm h effluent dp event mean concentration emc fell from an average of 0 22 mg l p to below the epa water quality criterion of 0 037 mg l in 8 of 9 storms dp retention increased at lower rainfall intensity and lower ph effluent emc was lowered to less than 30 μg l for total cu and less than 92 μg l for total zn on average relative to average influent emcs above 61 and 255 μg l for total cu and zn respectively effluent total al emcs were below the 25 μg l detection limit for all storm simulations indicating al leaching from the wtr containing media not to be an issue inclusion of an internal water storage iws zone resulted in a 33 total nitrogen tn load reduction when adequate carbon was present to advance denitrification this study provides an evaluation and demonstrates expected treatment performance of a novel stormwater treatment media under conditions representative of

on maintaining high quality water resources in and around urban areas the impetus to protect these surface waters from pollution likewise increases stormwater runoff is an important avenue for

al 2005 to improve dissolved pollutant retention in permeable pavements a novel treatment media was developed as described in ostrom et al 2019 this structural treatment media dubbed high permeability media mixture hpmm was designed as a permeable pavement base material capable of retaining dp in stormwater hpmm comprises aluminum based water treatment residual wtr expanded shale lightweight aggregate shale and a psyllium based soil binder psyllium laboratory studies showed effective dp retention using hpmm ostrom et al 2019 but further study is required with the goal of assessing hpmm treatment performance under more realistic conditions e g rainfall simulations and to determine the potential of the material to leach or retain n and metals the following objectives were identified to achieve this goal 1 evaluate phosphorus p nitrogen n and metals retention onto hpmm in rainfall simulations with the hypothesis that hpmm will achieve effective p and metals removal but will not significantly retain n 2 analyze the influence of simulated rainfall intensity contact time and ph on dp treatment with the hypothesis that dp retention is negatively correlated with rainfall intensity and ph 3 compare pollutant removal for hpmm prepared using two different wtr sources testing the hypothesis that wtr containing activated carbon will achieve greater n retention 4 investigate the potential for a hppm iws zone to enhance n removal via denitrification to support the hypothesis that reducing conditions can be created in an iws zone to advance denitrification and remove n 5 test al leaching from hpmm under simulated rainfall stormwater conditions with the hypothesis that al leaching will not be significant in the ph range typical of urban stormwater 2 methods and materials 2 1 high permeability media mixture wtr used in this study was collected from two sources the first wtr was sourced at a moisture content mc of 3 22 0 17 g wet g dry 69 2 from the dalecarlia drinking water treatment plant in washington d c the second wtr was sourced from an aqua america drinking water treatment plant in philadelphia pa at a mc of 3 51 0 11 g wet g dry 71 1 the dalecarlia wtr d and aqua america wtr aa wtrs are aluminum based resulting from the coagulation flocculation and settling process using alum addition the aqua america treatment plant also adds activated carbon as a coagulant aid and an organic polymer as a flocculant aid which settle out in the wtr along with al haydite b size expanded shale digeronimo aggregates cleveland oh graded between 2 38 no 8 sieve and 9 5 mm 3 8 in was used in this application and stabilizer stabilizer solutions phoenix az was used as a psyllium containing binder the mix ratio used to prepare hpmm is such that each kg contains 905 g shale 85 g wtr and 10 g psyllium by oven dry mass this ratio was selected based on experimentation with different mix proportions more wtr could be used in the mix but there is a trade off between wtr content and hydraulic conductivity for example doubling the wtr decreased the hydraulic conductivity by 68 from 9 0 10 4 m s ostrom et al 2019 to 2 9 10 4 m s supplemental data hpmm used in this study was prepared with wtr sieved through a 2 00 mm sieve then air dried to mc 1 21 0 01 g wet g dry 17 1 and powdered by hand the wtr powder was then blended with shale and psyllium and moistened to stimulate binding different mix preparation methods were tried but not tested in rainfall simulations to improve wtr coating and binding to the shale surface more even coating and effective binding based on visual inspection was achieved by mixing components moist rather than first drying and powdering the wtr this preparation method requires weighing components at as received mc for mc 3 2 g wet g dry for wtr d each kg of hpmm requires 760 230 and 10 g of shale wtr and psyllium respectively amorphous al fe and p were extracted from hpmm and wtr using an oxalate extraction procedure from mckeague and day 1966 as described in ostrom et al 2019 extraction results were obtained for hpmm d hpmm prepared with wtr d wtr d and wtr aa no extraction was performed on hpmm aa hpmm prepared with wtr aa a second oxalate extraction procedure was performed on hpmm d and hpmm aa samples collected from mesocosm boxes following completion of rainfall simulation experiments described in section 2 2 media samples collected from three locations within each box were mixed together to produce a representative sample all extractions were performed in triplicate oxalate ratio or was calculated for each material as the ratio of oxalate extractable i e amorphous al fe to p in mmol kg 2 2 rainfall simulation mesocosm a mesocosm scale experiment was established to mimic storm events under representative local rainfall conditions for college park md two mesocosms were setup using 0 31 m2 water tight boxes 51 61 cm three parallel perforated pvc drainage pipes were placed at the bottom of each box for effluent sampling approximately 1 5 cm of water washed pea gravel filled the space around and to the top of the drainage pipes and a 5 cm layer of hpmm was placed on top of the pea gravel layer hpmm used in mesocosm testing was determined to have bulk density of 0 72 g cm3 each mesocosm therefore contained 0 015 m3 and 11 1 kg of hpmm hpmm d was placed in box 1 and hpmm aa was placed in box 2 a single paverguide grid was then placed over the hpmm layer paverguide is a proprietary geosynthetic product which can replace the typical stone base in permeable pavements rainfall was simulated using misting devices positioned at the top corners of each box and fed by individual flow lines using peristaltic pumps synthetic stormwater was prepared by adding representative urban runoff constituents to tap water table 1 no additional p was added as the tap water was found to contain levels approximately equal to those reported in stormwater runoff pitt and maestre 2005 only tp and tdp were analyzed in this study however work by mangum et al 2019 using the same tap water source and influent composition found tdp to be nearly 100 soluble reactive phosphorus srp considered as orthophosphate this experimental design simulates rainfall applied directly to a pavement surface i e no run on flow at different rainfall intensities water infiltrated into a permeable pavement from direct rainfall would contain only the pollutants washed from the pavement surface past studies have shown pollutant accumulation on pavements to be site specific and to vary with use gilbert and clausen 2006 dietz 2007 bean et al 2007 three sets of storm simulations were carried out the first set consisted of 12 simulations conducted on box 1 containing hpmm d configuration d the second set of 12 simulations was conducted on box 1 containing hpmm d configuration d iws and box 2 containing hpmm aa configuration aa simultaneously for the second set the outflow tube in box 1 was elevated to maintain the water level inside the mesocosm at the top of the hpmm layer thus creating a 5 cm iws zone in the third set an additional 5 storm simulations were carried out on box 1 and 2 simultaneously configurations d iws and aa respectively this set consisted of storm simulations conducted to test reproducibility of results and investigate effects of increased carbon concentration on n treatment each storm was conducted under a predetermined combination of rainfall intensity i 0 66 0 02 1 34 0 06 1 95 0 05 or 2 62 0 10 cm h and influent ph 5 97 0 12 6 96 0 08 or 8 03 0 07 both of which were held constant throughout each simulation for all simulations influent spray from misting devices was captured in a graduated cylinder to measure i twelve to 27 l 3 9 8 7 cm of influent was used in each simulation resulting in 6 4 and 3 hour storm durations a total depth of 78 cm was applied to configuration d and 113 cm of water was applied to each of configurations d iws and aa this represents 0 70 and 1 02 years of annual rainfall respectively using the long term average 111 cm yr for college park md usa arguez et al 2010 simulations were conducted regularly to maintain an average antecedent dry period adp of 11 8 days range 4 46 days for each simulation 4 12 effluent samples were collected at even intervals apart from sample 1 which was collected as outflow first occurred the delay between the start of influent and effluent flow indicates some amount of storage within the mesocosm setup likely in the bottom of the box and in moisture retained by the hpmm as noted by the as received moisture content wtr can retain significant water above a 3 1 wet to dry mass ratio samples were analyzed for ph tp total dp tdp total n tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and total al cu fe pb and zn as detailed in section 2 3 event mean concentration emc is defined as 1 e m c t i t f q t c t d t t i t f q t d t where c t concentration in sample collected at time t q t flow rate at time t and ti and tf represent time at the start and end of flow respectively the integral was approximated using the trapezoidal rule emc for ph was calculated by converting individual ph measurements to h ion concentration h inputting h into equation 1 and converting the emc back to ph units 2 3 analytical procedures sample ph was measured using a glass electrode probe with ag agcl reference to an accuracy of 0 01 units oxidation reduction potential orp was measured using an orp probe mettler toledo ma235 greifensee switzerland the orp probe was installed at the outlet of box 1 after an iws zone was created this allowed for the probe to be permanently submerged while taking readings of effluent from the mesocosm tp and tdp concentrations were determined to a detection limit of 0 01 mg l p as described in ostrom et al 2019 using standard method 4500 p apha et al 2012 and a method modified from wolf and baker 1990 tn was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer with a total nitrogen measuring unit toc analyzer shimazdu kyoto japan the detection limit was 0 05 mg l as n nh4 n concentrations were measured using the phenate method from standard method 4500 nh3 apha et al 2012 absorbance was measured with a 1 cm path length cuvette at 640 nm in a uv visible spectrophotometer to a detection limit of 0 05 mg l as n samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm ceramic filter prior to nitrate and nitrite analysis no3 n was measured using ion chromatography ics 1100 dionex sunnyvale ca following standard method 4110 a 4 5 mm na2co3 and 1 4 mm nahco3 eluent solution was run isocratically through an anion exchange column with 150 mm length 4 mm id and 6 5 μm polymer particle size ionpac as22 fast ic column dionex sunnyvale ca at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min the detection limit was 0 1 mg l as n no2 n was analyzed colorimetrically in a uv visible spectrophotometer at 543 nm following standard method 4500 no2 apha et al 2012 with a 1 cm path length cuvette to a detection limit of 0 01 mg l as n no2 n consistently accounted for less than 3 of tn and is therefore excluded from discussion total al cu fe pb and zn concentrations of samples acidified with trace metal grade nitric acid were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icpe 9000 plasma atomic emission spectrometer shimazdu kyoto japan at wavelengths of 394 403 324 754 259 940 220 353 and 213 856 nm respectively the detection limit for al fe and pb was 25 μg l and for cu and zn the limit was 10 μg l all pb samples were below the detection limit therefore pb results are not discussed here values below corresponding detection limits for all parameters have been assigned following the probability plot method from helsel and hirsch 2002 and helsel 2005 the two sided wilcoxon mann whitney rank sum test was employed to determine statistically significant difference at the 95 confidence level α 0 05 this non parametric test is appropriate for small sample sizes regardless of distribution helsel and hirsch 2002 kendall s tau τ was used to test for significance of correlations at the 95 confidence level α 0 05 with values of τ ranging from 1 to 1 indicating relatively stronger negative and positive correlations respectively helsel and hirsch 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus measured influent and effluent tdp concentrations for all storm simulations are presented in fig 1 effluent tdp concentration was lower than influent for all samples effluent concentrations of individual samples remained stable throughout most simulations with standard deviation sd less than 0 02 mg l p for 80 of the 36 storms the remaining 20 of storms exhibited greater variation however no consistent trend e g initial flush of higher concentrations is apparent across storms simulations to assess overall performance tdp emcs for each set of 12 storms were grouped by configuration and are presented in fig 2 effluent tdp emc was observed between 0 01 and 0 15 mg l p fig 2a while event removal efficiency ranged from 48 to 98 the median effluent tdp emcs were 0 05 0 045 and 0 045 mg l p for configurations d aa and d iws respectively these were significantly lower p 3 42 10 5 p 3 36 10 5 p 3 46 10 5 compared to influent while no significant difference p 0 502 for d and aa p 0 522 for d and d iws p 0 930 for aa and d iws was observed among configurations effluent tdp emc concentrations were below the epa recommended 0 03656 mg l tp for rivers and streams in ecoregion xiv usepa 2000 for all but one storm at rainfall intensity i 0 66 cm h this i is just lower than the 1 yr average return interval ari event averaged storm intensity for a 6 h storm for college park md 0 8 cm h bonnin et al 2006 it also exceeds the rainfall intensity of at least 61 of maryland storms analyzed by kreeb 2003 tp was measured in a subset of samples and was consistently 10 greater than tdp if tdp emc results were increased by 10 to approximate tp emc all but the same single storm event at i 0 66 cm h still fell below the epa recommended level for tp the data therefore support the hypothesis that hpmm can achieve effective p retention for storm intensities in this range a statistically significant positive trend toward higher effluent tdp emc at higher rainfall intensity is apparent for configurations d τ 0 769 p 0 006 and aa τ 0 467 p 0 047 fig 3 a a positive linear relationship between tdp emc and rainfall intensity is not statistically significant for d iws τ 0 244 p 0 293 this supports the hypothesis that dp retention will decrease as rainfall intensity increases weaker correlation between tdp emc and rainfall intensity for configuration d iws is likely due to differences in the flow regime of this configuration because the outlet is elevated water saturates the media layer following each storm and remains there until the start of the next storm as new influent is applied water retained from the previous storm is pushed out of the outlet contact time for this old water with the media is a function of the time between storms rather than the rainfall intensity of the current storm simulation additionally flow in the d iws configuration occurs under saturated conditions in contrast to the d and aa configurations for which flow is through unsaturated media these differences in flow regime appear to result in a damping of the effect of rainfall intensity on dp retention in the d iws configuration correlations between effluent tdp emc and effluent ph emc for configurations d τ 0 295 p 0 285 and aa τ 0 226 p 0 325 are not statistically significant the scatter and distribution indicate the relationship is influenced by extreme points in the data set or the relationship may not be linear a statistically significant positive correlation was found for configuration d iws τ 0 537 p 0 021 it was hypothesized that p retention would decrease with increased ph based on previous research demonstrating this ph effect on phosphate adsorption onto aluminum oxide materials goldberg and sposito 1984 tanada et al 2003 recall that tdp in this study was present as srp orthophosphate orthophosphate is a triprotic acid and its speciation is ph dependent with h2po4 and hpo4 2 being the predominant dissolved species at ph typical of urban runoff 7 50 0 75 stumm and morgan 1996 clary et al 2017 higher ph causes the alumina surface to be more negatively charged increasing the repulsive force acting on negatively charged h2po4 and hpo4 2 chen et al 1973b adsorption of anions is also a competitive process surface complexation i e adsorption of phosphate species onto metal hydroxides occurs primarily through ligand exchange where phosphate anions replace hydroxyl oh ions bound to the adsorptive surface this buffering by the media resulted in effluent ph values that did not vary as much as influent ph greater oh ion concentration at higher ph however can result in reduced adsorption of phosphate brattebø and ødegaard 1986 stumm and morgan 1996 some of the anticipated correlation between effluent tdp and effluent ph may have been masked by the relatively stronger effect of rainfall intensity on effluent tdp particularly for configurations d and aa for which tdp and i were significantly correlated fig 3a a model developed by ostrom et al 2019 to describe dp retention by hpmm was employed to describe the effect of rainfall intensity on effluent tdp in the mesocosms the model shown in equation 2 was developed based on known p adsorption mechanisms and assuming plug flow conditions for flow through the media 2 c o u t c i n 1 e β 0 m e β 0 m β 1 v m q cout and cin represent effluent and influent tdp concentrations respectively equation 2 was calibrated using data from long term p loading experiments to obtain values for the fitting parameter β0 related to long term adsorption capacity of the media cumulative dp loading in mg p kg media is represented by σm as adsorption sites on the media surface become occupied with increased dp loading the gradient between the dp concentration in equilibrium with the reactive surface and the dp concentration in the bulk fluid decreases resulting in lower dp removal this effect was verified through long term column testing in which a scaled down shale 2 mm version of the hpmm d used in the present study was subjected to continuous flow of synthetic stormwater ostrom et al 2019 that study showed dp retention to decay exponentially with increased cumulative dp loading β1 is a parameter used to describe rates of short term adsorption onto hpmm as a function of media specific adsorption kinetics and media reactive surface area vm is the bulk media volume and q is volumetric flowrate first order kinetics were assumed to describe the effect of contact time vm q on p adsorption equation 2 was used to calculate β1 for the specific cout cin and q of each of 12 storm simulations from the present study using tdp emcs cumulative p loading σm was set to zero because loading from 12 storm simulations represents less than 1 m of rainfall loading which is insignificant compared to the projected loading capacity of over 600 m before reaching p saturation of the media found by ostrom et al 2019 in long term column studies calculated β1 values were plotted against effluent ph emc fig 4 β1 relates to adsorption rates with higher values corresponding to faster adsorption a negative correlation between β1 and ph is observed for all configurations with the relationship statistically significant for d τ 0 611 p 0 025 and d iws τ 0 457 p 0 044 but not aa τ 0 242 p 0 311 β1 increases as ph decreases indicating faster adsorption at lower ph this result is consistent with previous studies with aluminum oxide materials showing an increase in phosphate removal rate as ph decreased chen et al 1973a and supports the hypothesis that dp retention by hpmm as used in a permeable pavement base layer is negatively correlated with ph equation 2 can be modified to include the ph dependence of β 1 a linear model is assumed for simplicity where β 1 a 0 a 1 p h 3 c o u t c i n 1 e β 0 m e β 0 m a 0 a 1 p h d v equation 3 also expresses v m q in terms of media depth d and actual fluid velocity through the media v this representation is used because flow velocity controls advective transport through the media and is expected to influence p retention rate actual velocity was not directly measured in these experiments and may be influenced by several factors as described by the horton and green ampt models for soil infiltration horton 1941 discussed a variety of factors which may influence the rate of rain infiltration into a soil these factors include temperature rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture or rainfall horton 1941 also described the exponential decrease in infiltration rate with rain duration the infiltration rate approaches a constant value as unsaturated conditions such as those encountered under configurations d and aa in the present mesocosm experiments become saturated under saturated flow conditions velocity is related to saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat as described by darcy s law mccuen 2005 to account for these factors velocity v is expressed in equation 4 as a simple linear function of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and rainfall intensity i where v b 0 k s a t b 1 i the resulting model is an improvement over equation 2 by integrating additional mechanistic considerations related to ph and rainfall intensity 4 c o u t c i n 1 e β 0 m e β 0 m a 0 a 1 p h d b 0 k s a t b 1 i it should be noted that the flow regime in configuration d iws is not well represented by equation 4 because the contact time between storm events is not considered equation 4 improves on the description of adsorption developed in ostrom et al 2019 i e equation 2 by better describing the effect of short term kinetic rates and considering the effect of ph and rainfall intensity on dp retention experimental data from the present mesocosm study can be used to parameterize the short term kinetic components through the fitting parameters a0 a1 b0 and b1 operational conditions and measured parameters i e d ksat i influent tdp emc effluent ph emc for all 12 storm simulations were input into equation 4 to predict effluent tdp emc the ksat value reported in ostrom et al 2019 for hpmm d 324 cm h 9 0 10 4 m s was used for all configurations because hydraulic conductivity was not assessed for hpmm aa because σm was set to zero for the mesocosm study the value of β0 is inconsequential to this calibration step fitting parameters a0 a1 b0 and b1 were varied using excel s solver function with the grg nonlinear method to find the best fit by maximizing the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse resulting fitting parameter and nse values are summarized in table 2 as expected a0 values were positive and a1 negative resulting in a model indicating decreasing adsorption as ph increases which was the trend observed in measured data shown in fig 4 the velocity related parameters b0 and b1 were both positive which affirms the expectation that increased hydraulic conductivity and rainfall intensity should result in higher velocity of flow through the media the b1 value for configuration d is also two orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding values for d iws and aa which reflects the relatively stronger influence of rainfall intensity on tdp removal for configuration d as shown in fig 3a and helps explain the better model fit for configuration d because of the limited data available equation 4 was calibrated using data from all 12 storm simulations in each configuration to generate values for the fitting parameters a0 a1 b0 and b1 related to ph hydraulic conductivity and rainfall intensity despite this limitation the nse can be used to assess the goodness of fit of equation 4 to calibration data good model fit and agreement was found between modeled and measured values for configuration d fig 5 the relationship was found to be 1 03 to 1 with an nse value of 0 91 equation 4 slightly underestimates effluent tdp for configurations aa and d iws with a 0 92 1 ratio of modeled to measured concentrations for the former and a 0 89 1 ratio for the latter nse values of 0 48 and 0 59 for configurations aa and d iws respectively also indicate good model fit though not as good as for configuration d the better model fit for configuration d was driven by greater sensitivity to rainfall intensity under this configuration a flatter tdp distribution with respect to rainfall intensity was found for configurations aa and d iws this can be explained for configuration d iws by the damping effect on rainfall intensity as described above from the different flow regime created by the iws zone differences in treatment effectiveness for configuration aa may have been due to differences in the wtr source and composition results from oxalate extractions table 3 demonstrated wtr d and wtr aa to have similar oxalate ratios which has been shown to correspond to p treatment capacity yan et al 2018 therefore or is unlikely to explain the difference in treatment performance between these wtrs wtr aa contains an activated carbon coagulant aid and organic polymer flocculant aid which wtr d does not coagulant and flocculant aids generally result in stickier and larger flocs being formed crittenden et al 2012 the presence of these components may have resulted in wtr aggregation causing narrowing of flow paths through the hpmm which could weaken the influence of rainfall intensity on flow velocity this appeared to be the case based on visual inspection of hpmm aa and hpmm d hpmm d contains higher amorphous al and fe than expected based on oxalate extractions of wtr d table 3 this may be due to al and fe contained in the expanded shale chemical analysis provided by the supplier shows a typical shale composition to include 19 alumina and 4 ferric oxide p content was also lower than projected expanded shale creates a dilution effect in which the shale contributes total mass but not p oxalate extraction results also showed increased p content in media after rainfall simulations compared to freshly mixed hpmm table 3 the p content of hpmm d increased from 1 53 to 6 76 mmol kg hpmm this increase supports the hypothesis that hpmm will retain p 3 1 1 design tool model application the model given by equation 4 can inform design decisions for permeable paving installations using hpmm as a base material equation 4 combines understanding of the importance of long term p adsorption capacity and short term adsorption kinetic rates for p removal long term p adsorption capacity controls the volume of stormwater that can be treated before reaching p saturation and therefore the length of service this was explored by ostrom et al 2019 through long term column adsorption studies with hpmm subjected to over 600 m of synthetic stormwater the model utility is broadened and evaluated under more realistic simulations in the present study resulting in a model representative of hpmm treatment effectiveness fig 6 shows predicted tdp removal using equation 4 for a 5 cm base layer of hpmm d at different loading ratios using assumptions representative of conditions in college park maryland assumptions include c0 0 20 mg l tdp rainfall intensity 1 27 cm h ph 7 0 annual precipitation 1 11 m arguez et al 2010 k 324 cm h and hpmm density 719 kg m3 under these assumptions an initial tdp removal efficiency of 80 90 is expected diminishing after 80 years to 60 70 for a 1 1 loading ratio loading ratio is defined as the ratio of contributing area to treatment surface area with 1 1 representing a pavement treating only rainfall falling directly onto the pavement and higher ratios including adjacent areas contributing runoff to permeable pavement removal efficiency drops more sharply under higher loading ratios with a 20 1 loading ratio predicted to result in p saturation of the media and removal efficiency near zero after 50 years a designer may use the tool to strike the desired balance between loading ratio removal efficiency and pavement lifetime the uniform rainfall intensity of 1 27 cm h 0 5 in h used for the design tool is representative of a 5 yr ari 6 h duration precipitation event in college park md and is near the range of most frequently observed storm sizes and durations in maryland based on analysis by kreeb 2003 it is also representative of a storm intensity likely to generate substantial throughflow because homogenous conditions are modeled over a long time a range 10 is given around the predicted removal efficiency to account for fluctuations in removal resulting from variations in influent dp concentration ph rainfall intensity and other parameters that will vary from storm to storm this uncertainty also reflects expected variation under field conditions which may result from differences in parameters controlled under lab conditions e g temperature adp scm design lab performance and models describing treatment have differed from field performance in past studies of scms erickson et al 2012 huang et al 2016 the model developed here could potentially be expanded with further data to include other treatment media this could enable better informed decisions and improve estimates from watershed scale models incorporating scms 3 2 nitrogen effluent n emcs were higher than influent for configurations d and aa across all storm events simulated this was true for tn nh4 n and no3 n n data are only available across all three configurations for a subset of 6 storm events consisting of the 3rd through 9th storms for each configuration examining this subset the median of emcs for tn increased from 3 95 to 4 61 mg l for d and 3 99 5 07 mg l for aa and decreased from 3 99 to 3 88 mg l for d iws fig 2 the increase in tn emcs was statistically significant for configurations d p 0 045 and aa p 0 037 but the decrease for d iws p 0 897 was not as hypothesized inclusion of an iws in configuration d iws did improve n treatment but this effect was not consistent across all storm simulations the data do not support the hypothesis that configuration aa will improve n retention compared to configuration d in fact the median effluent emc was higher in configuration aa than in d for both tn p 0 630 and no3 n p 0 230 though the increase in emcs was not significant median effluent nh4 n emc was lower in aa than in d but the decrease was also not significant p 0 784 influent n was added as nitrate nano3 and organic n glycine in a 1 2 n ratio effluent n was dominated by nitrate under configurations d and aa fig 7 effluent ammonium concentrations also increased slightly from influent this indicates mineralization and nitrification likely occurred in these mesocosms transforming organic n to nh4 n and ultimately to no3 n higher effluent tn concentrations are indicative of n leaching from scm media and has been observed in past studies li and davis 2014 leached n also appears to have been flushed from the media at the start of each storm with effluent tn and no3 n concentrations initially higher than influent these initially elevated concentrations approached influent levels toward the end of each storm event this is further evidence of mineralization and nitrification occurring between storm events enabling flushing of soluble no3 n in subsequent storm simulations stabilizer was evaluated as a source of this leached n stabilizer dissolved in a 5 acetone solution was analyzed for tn and found to contain 61 4 mg n per kg wtr however is more likely the significant n source studies by others have found wtr to contain up to 500 mg n kg wtr dayton and basta 2001 lei and davis 2019 at this concentration hpmm is estimated to contain 42 5 mg n from wtr and only 0 6 mg n from stabilizer per kg of hpmm each mesocosm box contains an estimated 472 mg n this mass of n equates to approximately one third of the influent tn load under conditions simulated in the present study i e 100 cm of synthetic stormwater applied at 4 mg l tn previous studies have been undertaken using wtr as an scm media amendment but typically these have been in contexts with n export from other sources masking n export from wtr specifically or n has not been a focus of the study lucas and greenway 2011 liu et al 2014 treatment performance in configuration d iws can be divided into three subsets based on effluent tn concentrations the first includes 4 of 17 total storm simulations shaded in fig 7b in which tn was lower in all effluent samples than in influent this subset consisting of two separate periods is defined by n removal occurring throughout each storm simulation a second subset includes 10 of 17 storms in which tn was higher in effluent than in influent for all samples this subset is characterized by n export the third subset includes each storm immediately before and after a n removal period a total of 3 storms this subset is designated to clearly differentiate between the other two subsets fig 8 provides a comparative illustration of n transformations during periods with n export fig 8a and periods with n removal fig 8b in the former tn total mass load increased by 12 from influent to effluent with no3 n constituting over 90 of effluent n load as discussed previously for configurations d and aa mineralization of organic n to nh4 n and nitrification of nh4 n to no3 n are thought to have been the dominant n transformation process for this subset of d iws simulations this is supported by an 82 decrease in organic n load from influent to effluent accompanied by a 72 increase in discharge no3 n load over these 10 storms these storms also exhibited the same flushing trend found in configurations d and aa with elevated effluent tn and no3 n at the start of each simulation decreasing to approach influent concentrations by the end fig 7b in the subset exhibiting n removal tn load decreased by 33 from influent to effluent fig 8b the median of effluent tn emcs for these 4 storms was 3 39 mg l which still exceeds the epa water quality criterion of 0 69 mg l usepa 2000 but represents a significant reduction p 0 030 from influent tn emcs with a median value of 4 00 mg l mineralization of organic n to nh4 n likely occurred during this subset of storms as evidenced by a 37 decrease in organic n and 16 increase in nh4 n load no3 n load decreased by 34 likely due to denitrification occurring in the mesocosm to advance denitrification reducing conditions and an electron donor such as an appropriate carbon source are required orp can be used as a gauge for the presence of reducing conditions peterson et al 2015 drift was observed in the orp probe fig 7d making it difficult to conclude whether reducing conditions were present or not in the d iws mesocosm there is however a consistent trend on a storm by storm basis of orp dropping between storm events and increasing rapidly at the start of each storm as oxygenated influent water flushed the old water from the iws zone effluent tn and no3 n concentrations also followed this flushing trend in the n removal subset of simulations the lowest concentrations were observed at the start and approached influent levels near the end of each simulation this suggests conditions were conducive to denitrification during the inter storm periods when retention time was much longer than during storm simulations lopez ponnada et al 2017 additional evidence of the presence of reducing conditions comes from metals data total fe concentrations were below the 25 μg l detection limit for all samples except those from the second storm simulation in configuration d iws when the mesocosm is thought to have been transitioning from oxidizing to reducing conditions and the initial n removal period began elevated effluent fe concentrations may indicate reducing conditions in which insoluble fe iii was converted to soluble fe ii and flushed out of the system denitrification is thought to have been limited by carbon availability which has been shown to be a controlling factor in denitrification in scm studies peterson et al 2015 waller et al 2018 wtr is presumed to be the c source in this system an initial period of putative denitrification occurred between the third and fifth storm events it is hypothesized that this initial n removal period ceased as the om in the wtr was exhausted as a c source and the system became c limited analysis by dayton et al 2003 found a low median organic c content of 63 0 g kg 6 3 in a study of wtrs from 21 different sources despite the presence of reducing conditions following the fifth storm event denitrification was not apparent because of this c limitation and n removal was not observed in the final two storm simulations influent c was increased by a factor of 10 to 13 mg l as c by adding sodium acetate this stimulated a second n removal period for the final storm in which tn and no3 n concentrations were again lower for effluent samples compared to influent for long term n removal to be viable in this system a more significant c source than the om present in wtr is required for example peterson et al 2015 used woodchips with c content on the order of 50 and ashoori et al 2019 further amended a woodchip reactor with biochar at 78 c it may be possible to integrate these or other low cost materials into hpmm as long term c sources to improve n removal 3 3 metals the primary metal of concern for leaching from the test media is al because hpmm uses al based wtr table 3 mesocosm results indicate low al leaching under conditions representative of stormwater runoff effluent al emcs were below the 25 μg l detection limit for all storms simulated across all configurations these concentrations are well below the epa ambient water quality criterion for al 87 μg l for freshwater at ph between 6 5 and 9 0 usepa 1988 all effluent samples from configurations aa and d iws had total al concentrations below 25 μg l while a few individual effluent samples were found above 25 μg l in earlier storm events simulated in configuration d the highest concentration 123 μg l occurred in the first sample collected and was the only sample to exceed the epa limit it is likely the few elevated al concentrations were due to initial wash out of fines containing powdered wtr or shale from the newly established media rather than from al being solubilized because ph remained between 6 and 8 for all effluent samples al solubility is minimal approximately 9 μg l 10 6 5 m total al at ph in this range stumm and morgan 1996 ippolito et al 2011 the observed wash out indicates the importance of mix preparation in binding fines into the media total fe emcs decreased from influent to effluent for all configurations the decrease from median values of 28 to 16 μg l was not statistically significant for configuration d p 0 054 while both influent and effluent median emc were below the 25 μg l detection limit for configurations aa and d iws the epa sets ambient water quality criteria for fe at 1000 μg l usepa 1986 effluent total fe was far below this level for all samples across all storm simulations and under all configurations influent was spiked with cu and zn to determine if hpmm can remove these potentially toxic water pollutants from stormwater results indicate effective and consistent cu and zn removal this removal is likely due to a combination of sorption to om and complexation with al oxides in the wtr castaldi et al 2015 emcs were significantly lower for effluent compared to influent across configurations d aa and d iws for both metals fig 2e and f cu p 0 001 p 0 001 p 0 001 zn p 1 82 10 4 p 3 66 10 5 p 8 06 10 5 effluent total cu emc averaged 30 24 and 18 μg l for configurations d aa and d iws respectively the mean of effluent total zn emcs was 67 92 and 47 μg l for the same configurations the concentrations are relative to overall mean influent concentrations of 61 81 and 73 μg l cu and 255 499 and 458 μg l zn for d aa and d iws respectively water quality criteria for cu are highly site and species specific but typically are on the order of a few μg l usepa 2016 zn levels in all three configurations were below the epa criterion for acute toxicity to freshwater aquatic life of 133 μg l usepa 1996 metals toxicity can depend on water chemistry of the receiving water including factors such as ph hardness alkalinity and om concentrations the fraction of the metal in dissolved form can also be important as can specific aquatic life of concern in the local area usepa 2016 with these complications in mind it can be concluded that hpmm does not present a concern for al or fe leaching under conditions typical of stormwater runoff hpmm can effectively and consistently reduce cu and zn concentrations this reduction is sufficient to attain water quality standards for zn but is likely insufficient to meet very stringent cu standards 4 conclusions a novel stormwater treatment media hpmm was shown effective at reducing dp and total metals concentrations in stormwater under simulated rainfall events dp retention increased at lower rainfall intensity and lower ph al leaching from the wtr containing media was not found to be an issue the media is a potential source of n export but demonstrated capacity to reduce n concentrations by including an iws zone if adequate c is available differences in wtr source did not significantly influence n retention a 5 cm layer of hpmm reduced influent tdp emcs from an average of 0 22 mg l to a maximum of 0 05 mg l p for storm simulations with 0 66 cm h rainfall intensity at ph between 5 86 and 8 23 typical of stormwater ph for 9 simulations at this rainfall intensity 8 fell below the epa water quality criteria of 0 03656 mg l for tp this intensity is slightly lower than the 1 yr ari for college park md and likely exceeds the intensity of at least 2 3 of maryland storms hpmm did not remove n under aerobic conditions and the wtr contained in it may be a source of n export an iws zone however was successful in decreasing effluent n when adequate c was present to advance denitrification a 33 decrease in tn load and 34 decrease in no3 n load was achieved in this case wtr was shown to be a limited c source for denitrification and wtr source had no significant impact on n retention no leaching of cu fe or zn from hpmm was found under the conditions tested in this study e g ph between 6 and 9 influent cu and zn concentrations were lowered significantly using hpmm additional treatment may be necessary to further lower cu concentrations to avoid toxic effects if that is a target metal effluent total al emcs were found to be below the 25 μg l detection limit for all storm simulations initial export of al was observed in a few samples however but rapidly ceased this can likely be mitigated through careful mix preparation ensuring complete binding of fines to the media a model developed in previous work with long term column studies equation 4 was refined with further mechanistic understanding of the effect of rainfall intensity and ph on short term p adsorption kinetics it was fit to mesocosm experimental data to predict effluent tdp concentration from hpmm as a function of ph hydraulic conductivity rainfall intensity cumulative p loading and media depth excellent model fit was found for configuration d with an nse value of 0 91 configurations aa and d iws had good but poorer model fit with nse values of 0 48 and 0 59 respectively equation 4 can be used to inform permeable pavement base design decisions including balancing desired removal efficiency with loading ratio and design

18473,trade in commodities implies trade in virtual water vw which refers to the water that was used to produce the traded goods various studies have quantified international or inter provincial virtual water vw flows related to the trade in crops and animal products until date however no effort has been undertaken to understand how the water embodied in traded feed crops trade stage ts1 will be transferred further because of trade in animal products trade stage ts2 this is the first study showing this mechanism in a case study in china for maize the major pig feed and pork the dominant meat considering the period 2000 2013 we estimate the annual green and blue water footprints in maize production and then quantify the inter provincial vw flows related to trade in maize ts1 and trade in maize embodied in pork ts2 results show that in ts1 maize related vw flowed from the water scarce north to the water rich south with an increase of 40 over the study period from 43 to 61 billion m3 y 1 in ts2 about 10 of the water embodied in maize exports from north to south china returns in the form of pork with an increase in the absolute amount of 25 from 4 8 to 6 1 billion m3 y 1 considering blue vw flows specifically we find that north to south blue vw flows decreased by 5 in ts1 while south to north blue vw flows increased by 23 in ts2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords pork maize supply chain water footprint virtual water trade 1 introduction trade in goods and services among nations and within a nation implies long distance socioeconomic and environmental interactions introducing a global dimension to the challenge of sustainable use of natural resources liu et al 2013 trade can compensate for natural resource deficits in importing regions and create labour opportunities and economic outputs in the exporting regions but trade may also shift the burden of resource use and environmental impacts from the importing region where the consumption takes place to the exporting region where the production is located wiedmann and lenzen 2018 sun et al 2018 pace and gephart 2017 zhao et al 2016 dalin and rodríguez iturbe 2016 yang et al 2006 globally around 10 70 of environmental influences e g co2 emissions particulate matter emissions land use coal exploitation and water consumption are embodied in the international trade in which food trade has been the dominant driver wiedmann and lenzen 2018 here we are interested in the consumption of water for producing food whereby we will focus on the case of water for maize for pigs for pork this includes two stages of trade trade in maize and trade in pork we will trace how the water embodied in traded maize will be transferred further because of trade in pork as a metric for water use we will employ the consumptive water footprint wf which measures both consumption of green water rainwater and blue water groundwater and surface water hoekstra 2017 the external wf of a community within a geographic region refers to the water embodied in its consumption from imports the water virtually embedded in traded commodities is known as virtual water vw allan 2003 agricultural products together account for 92 of the wf of humanity and more specifically animal products together contribute about 30 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the major share 98 of the wf of animal products comes from the water consumed to produce the feed mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 growing food demand and intensified food trade are increasing the water scarcity in the exporting production regions globally the water depletion in countries scarce in blue water contributed to 35 of global vw flows lenzen et al 2013 and 11 of non renewable groundwater consumption was embodied in the food trade dalin et al 2017 in this study we distinguish two trade stages of maize fig 1 in the first trade stage ts1 maize is traded from the place of cultivation to the place of consumption in the form of food by humans or feed by animals in the second trade stage ts2 pork is traded from the place of pig farming to the place of pork consumption we quantify vw flows related to maize trade ts1 as well as vw flows related to pork trade ts2 in the latter case we merely focus on the water consumed to produce the maize eaten by the pig to produce one kg of pork the new element of the current study is that it maps and links vw flows related to both ts1 and ts2 inter regional vw flows redistribute water through trade of water intensive products and reshaping the patterns of water reliance through teleconnections between the consumers and producers zhao et al 2015 d odorico et al 2019 severe water scarcity in a certain place can be driven remotely by its trade partner who imports products that consume considerable volume of water in the exporting place therefore it is of importance to clearly and correctly identify the directions and magnitudes of the burden shifting along the vw flows and associated water scarcities there are numerous studies that map vw flows associated with crop trade ts1 at global level e g hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 dalin et al 2012 konar et al 2011 as well as the national level e g liu et al 2008 novo et al 2009 and sub national level e g guan and hubacek 2007 ma et al 2006 verma et al 2009 dalin et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016a zhao et al 2017 there are also several studies that analyse vw flows associated with trade in animal products ts2 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 ma et al 2006 dalin et al 2014 hanasaki et al 2010 but the vw flows related to ts1 and ts2 are never connected the previous studies on crop related or food related vw flow assessments ignore the effects of st2 as well as of the other big crop consumer livestock than humanity on such burden shifting among trade partners here we choose maize and pork trade among provinces in china in the period 2000 2013 as a study case the pork consumer indirectly consumes the maize for feeding the pigs whereas previous studies that quantify vw flows related to trade in pork consider the full amount of embodied water in traded pork we are interested here only in the maize related embodied water in traded pork we first estimate the green and blue wfs of maize production in china per year over the period 2000 2013 at a 5 5 arc minute grid level with consideration of the effects of different irrigation techniques second we quantify the inter provincial vw flows within china related to trade in maize third we quantify the inter provincial vw flows related to the pork trade considering specifically the water for maize for pig for pork maize is one of the major feed crops in the world and contributes 17 to the wf of the global livestock sector mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 china is currently the second biggest producer of maize in the world responsible for 22 of global maize production 2016 about 70 of maize utilization in china is for feed fao 2018 over the period 2000 2013 maize demand for feed in china increased by 69 the harvested area of maize by 57 and total maize production by 106 nbsc 2018 china is the world s largest pork producer accounting for 48 of the global total fao 2018 we choose inter provincial trade of maize and pork in china as a representative target with three main reasons firstly china has intensive inter provincial transfers of maize which resulted in visible maize related water scarce north to water rich south vw flows inter regional maize related vw flows contributed to 39 of the crop related north to south vw flows i e the biggest contributor among considered crops and 38 of crop related gross vw flows within china by 2008 zhuo et al 2016a secondly in china s maize related inter provincial vw flows 72 was driven by feed consumption 2013 fao 2018 given china is the world biggest pork producer with much higher stock than other types of livestock majority of maize feed consumption is for pigs thirdly there is significant spatial mismatch between feed and pork production fig 2 as well as between the consumption and production of pork in 2013 north china produced 84 of the national maize production while south china accounted for 60 of the country s pork production nbsc 2018 given the high water scarcity in north china there is much interest in understanding the reasons and dynamics underlying the widely reported north to south vw flows related to agricultural products mainly crops based on either the bottom up approach i e food balance methods ma et al 2006 dalin et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016a wu et al 2010 cao et al 2011 dong et al 2014 sun et al 2019 or top down approach i e input output models guan and hubacek 2007 feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 2019 2018 zhang and anadon 2014 the vw export from north china is increasingly recognized as one of the key contributions to local water scarcity feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 hoekstra and mekonnen 2016 chukalla et al 2015 compared to the studies based on bottom up approaches the common conclusion is the main direction of the north to south vw flows within china with a full picture covering all the water using sectors the top down method based studies were able to map the patterns and construction of the vw flows zhang and anadon 2014 guan and hubacek 2007 zhao et al 2015 scarce unsustainable virtual flows feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 and the driving factors zhao et al 2019 however none has solved the current research question on distinction and links between vw flows in st1 and st2 currently china has the world largest amount of non renewable groundwater depletion related to maize production 4 7 million m3 y 1 most of which is in the north dalin et al 2017 2 methods and data 2 1 estimating green and blue wfs of maize we distinguish between the water footprint of production of maize in a province and the average water footprint of maize as available on the market in a province the latter is used for estimating the wf of the maize fed to pigs and finally the wf of pork assuming that pigs consume a mix of domestically produced maize and maize imported from other provinces according to the relative proportions available in a province the average green and blue wfs of rainfed and irrigated maize production per province over the study period 2000 2013 were based on estimation at 5 5 arc minute grid level following the accounting framework of hoekstra et al 2011 the green and blue wfs of maize production m3 t 1 within a grid cell were calculated as the actual green and blue evapotranspiration et m3 t 1 over the growing period divided by the crop yield y t ha 1 fao s crop water productivity model aquacrop version 6 0 steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 was used to simulate et and y per grid cell per year the simulated maize yields in all grid cells in a province were scaled to fit to the statistics on maize production at province level zhuo et al 2016b the separation of green and blue et was carried out by tracking the daily green and blue soil water balances based on the contribution of rainfall and irrigation respectively following chukalla et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016b and karandish and hoekstra 2017 regarding irrigated maize production we simulated the wfs under three different irrigation methods furrow sprinkler and micro irrigation in aquacrop the effects of varied irrigation are reflected by the different levels of soil evaporation e which partially depends on the fraction of soil surface wetted fw during irrigation which different by irrigation method allen et al 1998 soil evaporation e is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration with the soil evaporation coefficient ke which considers the characteristics of soil surface and the fraction of the soil surface not covered by the canopy when considering the effects of different irrigation methods that the soil surface is partially wetted the ke is adjusted by the fraction of the surface wetted fw allen et al 1998 1 k e f w 1 c c k e x where c c refers to the canopy cover fraction kex maximum soil evaporation coefficient for fully wet and not shaded soil surface we set values of fw as 80 100 and 40 for furrow sprinkler and micro irrigation respectively for each grid the overall green and blue wf wf g and wf b m3 t 1 of irrigated maize then can be calculated as 2 w f g i 1 3 10 t 1 g p e t g t i w i i 1 3 y i w i 3 w f b i 1 3 10 t 1 g p e t b t i w i i 1 3 y i w i where i refers to the irrigation method and w i to the percentage of irrigation method i in the total irrigated area of maize in the grid cell since percentages w i are available only by province we assume w i per grid cell equal to the value at province level evapotranspiration et is summed over the days of the growing period gp 2 2 estimating green and blue wfs of maize in pork for estimating the volume of water for maize for pig for pork we first estimate the amount of maize embodied in 1 kg of pork the amount of maize is then multiplied with the green and blue wfs of maize to obtain the green and blue wfs per kg of pork related to the maize eaten by the pig the maize embodied in pork which we will call here the virtual maize content of pork vmc kg kg 1 equals the maize fed to pig over its lifetime maize consumption mc kg head 1 divided by the pork production rate per pig ppr kg head 1 here we assume that china s national total maize feed goes to swine farms with two reasons firstly pigs are the only livestock with maize dominated feeding maize is responsible for over 63 in pig feeding hansen 2007 secondly pigs dominate china s livestock industry fed by maize in 2013 the number of pigs in china was four times higher than the number of goats the second largest livestock category nbsc 2018 the wf of per kg of the vmc per province refers to the average wf of maize as on the market in the province i e the wf cons shown in equation 3 the wf of maize on the market in a province depends on the ratio of provincially produced maize to imported maize and the wfs in the respective locations of production the average wf of the maize consumed in a province i wf cons i m3 t 1 and is calculated as follows 4 w f c o n s i p i w f p r o d i e i e w f p r o d e p i e i e in which p i t y 1 refers to the maize production quantity in province i i e t y 1 to the imported quantity of maize from exporting place e other regions in china or other countries outside china wf prod i m3 t 1 the wf per unit of maize in province i and wf prod e m3 t 1 the wf per unit of maize as produced in exporting place e 2 3 estimating inter provincial vw networks related to trade in maize and pork the vw flow in ts1 was calculated by multiplying the related maize trade flow t y 1 with the wf of maize production m3 t 1 in the exporting region the vw flow in ts2 was computed as the product of the pork trade flow t y 1 the amount of maize consumed per unit of pork kg kg 1 and the wf per tonne of maize m3 t 1 on the market in the pork export region we estimate provincial trade balances i e net imports for maize and pork as the consumption in a province minus the production in a province ma et al 1998 zhuo et al 2016a with consideration of international trade production consumption of maize for food feed and manufactured products as well as waste and seed based on the national food balance sheets in faostat fao 2018 combined with population and livestock units per province for each year the national consumption of maize for direct human consumption and manufactured products and the national consumption of pork as given by fao 2018 were distributed over the provinces based on provincial populations the national use of maize for feed was distributed over provinces proportional to the amount of pigs per province provincial statistics on yearly maize and pork production per province were taken from nbsc 2018 inter provincial trade matrices for maize and pork per year were determined by using a linear programming optimization procedure assuming that inter provincial trade flows are such that the overall transport cost of trade is minimized following dalin et al 2014 the net import of product p in a province is defined as the total provincial utilization of the product minus the local production we considered four harbour provinces tianjin liaoning shandong and guangdong for distributing foreign imports of maize and pork to provinces and for shipping exports we assume that the intra national and

2000 2013 were obtained from fao 2018 data on monthly precipitation reference evapotranspiration and temperature at a resolution of 30 30 arc minute were taken from harris et al 2014 data on irrigated and rain fed areas for each crop at a 5 5 arc minute resolution were obtained from portmann et al 2010 annual agriculture statistics on harvested areas and yields of maize statistics for fed and slaughtered livestock and the associated livestock production as well as total irrigated area with different irrigation methods per province were obtained from nbsc 2018 soil texture data were obtained from the isric soil and terrain database for china at a scale of 1 1 million dijkshoorn et al 2008 for hydraulic characteristics for each type of soil the indicative values provided by aquacrop were used data on total soil water capacity in vol at a spatial resolution of 5 5 arc minute were obtained from the isric wise version1 2 dataset batjes 2012 3 results 3 1 wf of maize production in china over the study period 2000 2013 china s national average wf per tonne of maize decreased by 23 from 955 m3 t 1 of which 18 blue wf in 2000 to 692 m3 t 1 13 blue wf in 2013 fig 3 this was mainly related to the increased national average maize yield which grew by 31 from 4 6 t ha 1 in 2000 to 6 0 t ha 1 in 2013 with the doubled total maize production from 106 to 218 million t y 1 the national total wf of maize production increased by 49 from 101 billion m3 y 1 in 2000 to 151 billion m3 y 1 in 2013 whereby the green wf increased by 58 from 83 billion m3 y 1 to 132 billion m3 y 1 north china had a larger wf per tonne of maize than south china fig 4 the provincial average wf of maize production ranged between 348 m3 t 1 qinghai province and 1032 m3 t 1 guizhou province in 2013 over the study period most of the provinces experienced a decrease in the wf per tonne of maize with an exception for five provinces in the south shanghai jiangsu zhejiang hubei and guizhou these five provinces also had decreased maize yields for instance the maize yield in guizhou province decreased by 19 over the study period while the wf per tonne of maize increased by 31 for guizhou province the reduction started since the year 2011 with yield level was 42 less than in 2010 mainly due to the extreme drought happened in august and successive drought problems in the following two years wang et al 2014 in addition reductions in irrigated maize area by 30 in shanghai and by 3 in jiangsu as well as the less fertilization by 65 in shanghai and by 12 in jiangsu could be other reasons for maize yield decreases nbsc 2018 among all provinces inner mongolia had the highest decrease 59 in wf per tonne of maize irrigated maize contributed 48 to the national total wf of maize production by 2013 with irrigation over 41 of the total harvested maize land furrow irrigation is still the main irrigation method in china and accounted 86 of total wf of irrigated maize production in 2013 the study period witnessed an increasing wf of micro irrigated maize production from zero to 7 of total wf related to irrigated maize production with the expansion in the micro irrigation across the country in most provinces the wf per tonne of maize under micro irrigation was the smallest followed by furrow irrigation and finally sprinkler irrigation the wf per tonne of rain fed maize was always larger than the wf of irrigated maize due to a relatively lower yield level micro irrigation had the highest blue water fraction in the total wf 3 2 maize related wf of pork in china the fraction of maize in pig feed increased considerably over the period 2000 2013 cfia 2013 with the number of pigs increasing by 14 but total maize consumption by pigs increasing by 68 the pork production rate meat per animal was stable over the period considered the average virtual maize content of pork in china increased by 46 from 2 8 in 2000 to 4 1 kg kg 1 in 2013 table 1 the increasing trend reflects the effects of the expansion in scale breeding of pigs that the occupation of which in the national swine cultivation increased from 9 to 50 over 2000 2013 and rising demand of concentrated feed tian et al 2016 translating the maize content of pork to the underlying water consumption we find that the average maize related wf of pork increased by 7 this rate of increase was less than 46 because of the reduction in the wf per tonne maize in the country fig 3 at provincial level the maize related wf of pork ranged between 1580 m3 t 1 ningxia and 3680 m3 t 1 hebei as shown in fig 5 the maize related wf of pork was relatively high in eastern provinces where most of the swine farms are located fig 2 twenty one provinces had an increased maize related wf per tonne of pork over the study period with shandong province having the sharpest increase from 2230 to 3110 m3 t 1 mainly due to the increased maize feed per pig fig 6 shows per province for 2013 the blue water percentage in the maize related wf of pork versus the blue water percentage in the wf of maize most exporting provinces of pork most depending on imported maize had a higher blue water fraction in the maize related wf of pork than in the wf of locally produced maize the main reason is that they imported maize from more water scarce northern provinces where there are higher blue wf ratios in maize production for example anhui hubei hunan and chongqing province imported maize for their pigs from north eastern china heilongjiang liaoning and jilin while sichuan guizhou and yunnan imported maize from northern and north western provinces 3 3 virtual water flows related to maize in the two trade stages over the period 2000 2013 maize trade from north to south china increased by a factor 2 2 from 45 to 99 million t y 1 in 2013 north to south maize trade was equivalent to 45 of china s total maize production in that year north china accounted for 86 of national maize production whereas the south accounted for 59 of national maize consumption the net vw flow related to trade in maize trade stage ts1 has thus been from the water scarce north to the water rich south the net maize related north to south vw flow increased by 40 from 43 to 61 billion m3 y 1 fig 7 a this maize related vw flow increased less than the north to south trade of maize itself because of the decrease in wf per tonne of maize in this period fig 3a in 2013 heilongjiang and jilin provinces both located in northeast china were the biggest net vw exporters in ts1 exporting 51 of the gross inter provincial vw flows in 2013 see fig 8 a hunan was the biggest net vw importer with 10 2 billion m3y 1 of net vw import in 2013 driven by the province s use of maize for feed consumption while local maize production was low see fig 2 the second trade stage ts2 the trade of pork gives a very different picture south china accounts for 59 of national total pork production and 60 of national pork consumption the net trade of pork is from south to north china as a result also the vw flow related to trade in maize embodied in pork was from south to north china this vw flow in ts2 is thus in the opposite direction to the vw flow in ts1 the vw flow from south to north in ts2 increased by 25 over the study period from 4 8 to 6 1 billion m3 y 1 fig 7b this means that in ts2 about 10 of the water embodied in maize exports from north to south china returns in the form of pork the net flow of the vw in the whole production consumption chain was 55 billion m3 y 1 by 2013 there was a sharp increase in the size of the south to north vw flow in ts2 from year 2005 2006 due to the reduced pork production in a larger number of provinces mostly located in the north as a result of a severe pig blue ear disease outbreak in 2006 ccg 2007 in 2013 ten provinces in the south were a net vw importer in ts1 but a net vw exporter in ts2 fig 8 hunan the biggest vw importer in ts1 was the biggest vw exporter in ts2 reversely nine provinces in the north were a net vw exporter in ts1 but a net vw importer in ts2 this included heilongjiang the largest vw exporter in ts1 the amount of returning water can be substantial as shown by the case of shanxi province in the north the vw import of shanxi in ts2 was equivalent to 63 of the vw export in ts1 still the province has a net vw export related to maize trade but much less than appears at first sight much of the water consumed in the province for producing export maize returns in the form of imported pork liaoning and jilin province two north eastern provinces had vw exports in both ts1 and ts2 these two provinces are expanding production bases of both maize with a 1 8 time production increase over the study period and swine with doubled and 1 5 fold production increase in liaoning and jilin respectively when we focus on blue water only we find that the north to south blue vw flow in ts1 decreased over the study period by 5 from 9 1 to 8 6 billion m3y 1 while the south to north blue vw flow in ts2 increased by 23 from 0 7 to 0 9 billion m3y 1 most of the provinces with net blue vw export in ts1 are net blue vw importers in ts2 fig 9 except for the north eastern provinces of liaoning and jilin which together increasingly form china s key swine base and suffer moderate blue water scarcity zhao et al 2018 in 2013 the total net blue vw export from liaoning and jilin over the two trade stages accounted for 49 and 64 of the total wf of local maize production respectively in fig 10 we illustrate the reversed vw flows in ts1 and ts2 for the biggest maize producer shandong province and the biggest pork producer sichuan province about 11 of the vw flow from shandong in the north to hubei in the south in ts1 maize trade is returned in ts2 pork trade these return flows in the form of pork are 9 for the maize trade from shandong to hunan and 12 for the maize trade from shandong to chongqing the pork exporting province of sichuan exports a lot of vw embedded in pork but also imports a lot of vw embedded in maize to feed the pigs considering the net effect of ts1 and ts2 sichuan shows a net export of vw to shaanxi and gansu provinces pork export being dominant but a net import of vw from ningxia and xinjiang maize import being dominant 3 4 discussion 3 4 1 sustainability of maize related blue wfs and vw flows in china following the approach for wf sustainability assessment by hoekstra et al 2011 we assess the impacts of maize production and consumption on blue water scarcity bws and sustainability of maize related blue wfs and vw flows in china blue wfs of maize production and maize related inter provincial virtual water vw exports in both st1 and st2 were compared to the average local bws levels at 30 30 arc minute grid level by mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the bws level was indicated as the ratio of the local blue wf to the total blue water availability the blue water availability is the sum of locally generated blue water in a grid cell which adopted the 80 natural runoff presumptive environmental flow standard richter et al 2012 and the blue water flowing in from upstream grid cells mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the presumptive environmental flow standards stand for a moderate level of protection with measurable changes in structure and minimal changes in ecosystem functions the bws values are classified into four levels low bws 1 0 moderate 1 0 bws 1 5 significant 1 5 bws 2 0 and severe bws 2 0 hoekstra et al 2012 fig 11 shows that more than half of the maize fields in northern china was under severe bws by the year 2013 current results show that 67 of total blue wf in maize production contributed to severe bws in china which means severe unsustainable six in eleven blue vw exporting provinces in st1 had over 70 of blue wf of maize production located in area under severe bws over 90 of the blue wf in maize production in four provinces including hebei shanxi shandong and xinjiang were severe unsustainable maize production contributed to 27 16 13 and 13 of the overall severe bws in shanxi shandong hebei and xinjiang respectively mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 without maize production henan province may relieve its overall bws level from severe bws 2 2 to moderate bws 1 6 as a result 59 of the maize related inter provincial blue vw exports in st1 was from maize fields under severe bws fig 11a xinjiang province can be identified as a hotspot in st1 for urgent measures to reduce blue wfs in maize production because it had 92 of severe unsustainable blue wf of maize production 68 of total blue wf was for producing exported maize to other provinces and accounted for 21 of severe unsustainable maize related inter provincial blue vw flows however only 17 of the blue vw exports returned back in st2 the finding is consistent with zhao et al 2018 whereas in st2 majority of the maize related blue vw exporting provinces i e maize related vw importers in st1 were under low scarcity however only 12 632 million m3y 1 of the severe unsustainable north to south blue vw flows in st1 returned in st2 fig 11b liaoning and jilin province the two vw exporters in both st1 and st2 are the other two hotspots by the year 2013 the severe unsustainable blue vw exports of liaoning and jilin meant 17 and 19 of total local blue water consumption in maize production respectively the percentages could keep increasing with the current expanding trends in production of both maize and swine see section 3 3 urgent actions are called for reducing the severe unsustainable blue wf in maize production and associated blue vw flows so that mitigating the severe bws in the hotspots four key strategies can be taken into consideration for more sustainable water consumption related to china s maize hoekstra and mekonnen 2016 i reducing the blue wf in current water scarce maize fields by setting and reaching the blue wf benchmarks with smart field managements e g drip irrigation combined with synthetic mulching chukalla et al 2015 zhuo and hoekstra 2017 nouri et al 2019 or planting more water saving and higher water productive varieties ii increasing self sufficiency degree of feed crops in swine based provinces under low water scarcity like hunan hubei and jiangxi provinces iii reducing the reliance on imports from water scarce regions while increase the production and exports in places with lower water scarcity and higher water productivities hoekstra and mekonnen 2016 iv enhancing the international trade of feed crops from water abundant countries while ensuring the staple food self sufficiency as in governmental goals 3 4 2 burden shifting the results illustrate that mapping of vw flows along a feed meat supply chain helps to better understand the impact of a two step supply chain on the spatial water use pattern in a country the case study for china reveals that the water embodied in the maize traded from the water scarce north to feed pigs in the more water abundant south partly returned to the north in the form of traded pork however only about 10 of the embedded water in the maize exports from the north returned embedded in imported pork despite the trade of pork back to the north the environmental burden shifting remains from the south to the north 3 4 3 uncertainties and limitations a major limitation in the study was the absence of statistics regarding the inter provincial trade network of specific agricultural products for china the method of trade network simulation assumptions in the precondition of trade flow and uncertainties embodied in the unit wf per traded product generate the disparity in the vw flow estimations liu et al 2018a b the current study applies the bottom up approach according to the food balance per province the order of magnitude and main directions in the maize related vw flows in ts1 and ts2 which is dominated by the trade in pork are consistent with available studies based on either the bottom up approach ma et al 2006 dalin et al 2014 or top down approach based on multi regional input output tables e g zhao et al 2015 in current simulations the local consumption of local production is assumed as being priority compared to exports while exports can be prioritized compared to local consumption of maize and pork production in one provinces driven by economic benefits however we made the best assumptions in making the most of accessible data following the previous widely acceptable and cited studies like ma et al 1998 and dalin et al 2014 the top vw exporters are consistent with dalin et al 2014 although the priorities of international trades in meeting the demand are different therefore the shown vw flow patterns and magnitudes are comparable to the available reports based on similar assumptions and approaches there must be over or under estimation in the trade balances per province according to the food balance assumptions for local studies focusing on smaller regions than provincial scale validation and modification of the current vw trade modelling based on surveys or accessible official data on transfers of crop is crucial for setting relative local water policies one may suggest to compare to results based on the top down approaches however the main difference between the bottom up and top down approach is that the mrio modelling cannot downscale from the whole agricultural sector into specific individual products feng et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 while the same main directions of the inter provincial vw flows still tell the feasibility of the current methodology and results regarding the uncertainties in the wf accounting for crop production kersebaum et al 2016 identified through winter wheat in european environment as the case that the variation among calculated unit wfs by different crop growth models including the aquacrop was 15 49 and the discrepancy in yield simulations dominated the differences in wf results rather than that in simulated et the current study calibrates yield simulations of maize based on provincial statistics per year zhuo et al 2014 tested effects of uncertainties in key input variables on the crop wf accounting results via the study case on major crops in the yellow river basin and concluded an uncertainty range of 30 in the simulated unit wf of crops through the cropwat method we compare the current results on unit wf of maize production per province to the estimations in three studies with varied data sources and models dalin et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016a mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 as shown in fig 12 there are 87 of the tested figures with the acceptable deviations less than 30 to the previous studies at national average level the current unit wf of maize production in china is 10 higher than the records by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 who calibrated the simulated yield based on national average level we used the same input data sources as in zhuo et al 2016a however with the consideration of different irrigation method as a result the national average unit wfs of maize differ in the range of 6 5 while the current blue wf rates in the green blue wf in the current study are 0 8 1 9 times higher which shows the effects of the differences in modelling settings assumptions have to be made in the current simulations of the vw networks with the data limitations firstly the maize consumption level per capita was assumed the same across provinces and the differences in diets among rural and urban residents were ignored secondly in the simulations for vw flows in the ts2 we assume a unit maize feeding concentration per livestock without available detailed information on animal specific maize feeding level for china the mentioned assumptions may result in the over or under estimation on the provincial trade balances so that affect the corresponding inter provincial vw trade matrixes according to the identification by tamea et al 2014 population gross domestic product and geographical distances between trade partners were the major driving factors in global vw fluxes which were mainly considered in current simulations therefore given the broad comparisons with available information and knowledge we believe that the current results on the main directions in the network of vw flows over the extended production consumption chain of maize in china are acceptable and solid 3 4 4 implications of the new policies regarding reallocation of animal production to the north for water resources management china s governmental plan for the pork industry for the period 2016 2020 moa 2016 aims to increase the pork production by 0 14 billion t y 1 to maintain a high self sufficiency in the plan four north eastern provinces liaoning jilin heilongjiang and inner mongolia which are the biggest net vw exporters related to maize trade ts1 are designated as the future pork base with 1 2 of production increase per year given the relatively abundant land and feed availabilities but without considering impacts on local water security such pork industry expansion could generate income but will undoubtedly increase local feed production demand and associated water consumption thus increasing local water scarcity levels besides the planned intensification in both maize and pork production in the north eastern provinces may accelerate nitrogen n and phosphorus p pollution of groundwater and streams sun et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2018a 2018b bai et al 2018 show that many regions in the liaoning jilin and heilongjiang provinces have already become polluted with n and p because of the intensive agricultural activities this will worsen if more pig production moves to these provinces 4 conclusion the study maps and links for the first time the vw flows related to the trade of a feed crop ts1 and the trade of an animal product based on this feed ts2 taking the water for maize for pig for pork example in china over the period 2000 2013 as a study case although there was visible reduction in wf per unit mass of maize by 23 the net vw flow related to maize trade ts1 from the water scarce north to the more water abundant south of china grew by 40 related to the doubling of the trade volume over the study period in the reversed direction the net vw flow from south to north related to maize embedded in traded pork ts2 increased by 25 over the same period regarding blue vw flows specifically north to south blue vw flows decreased by 5 in ts1 while south to north blue vw flows increased by 23 in ts2 with this assessment we illustrate the complexity of environmental burden shifting through trade in the case of an animal product supply chain the current case for chinese pork reveals that the environmental burden related to pork consumption in the south is shifted to the north because of the import of feed maize from the north however not all feed maize imported from the north to produce pork in the south can be accounted to pork consumption in the south since some of the pork produced in the south with feed from the north is traded back to the north enhancing both feed and pork production in northern regions as in governmental plans may boost local income but will be at the cost of intensified water scarcity declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18473,trade in commodities implies trade in virtual water vw which refers to the water that was used to produce the traded goods various studies have quantified international or inter provincial virtual water vw flows related to the trade in crops and animal products until date however no effort has been undertaken to understand how the water embodied in traded feed crops trade stage ts1 will be transferred further because of trade in animal products trade stage ts2 this is the first study showing this mechanism in a case study in china for maize the major pig feed and pork the dominant meat considering the period 2000 2013 we estimate the annual green and blue water footprints in maize production and then quantify the inter provincial vw flows related to trade in maize ts1 and trade in maize embodied in pork ts2 results show that in ts1 maize related vw flowed from the water scarce north to the water rich south with an increase of 40 over the study period from 43 to 61 billion m3 y 1 in ts2 about 10 of the water embodied in maize exports from north to south china returns in the form of pork with an increase in the absolute amount of 25 from 4 8 to 6 1 billion m3 y 1 considering blue vw flows specifically we find that north to south blue vw flows decreased by 5 in ts1 while south to north blue vw flows increased by 23 in ts2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords pork maize supply chain water footprint virtual water trade 1 introduction trade in goods and services among nations and within a nation implies long distance socioeconomic and environmental interactions introducing a global dimension to the challenge of sustainable use of natural resources liu et al 2013 trade can compensate for natural resource deficits in importing regions and create labour opportunities and economic outputs in the exporting regions but trade may also shift the burden of resource use and environmental impacts from the importing region where the consumption takes place to the exporting region where the production is located wiedmann and lenzen 2018 sun et al 2018 pace and gephart 2017 zhao et al 2016 dalin and rodríguez iturbe 2016 yang et al 2006 globally around 10 70 of environmental influences e g co2 emissions particulate matter emissions land use coal exploitation and water consumption are embodied in the international trade in which food trade has been the dominant driver wiedmann and lenzen 2018 here we are interested in the consumption of water for producing food whereby we will focus on the case of water for maize for pigs for pork this includes two stages of trade trade in maize and trade in pork we will trace how the water embodied in traded maize will be transferred further because of trade in pork as a metric for water use we will employ the consumptive water footprint wf which measures both consumption of green water rainwater and blue water groundwater and surface water hoekstra 2017 the external wf of a community within a geographic region refers to the water embodied in its consumption from imports the water virtually embedded in traded commodities is known as virtual water vw allan 2003 agricultural products together account for 92 of the wf of humanity and more specifically animal products together contribute about 30 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the major share 98 of the wf of animal products comes from the water consumed to produce the feed mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 growing food demand and intensified food trade are increasing the water scarcity in the exporting production regions globally the water depletion in countries scarce in blue water contributed to 35 of global vw flows lenzen et al 2013 and 11 of non renewable groundwater consumption was embodied in the food trade dalin et al 2017 in this study we distinguish two trade stages of maize fig 1 in the first trade stage ts1 maize is traded from the place of cultivation to the place of consumption in the form of food by humans or feed by animals in the second trade stage ts2 pork is traded from the place of pig farming to the place of pork consumption we quantify vw flows related to maize trade ts1 as well as vw flows related to pork trade ts2 in the latter case we merely focus on the water consumed to produce the maize eaten by the pig to produce one kg of pork the new element of the current study is that it maps and links vw flows related to both ts1 and ts2 inter regional vw flows redistribute water through trade of water intensive products and reshaping the patterns of water reliance through teleconnections between the consumers and producers zhao et al 2015 d odorico et al 2019 severe water scarcity in a certain place can be driven remotely by its trade partner who imports products that consume considerable volume of water in the exporting place therefore it is of importance to clearly and correctly identify the directions and magnitudes of the burden shifting along the vw flows and associated water scarcities there are numerous studies that map vw flows associated with crop trade ts1 at global level e g hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 dalin et al 2012 konar et al 2011 as well as the national level e g liu et al 2008 novo et al 2009 and sub national level e g guan and hubacek 2007 ma et al 2006 verma et al 2009 dalin et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016a zhao et al 2017 there are also several studies that analyse vw flows associated with trade in animal products ts2 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 ma et al 2006 dalin et al 2014 hanasaki et al 2010 but the vw flows related to ts1 and ts2 are never connected the previous studies on crop related or food related vw flow assessments ignore the effects of st2 as well as of the other big crop consumer livestock than humanity on such burden shifting among trade partners here we choose maize and pork trade among provinces in china in the period 2000 2013 as a study case the pork consumer indirectly consumes the maize for feeding the pigs whereas previous studies that quantify vw flows related to trade in pork consider the full amount of embodied water in traded pork we are interested here only in the maize related embodied water in traded pork we first estimate the green and blue wfs of maize production in china per year over the period 2000 2013 at a 5 5 arc minute grid level with consideration of the effects of different irrigation techniques second we quantify the inter provincial vw flows within china related to trade in maize third we quantify the inter provincial vw flows related to the pork trade considering specifically the water for maize for pig for pork maize is one of the major feed crops in the world and contributes 17 to the wf of the global livestock sector mekonnen and hoekstra 2012 china is currently the second biggest producer of maize in the world responsible for 22 of global maize production 2016 about 70 of maize utilization in china is for feed fao 2018 over the period 2000 2013 maize demand for feed in china increased by 69 the harvested area of maize by 57 and total maize production by 106 nbsc 2018 china is the world s largest pork producer accounting for 48 of the global total fao 2018 we choose inter provincial trade of maize and pork in china as a representative target with three main reasons firstly china has intensive inter provincial transfers of maize which resulted in visible maize related water scarce north to water rich south vw flows inter regional maize related vw flows contributed to 39 of the crop related north to south vw flows i e the biggest contributor among considered crops and 38 of crop related gross vw flows within china by 2008 zhuo et al 2016a secondly in china s maize related inter provincial vw flows 72 was driven by feed consumption 2013 fao 2018 given china is the world biggest pork producer with much higher stock than other types of livestock majority of maize feed consumption is for pigs thirdly there is significant spatial mismatch between feed and pork production fig 2 as well as between the consumption and production of pork in 2013 north china produced 84 of the national maize production while south china accounted for 60 of the country s pork production nbsc 2018 given the high water scarcity in north china there is much interest in understanding the reasons and dynamics underlying the widely reported north to south vw flows related to agricultural products mainly crops based on either the bottom up approach i e food balance methods ma et al 2006 dalin et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016a wu

export from north china is increasingly recognized as one of the key contributions to local water scarcity feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 hoekstra and mekonnen 2016 chukalla et al 2015 compared to the studies based on bottom up approaches the common conclusion is the main direction of the north to south vw flows within china with a full picture covering all the water using sectors the top down method based studies were able to map the patterns and construction of the vw flows zhang and anadon 2014 guan and hubacek 2007 zhao et al 2015 scarce unsustainable virtual flows feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 and the driving factors zhao et al 2019 however none has solved the current research question on distinction and links between vw flows in st1 and st2 currently china has the world largest amount of non renewable groundwater depletion related to maize production 4 7 million m3 y 1 most of which is in the north dalin et al 2017 2 methods and data 2 1 estimating green and blue wfs of maize we distinguish between the water footprint of production of maize in a province and the average water footprint of maize as available on the market in a province the latter is used for estimating the wf of the maize fed to pigs and finally the wf of pork assuming that pigs consume a mix of domestically produced maize and maize imported from other provinces according to the relative proportions available in a province the average green and blue wfs of rainfed and irrigated maize production per province over the study period 2000 2013 were based on estimation at 5 5 arc minute grid level following the accounting framework of hoekstra et al 2011 the green and blue wfs of maize production m3 t 1 within a grid cell were calculated as the actual green and blue evapotranspiration et m3 t 1 over the growing period divided by the crop yield y t ha 1 fao s crop water productivity model aquacrop version 6 0 steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 was used to simulate et and y per grid cell per year the simulated maize yields in all grid cells in a province were scaled to fit to the statistics on maize production at province level zhuo et al 2016b the separation of green and blue et was carried out by tracking the daily green and blue soil water balances based on the contribution of rainfall and irrigation respectively following chukalla et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016b and karandish and hoekstra 2017 regarding irrigated maize production we simulated the wfs under three different irrigation methods furrow sprinkler and micro irrigation in aquacrop the effects of varied irrigation are reflected by the different levels of soil evaporation e which partially depends on the fraction of soil surface wetted fw during irrigation which different by irrigation method allen et al 1998 soil evaporation e is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration with the soil evaporation coefficient ke which considers the characteristics of soil surface and the fraction of the soil surface not covered by the canopy when considering the effects of different irrigation methods that the soil surface is partially wetted the ke is adjusted by the fraction of the surface wetted fw allen et al 1998 1 k e f w 1 c c k e x where c c refers to the canopy cover fraction kex maximum soil evaporation coefficient for fully wet and not shaded soil surface we set values of fw as 80 100 and 40 for furrow sprinkler and micro irrigation respectively for each grid the overall green and blue wf wf g and wf b m3 t 1 of irrigated maize then can be calculated as 2 w f g i 1 3 10 t 1 g p e t g t i w i i 1 3 y i w i 3 w f b i 1 3 10 t 1 g p e t b t i w i i 1 3 y i w i where i refers to the irrigation method and w i to the percentage of irrigation method i in the total irrigated area of maize in the grid cell since percentages w i are available only by province we assume w i per grid cell equal to the value at province level evapotranspiration et is summed over the days of the growing period gp 2 2 estimating green and blue wfs of maize in pork for estimating the volume of water for maize for pig for pork we first estimate the amount of maize embodied in 1 kg of pork the amount of maize is then multiplied with the green and blue wfs of maize to obtain the green and blue wfs per kg of pork related to the maize eaten by the pig the maize embodied in pork which we will call here the virtual maize content of pork vmc kg kg 1 equals the maize fed to pig over its lifetime maize consumption mc kg head 1 divided by the pork production rate per pig ppr kg head 1 here we assume that china s national total maize feed goes to swine farms with two reasons firstly pigs are the only livestock with maize dominated feeding maize is responsible for over 63 in pig feeding hansen 2007 secondly pigs dominate china s livestock industry fed by maize in 2013 the number of pigs in china was four times higher than the number of goats the second largest livestock category nbsc 2018 the wf of per kg of the vmc per province refers to the average wf of maize as on the market in the province i e the wf cons shown in equation 3 the wf of maize on the market in a province depends on the ratio of provincially produced maize to imported maize and the wfs in the respective locations of production the average wf of the maize consumed in a province i wf cons i m3 t 1 and is calculated as follows 4 w f c o n s i p i w f p r o d i e i e w f p r o d e p i e i e in which p i t y 1 refers to the maize production quantity in province i i e t y 1 to the imported quantity of maize from exporting place e other regions in china or other countries outside china wf prod i m3 t 1 the wf per unit of maize in province i and wf prod e m3 t 1 the wf per unit of maize as produced in exporting place e 2 3 estimating inter provincial vw networks related to trade in maize and pork the vw flow in ts1 was calculated by multiplying the related maize trade flow t y 1 with the wf of maize production m3 t 1 in the exporting region the vw flow in ts2 was computed as the product of the pork trade flow t y 1 the amount of maize consumed per unit of pork kg kg 1 and the wf per tonne of maize m3 t 1 on the market in the pork export region we estimate provincial trade balances i e net imports for maize and pork as the consumption in a province minus the production in a province ma et al 1998 zhuo et al 2016a with consideration of international trade production consumption of maize for food feed and manufactured products as well as waste and seed based on the national food balance sheets in faostat fao 2018 combined with population and livestock units per province for each year the national consumption of maize for direct human consumption and manufactured products and the national consumption of pork as given by fao 2018 were distributed over the provinces based on provincial populations the national use of maize for feed was distributed over provinces proportional to the amount of pigs per province provincial statistics on yearly maize and pork production per province were taken from nbsc 2018 inter provincial trade matrices for maize and pork per year were determined by using a linear programming optimization procedure assuming that inter provincial trade flows are such that the overall transport cost of trade is minimized following dalin et al 2014 the net import of product p in a province is defined as the total provincial utilization of the product minus the local production we considered four harbour provinces tianjin liaoning shandong and guangdong for distributing foreign imports of maize and pork to provinces and for shipping exports we assume that the intra national and international imports occur in deficit provinces where demand is lower than production and that the intra national and international exports are from surplus provinces we estimate inter provincial

chinese provinces were obtained from the surveying and mapping data sharing network nasmg 2010 data on yearly consumption and international trade in maize and pork for china in t y 1 over the period 2000 2013 were obtained from fao 2018 data on monthly precipitation reference evapotranspiration and temperature at a resolution of 30 30 arc minute were taken from harris et al 2014 data on irrigated and rain fed areas for each crop at a 5 5 arc minute resolution were obtained from portmann et al 2010 annual agriculture statistics on harvested areas and yields of maize statistics for fed and slaughtered livestock and the associated livestock production as well as total irrigated area with different irrigation methods per province were obtained from nbsc 2018 soil texture data were obtained from the isric soil and terrain database for china at a scale of 1 1 million dijkshoorn et al 2008 for hydraulic characteristics for each type of soil the indicative values provided by aquacrop were used data on total soil water capacity in vol at a spatial resolution of 5 5 arc minute were obtained from the isric wise version1 2 dataset batjes 2012 3 results 3 1 wf of maize production in china over the study period 2000 2013 china s national average wf per tonne of maize decreased by 23 from 955 m3 t 1 of which 18 blue wf in 2000 to 692 m3 t 1 13 blue wf in 2013 fig 3 this was mainly related to the increased national average maize yield which grew by 31 from 4 6 t ha 1 in 2000 to 6 0 t ha 1 in 2013 with the doubled total maize production from 106 to 218 million t y 1 the national total wf of maize production increased by 49 from 101 billion m3 y 1 in 2000 to 151 billion m3 y 1 in 2013 whereby the green wf increased by 58 from 83 billion m3 y 1 to 132 billion m3 y 1 north china had a larger wf per tonne of maize than south china fig 4 the provincial average wf of maize production ranged between 348 m3 t 1 qinghai province and 1032 m3 t 1 guizhou province in 2013 over the study period most of the provinces experienced a decrease in the wf per tonne of maize with an exception for five provinces in the south shanghai jiangsu zhejiang hubei and guizhou these five provinces also had decreased maize yields for instance the maize yield in guizhou province decreased by 19 over the study period while the wf per tonne of maize increased by 31 for guizhou province the reduction started since the year 2011 with yield level was 42 less than in 2010 mainly due to the extreme drought happened in august and successive drought problems in the following two years wang et al 2014 in addition reductions in irrigated maize area by 30 in shanghai and by 3 in jiangsu as well as the less fertilization by 65 in shanghai and by 12 in jiangsu could be other reasons for maize yield decreases nbsc 2018 among all provinces inner mongolia had the highest decrease 59 in wf per tonne of maize irrigated maize contributed 48 to the national total wf of maize production by 2013 with irrigation over 41 of the total harvested maize land furrow irrigation is still the main irrigation method in china and accounted 86 of total wf of irrigated maize production in 2013 the study period witnessed an increasing wf of micro irrigated maize production from zero to 7 of total wf related to irrigated maize production with the expansion in the micro irrigation across the country in most provinces the wf per tonne of maize under micro irrigation was the smallest followed by furrow irrigation and finally sprinkler irrigation the wf per tonne of rain fed maize was always larger than the wf of irrigated maize due to a relatively lower yield level micro irrigation had the highest blue water fraction in the total wf 3 2 maize related wf of pork in china the fraction of maize in pig feed increased considerably over the period 2000 2013 cfia 2013 with the number of pigs increasing by 14 but total maize consumption by pigs increasing by 68 the pork production rate meat per animal was stable over the period considered the average virtual maize content of pork in china increased by 46 from 2 8 in 2000 to 4 1 kg kg 1 in 2013 table 1 the increasing trend reflects the effects of the expansion in scale breeding of pigs that the occupation of which in the national swine cultivation increased from 9 to 50 over 2000 2013 and rising demand of concentrated feed tian et al 2016 translating the maize content of pork to the underlying water consumption we find that the average maize related wf of pork increased by 7 this rate of increase was less than 46 because of the reduction in the wf per tonne maize in the country fig 3 at provincial level the maize related wf of pork ranged between 1580 m3 t 1 ningxia and 3680 m3 t 1 hebei as shown in fig 5 the maize related wf of pork was relatively high in eastern provinces where most of the swine farms are located fig 2 twenty one provinces had an increased maize related wf per tonne of pork over the study period with shandong province having the sharpest increase from 2230 to 3110 m3 t 1 mainly due to the increased maize feed per pig fig 6 shows per province for 2013 the blue water percentage in the maize related wf of pork versus the blue water percentage in the wf of maize most exporting provinces of pork most depending on imported maize had a higher blue water fraction in the maize related wf of pork than in the wf of locally produced maize the main reason is that they imported maize from more water scarce northern provinces where there are higher blue wf ratios in maize production for example anhui hubei hunan and chongqing province imported maize for their pigs from north eastern china heilongjiang liaoning and jilin while sichuan guizhou and yunnan imported maize from northern and north western provinces 3 3 virtual water flows related to maize in the two trade stages over the period 2000 2013 maize trade from north to south china increased by a factor 2 2 from 45 to 99 million t y 1 in 2013 north to south maize trade was equivalent to 45 of china s total maize production in that year north china accounted for 86 of national maize production whereas the south accounted for 59 of national maize consumption the net vw flow related to trade in maize trade stage ts1 has thus been from the water scarce north to the water rich south the net maize related north to south vw flow increased by 40 from 43 to 61 billion m3 y 1 fig 7 a this maize related vw flow increased less than the north to south trade of maize itself because of the decrease in wf per tonne of maize in this period fig 3a in 2013 heilongjiang and jilin provinces both located in northeast china were the biggest net vw exporters in ts1 exporting 51 of the gross inter provincial vw flows in 2013 see fig 8 a hunan was the biggest net vw importer with 10 2 billion m3y 1 of net vw import in 2013 driven by the province s use of maize for feed consumption while local maize production was low see fig 2 the second trade stage ts2 the trade of pork gives a very different picture south china accounts for 59 of national total pork production and 60 of national pork consumption the net trade of pork is from south to north china as a result also the vw flow related to trade in maize embodied in pork was from south to north china this vw flow in ts2 is thus in the opposite direction to the vw flow in ts1 the vw flow from south to north in ts2 increased by 25 over the study period from 4 8 to 6 1 billion m3 y 1 fig 7b this means that in ts2 about 10 of the water embodied in maize exports from north to south china returns in the form of pork the net flow of the vw in the whole production consumption chain was 55 billion m3 y 1 by 2013 there was a sharp increase in the size of the south to north vw flow in ts2 from year 2005 2006 due to the reduced pork production in a larger number of provinces mostly located in the north as a result of a severe pig blue ear disease outbreak in 2006 ccg 2007 in 2013 ten provinces in the south were a net vw importer in ts1 but a net vw exporter in ts2 fig 8 hunan the biggest vw importer in ts1 was the biggest vw exporter in ts2 reversely nine provinces in the north were a net vw exporter in ts1 but a net vw importer in ts2 this included heilongjiang the largest vw exporter in ts1 the amount of returning water can be substantial as shown by the case of shanxi province in the north the vw import of shanxi in ts2 was equivalent to 63 of the vw export in ts1 still the province has a net vw export related to maize trade but much less than appears at first sight much of the water consumed in the province for producing export maize returns in the form of imported pork liaoning and jilin province two north eastern provinces had vw exports in both ts1 and ts2 these two provinces are expanding production bases of both maize with a 1 8 time production increase over the study period and swine with doubled and 1 5 fold production increase in liaoning and jilin respectively when we focus on blue water only we find that the north to south blue vw flow in ts1 decreased over the study period by 5 from 9 1 to 8 6 billion m3y 1 while the south to north blue vw flow in ts2 increased by 23 from 0 7 to 0 9 billion m3y 1 most of the provinces with net blue vw export in ts1 are net blue vw importers in ts2 fig 9 except for the north eastern provinces of liaoning and jilin which together increasingly form china s key swine base and suffer moderate blue water scarcity zhao et al 2018 in 2013 the total net blue vw export from liaoning and jilin over the two trade stages accounted for 49 and 64 of the total wf of local maize production respectively in fig 10 we illustrate the reversed vw flows in ts1 and ts2 for the biggest maize producer shandong province and the biggest pork producer sichuan province about 11 of the vw flow from shandong in the north to hubei in the south in ts1 maize trade is returned in ts2 pork trade these return flows in the form of pork are 9 for the maize trade from shandong to hunan and 12 for the maize trade from shandong to chongqing the pork exporting province of sichuan exports a lot of vw embedded in pork but also imports a lot of vw embedded in maize to feed the pigs considering the net effect of ts1 and ts2 sichuan shows a net export of vw to shaanxi and gansu provinces pork export being dominant but a net import of vw from ningxia and xinjiang maize import being dominant 3 4 discussion 3 4 1 sustainability of maize related blue wfs and vw flows in china following the approach for wf sustainability assessment by hoekstra et al 2011 we assess the impacts of maize production and consumption on blue water scarcity bws and sustainability of maize related blue wfs and vw flows in china blue wfs of maize production and maize related inter provincial virtual water vw exports in both st1 and st2 were compared to the average local bws levels at 30 30 arc minute grid level by mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the bws level was indicated as the ratio of the local blue wf to the total blue water availability the blue water availability is the sum of locally generated blue water in a grid cell which adopted the 80 natural runoff presumptive environmental flow standard richter et al 2012 and the blue water flowing in from upstream grid cells mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the presumptive environmental flow standards stand for a moderate level of protection with measurable changes in structure and minimal changes in ecosystem functions the bws values are classified into four levels low bws 1 0 moderate 1 0 bws 1 5 significant 1 5 bws 2 0 and severe bws 2 0 hoekstra et al 2012 fig 11 shows that more than half of the maize fields in northern china was under severe bws by the year 2013 current results show that 67 of total blue wf in maize production contributed to severe bws in china which means severe unsustainable six in eleven blue vw exporting provinces in st1 had over 70 of blue wf of maize production located in area under severe bws over 90 of the blue wf in maize production in four provinces including hebei shanxi shandong and xinjiang were severe unsustainable maize production contributed to 27 16 13 and 13 of the overall severe bws in shanxi shandong hebei and xinjiang respectively mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 without maize production henan province may relieve its overall bws level from severe bws 2 2 to moderate bws 1 6 as a result 59 of the maize related inter provincial blue vw exports in st1 was from maize fields under severe bws fig 11a xinjiang province can be identified as a hotspot in st1 for urgent measures to reduce blue wfs in maize production because it had 92 of severe unsustainable blue wf of maize production 68 of total blue wf was for producing exported maize to other provinces and accounted for 21 of severe unsustainable maize related inter provincial blue vw flows however only 17 of the blue vw exports returned back in st2 the finding is consistent with zhao et al 2018 whereas in st2 majority of the maize related blue vw exporting provinces i e maize related vw importers in st1 were under low scarcity however only 12 632 million m3y 1 of the severe unsustainable north to south blue vw flows in st1 returned in st2 fig 11b liaoning and jilin province the two vw exporters in both st1 and st2 are the other two hotspots by the year 2013 the severe unsustainable blue vw exports of liaoning and jilin meant 17 and 19 of total local blue water consumption in maize production respectively the percentages could keep increasing with the current expanding trends in production of both maize and swine see section 3 3 urgent actions are called for reducing the severe unsustainable blue wf in maize production and associated blue vw flows so that mitigating the severe bws in the hotspots four key strategies can be taken into consideration for more sustainable water consumption related to china s maize hoekstra and mekonnen 2016 i reducing the blue wf in current water scarce maize fields by setting and reaching the blue wf benchmarks with smart field managements e g drip irrigation combined with synthetic mulching chukalla et al 2015 zhuo and hoekstra 2017 nouri et al 2019 or planting more water saving and higher water productive varieties ii increasing self sufficiency degree of feed crops in swine based provinces under low water scarcity like hunan hubei and jiangxi provinces iii reducing the reliance on imports from water scarce regions while increase the production and exports in places with lower water scarcity and higher water productivities hoekstra and mekonnen 2016 iv enhancing the international trade of feed crops from water abundant countries while ensuring the staple food self sufficiency as in governmental goals 3 4 2 burden shifting the results illustrate that mapping of vw flows along a feed meat supply chain helps to better understand the impact of a two step supply chain on the spatial water use pattern in a country the case study for china reveals that the water embodied in the maize traded from the water scarce north to feed pigs in the more water abundant south partly returned to the north in the form of traded pork however only about 10 of the embedded water in the maize exports from the north returned embedded in imported pork despite the trade of pork back to the north the environmental burden shifting remains from the south to the north 3 4 3 uncertainties and limitations a major limitation in the study was the absence of statistics regarding the inter provincial trade network of specific agricultural products for china the method of trade network simulation assumptions in the precondition of trade flow and uncertainties embodied in the unit wf per traded product generate the disparity in the vw flow estimations liu et al 2018a b the current study applies the bottom up approach according to the food balance per province the order of magnitude and main directions in the maize related vw flows in ts1 and ts2 which is dominated by the trade in pork are consistent with available studies based on either the bottom up approach ma et al 2006 dalin et al 2014 or top down approach based on multi regional input output tables e g zhao et al 2015 in current simulations the local consumption of local production is assumed as being priority compared to exports while exports can be prioritized compared to local consumption of maize and pork production in one provinces driven by economic benefits however we made the best assumptions in making the most of accessible data following the previous widely acceptable and cited studies like ma et al 1998 and dalin et al 2014 the top vw exporters are consistent with dalin et al 2014 although the priorities of international trades in meeting the demand are different therefore the shown vw flow patterns and magnitudes are comparable to the available reports based on similar assumptions and approaches there must be over or under estimation in the trade balances per province according to the food balance assumptions for local studies focusing on smaller regions than provincial scale validation and modification of the current vw trade modelling based on surveys or accessible official data on transfers of crop is crucial for setting relative local water policies one may suggest to compare to results based on the top down approaches however the main difference between the bottom up and top down approach is that the mrio modelling cannot downscale from the whole agricultural sector into specific individual products feng et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 while the same main directions of the inter provincial vw flows still tell the feasibility of the current methodology and results regarding the uncertainties in the wf accounting for crop production kersebaum et al 2016 identified through winter wheat in european environment as the case that the variation among calculated unit wfs by different crop growth models including the aquacrop was 15 49 and the discrepancy in yield simulations dominated the differences in wf results rather than that in simulated et the current study calibrates yield simulations of maize based on provincial statistics per year zhuo et al 2014 tested effects of uncertainties in key input variables on the crop wf accounting results via the study case on major crops in the yellow river basin and concluded an uncertainty range of 30 in the simulated unit wf of crops through the cropwat method we compare the current results on unit wf of maize production per province to the estimations in three studies with varied data sources and models dalin et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016a mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 as shown in fig 12 there are 87 of the tested figures with the acceptable deviations less than 30 to the previous studies at national average level the current unit wf of maize production in china is 10 higher than the records by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 who calibrated the simulated yield based on national average level we used the same input data sources as in zhuo et al 2016a however with the consideration of different irrigation method as a result the national average unit wfs of maize differ in the range of 6 5 while the current blue wf rates in the green blue wf in the current study are 0 8 1 9 times higher which shows the effects of the differences in modelling settings assumptions have to be made in the current simulations of the vw networks with the data limitations firstly the maize consumption level per capita was assumed the same across provinces and the differences in diets among rural and urban residents were ignored secondly in the simulations for vw flows in the ts2 we assume a unit maize feeding concentration per livestock without available detailed information on animal specific maize feeding level for china the mentioned assumptions may result in the over or under estimation on the provincial trade balances so that affect the corresponding inter provincial vw trade matrixes according to the identification by tamea et al 2014 population gross domestic product and geographical distances between trade partners were the major driving factors in global vw fluxes which were mainly considered in current simulations therefore given the broad comparisons with available information and knowledge we believe that the current results on the main directions in the network of vw flows over the extended production consumption chain of maize in china are acceptable and solid 3 4 4 implications of the new policies regarding reallocation of animal production to the north for water resources management china s governmental plan for the pork industry for the period 2016 2020 moa 2016 aims to increase the pork production by 0 14 billion t y 1 to maintain a high self sufficiency in the plan four north eastern provinces liaoning jilin heilongjiang and inner mongolia which are the biggest net vw exporters related to maize trade ts1 are designated as the future pork base with 1 2 of production increase per year given the relatively abundant land and feed availabilities but without considering impacts on local water security such pork industry expansion could generate income but will undoubtedly increase local feed production demand and associated water consumption thus increasing local water scarcity levels besides the planned intensification in both maize and pork production in the north eastern provinces may accelerate nitrogen n and phosphorus p pollution of groundwater and streams sun et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2018a 2018b bai et al 2018 show that many regions in the liaoning jilin and heilongjiang provinces have already become polluted with n and p because of the intensive agricultural activities this will worsen if more pig production moves to these provinces 4 conclusion the study maps and links for the first time the vw flows related to the trade of a feed crop ts1 and the trade of an animal product based on this feed ts2 taking the water for maize for pig for pork example in china over the period 2000 2013 as a study case although there was visible reduction in wf per unit mass of maize by 23 the net vw flow related to maize trade ts1 from the water scarce north to the more water abundant south of china grew by 40 related to the doubling of the trade volume over the study period in the reversed direction the net vw flow from south to north related to maize embedded in traded pork ts2 increased by 25 over the same period regarding blue vw flows specifically north to south blue vw flows decreased by 5 in ts1 while south to north blue vw flows increased by 23 in ts2 with this assessment we illustrate the complexity of environmental burden shifting through trade in the case of an animal product supply chain the current case for chinese pork reveals that the environmental burden related to pork consumption in the south is shifted to the north because of the import of feed maize from the north however not all feed maize imported from the north to produce pork in the south can be accounted to pork consumption in the south since some of the pork produced in the south with feed from the north is traded back to the north enhancing both feed and pork production in northern regions as in governmental plans may boost local income but will be at the cost of intensified water scarcity declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18474,acidic rare earth element tailings rees wastewater with high nitrogen and low cod is the most serious and yet unsolved environmental issue in the rare earth mining industry the effective and cheap remediation of nh4 n and no3 n from the rees wastewater is still a huge challenge this harsh wastewater environment results in the difficulty for common microbes and microalgae to be survived in this work a novel highly tolerant co flocculating microalgae the combination of scenedesmus sp and parachlorella sp was successfully isolated from the rare earth mine effluent through three year cultivation the removal efficiency of total inorganic nitrogen tin by the co flocculating microalgae cultivation was as high as 90 9 which is 1 9 times than the average removal efficiency 47 9 of previously reported microalgae species in the wastewater with cod n ratio ranging from 0 to 1 thus the residual concentrations of nh4 n and tin could reach the emission standards of pollutants from rare earths industry gb 26451 2011 along with the high n removal performance other related characteristics of the co flocculating microalgae were also revealed such as high tolerance towards high nh4 n and strong acid rapid growth and sedimentation and simultaneous removal of nh4 n and no3 n these algae characteristics were ascribed to the specific co flocculating community structure covered by extracellular polymeric substances graphical abstract image 1 keywords tailings wastewater acid mining wastewater flocculating microalgae ammonia and nitrate 1 introduction rare earth elements are widely used in electronic devices auto industry aeronautical manufacture energy conversion and so on alonso et al 2012 dutta et al 2016 the rare earth mines worldwide are mainly distributed in china 36 5 57 5 and about 80 of the rare earth oxide were supplied from china yang et al 2013 dutta et al 2016 ion adsorbed rare earth minerals are mainly located in the south china especially jiangxi province in situ mining by chemical leaching with ammonium salt is a simple and common used method high concentration of ammonium sulfate solution are poured into the ion adsorbed rare earth minerals to dissolve and extract the rare earth elements moldoveanu and papangelakis 2012 zhao et al 2017 nevertheless extensive residual ammonium sulfate still remains in the groundwater around the abandoned mines and then flows out with rainwater to form a mass of rare earth element tailings rees wastewater according to the field survey the average flow rate of the rees wastewater in single rare earth mine is as high as 4 000 10 000 m3 d and the number of the tailings can reach up to 200 in ganzhou region of jiangxi province alone china most of the rees wastewater possesses the following characteristics high nh4 n about 50 200 mg l and no3 n usually 10 80 mg l low organic matter less than 10 mg cod l low ph values from 3 5 to 5 high sulfate so4 2 200 700 mg l low concentrations of heavy metals and residual rare earth elements compared with other pollutants the removal of nh4 n and no3 n from the rees wastewater is a priority therefore it is urgent to choose an effective and cheap method to remediate the total inorganic nitrogen tin under the low cod and strong acidic environment chemical oxidation or electro oxidation could only achieve a fast nh4 n removal but a large number of no3 n was remained thus resulting in a low tin removal efficiency perez et al 2010 vendramel et al 2013 various adsorbents have been used to remove nh4 n and no3 n such as zeolites and bamboo powder charcoal jung et al 2004 mizuta et al 2004 however high concentrations of other ions i e so4 2 and cl would interfere and decrease the adsorption performance of the target ions even more important the above two chemical or physicochemical methods are usually expensive and difficult to be implemented in the real rees wastewater biological technique was considered to be an effective and widely used method such as activated sludge process lu et al 2017 in the activated sludge process enough cod n ratio at least equal to or higher than 4 cheng et al 2017 virdis et al 2010 and proper ph range 6 5 7 5 in the denitrification process rathnayake et al 2015 zou et al 2016 were needed for the real rees wastewater the use of the activated sludge process required to add large number of organic matter and adjust ph value which certainly would lead to a more complex treatment process and higher operation cost on the other hand to the best of our knowledge until now there is not an effective and low cost method to successfully remediate the real rees wastewater in practical applications recently microalgae treatment methods are popular due to that they can remove n and p pollutants from wastewater and simultaneously produce microalgae biomass as bioresources for biofuel or high value by products beuckels et al 2015 relative to traditional activated sludge process microalgae could efficiently treat various wastewater with more wider c n p ratios chiu et al 2015 even some refractory wastewater can be successfully treated by algal cultivation but the traditional biological techniques required complex pretreatment processes such as dilution and the addition of chemical agents this is due to that the microalgae could tolerate and fast grow in the harsh wastewater environment he et al 2013 and assimilate inorganic carbon as the carbon source martınez et al 2000 mujtaba and lee 2017 for example reverse osmosis concentrate and anaerobic digester effluent can be solved by the algal cultivation and the removal efficiency of nh4 n or no3 n can reach up to 90 0 wang et al 2016 2018 thus it is possible that microalgae can be used to treat the refractory rees wastewater however to the best of our knowledge there are no reports using microalgae to treat the wastewater with severe unbalanced nutrient and strong acidic environment the objectives of this study were to determine a whether a suitable microalgae could survive in the harsh rees wastewater b whether the tin can be efficiently removed from the rees wastewater to reach a lower residual concentration our results demonstrated that a novel highly tolerant co flocculating microalgae was successfully isolated from the rare earth mine effluent and the tin removal efficiency could reach up to 90 9 in addition rapid sedimentation characteristics and co flocculating structure of the obtained microalgae were also revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 rees wastewater the wastewater samples were collected from the longnan foot cave rare earth element mine area in longnan county ganzhou city jiangxi province china located at e24 850319 n114 816080 the samples were placed and sealed in 30 l polyethylene drums and stored in laboratory at room temperature the following parameters of the rees wastewater were measured ph cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n phosphate calcium magnesium chloride sulfate typical heavy metals and residual rare earth elements 2 2 microalgae common similar microalgae strains such as chlorella vulgaris fachb 8 chlorella pyrenoedosa fachb 5 and scenedesmus obliquus fachb 315 were purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology fachb chinese academy of sciences p r china the three microalga species were incubated in sterilized bg 11 medium purchased from hope bio technology qingdao china which contains 250 mg n l 10 mg p l and other macro and micro nutrients the co flocculating microalgae was isolated from the rees effluent in longnan county through three years cultivation in the laboratory a small amount of microalgae was survived at the bottom of the wastewater the microalgae was inoculated into the synthetic culture medium table s1 thus massive co flocculating microalgae was obtained the co flocculating microalgae was identified the detailed process was described in supporting information s1 1 2 3 experimental design all algal assays were conducted in a temperature controlled room qiushi environment company zhejiang province set at 28 c and 60 relative humidity light was provided continuously using white fluorescent tubes with a light intensity of 125 μmol m2 s four assays were conducted as described below assay 1 microalgae incubation and cultivation three algal strains were added separately at 5 v v into erlenmeyer flasks containing bg 11 medium after 25 d of incubation algal cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 5 min and then re suspended in deionized water after 24 h centrifuged again and re suspended in the real rees wastewater and keep the initial concentration of microalgae is 0 5 g l the sedimentation efficiency of microalgae was measured by comparing the concentration at half depth over time the concentration of tin in wastewater was measured after 10 d incubation the above described assay procedure was also followed with the co flocculating microalgae assay 2 microalgae tolerance investigation after the above cultivation in bg 11 medium three common microalgae species and the co flocculating microalgae were incubated in three different kinds of synthetic wastewater respectively the incubation initial concentration is 0 5 g l the wastewater consists of nh4 with different concentrations and 60 mg l p and the ph was adjusted to desired values with hcl or naoh that is ph 7 0 nh4 n 130 mg l ph 3 5 nh4 n 130 mg l ph 3 5 nh4 n 10 mg l the microalgae biomass were determined on the third and sixth day and the growth ratios were also calculated assay 3 p supplementation test k2hpo4 as p source was added into the rees wastewater and the initial p concentrations were controlled to be 0 10 20 40 80 and 160 mg l respectively the co flocculating microalgae with initial concentration of 0 5 g l was added in the above reactors containing different p concentrations the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and p were measured over time and the optimal p concentration was confirmed assay 4 n removal test from the rees wastewater the initial concentration of the supplemented p is 60 mg l the removal efficiency re and removal rate rr mg l 1 d 1 by the co flocculating microalgae in the rees wastewater were calculated as 1 r e c t c 0 c 0 100 2 r r c t c 0 v 10 3 t where c t is n concentration mg l at time t

basic ic plus metrohm switzerland with an sh ac 3 column 4 250 mm the ph values were obtained with a ph meter inesa china the morphologies of the co flocculating microalgae cells were acquired using scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan total lipids were extracted with a chloroform methanol 1 1 v v mixed solvent and quantified gravimetrically bligh and dbliyer 1959 the extracted lipids were dissolved in 1 0 ml isopropyl alcohol and the triacylglycerol tag were measured by the enzymatic colorimetric method bligh and dbliyer 1959 using commercial kits purchased from nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china algal samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters welch china and then dried at 105 c for 24 h thus the dry weight of algal biomass was obtained 3 result and discussion 3 1 rees wastewater characteristics table 1 shows the characteristics of the rees wastewater compared with low cod value about 6 mg l and low concentrations of heavy metals and rare earth elements table s2 the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were as high as 125 4 mg l and 84 5 mg l respectively hence nitrogen including nh4 n and no3 n was predominant constituent of the rees wastewater and was also the target pollutant especially high concentration of nh4 n may inhibit the microalgae growth park et al 2010 perez garcia et al 2011 the ph value of the wastewater is 3 5 which is far below the normal range for traditional nitrification and denitrification processes 6 5 7 5 rathnayake et al 2015 zou et al 2016 and also below the general tolerance ability of common microalgae 6 9 bartley et al 2014 moreover p concentration was less than 0 01 mg l much lower than the empirical proportions c n p 100 5 1 this severe unbalanced nutritional composition and hostile strong acid environment result in the difficulty for common microalgae to be survived in addition the high salt concentration such as sulfate and chloride possibly leads to the massive secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps due to stress induces jung et al 2015 the specific rees wastewater environment would be beneficial to the algae acclimation and special functional algae was possible to be obtained 3 2 the co flocculating microalgae isolated from the rees effluent due to the severe unbalanced nutrient and hostile strong acid common microalgae species cannot adapt this rees wastewater environment thus almost none microalgae were observed in the freshly collected wastewater the rees wastewater was hermetically cultivated in a light incubator at constant temperature and a small amount of nutrients were supplemented the sample almost remained unchanged in the first two years in the third year at the bottom of sample bottle a small amount of microalgae was observed then the microalgae was inoculated in the culture medium to be amplified and a lot of microalgae appeared therefore after three year natural domestication the co flocculating microalgae was successfully isolated from the rees effluent through identification the co flocculating microalgae were composed of scenedesmus sp and parachlorella sp the high concentration of nh4 n and no3 n endow the co flocculating microalgae possess a strong ability to assimilate the n and then the cell grow after 15 d of incubation 90 1 of tin in the rees wastewater were removed and n removal rate could be as high as 12 6 mg l 1 d 1 in addition the biomass productivity was as high as 107 0 mg l 1 d 1 3 3 tolerance of the co flocculating microalgae to investigate the tolerance of the co flocculating microalgae three common microalga species and the co flocculating microalga were incubated in undiluted rees wastewater under the same condition after 10 d cultivation the co flocculating microalgae achieved the highest removal efficiency of tin 11 0 fig 1 a however three common microalga showed relatively low tin removal ability chlorella vulgaris achieved the lowest tin removal efficiency 2 8 and scenedesmus obliquus achieved 8 3 tin removal efficiency from fig 1b the color of common microalgae turned from the green to yellow and the co flocculating microalgae kept it bright green color these results demonstrated that the co flocculating microalgae possesses superior tolerance than other microalgae species when cultivated in the rees wastewater to further study the tolerance of the co flocculating microalgae in the rees wastewater three kinds of synthetic wastewater with different ph and nh4 n was used to culture these microalgae species as shown in fig 1c in the high concentration of nh4 n wastewater with neutral or acidic condition the growth ratio of co flocculating microalgae increased at 5 0 in the 6 days however the ratios of other three common microalgae all decreased 4 3 8 2 in addition the growth ratio of the co flocculating microalgae in the acidic wastewater was higher than that in neutral condition which is due to the increase of free ammonia nh3 under more h environment that have uncoupling effect on the photosynthetic processes lin et al 2007 park et al 2010 on the other hand in the acidic and low nh4 n wastewater only the growth ratio of chlorella vulgaris was decreased these results demonstrated that high nh4 n particularly free ammonia in the rees wastewater is the most important factor that inhibits the growth of microalgae species 3 4 the optimization of p concentration although the co flocculating microalgae possesses high tolerance ability in the rees wastewater the tin removal efficiency of the co flocculating microalgae was only 11 0 within 10 d incubation corresponding to a mean n removal rate of 2 1 mg n d the tin removal rate is much lower than previously reported rates of other microalgae treating high n wastewater 6 5 20 mg n d wang et al 2016 2018 in order to improve the removal efficiency of the co flocculating microalgae many optimized methods such as the addition of carbon dioxide stirring and so on were tried but the resultant performance was not obviously improved even decreased empirically p element could account for 0 9 in the microalgae molecular formula of c106h263o110n16p xu et al 2006 considering p concentration was even lower than 0 01 mg l in the rees wastewater table 1 the lack of p was considered to be the main factor of the low n removal efficiency therefore different concentrations of p were added in the rees wastewater to test the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and no3 n as shown in fig 2 a the nh4 n removal efficiency increased from 22 4 to 99 6 with the p dose increased from 10 to 80 mg l when the p dose was increased to 160 mg l the nh4 n was completely removed and treatment time was shortened from 29 d to 17 d with the p supplemented the no3 n removal also showed the similar tendency with the nh4 n fig 2b the removal efficiency of no3 n increased from 4 1 to 99 5 with the p dose was increased from 0 to 80 mg l at a p dose of 160 mg l the no3 n was almost completely removed only by the 13 d of incubation therefore p supplement could greatly improve the removal efficiency of nh4 n and no3 n simultaneously although p could promote the removal of nh4 n and no3 n too much p would lead to p residue which would cause the eutrophication in receiving waters dodds and smith 2016 as shown in fig 2c the p residues scarcely appeared in the added p concentration from 10 to 40 mg l but the nh4 n and no3 n were not completely removed through 29 d cultivation high concentrations of p are indeed beneficial to the removal of nh4 n and no3 n by the co flocculating microalgae cultivation but the p residue would be more serious when the supplemented p dosage was 80 mg l the residual p concentration was 25 6 mg l and the p residues could be as high as 78 7 mg l at the supplemented p 160 mg l therefore a suitable n p ratio need to be confirmed the residual concentrations of n and p were plotted as the supplemented p concentration fig 2d the supplemented p concentration at a dose of about 60 mg l could result in relatively low levels of both n and p concentration in the treated wastewater therefore 60 mg l p source was added in the subsequent experiments 3 5 n removal performance in the rees wastewater based on the optimal p concentration 60 mg l the initial concentration of the co flocculating microalgae was also investigated table s3 and the optimal concentration 1 0 g l was obtained under the optimal conditions the concentrations of different n types tin nh4 n no3 n and no2 n in the rees wastewater through the co flocculating microalgae cultivation were measured and the results are shown in fig 3 the tin removal efficiency was as high as 90 9 after 15 d treatment and the residual concentration was 19 1 mg l which is much lower than the required value 30 mg l of emission standards of pollutants from rare earths industry gb 26451 2011 the nh4 n was removed at 88 4 and its residual concentration was 14 5 mg l which is also lower than the emission standard of 15 mg l the no3 n was simultaneously removed by the co flocculating microalgae cultivation and the removal efficiency could be as high as 94 7 meanwhile low concentration of no2 n 0 4 1 4 mg l was detected between 7 and 11 d of incubation which is the transformation intermediate product from no3 n to nh4 n vilchez et al 1997 therefore the tin nh4 n and no3 n in the rees wastewater could be effectively removed by the co flocculating microalgae and meet the emission standard in addition the p residue was also detected fig s1 and the concentration was only 3 4 mg l which is slightly higher than that of the emission standard 1 0 mg l gb 26451 2011 furthermore the carbon utilization by the co flocculating microalgae was also analyzed fig s2 which showed that the carbon sources came from inorganic carbon in the rees wastewater accounting for 6 1 and carbon dioxide in the air accounting for 93 9 the microalgae cultivation process would increase the cod content in the rees wastewater but the soluble cod value is less than 59 mg l fig s3 which is lower than the emission standard 70 mg l gb26451 2011 in addition tin removal performance was also compared with other microalgae species under a range of cod n ratio table s4 detailed constituents of different wastewater are shown in table s5 the tin removal efficiency of the co flocculating microalgae could reach up to 90 9 which is 1 9 times than the average removal efficiency 47 9 of previously reported microalgae species in the low cod n ratio range 0 1 besides the tin removal rate of the co flocculation microalgae in the rees wastewater is as high as 12 6 mg l 1 d 1 which is 2 1 times than the average rate 6 0 mg l 1 d 1 of other similar wastewater at the same time the three mentioned common microalgae were also compared in the same rees wastewater the average removal efficiency and rate is only 4 8 and 1 0 mg l 1 d 1 therefore the co flocculating microalgae possessed an excellent n removal ability and the rees wastewater with low ratio of cod n was treated efficiently 3 6 microalgae growth and sedimentation characteristic the removal n from the rees wastewater was converted to biomass of the co flocculating microalgae fig s4 with the continuous n removal from the rees wastewater the biomass of the co flocculating microalgae keeps increased as shown in fig 4a through 15d cultivation the dry weight increased from 1 0 g l to 2 7 g l in addition the co flocculating microalgae showed the growth characteristics of first fast then slow down and reached the highest on the 5th day the biomass productivity of the co flocculating microalgae was calculated to be as high as 107 0 mg l 1 d 1 which is much higher than the average productivity value of the previously reported microalgae 56 9 mg l 1 d 1 in the wastewater with the similar cod n ratio table s4 even compared with the wastewater with higher cod n ratio the productivity of the co flocculating microalgae was also higher than the most of case lipid and triglyceride tag contents of the co flocculating microalgae were measured to evaluate oil production potential hu et al 2008 as shown in fig 4b the contents of lipid and tag reached to be 8 7 w w and 30 1 w w respectively which are among the reported value range wu et al 2014 thus the tin in the rees wastewater was rapidly converted into valuable biomass by the co flocculating microalgae growth during the n removal process the co flocculating microalgae settled into a layer and 99 0 biomass gathered together at the end of 15 d incubation in the rees wastewater this is an interesting characteristic for microalgae species as it implies decreased production cost and reduced energy consumption seo et al 2016 as shown in fig 4c compared with other three common microalgae the co flocculating microalgae achieved the highest settlement ratio 70 5 after 12 h free settlement the settlement ratio of the co flocculating microalgae even reached up to 97 2 at 24 h fig 4 d among the three common microalgae scenedesmus obliquus the same category with one species of the co flocculating microalgae achieved a high settlement ratio 41 3 while chlorella vulgaris achieved the lowest ratio 11 5 the rapid sedimentation characteristics was attributed to the strong flocculation ability which is caused by the formation of co flocculating community structure guo et al 2013 moreover the co flocculating microalgae showed an excellent sedimentation ability in different water environment such as culture medium deionized water and synthetic wastewater fig s5 3 7 the structure analysis of the co flocculating microalgae through algal group identification the co flocculating microalgae were composed of scenedesmus sp and parachlorella sp fig s6 scenedesmus species can produce a large number of eps and then flocculate suspended cells into aggregates self flocculation to be easily harvested mennaa et al 2015 parachlorella species are characterized by a high growth rate and further fast n absorption but possesses poor adhesion to bioreactor surfaces and a low tendency to form aggregates li et al 2013 the co flocculating combination of the two species could be beneficial to the fast n removal and sedimentation harvest scenedesmus sp and parachlorella sp are the similar in size and shape and they gathered with each together to form a co flocculating community fig 5 a meanwhile the algae cells of other common microalgae were totally dispersed fig s7 the co flocculating community structure would lead to the rapid sedimentation of the co flocculating microalgae the two algae species were obviously observed by sem technique fig 5b one kind of microalgae possesses regular lines on its surface which is parachlorella sp fig 5c the other one is scenedesmus sp and abundant eps were covered on the surface fig 5d through three year cultivation in the rees wastewater the abundant eps of the scenedesmus sp appeared which is maybe caused by stress induces effect of the hostile environment jung et al 2015 the two algae species flocculate with each other to form the co flocculating structure fig 5e this co flocculating relationship allows the fast growth and self flocculation sedimentation the eps on the surface of co flocculating microalgae community protect internal cells from direct contact with harmful substances free ammonia and hydrogen ions meanwhile the parachlorella sp cells can rapidly absorb the harmful substances then protect the cells inside community the special structure of the co flocculating microalgae may be improving the tolerance of microalgae towards the high nh4 n and hostile strong acid environment generally most of microalgae species prefer nh4 n than no3 n as the n source wang et al 2016 perez garcia et al 2011 however the above n removal test results showed that the co flocculating microalgae could simultaneously remove the nh4 n and no3 n in the rees wastewater to further reveal the behavior of the obtained co flocculation microalgae another synthetic wastewater the same concentration of nh4 n and no3 n was used to compare the n removal performance under the stationary state and agitation state fig 6 a and b in the stationary state rapid sedimentation phenomenon nh4 n and no3 n were removed simultaneously 49 1 and 83 1 at the fifth day similarly hereinafter which is in consistence with that of the actual rees wastewater however in the agitation state suspension phenomenon the concentration of nh4 n decreased 34 7 but the concentration of no3 n remained nearly unchanged in addition the tin removal efficiency under the agitation situation is only 17 5 at the fifth day which was significantly lower than that of the stationary reactor 65 8 4 conclusions in summary we successfully isolated a novel highly tolerant co flocculating microalgae from the rare earth mine effluent which could remediate the real rees wastewater efficiently and cheaply these results indicated that 1 high tin removal efficiency 90 9 and rate 12 6 mg l 1 d 1 was achieved through the co flocculating microalgae in the rees wastewater with the low cod n ratio 0 025 and the residual concentrations of nh4 n and tin could reach the emission standard gb 26451 2011 2 the special co flocculating community structure lead to the high tolerance towards high nh4 n and strong acid rapid growth and sedimentation and the nh4 n and no3 n simultaneous removal which is beneficial to the high n removal ability this study provides a competitive biological method to treat the high n low cod and or acidic wastewater more importantly the co flocculating microalgae research is expected to be also helpful

18474,acidic rare earth element tailings rees wastewater with high nitrogen and low cod is the most serious and yet unsolved environmental issue in the rare earth mining industry the effective and cheap remediation of nh4 n and no3 n from the rees wastewater is still a huge challenge this harsh wastewater environment results in the difficulty for common microbes and microalgae to be survived in this work a novel highly tolerant co flocculating microalgae the combination of scenedesmus sp and parachlorella sp was successfully isolated from the rare earth mine effluent through three year cultivation the removal efficiency of total inorganic nitrogen tin by the co flocculating microalgae cultivation was as high as 90 9 which is 1 9 times than the average removal efficiency 47 9 of previously reported microalgae species in the wastewater with cod n ratio ranging from 0 to 1 thus the residual concentrations of nh4 n and tin could reach the emission standards of pollutants from rare earths industry gb 26451 2011 along with the high n removal performance other related characteristics of the co flocculating microalgae were also revealed such as high tolerance towards high nh4 n and strong acid rapid growth and sedimentation and simultaneous removal of nh4 n and no3 n these algae characteristics were ascribed to the specific co flocculating community structure covered by extracellular polymeric substances graphical abstract image 1 keywords tailings wastewater acid mining wastewater flocculating microalgae ammonia and nitrate 1 introduction rare earth elements are

mine is as high as 4 000 10 000 m3 d and the number of the tailings can reach up to 200 in ganzhou region of jiangxi province alone china most of the rees wastewater possesses the following characteristics high nh4 n about 50 200 mg l and no3 n usually 10 80 mg l low organic matter less than 10 mg cod l low ph values from 3 5 to 5 high sulfate so4 2 200 700 mg l low concentrations of heavy metals and residual rare earth elements compared with other pollutants the removal of nh4 n and no3 n from the rees wastewater is a priority therefore it is urgent to choose an effective and cheap method to remediate the total inorganic nitrogen tin under the low cod and strong acidic environment chemical oxidation or electro oxidation could only achieve a fast nh4 n removal but a large number of no3 n was remained thus resulting in a low tin removal efficiency perez et al 2010 vendramel et al 2013 various adsorbents have been used to remove nh4 n and no3 n such as zeolites and bamboo powder charcoal jung et al 2004 mizuta et al 2004 however high concentrations of other ions i e so4 2 and cl would interfere and decrease the adsorption performance of the target ions even more important the above two chemical or physicochemical methods are usually expensive and difficult to be implemented in the real rees wastewater biological technique was considered to be an effective and

range 6 5 7 5 in the denitrification process rathnayake et al 2015 zou et al 2016 were needed for the real rees wastewater the use of the activated sludge process required to add large number of organic matter and adjust ph value which certainly would lead to a more complex treatment process and higher operation cost on the other hand to the best of our knowledge until now there is not an effective and low cost method to successfully remediate the real rees wastewater in practical applications recently microalgae treatment methods are popular due to that they can remove n and p pollutants from wastewater and simultaneously produce microalgae biomass as bioresources for biofuel or high value by products beuckels et al 2015 relative to traditional activated sludge process microalgae could efficiently treat various wastewater with more wider c n p ratios chiu et al 2015 even some refractory wastewater can be successfully treated by algal cultivation but the traditional biological techniques required complex pretreatment processes such as dilution and the addition of chemical agents this is due to that the microalgae could tolerate and fast grow in the harsh wastewater environment he et al 2013 and assimilate inorganic carbon as the carbon source martınez et al 2000 mujtaba and lee 2017 for example reverse osmosis concentrate and anaerobic digester effluent can be solved by the algal cultivation and the removal efficiency of nh4 n or no3 n can reach up to 90 0 wang et al 2016 2018 thus it is possible that microalgae can be used to treat the refractory rees wastewater however to the best of our knowledge there are no reports using microalgae to treat the wastewater with severe unbalanced nutrient and strong acidic environment the objectives of this study were to determine a whether a suitable microalgae could survive in the harsh rees wastewater b whether the tin can be efficiently removed from the rees wastewater to reach a lower residual concentration our results demonstrated that a novel highly tolerant co flocculating microalgae was successfully isolated from the rare earth mine effluent and the tin removal efficiency could reach up to 90 9 in addition rapid sedimentation characteristics and co flocculating structure of the obtained microalgae were also revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 rees wastewater the

magnesium chloride sulfate typical heavy metals and residual rare earth elements 2 2 microalgae common similar microalgae strains such as chlorella vulgaris fachb 8 chlorella pyrenoedosa fachb 5 and scenedesmus obliquus fachb 315 were purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology fachb chinese academy of sciences p r china the three microalga species were incubated in sterilized bg 11 medium purchased from hope bio technology qingdao china which contains 250 mg n l 10 mg p l and other macro and micro nutrients the co flocculating microalgae was isolated from the rees effluent in longnan county through three years cultivation in the laboratory a small amount of microalgae was survived at the bottom of the wastewater the microalgae was inoculated into the synthetic culture medium table s1 thus massive co flocculating microalgae was obtained the co flocculating microalgae was identified the detailed process was described in supporting information s1 1 2 3 experimental design all algal assays were conducted in a temperature controlled room qiushi environment company zhejiang province set at 28 c and 60 relative humidity light was provided continuously using white fluorescent tubes with a light intensity of 125 μmol m2 s four assays were conducted as described below assay 1 microalgae incubation and cultivation three algal strains were added separately at 5 v v into erlenmeyer flasks containing bg 11 medium after 25 d of incubation algal cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 5 min and then re suspended in deionized water after 24 h centrifuged again and re suspended in the real rees wastewater and keep the initial concentration of microalgae is 0 5 g l the sedimentation efficiency of microalgae was measured by comparing the concentration at half depth over time the concentration of tin in wastewater was measured after 10 d incubation the above described assay procedure was also followed with the co flocculating microalgae assay 2 microalgae tolerance investigation after the above cultivation in bg 11 medium three common microalgae species and the co flocculating microalgae were incubated in three different kinds of synthetic wastewater respectively the incubation initial concentration is 0 5 g l the wastewater consists of nh4 with different concentrations and 60 mg l p and the ph was adjusted to desired values with hcl or naoh that is ph 7 0 nh4 n 130 mg l ph 3 5 nh4 n 130 mg l ph 3 5 nh4 n 10 mg l the microalgae biomass were determined on the third and sixth day and the growth ratios were also calculated assay 3 p supplementation test k2hpo4 as p source was added into the rees wastewater and the initial p concentrations were controlled to be 0 10 20 40 80 and 160 mg l respectively the co flocculating microalgae with initial concentration of 0 5 g l was added in the above reactors containing different p concentrations the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and p were measured over time and the optimal p concentration was confirmed assay 4 n removal test from the rees wastewater the initial concentration of the supplemented p is 60 mg l the removal efficiency

basic ic plus metrohm switzerland with an sh ac 3 column 4 250 mm the ph values were obtained with a ph meter inesa china the morphologies of the co flocculating microalgae cells were acquired using scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan total lipids were extracted with a chloroform methanol 1 1 v v mixed solvent and quantified gravimetrically bligh and dbliyer 1959 the extracted lipids were dissolved in 1 0 ml isopropyl alcohol and the triacylglycerol tag were measured by the enzymatic colorimetric method bligh and dbliyer 1959 using commercial kits purchased from nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china algal samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters welch china and then dried at 105 c for 24 h thus the dry weight of algal biomass was obtained 3 result and discussion 3 1 rees wastewater characteristics table 1 shows the characteristics of the rees wastewater compared with low cod value about 6 mg l and low concentrations of heavy metals and rare earth elements table s2 the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were as high as 125 4 mg l and 84 5 mg l respectively hence nitrogen including nh4 n and no3 n was predominant constituent of the rees wastewater and was also the target pollutant especially high concentration of nh4 n may inhibit the microalgae growth park et al 2010 perez garcia et al 2011 the ph value of the wastewater is 3 5 which is far below the normal range for traditional nitrification and denitrification processes 6 5 7 5 rathnayake et al 2015 zou et al 2016 and also below the general tolerance ability of common microalgae 6 9 bartley et al 2014 moreover p concentration was less than 0 01 mg l much lower than the empirical proportions c n p 100 5 1 this severe unbalanced nutritional composition and hostile strong acid environment result in the difficulty for common microalgae to be survived in addition the high salt concentration such as sulfate and chloride possibly leads to the massive secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps due to stress induces jung et al 2015 the specific rees wastewater environment would be beneficial to the algae acclimation and special functional algae was possible to be obtained 3 2 the co flocculating microalgae isolated from the rees effluent due to the severe unbalanced nutrient and hostile strong acid common microalgae species cannot adapt this rees wastewater environment thus almost none microalgae were observed in the freshly collected wastewater the rees wastewater was hermetically cultivated in a light incubator at constant temperature and a small amount of nutrients were supplemented the sample almost remained unchanged in the first two years in the third year at the bottom of sample bottle a small amount of microalgae was observed then the microalgae was inoculated in the culture medium to be amplified and a lot of microalgae appeared therefore after three year natural domestication the co flocculating microalgae was successfully isolated from the rees effluent through identification the co flocculating microalgae were composed of scenedesmus sp and parachlorella sp the high concentration of nh4 n and no3 n endow the co flocculating microalgae possess a strong ability to assimilate the n and then the cell grow after 15 d of incubation 90 1 of tin in the rees wastewater were removed and n removal rate could be as high as 12 6 mg l 1 d 1 in addition the biomass productivity was as high as 107 0 mg l 1 d 1 3 3 tolerance of the co flocculating microalgae to investigate the tolerance of the co flocculating microalgae three common microalga species and the co flocculating microalga were incubated in undiluted rees wastewater under the same condition after 10 d cultivation the co flocculating microalgae achieved the highest removal efficiency of tin 11 0 fig 1 a however three common microalga showed relatively low tin removal ability chlorella vulgaris achieved the lowest tin removal efficiency 2 8 and scenedesmus obliquus achieved 8 3 tin removal efficiency from fig 1b the color of common microalgae turned from the green to yellow and the co flocculating microalgae kept it bright green color these results demonstrated that the co flocculating microalgae possesses superior tolerance than other microalgae species when cultivated in the rees wastewater to further study the tolerance of the co flocculating microalgae in the rees wastewater three kinds of synthetic wastewater with different ph and nh4 n was used to culture these microalgae species as shown in fig 1c in the high concentration of nh4 n wastewater with neutral or acidic condition the growth ratio of co flocculating microalgae increased at 5 0 in the 6 days however the ratios of other three common microalgae all decreased 4 3 8 2 in addition the growth ratio of the co flocculating microalgae in the acidic wastewater was higher than that in neutral condition which is due to the increase of free ammonia nh3 under more h environment that have uncoupling effect on the photosynthetic processes lin et al 2007 park et al 2010 on the other hand in the acidic and low nh4 n wastewater only the growth ratio of chlorella vulgaris was decreased these results demonstrated that high nh4 n particularly free ammonia in the rees wastewater is the most important factor that inhibits the growth of microalgae species 3 4 the optimization of p concentration although the co flocculating microalgae possesses high tolerance ability in the rees wastewater the tin removal efficiency of the co flocculating microalgae was only 11 0 within 10 d incubation corresponding to a mean n removal rate of 2 1 mg n d the tin removal rate is much lower than previously reported rates of other microalgae treating high n wastewater 6 5 20 mg n d wang et al 2016 2018 in order to improve the removal efficiency of the co flocculating microalgae many optimized methods such as the addition of carbon dioxide stirring and so on were tried but the resultant performance was not obviously improved even decreased empirically p element could account for 0 9 in the microalgae molecular formula of c106h263o110n16p xu et al 2006 considering p concentration was even lower than 0 01 mg l in the rees wastewater table 1 the lack of p was considered to be the main factor of the low n removal efficiency therefore different concentrations of p were added in the rees wastewater to test the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and no3 n as shown in fig 2 a the nh4 n removal efficiency increased from 22 4 to 99 6 with the p dose increased from 10 to 80 mg l when the p dose was increased to 160 mg l the nh4 n was completely removed and treatment time was shortened from 29 d to 17 d with the p supplemented the no3 n removal also showed the similar tendency with the nh4 n fig 2b the removal efficiency of no3 n increased from 4 1 to 99 5 with the p dose was increased from 0 to 80 mg l at a p dose of 160 mg l the no3 n was almost completely removed only by the 13 d of incubation therefore p supplement could greatly improve the removal efficiency of nh4 n and no3 n simultaneously although p could promote the removal of nh4 n and no3 n too much p would lead to p residue which would cause the eutrophication in receiving waters dodds and smith 2016 as shown in fig 2c the p residues scarcely appeared in the added p concentration from 10 to 40 mg l but the nh4 n and no3 n were not completely removed through 29 d cultivation high concentrations of p are indeed beneficial to the removal of nh4 n and no3 n by the co flocculating microalgae cultivation but the p residue would be more serious when the supplemented p dosage was 80 mg l the residual p concentration was 25 6 mg l and the p residues could be as high as 78 7 mg l at the supplemented p 160 mg l therefore a suitable n p ratio need to be confirmed the residual concentrations of n and p were plotted as the supplemented p concentration fig 2d the supplemented p concentration at a dose of about 60 mg l could result in relatively low levels of both n and p concentration in the treated wastewater therefore 60 mg l p source was added in the subsequent experiments 3 5 n removal performance in the rees wastewater based on the optimal p concentration 60 mg l the initial concentration of the co flocculating microalgae was also investigated table s3 and the optimal concentration 1 0 g l was obtained under the optimal conditions the concentrations of different n types tin nh4 n no3 n and no2 n in the rees wastewater through the co flocculating microalgae cultivation were measured and the results are shown in fig 3 the tin removal efficiency was as high as 90 9 after 15 d treatment and the residual concentration was 19 1 mg l which is much lower than the required value 30 mg l of emission standards of pollutants from rare earths industry gb 26451 2011 the nh4 n was removed at 88 4 and its residual concentration was 14 5 mg l which is also lower than the emission standard of 15 mg l the no3 n was simultaneously removed by the co flocculating microalgae cultivation and the removal efficiency could be as high as 94 7 meanwhile low concentration of no2 n 0 4 1 4 mg l was detected between 7 and 11 d of incubation which is the transformation intermediate product from no3 n to nh4 n vilchez et al 1997 therefore the tin nh4 n and no3 n in the rees wastewater could be effectively removed by the co flocculating microalgae and meet the emission standard in addition the p residue was also detected fig s1 and the concentration was only 3 4 mg l which is slightly higher than that of the emission standard 1 0 mg l gb 26451 2011 furthermore the carbon utilization by the co flocculating microalgae was also analyzed fig s2 which showed that the carbon sources came from inorganic carbon in the rees wastewater accounting for 6 1 and carbon dioxide in the air accounting for 93 9 the microalgae cultivation process would increase the cod content in the rees wastewater but the soluble cod value is less than 59 mg l fig s3 which is lower than the emission standard 70 mg l gb26451 2011 in addition tin removal performance was also compared with other microalgae species under a range of cod n ratio table s4 detailed constituents of different wastewater are shown in table s5 the tin removal efficiency of the co flocculating microalgae could reach up to 90 9 which is 1 9 times than the average removal efficiency 47 9 of previously reported microalgae species in the low cod n ratio range 0 1 besides the tin removal rate of the co flocculation microalgae in the rees wastewater is as high as 12 6 mg l 1 d 1 which is 2 1 times than the average rate 6 0 mg l 1 d 1 of other similar wastewater at the same time the three mentioned common microalgae were also compared in the same rees wastewater the average removal efficiency and rate is only 4 8 and 1 0 mg l 1 d 1 therefore the co flocculating microalgae possessed an excellent n removal ability and the rees wastewater with low ratio of cod n was treated efficiently 3 6 microalgae growth and sedimentation characteristic the removal n from the rees wastewater was converted to biomass of the co flocculating microalgae fig s4 with the continuous n removal from the rees wastewater the biomass of the co flocculating microalgae keeps increased as shown in fig 4a through 15d cultivation the dry weight increased from 1 0 g l to 2 7 g l in addition the co flocculating microalgae showed the growth characteristics of first fast then slow down and reached the highest on the 5th day the biomass productivity of the co flocculating microalgae was calculated to be as high as 107 0 mg l 1 d 1 which is much higher than the average productivity value of the previously reported microalgae 56 9 mg l 1 d 1 in the wastewater with the similar cod n ratio table s4 even compared with the wastewater with higher cod n ratio the productivity of the co flocculating microalgae was also higher than the most of case lipid and triglyceride tag contents of the co flocculating microalgae were measured to evaluate oil production potential hu et al 2008 as shown in fig 4b the contents of lipid and tag reached to be 8 7 w w and 30 1 w w respectively which are among the reported value range wu et al 2014 thus the tin in the rees wastewater was rapidly converted into valuable biomass by the co flocculating microalgae growth during the n removal process the co flocculating microalgae settled into a layer and 99 0 biomass gathered together at the end of 15 d incubation in the rees wastewater this is an interesting characteristic for microalgae species as it implies decreased production cost and reduced energy consumption seo et al 2016 as shown in fig 4c compared with other three common microalgae the co flocculating microalgae achieved the highest settlement ratio 70 5 after 12 h free settlement the settlement ratio of the co flocculating microalgae even reached up to 97 2 at 24 h fig 4 d among the three common microalgae scenedesmus obliquus the same category with one species of the co flocculating microalgae achieved a high settlement ratio 41 3 while chlorella vulgaris achieved the lowest ratio 11 5 the rapid sedimentation characteristics was attributed to the strong flocculation ability which is caused by the formation of co flocculating community structure guo et al 2013 moreover the co flocculating microalgae showed an excellent sedimentation ability in different water environment such as culture medium deionized water and synthetic wastewater fig s5 3 7 the structure analysis of the co flocculating microalgae through algal group identification the co flocculating microalgae were composed of scenedesmus sp and parachlorella sp fig s6 scenedesmus species can produce a large number of eps and then flocculate suspended cells into aggregates self flocculation to be easily harvested mennaa et al 2015 parachlorella species are characterized by a high growth rate and further fast n absorption but possesses poor adhesion to bioreactor surfaces and a low tendency to form aggregates li et al 2013 the co flocculating combination of the two species could be beneficial to the fast n removal and sedimentation harvest scenedesmus sp and parachlorella sp are the similar in size and shape and they gathered with each together to form a co flocculating community fig 5 a meanwhile the algae cells of other common microalgae were totally dispersed fig s7 the co flocculating community structure would lead to the rapid sedimentation of the co flocculating microalgae the two algae species were obviously observed by sem technique fig 5b one kind of microalgae possesses regular lines on its surface which is parachlorella sp fig 5c the other one is scenedesmus sp and abundant eps were covered on the surface fig 5d through three year cultivation in the rees wastewater the abundant eps of the scenedesmus sp appeared which is maybe caused by stress induces effect of the hostile environment jung et al 2015 the two algae species flocculate with each other to form the co flocculating structure fig 5e this co flocculating relationship allows the fast growth and self flocculation sedimentation the eps on the surface of co flocculating microalgae community protect internal cells from direct contact with harmful substances free ammonia and hydrogen ions meanwhile the parachlorella sp cells can rapidly absorb the harmful substances then protect the cells inside community the special structure of the co flocculating microalgae may be improving the tolerance of microalgae towards the high nh4 n and hostile strong acid environment generally most of microalgae species prefer nh4 n than no3 n as the n source wang et al 2016 perez garcia et al 2011 however the above n removal test results showed that the co flocculating microalgae could simultaneously remove the nh4 n and no3 n in the rees wastewater to further reveal the behavior of the obtained co flocculation microalgae another synthetic wastewater the same concentration of nh4 n and no3 n was used to compare the n removal performance under the stationary state and agitation state fig 6 a and b in the stationary state rapid sedimentation phenomenon nh4 n and no3 n were removed simultaneously 49 1 and 83 1 at the fifth day similarly hereinafter which is in consistence with that of the actual rees wastewater however in the agitation state suspension phenomenon the concentration of nh4 n decreased 34 7 but the concentration of no3 n remained nearly unchanged in addition the tin removal efficiency under the agitation situation is only 17 5 at the fifth day which was significantly lower than that of the stationary reactor 65 8 4 conclusions in summary we successfully isolated a novel highly tolerant co flocculating microalgae from the rare earth mine effluent which could remediate the real rees wastewater efficiently and cheaply these results indicated that 1 high tin removal efficiency 90 9 and rate 12 6 mg l 1 d 1 was achieved through the co flocculating microalgae in the rees wastewater with the low cod n ratio 0 025 and the residual concentrations of nh4 n and tin could reach the emission standard gb 26451 2011 2 the special co flocculating community structure lead to the high tolerance towards high nh4 n and strong acid rapid growth and sedimentation and the nh4 n and no3 n simultaneous removal which is beneficial to the high n removal ability this study provides a competitive biological method to treat the high n low cod and or acidic wastewater more importantly the co flocculating microalgae research is expected to be also helpful
