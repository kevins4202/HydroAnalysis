13750,electrocoagulation ec dephosphorization kinetics plays an important role in design and amplification of ec reactors for phosphate removal however the existing ec dephosphorization kinetic models including both statistical model and adsorption model fail to establish a direct law between the electric field characteristics and the dephosphorization process which limit their efficient applications in practice in this study three classic adsorption isotherm models i e langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich model were compared to describe the phosphorus adsorption in ec reactor the experimental data is better fitted with langmuir model than the other two models indicating that adsorbed molecules are monolayered dispersed afterwards an advanced ec dephosphorization kinetic

concentration mol l 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec is an popular electrochemical process in water treatment in the process polynuclear hydroxyl complexes and hydroxides form by dissolving metal anodes in water under the applied electric field in this way colloid substances and dissolved organic compounds are removed from water through coagulation and adsorption 1 4 compared with other chemical and biological methods ec has many advantages including simple structural equipment no consumption of chemicals easy controlled reaction process by adjusting current and voltage high degradation rate of multiple contaminants therefore ec process has been widely used in water and wastewater treatment 1 3 5 the discharge of laundry wastewater through downspout is one of the most common sources of water pollution in china due to the lack of sanitary sewers the wastewater from washing machine is usually discharged through storm water sewers therefore the laundry wastewater with high phosphorous content transports directly into the surface water body such as river and lake which exacerbates the eutrophication 6 7 a number of previous studies have proved that phosphorus can be effectively removed by ec reactor 6 8 with regard to the effects on the phosphorus removal performance and energy consumption the design and operation of ec dephosphorization reactor has been paid much attention currently most ec dephosphorization reactors are designed and amplified following ec dephosphorization kinetics 9 however due to the limitation of the existing dephosphorization kinetics model it is difficult to realize the key parameters optimization previous studies have shown that the removal of phosphorus in aquatic enviroment by ec mainly depends on the adsorption of a13 fe3 and hydroxides flocculates produced by anode electrolysis 4 5 10 based on this mechanism different adsorption isotherm models were introduced to describe the process of ec dephosphorization vasudevan et al 11 simulated the process of phosphorus removal of drinking water by ec using langmuir and freundlich isotherm models respectively results confirmed that the langmuir model was better than the freundlich model and proved that the ec dephosphorization process followed the second order kinetics akbay et al 12 obtained similar conclusion in a full scale ec dephosphorization reactor using langmuir adsorption model janpoor et al 5 also stimulated phosphorus removal successfully in the ec reactor for treating laundry wastewater and confirmed that the ec dephosphorization follows the second order kinetics during the ec process the transfer of material and electron between the plate surface and the solution is one of the key factors affecting the ec reaction 3 13 under the condition of constant plate spacing the production of metal cation in solution after ec anode electrolysis is directly controlled by the current density 14 although some achievements have been made in the study of ec dephosphorization kinetics the existing models can only represent the effect of electric field characteristics on the reaction rate indirectly by changing of adsorption equilibrium constant and adsorption capacity 13 despite that the current density essentially influences the dephosphorization quantitative research work is limited and the relationship still remains unclear moreover the dephosphorization process under the applied electric field has not been fully simulated in existing models in this study an improved ec dephosphorization kinetic model was developed by combining faraday s law which describes the process of ec anode electrolysis to produce metal ions and the selected adsorption isotherm model in addition the effects of initial phosphorous concentration current density and plate spacing on the newly developed ec dephosphorization kinetic model were analyzed establishment of such model enables a more systematic approach to guide ec reactor design and facilitate the scaling up of industrial bench scale reactors 2 material and methods 2 1 electrocoagulation apparatus experiments were performed in a bench scale batch reactor with four aluminum electrodes fig 1 the working volume of each batch was 3 l 150 mm 150 mm 150 mm both electrodes anode and cathode made of aluminium were cuboid in shape 100 mm 80 mm 2 mm constant current was maintained using a potentiostat in intensiostat mode magnetic stirring at 200 rpm was used to maintain a homogeneous solution in the batch reactor 2 2 experimental procedure in order to improve the ec dephosphorization model faraday s law was coupled with an adsorption isotherm model selected from three classic models of langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich model simulation results obtained from the adsorption isotherm models were compared with experimental results in order to determine the optimal one the effects of different current densities 1 ma cm2 3ma cm2 5ma cm2 7ma cm2 plate spacing 0 5 cm 1 cm 1 5 cm 2 cm and initial phosphorous concentrations 12 mg l 24 mg l 36 mg l 48 mg l on key parameters of our newly developed ec dephosphorization model current efficiency and isotherm model constants were investigated response surface methodology rsm based on box behnken design was used to obtain the compound functional relationship between current efficiency and current density plate spacing initial concentration the response surface was designed by design expert the current density plate spacing and initial concentration were selected as independent variables the current efficiency in the ec process was used as the response value to conduct quadratic regression laundry wastewater from washing machine were used in these experiments the cod concentration was 150 20 mg l and the phosphorous concentration was 6 1 mg l analytical reagent kh2po4 were added to adjust the initial phosphorous concentration during experiment the water temperature was controlled at 20 1 standard method was adopted to measure the phosphorus concentration during the experiment 15 the sample was digested using the nitric acid sulfuric acid method then phosphorus concentration was determined by vanadomolybdo phosphoric acid spectrophotometry the concentration of al3 was determined by atomic absorption spectrometric determination 15 the current efficiency is defined as follows 1 φ a l t a l t h e o where al t is the total aluminum dosage liberated from the anodes which can be measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer al theo is the theoretical concentration of al liberated from anode which can be calculated by the following equation according to faraday s law 2 a l t h e o nit zfv here n is the number of cells i is the applied current z is the valence of the metal of the electrode for al f is faraday s constant v is the volume of the solution t is the retention time 2 3 adsorption isotherm model based on the mechanism of ec dephosphorization phosphorous abatement can be modeled from the adsorption phenomenon 16 therefore the adsorption isotherm model can be used to describe the ec process langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm model are three traditional models used in ec dephosphorization process simulation 9 17 18 the equations are given as below 3 langmuir isotherm q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e 4 freundlich isotherm q e k f c e 1 n 5 dubinin radushkevich isotherm q e q max e k d r t ln 1 1 c e 2 where q e is the saturated equilibrium adsorption capacity of phosphate radical q max is the maximum adsorption capacity of phosphate radical c e is the phosphate concentration in solution after equilibrium adsorption r is the gas constant t is absolute temperature kl is langmuir constant kf and n are freundlich parameters kd is dubinin radushkevich parameter the adsorption isotherms experiments were performed with initial phosphate concentrations ranging from 6 to 150 mg l or actual production of aluminum ion ranging from 0 1 to 1 5 g at 20 the regression approach was employed to obtain the isotherms parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of different isotherm models langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich isotherm were used to simulate the results which are shown in fig 2 the langmuir isotherm better simulated the adsorption behavior of ec generated flocs to phosphorus than dubinin radushkevich and freundlich isotherm indicating that the ec phosphorus adsorption followed the single molecular layer adsorption 11 3 2 model development the saturated adsorption capacity of phosphate group in batch test can be gained from the following equation 6 q e c 0 c e v m t where c0 is the initial phosphate concentration in water when adsorption begins v is the volume of the batch reactor mt is the actual production of aluminum ion when the content of al3 in water is low the rate of generating al3 by ec is the limiting step of phosphate radical removal which follows faraday s law 19 therefore the removal rate of phosphate radical in water can be expressed as 7 d c t dt φ m φ ni zfv q e where ct is the concentration of phosphate at t time φm is the efficiency of aluminum hydroxide hydrate formation φ is the current efficiency n is the number of cells i is the applied current z is the valence of the metal of the electrode for al f is faraday s constant v is the volume of the solution the efficiency of aluminum hydroxide hydrate formation is calculated as 8 φ m 1 al d al t here al d is the dissolved al3 concentration al t is the total aluminum dosage liberated from the anodes it was commonly reported spontaneous hydrolysis reactions occur immediately when aluminum ions al d is dissolved which generate aluminum hydroxide hydrate al oh 3 species predominate in the aqueous solution when ph ranges from 4 to 12 20 considering that wastewater of mildly alkaline was used in this study dissolved aluminum ions al d were almost absent and therefore φm can be simplified as 1 0 combing eq 7 with the langmuir isotherm model yields a new ec dephosphorization kinetic model 21 9 d c t dt φ 5i 3fv q max k l c t 1 k l c t 3 3 effect of current density the effect of current density on key parameters of our ec dephosphorization combined model was investigated it can be seen from fig 3 a and b that qmax and kl almost remained stable with the increase of current density indicating that current density had no significant effect on langmuir isotherm parameters however the current efficiency φ gradually decreased as enhanced current density negative linear correlation r2 0 991 was obtained between current density and current efficiency similar results were reported by zini et al 20 the increase of current density suppressed the current efficiency in this experiment on one hand reduction of the current efficiency in this experiment can be attributed to the secondary reactions such as the formation of cl2 eq 10 22 on the other the protective layers formed on the electrode surface eq 11 can also decrease the current efficiency 23 25 the deposition of the oxide layer and the hydroxide layer mainly contributes to the formation of protective layer the relevant chemical processes occurred on the electrode surface were shown as below 10 anode 2c l aq c l 2 g 2 e 2c l aq h 2 o l hoc l aq h aq c l aq hoc l aq h aq oc l aq cathode 4o h aq 2 h 2 o l o 2 g 4 e 11

aq hydroxide o2 g oxygen gas al 0 aluminum al oh 3 s aluminium hydroxide al2o3 s aluminium oxide when the current density was relatively small lower than 7 ma cm2 in this experiment the current efficiency was larger than 1 0 26 28 this phenomenon can be explained by the pitting corrosion which is a type of localized corrosion caused by reactive anions attacking the passive layer on the electrode surface 26 29 taking the chloride ions as an example which are commonly found in reactive anions the relevant pitting corrosion reaction occurred on the surface of al electrode can be expressed as 12 2a l s 6hc l a q 2 a l c l 3 a 1 3 h 2 g 2alc l 3 a q 6 h 2 o l 2 a l o h 3 s 6hc l a q where al s aluminum hcl aq hydrochloric acid alcl3 aq aluminium chloride h2 g hydrogen gas therefore we should adjust the electrical current density to an optimum range in order to extend the lifespan of the electrodes 3 4 effect of initial phosphorous concentration the key parameters of the combined model of ec dephosphorization under different initial phosphorous concentration were studied the initial concentration of phosphorus had little impact on the parameters of the isotherms parameters while it affected the value of current efficiency greater current efficiency φ was obtained under higher phosphorus concentration also the current efficiency φ was positively linearly related to the initial phosphorous concentration fig 4 this positive correlation between the initial phosphorous concentration and the current efficiency can be attributed to the reduction of some undesired electrode reactions the aqueous solution under variable initial phosphorous concentration have different resistivity and conductivity higher initial phosphorous concentration leads to lower solution resistance and thus lower cell voltage which then may reduce the extent of some undesired electrode reactions and result in a higher current efficiency 30 3 5 effect of plate spacing fig 5 showed that the effect of plate spacing on key parameters of combined model simulation of the combined model analysis showed the kl and qmax had little change in parameters as plate spacing increased from 0 5 cm to 2 0 cm while the current efficiency φ had the tendency to increase first and then decrease generally the resistivity between plates was proportional to the plate spacing while the current efficiency between plates was inversely proportional to plate spacing 31 however when the plate spacing was relatively small less than 1 5 cm the bubbles and flocculates generated by the electrolysis of plates was unable to be transmitted out quickly as the plate spacing decreasing this accelerated the passivation of plates and increased the resistivity between plates leading to the reduction of the current efficiency between plates and the production rate of aluminum ions when the plate spacing exceeded 1 5 cm the mass transfer limitation of flocculation and bubble no longer occurred in the reactor further increasing the plate spacing inevitably increased the resistivity between plates and reduced the plate current efficiency which also hindered the production of aluminum ions 3 6 the compound functional relationship between φ and affecting factors by comparing the key parameters qmax kl and φ of the combined model under various current densities initial phosphorous concentrations and plate spacing it was observed that the parameters except φ were insensitive to these factors under the experimental conditions to further investigate the integrated influence on the current efficiency φ in the combined model 3 factors response surface methodology rsm using box behnken design was employed to study the compound functional relationship of efficiency φ with three selected parameters i e current density plate spacing and initial concentration the anova table and response value of φ are showed in tables 1 and 2 through the response surface method the functional expression of current efficiency φ and current density j plate spacing d initial concentration of water inlet c0 are shown as below 13 φ 1 131 0 222 j 0 011 c0 1 075 d 1 891e 3 j c0 0 049 j d 1 848e 3 c0 d 5 596e 3 j2 1 135e 4 c0 2 0 436 d2 where e is the natural exponential the value of e is equal to approximately 2 71828 based on the anova data values of prob f greater than 0 1000 indicate that the model terms are not significant hence these terms were regarded as constant in eq 13 considering the values were much smaller than the other terms eq 13 was further simplified as 14 φ 1 131 0 222 j 0 0114 c0 1 075 d 0 049 j d 0 436 d2 the determination coefficient r2 of the response surface was 0 9649 the signal to noise ratio s n 17 002 4 indicating that the prediction result of our model is reliable fig 6 3 7 ec reaction kinetic model by coupling of langmuir adsorption isotherm model and faraday s law with the previously obtained parameters of langmuir isothermal adsorption model and the expressions of current efficiency φ the kinetic model of total phosphorus degradation by ec reaction under the coupling model can be obtained as below 15 d c t dt 1 131 0 222 j 0 0114 c 0 1 075 d 0 049 j d 0 436 d 2 5i 3fv q max k l c t 1 k l c t the values of kl and qmax changed little in this study therefore the values in optimum condition j 5 ma cm2 d 1 cm t 298 k was used in eq 15 the simulation results were compared with the experimental results and the average relative error was calculated to evaluate the simulation accuracy fig 7 the relative error of the model simulations were less than 5 this indicated that the kinetic model of ec phosphorus removal established in this study was reasonable and effective and can be used to simulate and analyze the removal of total phosphorus of laundry wastewater in ec reactor 4 conclusion in this study a kinetic model of ec dephosphorization was developed by combining faraday s law with the selected adsorption isotherm model i e langmuir adsorption isotherm model which fit well with the experimental results the key parameters of the model qmax and kl did not change with current density j plate spacing d and initial phosphorous concentration c0 the relationship between current efficiency φ and current density j plate spacing d and initial phosphorous concentration c0 is φ 1 131 0 222 j 0 0114 c0 1 075 d 0 049 j d 0 436 d2 the new model directly established the relationship between electric field characteristics and phosphorus removal process and successfully simulated the dephosphorization process occurred in laundry wastewater with the relative error less than 5 the model can be used to guide the optimal design of ec reactor declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13751,the objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of a greywater treatment plant composed of an upflow anaerobic filter followed by a vertical constructed wetland and to assess the microbial risk resulting from the non potable reuse of its effluent the microbial risk posed by selected pathogens rotavirus campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp through the ingestion of aerosols during toilet flushing or garden irrigation was investigated using the qmra approach according to the brazilian water reuse technical standards the monitored greywater treatment plant was not able to consistently produce reclaimed water with satisfactory quality for reuse moreover although the treatment plant produced an effluent that achieved the usepa recommended level of 10 4pppy for the risk of infection posed by campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp the risk posed by rotavirus was above this threshold the monitoring data and the qmra outcomes showed that a post treatment including sand filtration and chlorination was essential to produce reclaimed water presenting a risk of infection below 10 4 for all evaluated target pathogens the qmra was very useful to evaluate and compare different levels of treatment applied to greywater reuse based on similar assumptions it was also concluded that the use of e coli does not appear to be appropriate to assess the risk of infection in greywater reuse systems keywords greywater reuse anaerobic filter vertical constructed wetland qmra toilet flushing garden irrigation 1 introduction among many alternative water sources greywater presents great potential for potable water savings and consequently reduction of domestic wastewater generation in residential and commercial buildings 1 greywater gw consists of a combination of wastewater streams from various water consumption points of a building due to the great variation in the quality of this type of water according to the polluting load it can be classified as light greywater that comes from a bathtub shower washbasin and washing machine and dark greywater produced in the kitchen washing machine dishes shower and washbasin ramona 2004 moreover the volume of greywater produced in residential buildings was observed to be sufficient to satisfy the non potable domestic demand such as toilet flushing and garden irrigation which accounted for about 35 of the total domestic demand 2 therefore according to ghaitidak and yadav 3 greywater is locally available and normally requires low cost treatment to produce water of appropriate quality for reuse in garden irrigation and toilet flushing although greywater does not include wastewater from toilet bowls the presence of pathogenic microorganisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus legionella clostridia cryptosporidium spp giardia sp rotavirus have been previously reported 4 6 this is likely to be caused by the introduction of microorganisms during showering hand washing clothes washing etc 7 pyrosequencing analysis and real time pcr revealed that the microbiota from the laundry effluent was dominated by skin associated bacteria such as staphylococcus corynebacterium and propionibacterium 8 previous studies undertaken in many countries have shown that untreated greywater presents relatively high levels of organic matter sulphates suspended solids and fecal contamination 9 which can generate unpleasant odor and pose a microbial risk to users 10 11 moreover previous research suggested that toilet plume could play a contributory role in the transmission of infectious diseases 12 therefore the reuse of untreated and insufficiently treated greywater is not recommended guidelines to regulate and control greywater reuse have been developed in countries that use quality standards as part of their water conservation and management tools and policy strategies however there has not been a consensus on the water quality standards for reuse yet and most countries have adopted a set of water quality criteria from the world health organization guidelines 13 or the australian guidelines for water recycling 14 or united states environmental protection agency usepa epa 600 r 12 618 15 in brazil new technical standards for characterization design use operation and maintenance of alternative non potable water systems in buildings have been developed and proposed by a committee in 2018 16 these standards consider the non potable use of alternative water sources for various purposes such as toilet and urinal flushing courtyard and outdoor areas washing irrigation for landscape purposes garden irrigation etc the new standards established limits for various water quality parameters such as e coli 200 nmp 100 m l 1 turbidity 5 ntu biochemical oxygen demand bod 20 mg l 1 and free chlorine range between 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 constructed wetlands cw have been proven to be an efficient low cost greywater treatment system based on physicochemical processes and interactions of plants and microorganisms to remove pollutants 17 18 besides their low investment and operation cost they can produce high quality effluent with low dissipation of energy and are simple to operate among the various configurations of wetlands vertical constructed wetlands vfcw were reported to be the most efficient in reducing the concentration of organic matter and suspended solids from greywater 19 however these processes present limited efficiency in reducing microbial contamination producing effluents with a relatively high density of thermotolerant coliform 100 to 1000 mpn 100 m l 1 20 in order to improve pathogen inactivation an additional disinfection step to the wetland system e g chlorination or uv has been employed 21 the efficiency of chlorination to kill pathogenic bacteria in greywater relies on greywater quality such as turbidity presence of organics and particles that might protect pathogenic bacteria from the action of chlorine 22 according to arden and ma 19 a chlorine dosage of 100 mg l 1 min 1 or uv dosage of 100 mj cm 2 min 1 is likely to be appropriate for meeting all microbiological parameters presented in the usepa and western australia guidelines if organics are sufficiently removed from gw quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a useful and widely accepted tool for evaluating and ranking microbial risk associated to specific pathogens considering different scenarios 23 although the assessment is performed based on several assumptions which normally results in large variation and uncertainty the qmra approach has been widely applied in the water sector to support decision and policymakers these include vegetable irrigation 24 25 toilet flushing 11 26 garden irrigation 6 27 car washing 28 dishwashing 29 and recreational activities 30 different water reuse proposals can be associated with several microbial transmission routes and result in different volumes of water ingested during each exposure event aerosols generated from reclaimed water that possibly contains enteric pathogens may increase the risk of infections 31 benami et al 5 observed that greywater treatment plant gwtp with aerated processes produces aerosols that may be hazardous to human health if inhaled ingested or come in contact with skin blanky et al 6 stated that the two main options for gw reuse toilet flushing and garden irrigation generate hazardous aerosols although the qrma performed by benami et al 5 and blanky et al 6 indicate that the ingestion of aerosols with staphylococcus aureus and legionella offers a low risk of contamination this route of contamination remains a concern due to the presence of enteric viruses in treated greywaters the objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of a greywater treatment plant and to assess the microbial risk resulting from the non potable reuse of its effluent the greywater treatment plant consisted of an upflow anaerobic filter followed by vertical constructed wetlands vfcw the need for an additional post treatment consisting of pressure sand filter followed by chlorination to improve the reclaimed water quality was also evaluated the microbial risk was assessed considering two alternatives for non potable water reuse toilet flushing and garden irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 greywater quality monitoring program this research was undertaken in vitoria brazil latitude 20 16 18 s longitude 40 18 24 w using data collected from an experimental greywater treatment plant gwtp installed at federal university of espírito santo ufes this gwtp was designed to treat greywater generated in a local building which was occupied by sixteen people at the time the tests started 4 months after the start up of the treatment system and lasted 12 months greywater consisted of three streams including washbasin 7 shower 29 and washing machine 64 that were collected and combined into a single greywater mixture and diverted to a reservoir by gravity fig 1 from this reservoir greywater was pumped to the gwtp which the main design and operational characteristics are shown in table 1 the gwtp consisted of a sieve with a 2 mm opening an upflow anaerobic filter with a granular bed volume of 540 l width 0 6 m length 0 6 m height 1 5 m and a vfcw with bed volume of 1 54 m3 width 1 17 m length 2 19 m height 0 6 m from the lower reservoir 180 l capacity the gw was pumped to the uaf through a centrifugal pump 1 4 cv the effluent from the uaf was stored in a flow equalizing tank 500 l capacity which distributed the liquid to the vfcw through a peristaltic pump controlled by a digital timer the uaf worked as a pre treatment for gw aiming at the removal of ss and cod although the concentration of these parameters in light gw are lower than those of municipal wastewater in this research we sought to assess whether their removal would result in an advanced redox condition in the vfcw that would allow the production of an effluent with turbidity less than 5 0 ntu this would be a strategy similar to that used in vertical recycling flow constructed wetlands rvfcw in which the recirculation flow increases aerobic conditions in the granular environment of wetlands according to the bibliographic review carried out by arden and ma 19 rvfcws are the only type of cw capable of consistently producing a treated effluent with turbidity below 5 0 ntu the hlr applied to uaf was superior to that of vfcw because it was also used to simultaneously feed another cw horizontal from another research the vfcw was filled with 0 4 m of height of coarse sand 0 6 to 2 0 mm and 0 2 m of height with gravel 4 8 to 9 5 mm the feed pipe had a diameter of 50 mm being arranged on the surface of the vfcw over the gravel in the form of a fishbone perforated with holes diameter 10 mm and spaced 30 cm the bottom of the vfcw had a slope of 2 to allow the gravitational flow of treated effluent the specie used in the vfcw was equisetum hyemale which is endemic in the south american continent and recognized as a slow growing plant the choice of this plant had two objectives that the periodic maintenance of the vfcw was carried out with low frequency and that the treatment process also had an ornamental function the first objective requires plants with low growth rates whose roots do not cause clogging of the support medium over time as for the second objective this plant is widely accepted as an ornamental plant in brazil its appearance varies from light green to gray green and consists of fragments of linear leaves and fluted stems the main stems are about 0 8 mm to 4 5 mm in diameter hollow articulated in nodes that are about 1 5 cm to 4 5 cm apart in the internodes there are distinct vertical streaks grouped in number from four to fourteen or more 32 the branches are chlorophyllized and can perform photosynthesis to supply the deficiency of the leaves 33 the tests were carried out over 12 months in which the hlr and olr were gradually increased the vfcw start up period was 60 days after which the process monitoring began four testing stages were implemented characterized by the following hlr 0 2 0 3 0 6 and 0 8 m3 m2 d 1 each stage lasted two and a half months with the first 15 days being dedicated to adapting the process to the new test conditions the vfcw was fed intermittently with frequencies of 3 5 7 and 9 batches per day from the first to the last testing stage this research considered the reuse of untreated and treated greywater for toilet flushing and garden irrigation which uses are presented in the brazilian technical standards 16 six scenarios were created scenarios 1 and 4 considered the reuse of untreated greywater for both proposed uses whereas scenarios 2 and 5 considered the reuse of treated greywater using an upflow anaerobic filter followed by a vertical constructed wetland uaf vfcw gwtp monitored in this research table 2 finally the last two scenarios 3 and 6 considered the reuse of greywater treated by the same process described for scenarios 2 and 5 with the addition of a hypothetical post treatment consisting of a pressure sand filter psf followed by chlorination uaf vfcw psf cl the psf aimed to reduce turbidity and organic matter remaining in the vfcw effluent which might affect negatively the disinfection efficiency 34 chlorination targets the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms on which pressure sand filters are inefficient 35 assuming a reduction rate between 60 and 95 for turbidity the tertiary effluent presented a turbidity varying from 0 5 to 3 8 ntu which is very similar to the turbidity level observed by tchobanoglous et al 36 in a study of an activated sludge followed by depth filtration 0 5 to 4 0 ntu moreover it was assumed a 50 removal efficiency for bod 9 6 mg l 1 and 4 log10 reduction for e coli from the effluent under disinfection 37 thus the final effluent of the gwtp would present the characteristics illustrated in table 3 sampling the samples were collected at least twice a week for physicochemical analyzes and twice a month for microbiological analyzes at different points along with the gwtp including raw greywater and the effluent of each process these were collected in polypropylene bottles 2 l and sterile glass bottles 500 ml for physicochemical and microbiological analyses respectively all samples were preserved on ice during transportation and analyzed within one hour 2 1 1 physicochemical and microbiological analysis all physicochemical and microbiological analyses followed the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 38 ph temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen turbidity total suspended solids cod bod tkn n nh4 total p p po4 3 total coliform and escherichia coli with the colilert kit idexx westbrook me the parameters ph turbidity and tss were analysed twice a week and bod5 twice a month microbiological analyses were performed monthly 2 1 2 statistical analysis and risk simulations all the parameters investigated were analysed and evaluated through descriptive statistics using the excel 2010 software microsoft corporation redmond the risk simulations were developed using excel 2010 spreadsheets microsoft corporation redmond and risk version 7 6 palisade corporation 2 2 quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra 2 2 1 hazard assessment target pathogens were selected based on who guidelines 2006 and included rotavirus campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp pathogen concentrations were estimated using e coli data generated during the 18 month monitoring period and assuming ratios between pathogens and e coli of 10 6 10 5 for rotaviruses and campylobacter spp and 10 7 10 6 for cryptosporidium spp 13 39 2 2 2 exposure assessment the ingestion of aerosols containing pathogenic microorganisms was the microbial transmission route considered in this study the ingested volume of aerosols from water reuse for one event of toilet flushing and garden irrigation were adopted from ashbolt et al 40 however as described in the australian guidelines for water recycling 14 the aerosols intake volume for toilet flushing is ten times lower than the aerosols intake volume for garden irrigation therefore the adopted intake volume for toilet flushing which was the same as for garden irrigation 40 was divided by ten and a triangular probability density function pdf was created to include the uncertainty of this value in the analysis the number of times that people flush the toilet was adopted from the usepa water conservation plan guidelines 41 which suggested a frequency between 1460 and 2160 flushes per inhabitant per year these values were used to generate a uniform distribution table 4 the concentration of pathogens in greywater was estimated based on the concentration of e coli observed during greywater monitoring which was represented by a fitted lognormal pdf the pathogens e coli ratios were represented by uniform pdfs the ingested dose of pathogens for each event of exposure was estimated by multiplying the concentration of e coli the pathogen e coli ratio and the ingested volume of aerosols per event equation 1 1 d e c r v where d ingested dose of pathogen for each exposure event e c concentration of e coli in greywater mpn ml 1 r pathogens e coli ratio v volume of greywater ingested per exposure event ml the efficiency of the existing greywater treatment plant uaf vfcw to remove e coli was evaluated and compared with previous research using similar treatment designs and conditions treatment systems presenting similar efficiency to remove e coli were considered to have a similar and proportional removal rate for other groups of microorganisms viruses and protozoa for example if there was a study reporting that a treatment process presented a removal efficiency of 3 log10 for e coli and 1 5 log10 for rotavirus and in this study a removal of 2 log10 for e coli was observed a 1 log10 reduction for rotavirus was assumed pathogens removal through the proposed post treatment psf cl was based on pathogen removal rates for pressure sand filter and chlorination reported in the literature it is relevant to mention that based on the overall turbidity of the vfcw effluent 9 4 ntu observed in this study and the turbidity reduction rates 60 95 reported in the literature three levels of turbidity for the effluent of psf were defined high 3 8 ntu medium 1 9 ntu and low 0 5 ntu these levels were linked with removal rates for target pathogens observed in previous studies that investigated chlorination of water presenting high and low turbidity the removal rates were used to create triangular pdfs to represent the target pathogens removal rates also including their uncertainty a summary of pdfs developed to represent the pathogen e coli ratios and treatment processes efficacies is illustrated in table 5 2 2 3 dose response assessment the dose response models used to estimate risk of infection were the β poisson equation 2 for rotavirus and campylobacter spp and the exponential equation 3 for cryptosporidium spp as suggested by haas et al 23 2 p i d 1 1 d d i 50 2 1 α 1 α 3 p i d 1 e r d where p i d probability of infection per person per exposure event pppee d ingested dose of pathogen for each exposure event i d 50 median infective dose α and r specific parameters related to the infection agent and host interaction the dose response parameters used in the risk assessment undertaken in this research were adopted from qmra wiki 47 table 6 2 2 4 risk characterization the risk characterization was performed by combining the estimated risk of infection per person considering each exposure event and the frequency of exposures in one year resulting in the probability of infection per person per year pppy the usepa 15 guidelines suggested a risk of infection lower than 10 4 pppy as an acceptable level and this was adopted as the threshold in this assessment the annual risk of infection was estimated using equation 4 4 p i a 1 1 p i d n where p i a probability of infection per person per year pppy p i d probability of infection per person per exposure event pppee n number of exposure events in a year simulations were undertaken using the monte carlo technique 10 000 iterations by using the latin hypercube sampling technique finally a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the model inputs that most affected the variance of the outputs for the risk assessment simulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the greywater treatment plant relatively low concentrations of organic matter cod 171 mg l 1 and bod 30 mg l 1 and in particular nutrients tkn 1 4 mg l 1 and total p 0 5 mg l 1 were observed in the raw greywater throughout the trials in this research greywater showed characteristics compatible with light greywaters which exclude water from kitchen sinks 48 the average cod bod ratio 5 7 indicates the significant presence of compounds refractory to biological degradation in the greywater 36 the biodegradability of greywaters is a controversial point as some researchers claim that it is more biodegradable than domestic sewage because feces and toilet paper present slowly biodegradable compounds 49 however the presence of large quantities of xenobiotics is pointed out by other researchers as the cause of the lower biodegradability of greywater in comparison to sewage 50 concentrations of total coliform and e coli higher than 104 nmp 100 m l 1 were detected frequently throughout the trials this is characteristic of greywaters that despite receiving low loads of fecal material have concentrations of thermotolerant coliform ranging from 102 to 107 nmp 100 m l 1 21 the average temperature of the gw during the tests was 24 1 c which is a value considered appropriate for the proper functioning of wetlands 51 a summary of all parameters investigated during the gwtp monitoring period is presented in table 7 considering the organic loading rate olr interval proposed by platzer et al 52 for vfcw in latin america 15 and 32 g bod m 2 d 1 the maximum olr 24 6 g bod m 2 d 1 practiced in this study can be considered as adequate however the olrs in the first and second test stages 5 2 and 7 9 g bod m 2 d 1 respectively were lower than the minimum olr proposed by the mentioned researchers the treatment system was efficient in removing turbidity tss and cod under all tested operating conditions it was possible to observe the effect of the maturation of the treatment processes throughout the research with the achievement of the best performances in the last two operational stages the average bod masses removed daily by the vfcw from the first to the last test stage were 3 5 8 3 21 4 and 20 2 gdbo d 1 this improvement can be attributed to the presence of larger amounts of macrophytes equisetum hyemale during the final stages fig 2 the macrophytes adapted well to feeding with anaerobic effluent with roots showing a branched aspect and reaching an average length of 20 2 cm fig 3 their average height was 1 56 meters which is within the range of 1 to 2 meters mentioned by ferreira et al 53 besides they presented low average productivity 2 98 tons of dry matter ha year practically requiring no maintenance in the twelve months of research despite the low absorption of nutrients table 2 the macrophytes demonstrated good adaptability rusticity and vigor in addition to allowing their ornamental application in the built environments the main function of the uaf in the set was to remove suspended solids and the slowly biodegradable fraction of the cod from greywater attenuating the quality variations of the affluent to vfcw the results indicated that this process has fulfilled its function being responsible for the removal of 65 of cod from greywater however the premise that this process would allow the installation of more advanced redox conditions in the vfcw has not been confirmed the expectation was to obtain a treated effluent with characteristics similar to those reported by arden and ma 19 for rvfcws treating greywaters the average cod removal efficiencies of the vfcw in the four test phases were 52 61 67 and 62 respectively the performance of the uaf and vfcw set in removing cod has resulted in the following efficiencies from the first to the last research stage 83 86 88 87 high cod removal efficiencies are reported in vfcw treating greywater 54 working with a vfcw under hlr ranging from 0 4 m3 m 2 d 1 to 0 8 m3 m 2 d 1 begosso 55 observed a cod of 32 5 mg l 1in treated greywater corresponding to an average removal efficiency of 78 paulo et al 54 observed cod removal of 84 in a vfcw operating with hlr between 0 2 m3 m 2 d 1 and 0 4 m3 m 2 d 1 the uaf reduced the bod concentration from 45 4 mg l 1 in gw to 30 7 mg l 1 which corresponds to an average removal efficiency of 32 the average bod removal efficiencies of the vfcw in the four test phases were 22 35 45 and 32 respectively the average bod concentrations in the gwtp effluent from the first to the last test phases were 24 20 17 and 21 mg l 1 corresponding to the average removal efficiency of 59 48 49 and 49 respectively fig 4 only the average bod 17 mg l of the third stage hlr 0 6 m3 m 2 d 1 met the maximum concentration established by the brazilian technical standards nbr 16783 16 bod 20 mg l 1 these results are compatible with those published by gorky 56 and pidou et al 57 obtained in research projects on vfcw treating greywaters in a review study of vfcws treating greywater pidou et al 57 estimated an average bod of 17 mg l 1 in the treated effluents and observed that more than half of the investigated studies reported mean bod concentrations below 10 mg l 1 in the treated greywater this is the case of begosso 55 that observed an average bod of 8 2 mg l 1 and an average efficiency of 94 for bod removal in a vfcw with hlr ranging from 0 9 hlr 0 84 m3 m 2 d 1 to 1 9 days hlr 0 48 m3 m 2 d 1 in another review carried out by arden and ma 19 vfcw with single passage or with treated effluent recirculation stood out as the most efficient cw modality in the removal of bod from greywater being able to produce effluents with low bod levels 10 mg l 1 when operating with hrt 5 days hrt volumetric capacity divided by daily inflow therefore although according to the review studies mentioned above a vfcw treating greywater is often able to produce bod 10 mg l 1 many studies have reported worse performances in reducing the concentration of this parameter such as this research the average turbidity observed in the uaf effluent was 28 7 ntu average removal efficiency of 34 the average turbidity of the vfcw referring to the hlr of 0 2 0 3 0 6 and 0 8 m3 m2 d 1 were 15 ntu 10 3 ntu 5 3 ntu and 7 0 ntu the removal efficiencies of the uaf and vfcw set were 69 79 89 and 86 respectively at no stage of the research the system proved capable of producing effluent within the turbidity maximum limit established in the referred brazilian technical standards turbidity 5 0 ntu an analysis of the most recent studies on this subject indicated that the treatment of greywater in vfcw hardly results in treated effluents with turbidity below 10 ntu 19 according to ramona et al 58 particles with colloidal dimensions constitute the dominant fraction in terms of numerical distribution in light greywater while the smaller number of larger particles make up the majority of particles average particle size 0 1 mm this would make the solid liquid separation difficult by limiting the retention of smaller particles through the sedimentation and filtration processes in the granular medium of wetlands in the mentioned review carried out by arden and ma 19 the only modality of wetlands that was able to consistently produce effluents with turbidity below 5 ntu was that of vertical constructed wetlands with effluent recirculation overall the use of uaf followed by vfcw showed poor removal rates for both total coliform and e coli in all stages of the research the gwtp removed one log10 of e coli present in greywater fig 5 the mean concentrations of e coli in the vfcw effluent ranged from 5 9 10² 9 8 10¹ in the stage with hlr 0 8m3 m 2 d 1 to 7 1 102 1 2 102 in the stage with hlr 0 3 m3 m 2 d 1 this was expected as uaf and vfcw are not normally designed for microbial removal but organic matter and solids removal 21 59 according to morató et al 60 microorganism removal and inactivation processes that occur in constructed wetlands include sedimentation of particle associated bacteria filtration by adsorption onto vegetation biofilm uv inactivation predation by micro zooplankton and bacteriophage attack as for the other parameters evaluated treated greywater presented tss concentration below 10 mg l 1 and ph close to neutrality in all test stages the removal of nutrients n and p were poor but it is relevant to mention that their concentrations in the studied greywater were low nevertheless the observed growth of macrophytes suggests that there was no nutritional limitation during the experiment despite the good performance of the gwtp in the removal of tss cod bod and turbidity the quality of the effluents produced in all stages was incompatible with the brazilian technical standards for water reuse 16 3 2 risk assessment although most individuals may be unaware of the microbial risks during garden irrigation or a toilet flushing event pathogens can be transferred to aerosols droplets during these events 12 and end up being accidentally ingested by users according to the usepa recommendation maximum risk 10 4 the findings of this research suggests that the reuse of untreated greywater for toilet flushing and garden irrigation may pose an excessive risk of infection for all target pathogens especially for rotavirus 5 45 10 2 and 3 04 10 2pppy considering toilet flushing and garden irrigation respectively fig 6 shi et al 11 evaluated the reuse of greywater from three sources bathroom laundry and kitchen although the exposure assessment was different from this study the results showed that greywater from all three household sources can be safely used for flushing the bathroom after microfiltration treatment however it is important to note that in the mentioned study the researchers considered only pathogenic e coli and did not estimate the risk posed by pathogens such as rotavirus one of the main concerns with respect to enteric viruses is related to its very low dose needed to cause infection in humans as well as to its high severity in elderly young children and immunocompromised individuals 61 62 treated greywater through uaf vfcw was considered safe for both purposes with regards to campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp although the risk of infection posed by campylobacter spp was slightly above the recommended threshold for garden irrigation 1 06 10 4pppy and toilet flushing 1 91 10 4pppy however the estimated risk of infection for rotavirus was still high for both uses since it was assumed that rotavirus was not removed through uaf vfcw the addition of a pressure sand filter psf was proposed because it can efficiently reduce turbidity moreover chlorination was chosen as the disinfection step because besides of its relatively high efficiency in removing pathogens it also leaves residual chlorine to avoid regrowth during water storage 63 and is requested by the brazilian technical standards nbr 16783 16 the additional post treatment proposed in this study would be able to produce an appropriate effluent for reuse for both purposes toilet flushing and garden irrigation presenting a risk of infection confidence level of 95 below the usepa recommendations risk 10 4 for all evaluated target pathogens fig 6 in all scenarios tested the microbial risk posed by all target pathogens for toilet flushing presented slightly higher risk compared to garden irrigation although the ingestion dose was 10 times higher for garden irrigation this can be explained by the fact that the frequency of toilet flushes was much higher 18 times than the frequency for garden irrigation the cumulative density distribution of the annual risk of infection per person considering all scenarios evaluated and all target pathogens assessed in this study clearly shows how the risk was diminished when treatment processes were employed fig 7 the gwtp uaf vfcw was able to reduce approximately one log10 of the risk of infection posed by campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp considering both uses proposed but it did not reduce the risk posed by rotavirus as mentioned before when the hypothetical processes psf and cl were considered the risk of infection posed by rotavirus and campylobacter spp were significantly decreased but the risk posed by cryptosporidium spp not so much this occurred because the efficiency of chlorine agents against cryptosporidium spp was considered to be much lower compared to its efficiency against rotavirus and campylobacter spp as suggested by cdc 37 the sensitivity analysis revealed that the concentration of e coli was the parameter that most contributed to the variance observed in the risk output for all scenarios evaluated considering all target pathogens the efficiency of treatment processes ratios between target pathogens and e coli ingested volume of aerosols and frequency of events also contributed to the observed variation of risk output however their significance was much lower compared to the concentration of e coli to illustrate this point the parameters that most affected the variance of the risk output for scenarios 2 uaf vfcw for toilet flushing and uaf vfcw psf cl for toilet flushing including all target pathogens is presented in fig 8 overall the qmra developed in this research was very supportive to evaluate and compare different levels of treatment applied to greywater reuse even though the magnitude of the estimated risks may not be very accurate due to many assumptions inherent to the qmra approach during modelling the comparison among scenarios with different levels of greywater treatment was very useful during the development of this research many questions have emerged 1 what would be the most suitable e coli limit level for the reuse of greywater for toilet flushing or garden irrigation would the use of e coli data and the ratio between pathogens and e coli be an adequate manner to assess microbial risk for these purposes such questions can be very difficult to answer because it depends on each specific situation for example the ratios between e coli and pathogens in large sewage treatment plants might not be an excessively rough approximation because of the large number of people contributing to the production of wastewater however if a greywater recycling system is designed for 20 people such as the case of this study the ratio between pathogens and e coli may not be very representative in this situation if all 20 individuals were healthy no infection they would be releasing high loads of e coli and no pathogens in contrast if at least one individual presented some infection the ratio would probably be much higher than that assumed in this study according to katukiza et al 64 even large greywater reuse systems may present different pathogen e coli ratios over time this occurs because e coli originates from the entire population every day while viral pathogens originate from the proportion of the population that is infected at a specific moment one major issue of using these ratios is that pathogens are assumed to be always present in the water investigated but in low concentration this may not be true because at some days there might have no infection cases especially when small populations are considered it is known that fecal indicator bacteria do not correlate well with pathogens in many situations future research should seek to clarify the suitability of e coli as an indicator of fecal contamination of greywater this has been questioned in several studies which showed that e coli can be present where fecal contamination does not occur and they are able of persisting and multiplying in the environment outside of the host under certain conditions 65 moreover ottoson and stenström 7 stated that the use of e coli in situations like this may lead to inaccurate conclusions and therefore they recommended the use of enterococcus spp as more suitable indicators of fecal contamination for greywater recycling systems as previously mentioned the use of e coli data to estimate the density of target pathogens in greywater was one of the main uncertainties in the risk assessment presented here therefore in order to improve future evaluation of greywater recycling systems there is a need to investigate more appropriate indicators to identify and quantify the presence of different groups of pathogens this is particularly relevant for the group of viruses because they normally present lower infectious doses and they are more likely to be transmitted via aerosols due to their small size more research to investigate the fate occurrence and persistence of pathogens especially enteric viruses as well as to quantify them in greywater would also support better risk assessment 4 conclusion the outcomes showed that the greywater treatment plant was not able to consistently produce reclaimed water with satisfactory physicochemical and biological quality according to the brazilian technical standards for water reuse it was efficient in removing organic matter and suspended solids but not as efficient for microbial removal the risk assessment outcomes suggest that the reuse of greywater for toilet flushing and garden irrigation without any prior treatment presents a relatively high risk of infection posed by cryptosporidium spp campylobacter spp and rotavirus the estimated rotavirus concentration in the effluent of the existing greywater treatment plant anaerobic upstream filter vertical flow built in humid areas also resulted in a high risk of infection the use of a post treatment pressure sand filter chlorination to improve its quality was shown to be very efficient in reducing the risk of infection to levels below 10 4 for all target pathogens assessed in all scenarios therefore the use of a disinfection step is recommended for any greywater treatment system intended for water reuse finally it was concluded that the use of e coli does not appear to be appropriate to assess the risk of infection in greywater reuse systems and therefore more effort should be concentrated in elucidating the suitability of e coli and potential novel indicators to support risk assessment in these systems declaration of competing interest the

13751,the objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of a greywater treatment plant composed of an upflow anaerobic filter followed by a vertical constructed wetland and to assess the microbial risk resulting from the non potable reuse of its effluent the microbial risk posed by selected pathogens rotavirus campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp through the ingestion of aerosols during toilet flushing or garden irrigation was investigated using the qmra approach according to the brazilian water reuse technical standards the monitored greywater treatment plant was not able to consistently produce reclaimed water with satisfactory quality for reuse moreover although the treatment plant produced an effluent that achieved the usepa recommended level of 10 4pppy for the risk of infection posed by campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp the risk posed by rotavirus was above this threshold the monitoring data and the qmra outcomes showed that a post treatment including sand filtration and chlorination was essential to produce reclaimed water presenting a risk of infection below 10 4 for all evaluated target pathogens the qmra was very useful to evaluate and compare different levels of treatment applied to greywater reuse based on similar assumptions it was also concluded that the use of e coli does not appear to be appropriate to assess the risk of infection in greywater reuse systems keywords greywater reuse anaerobic filter vertical constructed wetland qmra toilet flushing garden irrigation 1 introduction among many alternative water sources greywater presents great potential for potable water savings and consequently reduction of domestic wastewater generation in residential and commercial buildings 1 greywater gw consists of a combination of wastewater streams from various water consumption points of a building due to the great variation in the quality of this type of water according to the polluting load it can be classified as light greywater that comes from a bathtub shower washbasin and washing machine and dark greywater produced in the kitchen washing machine dishes shower and washbasin ramona 2004 moreover the volume of greywater produced in residential buildings was observed to be sufficient to satisfy the non potable domestic demand such as toilet flushing and garden irrigation which accounted for about 35 of the total domestic demand 2 therefore according to ghaitidak and yadav 3 greywater is locally available and normally requires low cost treatment to produce water of appropriate quality for reuse in garden irrigation and toilet flushing although greywater does not include wastewater from toilet bowls the presence of pathogenic microorganisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus legionella clostridia cryptosporidium spp giardia sp rotavirus have been previously reported 4 6 this is likely to be caused by the introduction of microorganisms during showering hand washing clothes washing etc 7 pyrosequencing analysis and real time pcr revealed that the microbiota from the laundry effluent was dominated by skin associated bacteria such as staphylococcus corynebacterium and propionibacterium 8 previous studies undertaken in many countries have shown that untreated greywater presents relatively high levels of organic matter sulphates suspended solids and fecal contamination 9 which can generate unpleasant odor and pose a microbial risk to users 10 11 moreover previous research suggested that toilet plume could play a contributory role in the transmission of infectious diseases 12 therefore the reuse of untreated and insufficiently treated greywater is not recommended guidelines to regulate and control greywater reuse have been developed in countries that use quality standards as part of their water conservation and management tools and policy strategies however there has not been a consensus on the water quality standards for reuse yet and most countries have adopted a set of water quality criteria from the world health organization guidelines 13 or the australian guidelines for water recycling 14 or united states environmental protection agency usepa epa 600 r 12 618 15 in brazil new technical standards for characterization design use operation and maintenance of alternative non potable water systems in buildings have been developed and proposed by a committee in 2018 16 these standards consider the non potable use of alternative water sources for various purposes such as toilet and urinal flushing courtyard and outdoor areas washing irrigation for landscape purposes garden irrigation etc the new standards established limits for various water quality parameters such as e coli 200 nmp 100 m l 1 turbidity 5 ntu biochemical oxygen demand bod 20 mg l 1 and free chlorine range between 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 constructed wetlands cw have been proven to be an efficient low cost greywater treatment system based on physicochemical processes and interactions of plants and microorganisms to remove pollutants 17 18 besides their low investment and operation cost they can produce high quality effluent with low dissipation of energy and are simple to operate among the various configurations of wetlands vertical constructed wetlands vfcw were reported to be the most efficient in reducing the concentration of organic matter and suspended solids from greywater 19 however these processes present limited efficiency in reducing microbial contamination producing effluents with a relatively high density of thermotolerant coliform 100 to 1000 mpn 100 m l 1 20 in order to improve pathogen inactivation an additional disinfection step to the wetland system e g chlorination or uv has been employed 21 the efficiency of chlorination to kill pathogenic bacteria in greywater relies on greywater quality such as turbidity presence of organics and particles that might protect pathogenic bacteria from the action of chlorine 22 according to arden and ma 19 a chlorine dosage of 100 mg l 1 min 1 or uv dosage of 100 mj cm 2 min 1 is likely to be appropriate for meeting all microbiological parameters presented in the usepa and western australia guidelines if organics are sufficiently removed from gw quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a useful and widely accepted tool for evaluating and ranking microbial risk associated to specific pathogens considering different scenarios 23 although the assessment is performed based on several assumptions which normally results in large variation and uncertainty the qmra approach has been widely applied in the water sector to support decision and policymakers these include vegetable irrigation 24 25 toilet flushing 11 26 garden irrigation 6 27 car washing 28 dishwashing 29 and recreational activities 30 different water reuse proposals can be associated with several microbial transmission routes and result in different volumes of water ingested during each exposure event aerosols generated from reclaimed water that possibly contains enteric pathogens may increase the risk of infections 31 benami et al 5 observed that greywater treatment plant gwtp with aerated processes produces aerosols that may be hazardous to human health if inhaled ingested or come in contact with skin blanky et al 6 stated that the two main options for gw reuse toilet flushing and garden irrigation generate hazardous aerosols although the qrma performed by benami et al 5 and blanky et al 6 indicate that the ingestion of aerosols with staphylococcus aureus and legionella offers a low risk of contamination this route of contamination remains a concern due to the presence of enteric viruses in treated greywaters the objective of this research was to evaluate the performance of a greywater treatment plant and to assess the microbial risk resulting from the non potable reuse of its effluent the greywater treatment plant consisted of an upflow anaerobic filter followed by vertical constructed wetlands vfcw the need for an additional post treatment consisting of pressure sand filter followed by chlorination to improve the reclaimed water quality was also evaluated the microbial risk was assessed considering two alternatives for non potable water reuse toilet flushing and garden irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 greywater quality monitoring program this research was undertaken in vitoria brazil latitude 20 16 18 s longitude 40 18 24 w using data collected from an experimental greywater treatment plant gwtp installed at federal university of espírito santo ufes this gwtp was designed to treat greywater generated in a local building which was occupied by sixteen people at the time the tests started 4 months after the start up of the treatment system and lasted 12 months greywater consisted of three streams including washbasin 7 shower 29 and washing machine 64 that were collected and combined into a single greywater mixture and diverted to a reservoir by gravity fig 1 from this reservoir greywater was pumped to the gwtp which the main design and operational characteristics are shown in table 1 the gwtp consisted of a sieve with a 2 mm opening an upflow anaerobic filter with a granular bed volume of 540 l width 0 6 m length 0 6 m height 1 5 m and a vfcw with bed volume of 1 54 m3 width 1 17 m length 2 19 m height 0 6 m from the lower reservoir 180 l capacity the gw was pumped to the uaf through a centrifugal pump 1 4 cv the effluent from the uaf was stored in a flow equalizing tank 500 l capacity which distributed the liquid to the vfcw through a peristaltic pump controlled by a digital timer the uaf worked as a pre treatment for gw aiming at the removal of ss and cod although the concentration of these parameters in light gw are lower than those of municipal wastewater in this research we sought to assess whether their removal would result in an advanced redox condition in the vfcw that would allow the production of an effluent with turbidity less than 5 0 ntu this would be a strategy similar to that used in vertical recycling flow constructed wetlands rvfcw in which the recirculation flow increases aerobic conditions in the granular environment of wetlands according to the bibliographic review carried out by arden and ma 19 rvfcws are the only type of cw capable of consistently producing a treated effluent with turbidity below 5 0 ntu the hlr applied to uaf was superior to that of vfcw because it was also used to simultaneously feed another cw horizontal from another research the vfcw was filled with 0 4 m of height of coarse sand 0 6 to 2 0 mm and 0 2 m of height with gravel 4 8 to 9 5 mm the feed pipe had a diameter of 50 mm being arranged on the surface of the vfcw over the gravel in the form of a fishbone perforated with holes diameter 10 mm and spaced 30 cm the bottom of the vfcw had a slope of 2 to allow the gravitational flow of treated effluent the specie used in the vfcw was equisetum hyemale which is endemic in the south american continent and recognized as a slow growing plant the choice of this plant had two objectives that the periodic maintenance of the vfcw was carried out with low frequency and that the treatment process also had an ornamental function the first objective requires plants with low growth rates whose roots do not cause clogging of the support medium over time as for the second objective this plant is widely accepted as an ornamental plant in brazil its appearance varies from light green to gray green and consists of fragments of linear leaves and fluted stems the main stems are about 0 8 mm to 4 5 mm in diameter hollow articulated in nodes that are about 1 5 cm to 4 5 cm apart in the internodes there are distinct vertical streaks grouped in number from four to fourteen or more 32 the branches are chlorophyllized and can perform photosynthesis to supply the deficiency of the leaves 33 the tests were carried out over 12 months in which the hlr and olr were gradually increased the vfcw start up period was 60 days after which the process monitoring began four testing stages were implemented characterized by the following hlr 0 2 0 3 0 6 and 0 8 m3 m2 d 1 each stage lasted two and a half months with the first 15 days being dedicated to adapting the process to the new test conditions the vfcw was fed intermittently with frequencies of 3 5 7 and 9 batches per day from the first to the last testing stage this research considered the reuse of untreated and treated greywater for toilet flushing and garden irrigation which uses are presented in the brazilian technical standards 16 six scenarios were created scenarios 1 and 4 considered the reuse of untreated greywater for both proposed uses whereas scenarios 2 and 5 considered the reuse of treated greywater using an upflow anaerobic filter followed by a vertical constructed wetland uaf vfcw gwtp monitored in this research table 2 finally the last two scenarios 3 and 6 considered the reuse of greywater treated by the same process described for scenarios 2 and 5 with the addition of a hypothetical post treatment consisting of a pressure sand filter psf followed by chlorination uaf vfcw psf cl the psf aimed to reduce turbidity and organic matter remaining in the vfcw effluent which might affect negatively the disinfection efficiency 34 chlorination targets the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms on which pressure sand filters are inefficient 35 assuming a reduction rate between 60 and 95 for turbidity the tertiary effluent presented a turbidity varying from 0 5 to 3 8 ntu which is very similar to the turbidity level observed by tchobanoglous et al 36 in a study of an activated sludge followed by depth filtration 0 5 to 4 0 ntu moreover it was assumed a 50 removal efficiency for bod 9 6 mg l 1 and 4 log10 reduction for e coli from the effluent under disinfection 37 thus the final effluent of the gwtp would present the characteristics illustrated in table 3 sampling the samples were collected at least twice a week for physicochemical analyzes and twice a month for microbiological analyzes at different points along with the gwtp including raw greywater and the effluent of each process these were collected in polypropylene bottles 2 l and sterile glass bottles 500 ml for physicochemical and microbiological analyses respectively all samples were preserved on ice during transportation and analyzed within one hour 2 1 1 physicochemical and microbiological analysis all physicochemical and microbiological analyses followed the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 38 ph temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen turbidity total suspended solids cod bod tkn n nh4 total p p po4 3 total coliform and escherichia coli with the colilert kit idexx westbrook me the parameters ph turbidity and tss were analysed twice a week and bod5 twice a month microbiological analyses were performed monthly 2 1 2 statistical analysis and risk simulations all the parameters investigated were analysed and evaluated through descriptive statistics using the excel 2010 software microsoft corporation redmond the risk simulations were developed using excel 2010 spreadsheets microsoft corporation redmond and risk version 7 6 palisade corporation 2 2 quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra 2 2 1 hazard assessment target pathogens were selected based on who guidelines 2006 and included rotavirus campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp pathogen concentrations were estimated using e coli data generated during the 18 month monitoring period and assuming ratios between pathogens and e coli of 10 6 10 5 for rotaviruses and campylobacter spp and 10 7 10 6 for cryptosporidium spp 13 39 2 2 2 exposure assessment the ingestion of aerosols containing pathogenic microorganisms was the microbial transmission route considered in this study the ingested volume of aerosols from water reuse for one event of toilet flushing and garden irrigation were adopted from ashbolt et al 40 however as described in the australian guidelines for water recycling 14 the aerosols intake volume for toilet flushing is ten times lower than the aerosols intake volume for garden irrigation therefore the adopted intake volume for toilet flushing which was the same as for garden irrigation 40 was divided by ten and a triangular probability density function pdf was created to include the uncertainty of this value in the analysis the number of times that people flush the toilet was adopted from the usepa water conservation plan guidelines 41 which suggested a frequency between 1460 and 2160 flushes per inhabitant per year these values were used to generate a uniform distribution table 4 the concentration of pathogens in greywater was estimated based on the concentration of e coli observed during greywater monitoring which was represented by a fitted lognormal pdf the pathogens e coli ratios were represented by uniform pdfs the ingested dose of pathogens for each event of exposure was estimated by multiplying the concentration of e coli the pathogen e coli ratio and the ingested volume of aerosols per event equation 1 1 d e c r v where d ingested dose of pathogen for each exposure event e c concentration of e coli in greywater mpn ml 1 r pathogens e coli ratio v volume of greywater ingested per exposure event ml the efficiency of the existing greywater treatment plant uaf vfcw to remove e coli was evaluated and compared with previous research using similar treatment designs and conditions treatment systems presenting similar efficiency to remove e coli were considered to have a similar and proportional removal rate for other groups of microorganisms viruses and protozoa for example if there was a study reporting that a treatment process presented a removal efficiency of 3 log10 for e coli and 1 5 log10 for rotavirus and in this study a removal of 2 log10 for e coli was observed a 1 log10 reduction for rotavirus was assumed pathogens removal through the proposed post treatment psf cl was based on pathogen removal rates for pressure sand filter and chlorination reported in the literature it is relevant to mention that based on the overall turbidity of the vfcw effluent 9 4 ntu observed in this study and the turbidity reduction rates 60 95 reported in the literature three levels of turbidity for the effluent of psf were defined high 3 8 ntu medium 1 9 ntu and low 0 5 ntu these levels were linked with removal rates for target pathogens observed in previous studies that investigated chlorination of water presenting high and low turbidity the removal rates were used to create triangular pdfs to represent the target pathogens removal rates also including their uncertainty a summary of pdfs developed to represent the pathogen e coli ratios and treatment processes efficacies is illustrated in table 5 2 2 3 dose response assessment the dose response models used to estimate risk of infection were the β poisson equation 2 for rotavirus and campylobacter spp and the exponential equation 3 for cryptosporidium spp as suggested by haas et al 23 2 p i d 1 1 d d i 50 2 1 α 1 α 3 p i d 1 e r d where p i d probability of infection per person per exposure event pppee d ingested dose of pathogen for each exposure event i d 50 median infective dose α and r specific parameters related to the infection agent and host interaction the dose response parameters used in the risk assessment undertaken in this research were adopted from qmra wiki 47 table 6 2 2 4 risk characterization the risk characterization was performed by combining the estimated risk of infection per person considering each exposure event and the frequency of exposures in one year resulting in the probability of infection per person per year pppy the usepa 15 guidelines suggested a risk of infection lower than 10 4 pppy as an acceptable level and this was adopted as the threshold in this assessment the annual risk of infection was estimated using equation 4 4 p i a 1 1 p i d n where p i a probability of infection per person per year pppy p i d probability of infection per person per exposure event pppee n number of exposure events in a year simulations were undertaken using the monte carlo technique 10 000 iterations by using the latin hypercube sampling technique finally a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the model inputs that most affected the variance of the outputs for the risk assessment simulations 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the greywater treatment plant relatively low concentrations of organic matter cod 171 mg l 1 and bod 30 mg l 1 and in particular nutrients tkn 1 4 mg l 1 and total p 0 5 mg l 1 were observed in the raw greywater throughout the trials in this research greywater showed characteristics compatible with light greywaters which exclude water from kitchen sinks 48 the average cod bod ratio 5 7 indicates the significant presence of compounds refractory to biological degradation in the greywater 36 the biodegradability of greywaters is a controversial point as some researchers claim that it is more biodegradable than domestic sewage because feces and toilet paper present slowly biodegradable compounds 49 however the presence of large quantities of xenobiotics is pointed out by other researchers as the cause of the lower biodegradability of greywater in comparison to sewage 50 concentrations of total coliform and e coli higher than 104 nmp 100 m l 1 were detected frequently throughout the trials this is characteristic of greywaters that despite receiving low loads of fecal material have concentrations of thermotolerant coliform ranging from 102 to 107 nmp 100 m l 1 21 the average temperature of the gw during the tests was 24 1 c which is a value considered appropriate for the proper functioning of wetlands 51 a summary of all parameters investigated during the gwtp monitoring period is presented in table 7 considering the organic loading rate olr interval proposed by platzer et al 52 for vfcw in latin america 15 and 32 g bod m 2 d 1 the maximum olr 24 6 g bod m 2 d 1 practiced in this study can be considered as adequate however the olrs in the first and second test stages 5 2 and 7 9 g bod m 2 d 1 respectively were lower than the minimum olr proposed by the mentioned researchers the treatment system was efficient in removing turbidity tss and cod under all tested operating conditions it was possible to observe the effect of the maturation of the treatment processes throughout the research with the achievement of the best performances in the last two operational stages the average bod masses removed daily by the vfcw from the first to the last test stage were 3 5 8 3 21 4 and 20 2 gdbo d 1 this improvement can be attributed to the presence of larger amounts of macrophytes equisetum hyemale during the final stages fig 2 the macrophytes adapted well to feeding with anaerobic effluent with roots showing a branched aspect and reaching an average length of 20 2 cm fig 3 their average height was 1 56 meters which is within the range of 1 to 2 meters mentioned by ferreira et al 53 besides they presented low average productivity 2 98 tons of dry matter ha year practically requiring no maintenance in the twelve months of research despite the low absorption of nutrients table 2 the macrophytes demonstrated good adaptability rusticity and vigor in addition to allowing their ornamental application in the built environments the main function of the uaf in the set was to remove suspended solids and the slowly biodegradable fraction of the cod from greywater attenuating the quality variations of the affluent to vfcw the results indicated that this process has fulfilled its function being responsible for the removal of 65 of cod from greywater however the premise that this process would allow the installation of more advanced redox conditions in the vfcw has not been confirmed the expectation was to obtain a treated effluent with characteristics similar to those reported by arden and ma 19 for rvfcws treating greywaters the average cod removal efficiencies of the vfcw in the four test phases were 52 61 67 and 62 respectively the performance of the uaf and vfcw set in removing cod has resulted in the following efficiencies from the first to the last research stage 83 86 88 87 high cod removal efficiencies are reported in vfcw treating greywater 54 working with a vfcw under hlr ranging from 0 4 m3 m 2 d 1 to 0 8 m3 m 2 d 1 begosso 55 observed a cod of 32 5 mg l 1in treated greywater corresponding to an average removal efficiency of 78 paulo et al 54 observed cod removal of 84 in a vfcw operating with hlr between 0 2 m3 m 2 d 1 and 0 4 m3 m 2 d 1 the uaf reduced the bod concentration from 45 4 mg l 1 in gw to 30 7 mg l 1 which corresponds to an average removal efficiency of 32 the average bod removal efficiencies of the vfcw in the four test phases were 22 35 45 and 32 respectively the average bod concentrations in the gwtp effluent from the first to the last test phases were 24 20 17 and 21 mg l 1 corresponding to the average removal efficiency of 59 48 49 and 49 respectively fig 4 only the average bod 17 mg l of the third stage hlr 0 6 m3 m 2 d 1 met the maximum concentration established by the brazilian technical standards nbr 16783 16 bod 20 mg l 1 these results are compatible with those published by gorky 56 and pidou et al 57 obtained in research projects on vfcw treating greywaters in a review study of vfcws treating greywater pidou et al 57 estimated an average bod of 17 mg l 1 in the treated effluents and observed that more than half of the investigated studies reported mean bod concentrations below 10 mg l 1 in the treated greywater this is the case of begosso 55 that observed an average bod of 8 2 mg l 1 and an average efficiency of 94 for bod removal in a vfcw with hlr ranging from 0 9 hlr 0 84 m3 m 2 d 1 to 1 9 days hlr 0 48 m3 m 2 d 1 in another review carried out by arden and ma 19 vfcw with single passage or with treated effluent recirculation stood out as the most efficient cw modality in the removal of bod from greywater being able to produce effluents with low bod levels 10 mg l 1 when operating with hrt 5 days hrt volumetric capacity divided by daily inflow therefore although according to the review studies mentioned above a vfcw treating greywater is often able to produce bod 10 mg l 1 many studies have reported worse performances in reducing the concentration of this parameter such as this research the average turbidity observed in the uaf effluent was 28 7 ntu average removal efficiency of 34 the average turbidity of the vfcw referring to the hlr of 0 2 0 3 0 6 and 0 8 m3 m2 d 1 were 15 ntu 10 3 ntu 5 3 ntu and 7 0 ntu the removal efficiencies of the uaf and vfcw set were 69 79 89 and 86 respectively at no stage of the research the system proved capable of producing effluent within the turbidity maximum limit established in the referred brazilian technical standards turbidity 5 0 ntu an analysis of the most recent studies on this subject indicated that the treatment of greywater in vfcw hardly results in treated effluents with turbidity below 10 ntu 19 according to ramona et al 58 particles with colloidal dimensions constitute the dominant fraction in terms of numerical distribution in light greywater while the smaller number of larger particles make up the majority of particles average particle size 0 1 mm this would make the solid liquid separation difficult by limiting the retention of smaller particles through the sedimentation and filtration processes in the granular medium of wetlands in the mentioned review carried out by arden and ma 19 the only modality of wetlands that was able to consistently produce effluents with turbidity below 5 ntu was that of vertical constructed wetlands with effluent recirculation overall the use of uaf followed by vfcw showed poor removal rates for both total coliform and e coli in all stages of the research the gwtp removed one log10 of e coli present in greywater fig 5 the mean concentrations of e coli in the vfcw effluent ranged from 5 9 10² 9 8 10¹ in the stage with hlr 0 8m3 m 2 d 1 to 7 1 102 1 2 102 in the stage with hlr 0 3 m3 m 2 d 1 this was expected as uaf and vfcw are not normally designed for microbial removal but organic matter and solids removal 21 59 according to morató et al 60 microorganism removal and inactivation processes that occur in constructed wetlands include sedimentation of particle associated bacteria filtration by adsorption onto vegetation biofilm uv inactivation predation by micro zooplankton and bacteriophage attack as for the other parameters evaluated treated greywater presented tss concentration below 10 mg l 1 and ph close to neutrality in all test stages the removal of nutrients n and p were poor but it is relevant to mention that their concentrations in the studied greywater were low nevertheless the observed growth of macrophytes suggests that there was no nutritional limitation during the experiment despite the good performance of the gwtp in the removal of tss cod bod and turbidity the quality of the effluents produced in all stages was incompatible with the brazilian technical standards for water reuse 16 3 2 risk assessment although most individuals may be unaware of the microbial risks during garden irrigation or a toilet flushing event pathogens can be transferred to aerosols droplets during these events 12 and end up being accidentally ingested by users according to the usepa recommendation maximum risk 10 4 the findings of this research suggests that the reuse of untreated greywater for toilet flushing and garden irrigation may pose an excessive risk of infection for all target pathogens especially for rotavirus 5 45 10 2 and 3 04 10 2pppy considering toilet flushing and garden irrigation respectively fig 6 shi et al 11 evaluated the reuse of greywater from three sources bathroom laundry and kitchen although the exposure assessment was different from this study the results showed that greywater from all three household sources can be safely used for flushing the bathroom after microfiltration treatment however it is important to note that in the mentioned study the researchers considered only pathogenic e coli and did not estimate the risk posed by pathogens such as rotavirus one of the main concerns with respect to enteric viruses is related to its very low dose needed to cause infection in humans as well as to its high severity in elderly young children and immunocompromised individuals 61 62 treated greywater through uaf vfcw was considered safe for both purposes with regards to campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp although the risk of infection posed by campylobacter spp was slightly above the recommended threshold for garden irrigation 1 06 10 4pppy and toilet flushing 1 91 10 4pppy however the estimated risk of infection for rotavirus was still high for both uses since it was assumed that rotavirus was not removed through uaf vfcw the addition of a pressure sand filter psf was proposed because it can efficiently reduce turbidity moreover chlorination was chosen as the disinfection step because besides of its relatively high efficiency in removing pathogens it also leaves residual chlorine to avoid regrowth during water storage 63 and is requested by the brazilian technical standards nbr 16783 16 the additional post treatment proposed in this study would be able to produce an appropriate effluent for reuse for both purposes toilet flushing and garden irrigation presenting a risk of infection confidence level of 95 below the usepa recommendations risk 10 4 for all evaluated target pathogens fig 6 in all scenarios tested the microbial risk posed by all target pathogens for toilet flushing presented slightly higher risk compared to garden irrigation although the ingestion dose was 10 times higher for garden irrigation this can be explained by the fact that the frequency of toilet flushes was much higher 18 times than the frequency for garden irrigation the cumulative density distribution of the annual risk of infection per person considering all scenarios evaluated and all target pathogens assessed in this study clearly shows how the risk was diminished when treatment processes were employed fig 7 the gwtp uaf vfcw was able to reduce approximately one log10 of the risk of infection posed by campylobacter spp and cryptosporidium spp considering both uses proposed but it did not reduce the risk posed by rotavirus as mentioned before when the hypothetical processes psf and cl were considered the risk of infection posed by rotavirus and campylobacter spp were significantly decreased but the risk posed by cryptosporidium spp not so much this occurred because the efficiency of chlorine agents against cryptosporidium spp was considered to be much lower compared to its efficiency against rotavirus and campylobacter spp as suggested by cdc 37 the sensitivity analysis revealed that the concentration of e coli was the parameter that most contributed to the variance observed in the risk output for all scenarios evaluated considering all target pathogens the efficiency of treatment processes ratios between target pathogens and e coli ingested volume of aerosols and frequency of events also contributed to the observed variation of risk output however their significance was much lower compared to the concentration of e coli to illustrate this point the parameters that most affected the variance of the risk output for scenarios 2 uaf vfcw for toilet flushing and uaf vfcw psf cl for toilet flushing including all target pathogens is presented in fig 8 overall the qmra developed in this research was very supportive to evaluate and compare different levels of treatment applied to greywater reuse even though the magnitude of the estimated risks may not be very accurate due to many assumptions inherent to the qmra approach during modelling the comparison among scenarios with different levels of greywater treatment was very useful during the development of this research many questions have emerged 1 what would be the most suitable e coli limit level for the reuse of greywater for toilet flushing or garden irrigation would the use of e coli data and the ratio between pathogens and e coli be an adequate manner to assess microbial risk for these purposes such questions can be very difficult to answer because it depends on each specific situation for example the ratios between e coli and pathogens in large sewage treatment plants might not be an excessively rough approximation because of the large number of people contributing to the production of wastewater however if a greywater recycling system is designed for 20 people such as the case of this study the ratio between pathogens and e coli may not be very representative in this situation if all 20 individuals were healthy no infection they would be releasing high loads of e coli and no pathogens in contrast if at least one individual presented some infection the ratio would probably be much higher than that assumed in this study according to katukiza et al 64 even large greywater reuse systems may present different pathogen e coli ratios over time this occurs because e coli originates from the entire population every day while viral pathogens originate from the proportion of the population that is infected at a specific moment one major issue of using these ratios is that pathogens are assumed to be always present in the water investigated but in low concentration this may not be true because at some days there might have no infection cases especially when small populations are considered it is known that fecal indicator bacteria do not correlate well with pathogens in many situations future research should seek to clarify the suitability of e coli as an indicator of fecal contamination of greywater this has been questioned in several studies which showed that e coli can be present where fecal contamination does not occur and they are able of persisting and multiplying in the environment outside of the host under certain conditions 65 moreover ottoson and stenström 7 stated that the use of e coli in situations like this may lead to inaccurate conclusions and therefore they recommended the use of enterococcus spp as more suitable indicators of fecal contamination for greywater recycling systems as previously mentioned the use of e coli data to estimate the density of target pathogens in greywater was one of the main uncertainties in the risk assessment presented here therefore in order to improve future evaluation of greywater recycling systems there is a need to investigate more appropriate indicators to identify and quantify the presence of different groups of pathogens this is particularly relevant for the group of viruses because they normally present lower infectious doses and they are more likely to be transmitted via aerosols due to their small size more research to investigate the fate occurrence and persistence of pathogens especially enteric viruses as well as to quantify them in greywater would also support better risk assessment 4 conclusion the outcomes showed that the greywater treatment plant was not able to consistently produce reclaimed water with satisfactory physicochemical and biological quality according to the brazilian technical standards for water reuse it was efficient in removing organic matter and suspended solids but not as efficient for microbial removal the risk assessment outcomes suggest that the reuse of greywater for toilet flushing and garden irrigation without any prior treatment presents a relatively high risk of infection posed by cryptosporidium spp campylobacter spp and rotavirus the estimated rotavirus concentration in the effluent of the existing greywater treatment plant anaerobic upstream filter vertical flow built in humid areas also resulted in a high risk of infection the use of a post treatment pressure sand filter chlorination to improve its quality was shown to be very efficient in reducing the risk of infection to levels below 10 4 for all target pathogens assessed in all scenarios therefore the use of a disinfection step is recommended for any greywater treatment system intended for water reuse finally it was concluded that the use of e coli does not appear to be appropriate to assess the risk of infection in greywater reuse systems and therefore more effort should be concentrated in elucidating the suitability of e coli and potential novel indicators to support risk assessment in these systems declaration of competing interest the

13752,cyanobacteria and plastics as the two major problems of the water environment crisis need to be solved urgently in particular there is no reasonable method for simultaneously treating these wastes and recovering useful resources from them therefore the mixture of cyanobacteria and polypropylene pp plastics is directly pyrolyzed at different activation conditions to synthesize the composite carbon cpc materials which have excellent performance in water contaminant removal the result indicates that the added pp is beneficial to improve the properties of cpc material increasing its specific surface area and pore volume up to 2811 m2 g and 1 992 cm3 g respectively the application performance of cpc materials is mainly determined by the surface area and pore volume therefore the cpc materials exhibit a higher methylene blue mb adsorption maximum 490 mg g this paper provides a new strategy for recycling wastes from water environment and new ideas for synthesizing high performance composite materials keywords porous carbon biochar co pyrolysis activation conditions adsorption performance 1 introduction recently the distribution of cyanobacteria has become extremely wide resulting in the release of microcystins which is a serious threat to the aquatic ecosystem and also to human health 1 3 concurrently the increase in the global production of plastic waste has become a pressing issue of the current era polypropylene pp as a typical non biodegradable plastic will long term threaten the natural ecosystem 4 biochar is obtained from various organic biomass such as rice husks wood chips coconut husks waste tires and so on 5 interestingly biochar has a good adsorption capacity for heavy metals pesticides antibiotics and other pollutants in water it is also widely used in batteries medicines catalysis and gold extraction generally technologies for biochar production include hydrothermal carbonization gasified carbonization pyrolytic carbonization baking carbonization and flashing carbonization 6 9 different raw materials ratios of constituents and activators and activation methods have a particularly large impact on the quality and use of carbon materials 5 6 cells of cyanobacteria contain a large amount of nutrients such as n p and phycocyanin 5 however due to the constraints of the current technological level and economic costs cyanobacteria are landfilled after usage what is more cyanobacteria have not been used on a large scale activated carbon is prepared by using cyanobacteria as raw material the preparation of activated carbon using cyanobacteria is short and simple and thus can be upscaled for mass production 5 10 limited by the seasonal factors in which cyanobacteria prevail pp can be an effective supplement for activated carbon raw materials studies have shown that there is a synergistic effect of co pyrolysis on algae and waste plastics 11 14 the soft template formed by polymers can maintain the complete morphology of activated carbon particles and support the overall framework of activated carbon 13 15 therefore co pyrolysis of harmful cyanobacteria and pp has the potential to produce high performance activated carbon although great progress has been made in the analysis of co pyrolysis kinetics and its effect on volatile components there are still some problems to be solved in the optimization and control of the pore structure of carbon materials especially the effect of structure on adsorption performance 13 14 16 20 in addition the conditions for preparing carbon materials by co pyrolysis of cyanobacteria and pp have not been systematically optimized in this research cyanobacteria plastic composite carbon cpc is prepared from dry mixing microcystis aeruginosa activator potassium carbonate and pp the effects of activation conditions on the structure and adsorption properties of cpc materials are investigated the aim is to provide a new energy saving and economical material for the adsorption of dyes in wastewater by cpc materials 2 materials and methods 2 1 fabrication of cyanobacteria plastic composite carbon cpc the microcystis aeruginosa used is purchased from the algae seed bank of the chinese academy of sciences after amplification and cultivation it is centrifuged concentrated dried pulverized and ground to obtain the cells pp is collected from the waste lunch box cleaned to remove impurities dried and pulverized with a multi purpose pulverizer after passing through the 100 mesh screen it is placed in a sealed bag for use potassium carbonate k2co3 methylene blue mb and hydrochloric acid hcl are purchased from aladdin reagents shanghai all of which are of analytical grade and utilized without further purification all aqueous solutions are prepared from deionized di water cpc materials are prepared by direct pyrolysis of cyanobacteria pp and k2co3 pyrolysis is a one step time saving process without harsh treatments the fixed mass ratio of k2co3 and mixed waste is pyrolyzed at different conditions for 90 min under a flowing stream of nitrogen finally the obtained sample is washed with 0 1 m hcl and deionized water several times until ph is neutral and dried at 80 c overnight cpc production is based on the initial weight of the mixed cyanobacteria and pp the collected samples are named cpc x y or z where x is the pyrolysis

plastic composite carbon cpc the proximate analysis is performed by thermogravimetric tg analysis sta7300 hitachi japan the pore structure of the sample is analyzed using an n2 adsorption isotherm and measured at 196 c using a v sorb 2800 instrument the surface area sbet is calculated from the n2 isotherm by fitting the brunauer emmett teller bet method saito foley sf and barrett joyner halenda bjh are used to fit the n2 adsorption data to obtain pore size distributions psds the morphologies of samples are measured by scanning electron microscopy s 4800 hitachi japan the samples are subjected to x ray diffraction xrd analysis using a d8 advanced diffractometer 2 3 adsorption experiments the isothermal experiments are performed in a batch model of 298 k in which 20 mg of the prepared sample is placed in a glass vial containing 20 ml of 500 mg l mb solution subsequently the vials are shaken at 150 rpm then after the adsorption is equilibrated the supernatant is filtered through a 0 45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane the residual concentration of mb is determined by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry and calculated by taking absorbance at 668 nm the amount of adsorbed mb is calculated as q c o c e v m where c0 and ce mg l represent the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of mb in the solution respectively v l is the volume of the mb solution to be tested m g is the amount of the cpc absorbent 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the thermolysis of cyanobacteria and the mixture cyanobacteria and pp the pyrolysis interval of pp is slightly higher than that of cyanobacteria which causes the pyrolysis interval of the mixture to move backward fig 1 a a higher thermal weight loss rate is conducive to the preparation of activated carbon and improves the adsorption capacity of activated carbon products 21 in addition the dtg curve of pp pyrolysis shows a peak in 370 c 520 c which is related to the chain breaking reaction and carbon formation however due to the decomposition of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin weight loss of biomass occurs mostly between 160 c and 520 c in the presence of pp the decomposition of biomass shifts to a lower temperature range and therefore corresponds to a higher weight loss in the tg curve fig 1b obviously the addition of pp reduces the peak temperature of the biomass 13 co pyrolysis can significantly reduce the energy input of the reaction process by greatly reducing the activation energy of the reaction 14 it turns out that pp can promote the pyrolysis of biomass it is found that there are obvious differences in pyrolysis characteristics fig 1c and d generally k2co3 promotes the decomposition of volatiles the maximum weight loss rate of cyanobacteria k2co3 appears at about 250 c and the maximum weight loss rate of cyanobacteria occurs near 320 c which indicates that k2co3 has a catalytic effect on the decomposition of cyanobacteria at lower temperatures from 370 520 c the pyrolysis effect of pp is significant the slight weight loss between 500 800 c is due to the decomposition of k2co3 besides pyrolysis of cyanobacteria and k2co3 can help reduce the generation of tar and coke thereby increasing the yield of syngas 12 14 22 3 2 impact of activation conditions 3 2 1 chemical properties of cpc materials according to table 1 as the activation temperature of k2co3 increases the bet surface area and total pore volume of cpc materials also increase which is caused by the initial decomposition of k2co3 at low temperatures at this point the carbon atoms start entering the activated state and help in promotion of the activation reaction with k2co3 this is shown in the following equations 19 k2o c 2 k co k2co3 2c 2 k 3co therefore the cpc yield decreases from 54 5 to 28 2 table 1 which is brought about by the abovementioned chemical reactions the activation temperature also reaches the boiling temperature of potassium metal 762 c and a large amount of potassium metal vapor enters the internal pores and graphite microcrystalline layer of cpc this phenomenon can promote the opening of the carbon lattice and leads to a further increase in cpc porosity subsequently the temperature of 900 c causes the pore structure to collapse pp contains a high amount of hydrogen which can supply hydrogen to biomass during pyrolysis which has a synergistic effect on the pyrolysis reaction 23 interestingly when the pp content increases to 60 the yield of the prepared cpc decreases sharply to almost zero which has no practical value therefore cpc 50 with the best bet surface area is about 2811 m2 g compared with pp free activated carbon the surface area of cpc has increased 3 1 times with the change of the reaction conditions the micropore rate increases first and then decreases and the mesopore rate is just the opposite which is of great significance for the pore size control of the material 22 24 25 3 2 2 textural properties as shown in fig 2 the isotherms of cpc materials are i or iv isotherms in the relative pressure p p0 0 1 region the adsorption isotherms rise rapidly indicating that they all contain more microporous structures a h4 type hysteresis loop indicates the existence of multi layer adsorption capillary condensation and a certain amount of mesoporous structure it can be seen from table 1 that the average pore diameter of the cyanobacterial based activated carbon sample increases as the activation temperature increases the salt to material ratio and pp content have similar effects these are consistent with the change in pore size distribution as reflected in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 2 that the pores of cpc materials are mainly micropores and small mesopores 0 7 3 2 nm and with the rise of temperature the size of mesopore increased from 2 0 5 0 nm notably cpc 600 showed lower adsorption volume and larger pore size it indicates that the preparation temperature can change the pore size and structure effectively and have an important impact on adsorption 25 26 3 2 3 sem investigations sem characterization reveals that cpc materials have a clear pore structure on the surface as shown in fig 3 the cpc materials exhibit a similar morphology which is mainly an irregular network structure compared with cpc 500 and cpc 900 the morphology of cpc 800 is close to the alveolar structure with deeper channels and bigger pores fig 3b which is mainly affected by the activation temperature in addition it is found that the pore structure of cpc 3 is more developed than the cpc 0 and cpc 4 samples which indicates that the moderate amount of activator k2co3 is indispensable during the activation process it is worth noting that the morphology of the cpc sample is close to the alveolate like structure with abundant pore fig 3g this result confirms that the addition of pp can promote the co pyrolysis reaction with cyanobacteria thereby greatly improving the morphology of the material at the same time it is of great help to increase the surface area of cpc materials in short the activation temperature the addition of pp and k2co3 can improve the pores development of cpc materials which in turn affects its morphology 3 2 4 xrd analysis xrd can obtain information about the crystal structure of the cpc materials fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that two peaks appear in each curve and the diffraction peak appears near 2θ 26 the weak diffraction peak is near 2θ 44 corresponding to the 002 crystal plane and the 100 crystal plane diffraction where most of the carbon exists in an amorphous form the appearance of 002 broad peak diffraction reflects the presence of graphite crystallite on increasing the activation temperature the diffraction intensity decreases the diffraction peaks are broadened and the peak position shifts fig 4a this shows that the layer spacing tends to increase while the stack thickness decreases in addition the damage of graphite microcrystal is exacerbated due to the etching of carbon coursed by the activator the graphite sheets are looser than the graphite microcrystal 12 the xrd pattern only has a broadened envelope peak further indicating that pp has a certain dispersion effect on other components of the carbon materials fig 4b in general the activation conditions activation temperature mass ratio of pp and k2co3 have little effect on the crystal structure of cpc materials and the derived cpc material is basically amorphous 3 3 mb adsorption properties the thermal reaction triggered by the pp dopant can be the basis for fabricating cpc materials with desired surface area and porosities previous study have shown that the organic adsorption capacity of carbonaceous materials depends on their pore structures and physical chemical properties which is called the pore fitting mechanism 27 28 therefore the prepared materials have high potential applications in the removal of organic pollutants which was consistent with the results in this work as shown in fig 5 as prepared cpc materials exhibited high mb adsorption capacity maximum 490 mg g and adsorption rate obvious higher than reported materials 29 30 and the adsorption isotherms of cpc materials are fitted to the langmuir models evidently cpc 40 sample exhibited the highest adsorption capacity mainly due to its high surface area 2135 m2 g and developed micropore structure 31 32 it clearly demonstrated that the sample was a candidate for organic pollutant removal from aqueous solutions in addition the high activation temperature derived cpc material has a disordered graphite structure with a large interlayer distance which results in more active surface atoms thus showing better adsorption performance 33 37 significantly the types of functional groups on the surface of carbon such as oh co and ch are also important reasons for promoting the adsorption of mb on cpc materials 14 15 the results indicate the effectiveness of the process and its significance for the further design of porous adsorbents synthetic cpcs are not only used to remove common organic pollutants such as mb in dyes but also provide a new carbon matrix for environmental restoration and even energy storage 8 it solves the deficiencies in optimizing and controlling the pore structure of carbon materials especially the influence of structure on adsorption performance 13 14 16 20 in addition the conditions for preparing carbon materials through the co pyrolysis of cyanobacteria and pp are more systematically optimized 4 conclusions in summary cpc materials have been fabricated by co pyrolyzing two types of waste and combining pore size and pore structure control into a simple process synthetic temperature activator s ratio and pp content have a crucial impact on physical and chemical properties and relative mb removal performance due to its developed pore structure and stable pp doping cpc 40 shows the highest mb adsorption capacity 490 mg g in aqueous solution this result provides a potential method for using harmful microalgae and waste pp as a functional carbon precursor for adsorption of macromolecular pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors

clearly demonstrated that the sample was a candidate for organic pollutant removal from aqueous solutions in addition the high activation temperature derived cpc material has a disordered graphite structure with a large interlayer distance which results in more active surface atoms thus showing better adsorption performance 33 37 significantly the types of functional groups on the surface of carbon such as oh co and ch are also important reasons for promoting the adsorption of mb on cpc materials 14 15 the results indicate the effectiveness of the process and its significance for the further design of porous adsorbents synthetic cpcs are not only used to remove common organic pollutants such as mb in dyes but also provide a new carbon matrix for environmental restoration and even energy storage 8 it solves the deficiencies in optimizing and controlling the pore structure of carbon materials especially the influence of structure on adsorption performance 13 14 16 20 in addition the conditions for preparing carbon materials through the co pyrolysis of cyanobacteria and pp are more systematically optimized 4 conclusions in summary cpc materials have been fabricated by co pyrolyzing two types of waste and combining pore size and pore structure control into a simple process synthetic temperature activator s ratio and pp content have a crucial impact on physical and chemical properties and relative mb removal performance due to its developed pore structure and stable pp doping cpc 40 shows the highest mb adsorption capacity 490 mg g in aqueous solution this result provides a potential method for using harmful microalgae and waste pp as a functional carbon precursor for adsorption of macromolecular pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors

13753,this paper presents multistage hydrometallurgical separation of co ii from wastewater achieved in an integrated system containing diffusion dialysis dd to decrease the acidity of the industrial effluent pregnant leach solution pls followed by precipitation of al iii fe iii and cr iii hydroxides selective extraction of co ii with bis 2 4 4 trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid cyanex 272 stripping of co ii from the loaded organic phase to form an electrolyte dd results indicate that minimum metal ion content in the dialysate and high concentration of h 1 5 3 m can be achieved by conducting the process at a low flow rate but for a longer time the feed after dd was effectively purified by precipitation of cr iii al iii hydroxides and some admixtures of cu ii and fe iii to ensure that those metals will not disturb the liquid liquid extraction of co ii at ph 5 2 high distribution ratio values for co ii extraction mean that ions of this metal can be selectively separated from the remaining ions present in the feed especially ni ii and transported to the organic phase the application of h2so4 solution and the dialysate as stripping phases indicates that the dialysate more efficiently stripped most of the metal ions from the extract thus forming co ii rich electrolyte for further electrodeposition of the metal finally co ii electrowinning from a model stripping solution was investigated and the preliminary results showed that good quality metallic cobalt can be deposited keywords diffusion dialysis liquid liquid extraction cyanex 272 bis 2 4 4 trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid cobalt nickel separation cobalt recovery waste regeneration 1 introduction the increasing population and economic growth of the world demand a great volume of water potable and technological on the one hand and new resources of various materials e g metals on the other hand thus the recovery of metals from industrial effluents offers a promising solution by reducing the amount of wastewater and providing value added products that have a positive influence on the environmental protection the recovery conversion and re introduction of metals into the supply chain according to the concept of waste to resources wtr 1 become an integral part of sustainable economies of the developed countries e g circular economy in eu to minimize raw material input waste generation and the dependence on the imports of raw materials 2 4 metal containing industrial wastewaters come from various process activities e g cleaning processes and surface preparation degreasing pickling 5 6 metallic coatings and surface finishing electroplating anodizing immersion 7 8 or post process treatment of scraps slags or used waste metal bearing products leaching 9 10 the post treatment of metal bearing materials carried out by leaching mainly acidic results in pregnant leach solutions pls that contain various metals also toxic and heavy e g zn ii ni ii co ii cr iii pb ii cd ii these metals must be removed from such wastewaters before water recycling or dumping for this purpose various methods leading to water purification are proposed among them neutralization to precipitate metal hydroxides 5 membrane treatment ultrafiltration reverse osmosis 11 12 or biotechnologies biosorption microalgae 13 14 however these methods rather focus on water purification than on the recovery of metals for further use wtr concept instead ion exchange 15 16 classical or membrane based solvent extraction 5 6 17 and electrodeposition 18 19 are pointed out as regeneration methods with metal recovery facing huge demand for cobalt a key element in lithium ion batteries for electric cars and the lack of available sources of this metal in europe and the usa cobalt is considered a strategic or critical one 20 hence cobalt containing wastewaters are likely to become a prospective secondary resource of this metal as a chain link in the circular economy these mixtures in which cobalt is accompanied by iron and aluminium manganese zinc chromium and chemically similar nickel 21 need a multistage process to separate and recover particular metals either as metal ions salts or in the metallic form while numerous papers can be found concerning hydrometallurgical cobalt or nickel recovery from spent li ion 22 24 nimh 24 26 or other types of batteries 27 28 or spent catalysts e g hydrodesulfurization catalysts 10 29 extracting these metals from other spent materials is not so widely described also metal scraps of stainless steel can be considered a valuable source of nickel they contain up to 10 ni or cobalt special types of stainless steel for use in fuel cells coated with co 24 29 thus the hydrometallurgical route of steel scraps treatment which has a low operational cost and is considered more environmentally friendly and energy saving when compared to pyrometallurgy covers metal leaching with various mineral acids or their mixtures further some precious and valuable metals among them nickel and cobalt present in the pregnant leach solutions could be removed by further processing ahn and lee 30 have investigated ru iii separation from co ii containing model solutions based on real mixtures after leaching of a scrap of tungsten carbide cobalt hard metals with ruthenium admixture they have indicated that ion exchange was more efficient and less complicated to separate ru iii from co ii from hcl solution compared with solvent extraction with basic extractants i e trioctylmethylammonium chloride aliquat 336 and trioctylamine alamine 300 shen et al 31 have proposed five stage process for recovery and separation of co ii and ni ii from pls containing 24 85 g dm3 co ii 12 55 g dm3 ni ii 28 62 g dm3 fe ii 13 97 g dm3 cr iii and 0 44 g dm3 cu ii the multistage route includes metal leaching with 6 m hcl from alloy scraps cu ii cementation by iron scraps chemical precipitation of fe ii and cr iii selective extraction of co ii over ni ii with 30 trialkylamine in kerosene and tributylphosphate tbp and co ii stripping with 0 01 m hcl and finally crystallization of nickel chloride and electrodeposition of cobalt the final recovery amounted to 95 ni and 60 co with purity over 99 9 operations including precipitation and cementation have been also proposed to recover co ii and zn ii from zinc smelting slag 32 resulting in 88 cobalt and 98 zinc recoveries in the entire separation and purification processes it should be mentioned that to recover cobalt ii and separate it from nickel ii from other industrial effluents than pls other methods such as sorption at ion exchange resins or bio enhanced precipitation have been proposed 33 35 on the one hand iminodiacetate chelating resins have been more selective for ni ii than for co ii recovery from laterite leach tailings 33 on the other hand precipitation of metals with sulfide produced by sulfate reducing bacteria srb has given promising results for nickel ii cobalt ii separation from model solutions based on mine wastewater composition thanks to the differences in nickel ii and cobalt ii solubility in the presence of srb resulting from the complexation of ni ii by proteins produced by the bacteria i e desulfomicrobium baculatum stenotrophomonas maltophilia and desulfovibrio magneticus up to 99 ni ii remained soluble despite the availability of sulfide for precipitation while over 84 5 co ii sulfide was precipitated 34 a bio enhanced treatment of pyritic tailings containing up to 3 co deposited between 1967 and 1982 at the old tailings dam savage river in tasmania has shown that recovery of cobalt from this material is possible by a three step process including flotation biooxidation by a mixture of naturally occurring bacterial population acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and leptospirillum ferrooxidans and finally precipitation to produce co oh 2 intermediate salable product 35 liquid liquid extraction called also solvent extraction applied not only on an industrial scale e g recovery of cobalt from a complex oxide and sulfide ore in boleo process 36 but also to recover metals from low concentrated solutions or deposits of unconventional composition is proposed as an important stage for separation of nickel and cobalt to obtain clean products 37 our team has investigated extractive co ii removal from model and real sulfate solutions with bis 2 4 4 trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid cyanex 272 or its salts 10 38 40 in various conditions the finally proposed extractive separation of co ii from ni ii containing wastewater covers sustainable processing of waste as well as regeneration and reuse of the organic chemicals applied for extraction in two extraction stripping stages and three scrubbing stages 39 after this process a stripping phase is enriched in co ii and can be used as an electrolyte for further electrowinning of metallic cobalt since both wastewater treatment and recovery require complex solutions and rarely only one method is sufficient integrated systems for industrial effluents are proposed before extraction neutralization with alkaline solutions is proposed to purify the pls from accompanying metals such as al iii cr iii or iron ions 31 32 precipitation of metal hydroxides is an easy way to remove these contaminations however particularly in highly acidic solutions neutralization consumes a lot of alkaline reagents if the acidity of pls was reduced fewer chemicals would be necessary therefore our team has conducted a preliminary investigation on diffusion dialysis dd as a pretreatment step before precipitation and extraction stripping stages to reduce acidity and separate as much h as possible from metal ions contained in a real pls 41 dd is one of the cheapest membrane techniques considered as best available technique bat due to low operating and maintenance costs low energy consumption a considerable reduction of fresh chemicals consumption and wastewater dumping this technique is widely applied for the recovery of free acids or bases from spent treatment bath solutions in the surface finishing and textile processes 42 43 anion exchange membranes aem enable anions e g cl so4 2 no3 etc to be transported from a feed to a dialysate together with highly mobile hydrogen ions and as a consequence the ph of the feed increases although it is accepted that the recovery of metals from industrial wastewater is important and necessary for the rational management of raw materials none has assessed the possibility of cobalt recovery from real pregnant leach solutions in the metallic form the aim and main novelty of our research is the presentation of a novel integrated system including diffusion dialysis precipitation liquid liquid extraction and stripping for the effective separation of cobalt ii and nickel ii as value added products from the real industrial effluent pregnant leach solution also preliminary electrowinning of metallic cobalt from a model solution was proposed to investigate if some admixtures of ni ii and cr iii in the co ii solution disturb the deposition of metallic cobalt additionally regeneration of the organic phase used for extraction is proposed to reuse the extractant which would contribute to less environmental burden and significantly lower operational costs 2 experimental 2 1 materials a real undiluted pls was sulfate chloride leaching liquor received after the treatment of stainless steel scraps and it was supplied by one of the polish companies involved in waste treatment this real solution was taken for investigation of cobalt ii recovery the content of the main compounds in the pls is presented in table 1 because of the high acidity of the pls the ph value was not measured the following reagents were used for analytical purposes and separation procedures naoh volumetric solution or microgranulate hno3 65 hcl 35 38 acetone p a purchased from avantor performance materials poland s a h2so4 95 from chempur poland decan 1 ol from merck germany exxsol d80 de aromatized aliphatic hydrocarbons from exxonmobil chemical usa as well as commercial acidic extractant bis 2 4 4 trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid cyanex 272 supplied by cytec industries inc usa solvay group all reagents were used as received without any purification the fumasep fad anion exchange membrane purchased from fumatech germany was used in dd according to the producer information the membrane has excellent properties regarding proton and anion transport as well as high efficiency given the metal ions rejection the basic properties are listed in table 2 this characteristic is predestinated for the operation in diffusions dialysis processes for the recovery of free acids from spent solutions 2 2 methods the proposed four stage process of metal ion separation from the actual post industrial wastewater integrates the following operations diffusion dialysis dd precipitation p extraction e stripping s the general sequence of the operations investigated in the study is presented in fig 1 2 2 1 diffusion dialysis procedure diffusion dialysis was carried out in a typical way both feed the real pls and dialysate deionized water phases were circulated counter current with a peristaltic pump for up to 120 min through the membrane module with the volume ratio vf vd 2 three various flow rates of phases were applied 2 3 3 9 and 4 8 dm3 h abbreviated in the work as dd i dd ii and dd iii respectively additionally to minimize the effect of local concentration differences upon the transport of the components through the membrane both solutions were intensively stirred in the dd module an anion exchange membrane fumasep fad fumatech germany was used with the operation area equal to 0 015 m2 during the dd the conductivity and concentrations of hydrogen cations and metal ions in dialysate as well as at the beginning and the end of dd in feed solution were measured 2 2 2 precipitation procedure precipitation of al iii and cr iii ions was carried out by slow addition of 30 naoh to the feed solution after dd up to ph 5 the precipitate was separated by centrifugation and the liquid phase was taken to the next step liquid liquid extraction 2 2 3 extraction stripping procedure extraction was carried out in a batch way with continuous monitoring of ph aqueous feed supernate after precipitation were mixed using a magnetic stirrer with the organic phase containing 0 6 m cyanex 272 and 5 v v decan 1 ol phase modifier in exxsol d80 volume ratio a o 2 at 23 2 c the extraction with 0 6 m cyanex 272 was carried out in two steps each time with the fresh organic phase to deplete co ii in the aqueous feed in each extraction step volume of the organic phase was twofold smaller than that of the aqueous one to concentrate co ii in the extract during the extraction 10 m naoh solution was added dropwise until the ph was set at 5 2 this ph value to separate co ii from ni ii was established in our previous research as the value resulting in the optimal selectivity of co ii extraction over ni ii 39 40 after the extraction was finished the mixtures were transferred to glass separation funnels and allowed to stand for phase separation the aqueous phase undergone a second stage of extraction in the same conditions as in the first stage stripping of metal ions from the mixed loaded organic phases obtained after both stages of extraction was carried out with 1 m h2so4 solution or a dialysate solution at volume ratio o a 5 for 15 min at 23 2 c in glass beakers equipped with magnetic stirrers then again the mixtures were transferred to glass separation funnels to allow phase separation standard deviations calculated for two repetitions of each step of the process did not exceed 8 for dd 8 for precipitation and extraction and 8 5 for stripping 2 2 4 regeneration procedure regeneration of the organic phase after one stage of stripping was carried out by the introduction of the second stripping stage with 1 m h2so4 to remove any possible metal residues and to restore cyanex 272 to its acidic form then the organic phase was washed several times with deionized water until a constant ph of the washings was achieved after phase separation the regenerated extractant was used for further extraction experiments as described in 2 2 3 section the procedure of extraction 2 stages stripping 2 stages washing was repeated ten times 2 2 5 electrolysis procedure the electrowinning of metallic cobalt has not been included in the sequence of the operations shown in fig 1 as only preliminary results for a model solution were presented in this study the model solution contained 30 2 g dm3 co ii 4 64 g dm3 ni ii and 0 1 g dm3 cr iii in 0 74 m h concentration 0 375 m h2so4 and its composition was based on the assumed composition of a real stripping electrolyte electrochemical studies consisted of metal deposition on carbon steel a hull cell was used as the electrolytic tank to analyze the wide range of deposition current density a 2 a direct current was used with 1 h time deposition the current density was determined based on approximated equations for current distribution in a hull cell 44 two electrode system was used the counter electrode was a pbcasn alloy autopart battery poland before the process the cathode surface was degreased in acetone 298 k 10 min in an ultrasonic washer and etched in 1 m hcl 298 k 5 min between each of these stages the surface was rinsed with distilled water thus the prepared electrode system was flooded with a model stripping solution 2 2 6 analytical methods atomic absorption spectroscopy contraa 300 analytik jena germany was applied to determine ni ii co ii cr iii cu ii fe iii ions concentrations in the aqueous solutions while microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy 4210 m p aes agilent santa clara california usa was applied for al iii analysis the concentrations of h and cl ions were controlled by potentiometric titration with 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m agno3 solutions respectively using metrohm 703 tistand equipment the concentration of so4 2 was measured by capillary isotachophoresis electrophoretic analyzer ea 100 villa labeco slovak republic the scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy edax images of the cobalt deposited samples were made using quanta 250 feg fei thermofisher scientific device with energy dispersive spectroscopy module 2 2 7 theoretical determination of speciation the speciation program consists of two software packages 45 hydra which contains a database with log k data at 25 c to define a chemical system and medusa which creates speciation diagrams based on the algorithms solgaswater 46 and haltafall 47 respectively the speciation was done for the different metal ions present in the real solution before removal of the contaminating ions and after precipitation of al iii fe iii cr iii hydroxides so4 2 cl co ii ni ii na h and traces of cr iii cu ii 2 3 calculations the effectiveness and efficiency of the diffusion dialysis process are characterized primarily by parameters such as rejection ratio acid flux total h recovery ratio and dialysis coefficient 48 49 the rejection ratio of metal ions r in dd was calculated according to eq 1 1 r v f 0 c f 0 v d t c d t v f 0 c f 0 100 acid flux jacid was calculated as the number of h moles crossing membrane area for time unit using the following expression eq 2 2 j a c i d c f 0 v f 0 c f t v f t a t in eqs 1 and 2 the following abbreviations were used c f 0 and c f t are metal or h concentrations in the feed at time 0 and time t respectively and c d t is metal concentration in the dialysate at time t v f 0 v f t are volumes of the feed before dd and after selected time t of dd respectively and v d t is a volume of the dialysate after selected time a effective area of the membrane equal to 0 015 m2 t time furthermore during the extraction and stripping processes the efficiencies and total yields were calculated masses of metal ions in the organic phases were calculated from the difference between the concentrations in the solutions before and after extraction taking into account the change in volume after the extraction due to the added naoh or h2so4 percentage extraction e eq 3 and percentage stripping s eq 4 were calculated from the contents of metal ions in the aqueous phases before c m 0 after c m a q extraction and after c m s t stripping v 0 v a q v s t are volumes of the feed raffinate stripping phases respectively 3 e v 0 c m 0 v a q c m a q v 0 c m 0 100 4 s v s t c m s t v 0 c m 0 v a q c m a q 100 distribution ratio of metal ions dm was defined as eq 5 5 d m c m o r g c m a q where c m o r g c m a q stand for the concentrations of metal ions after extraction in the organic and aqueous phases respectively selectivity of the extraction of metal ions was characterized by the separation coefficient β m 1 m 2 defined as eq 6 6 β m 1 m 2 d m 1 d m 2 the total yield of four stage co ii extraction stripping was calculated according to eq 7 7 y v s t c m s t v 0 c m 0 100 the ionic strength i was calculated according to the following eq 8 50 8 i 1 2 i 1 n c i z i 2 where c i is the molar concentration of ion i m and z i is the charge number of that ion 3 results and discussions 3 1 distribution of metal species in pls theoretical distribution of metal species existing in a real pls and in a solution after the precipitation of al iii fe iii and cr iii was estimated using the medusa program 45 and is shown in table 3 fractions of the species of one metal in pls are shown at ph 0 as the real solution is strongly acidic and 6 as after dd ph of the feed was increased to precipitate some metals for comparison also metal species of pls after precipitation solution depleted in fe iii al iii cr iii only at precipitation ph 6 are presented in this table plots of species distribution for pls before dd and after precipitation and ions of each metal in the ph range from 0 to 6 are shown in appendix figs a 1 and a 2 respectively the theoretical distribution shows that an increase in ph of the aqueous phase up to 6 does not cause significant changes in the distribution of nickel and cobalt sulfates however at ph 6 al iii and fe iii are present in solid form as al oh so4 and fe oh 2 7cl0 3 which is disadvantageous for further treatment i e extraction which is usually carried out with ph control at 5 0 although medusa does not display precipitation of cr iii at ph 6 in the real process it was confirmed that cr iii is precipitated and the results are presented in section 3 3 it is noteworthy that precipitation and change in solution composition resulting from this step decrease in ionic strength from 13 in the feed to 8 4 m does not affect the distribution of most metal species based on these theoretical calculations and our previous work 40 precipitation of co existing al iii cr iii and fe iii before extraction is necessary to avoid problems with phase separation during the extraction 3 2 diffusion dialysis dd the separation mechanism of the diffusion dialysis relies on the difference in concentration between the pls feed and deionized water which is the receiving solution dialysate since the effluent contains large amounts of metal ions and the membrane does not give full selectivity some of these metals are transferred across the membrane as presented for dd iii in fig 2 a similar relationship was observed for the other two dds i and ii with lower fluxes investigated in this study as well as by other authors 51 53 however the permeation of metal ions is much lower than that of proton h prajapati et al 52 concluded that low permeation of metal ions is due to high gibbs free energy of hydration of these ions thus the big size of hydrated metal ions and their hydrophilic nature hinder their permeation through the relatively hydrophobic membrane in the case of dd the effect of the applied flow rate is clearly visible fig 3 the higher the flow rate the less selective the membrane is for the metal ions present in the system as with the h ions this is a very beneficial phenomenon because more acid is removed from the pls solution the loss of metal ions especially co ii and ni ii is not the desired direction the results obtained shown in fig 3 translate into differences in the retention values of metal ions depending on the flow rate as presented in table a1 in the appendix the retention regardless of the metal ion under consideration decreases with increasing flow rate i e for co ii is equal to 99 3 96 3 and 94 2 respectively it is worth noting that the obtained relation between retention and flow rate was also observed by other researchers for example xiao and co workers 54 showed that the leakage ratios of metal ions na i k i mn ii zn ii mg ii increased as the flow rate decreased during dd with commercial anion exchange membrane aem from spent zinc sulfate electrolyte there is a trade off between hydrogen ions transport and metal ions hold in the dd process this problem is widely described in the literature 55 57 and scientists have been looking for solutions that will help to increase h mn selectivity the investigations indicated that this effect could be achieved by designing new types of anion exchange membranes i e quaternized poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide s with zwitterion groups 58 polysulfone graphene quantum dots composite 59 the self organized nanostructure of quaternary ammoniums with long hydrophilic side chains and hydrophobic poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide main chains 60 and via cationic functionalization of bromo poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide 61 or hexacations cross linked poly arylene ether sulfone 62 thus even better selectivity and recovery of the acid could be achieved which indicates the high potential of the dd process it should be noted that in most cases r is very high over 96 as the exception to this rule considerably lower retention of iron ions 92 should be pointed out permeation of metal ions through the aem can be explained by several factors first of all the determining factor is the valence of the metal ion for example monovalent cation has smaller hydrated ion radii and also lower electric repulsion from the positively charged surface of the aem is observed thus the dense architecture of the membrane matrix helps to limit the transport of the hydrated metal ions with bigger size 61 moreover in the considered pls or waste acidic solutions different ionic and neutral complexes of metals may be present and as a consequence interactions among these new formed compounds as well as with the membrane material may occur these phenomena could affect the dd transport of the components 63 65 in the considered system neutral positively and negatively charged both sulfate and chloride complexes may be formed the formation of various forms of the metal complexes explains the retention results obtained fig 4 shows a diagram of the change in h ion concentration in the dialysate in all the dd processes considered the concentration difference between the successive measurements was observed to decrease so it can be concluded that the number of hydrogen ions transferred to dialysate decreased over time it was also shown that after 2 h of running the test a steady state for acid recovery was not reached the results of acid flux calculated from eq 2 confirm this assumption fig 4 the values of the flux decrease significantly along time due to the reduction in the concentration driving force for all the considered dd experiments which is consistent with fick s law the same tendency of the acid fluxes during dd run was observed by other authors 53 65 it should be noted that the dialysis aims to achieve the maximum concentration of h ions in the dialysate on the one hand the reduction of the acid amount in the effluent will allow less sodium hydroxide to be used during the precipitation process and on the other hand the dialysate solution rich in hydrogen ions will be able to serve as a receiving phase in the stripping step as shown in fig 1 the results obtained indicate that both objectives have been achieved as can be seen in fig 5 the diffusion dialysis process allowed a significant acid reduction in the pls up to 50 while the concentration of acid in the dialysate reaches up to 3 m fig 4 it is noteworthy that the acid recovery is high despite the presence of a significant amount of accompanying ions studies on model solutions e g hydrochloric acid and fe3 66 or zn2 67 ions indicate that the presence of metal ions reduces the maximum amount of the acid recovered with dd the desired result of dd is a minimum metal ion content and a high concentration of hydrogen ions in the dialysate analysis of the results indicates that this can be achieved by conducting the process at a low flow rate but for a longer time the final concentration of metal ions in the dialysates which is very important information for application to stripping are presented in fig 3 for the dd iii process after 90 min and for all dds in table 5 h ranged from 1 5 to 3 m after 90 min of dd depending on the phase flow rates as was presented in fig 4 3 3 precipitation of al iii and cr iii precipitation is widely used as one of the metal separation methods as it does not require specialized apparatus co precipitation of valuable metals may occur which leads to more complex precipitate on the one hand and a lower concentration of the desired products on the other hand thus it is important to select a suitable precipitation agent and an appropriate ph as various metals may precipitate in different conditions for example al iii starts to precipitate at ph around 3 0 and cr iii at around 3 8 while co ii and ni ii precipitate at ph 6 0 and 7 2 respectively 68 fig 6 presents the differences in metal concentrations before and after precipitation and separation of the precipitate for solutions obtained after dd processes cr iii was removed almost completely from the aqueous phase after dd i and dd iii while in the solution after dd ii 1 74 g dm3 was still left changes in the concentrations are also associated with unavoidable dilution of the solutions because of the addition of naoh slight difference in co ii and ni ii concentration in dd ii solution fig 6b may suggest that this precipitation process was conducted with much less local ph growths than the other two if the added naoh is not mixed well immediately with the solution ph may locally achieve value above 6 or 7 which in turn leads to more intensive precipitation of all the metals present in the solution precipitation of significant amounts of co ii and ni ii as observed from the solution after dd i fig 6a is undesired because it results in less product after the whole recovery process this also means that more complex precipitate will be formed and more hazardous metals will remain in the waste stream this shows how important it is to develop optimal precipitation conditions and how even small differences in the process can change the overall efficiency change in concentration of cu ii and fe iii is much less visible it decreased from 0 13 0 15 to 0 01 g dm3 and from 0 07 0 11 to 0 g dm3 for cu ii and fe iii respectively cu ii is expected to precipitate at ph above 5 0 69 since the final ph in the experiments was around 5 0 the removal of cu ii from the solution should not be associated with its precipitation as the starting concentration is low compared with cr iii its decrease can be explained by the incorporation of ions into formed precipitate of cr iii hydroxide precipitation of fe iii is usually conducted at ph 3 0 4 0 70 in all three solutions after dd the concentration of fe iii is more than one hundred times lower than the concentration of cr iii so they can be easily either precipitated at the same ph or incorporated into cr iii precipitate precipitation of al iii was carried out efficiently concentration in the pls after the dd process was around 8 8 g dm3 and after precipitation it achieved no more than 0 02 g dm3 effective removal of this metal is necessary before the extraction stage because it would impede co ii extraction in two main ways at ph around 3 0 al iii starts either to precipitate or it can be separated from aqueous sulfate solutions by cyanex 272 71 precipitation in the extraction mixture prevents the process because it hinders the mixing and even distribution of naoh during ph adjustment co extraction of al iii ions with co ii pollutes the final product and makes it less useful for some purposes it may also create operational difficulties during electrolysis the solution after precipitating cr iii al iii and some admixtures of cu ii and fe iii needs to be separated from the precipitate to ensure that those metals will not dissolve back to the solution or prevent extraction by embedding co ii ions into the precipitate after centrifugation the solutions were passed to the extraction stripping process 3 4 extraction and stripping of metal ions the supernate purified from al iii fe ions and almost from cr iii 83 99 of precipitated cr iii and cu ii was taken for extraction to separate co ii from ions of other metals particularly ni ii the aim of extraction was the formation of two solutions co ii and ni ii electrolytes for electrolysis planned at a later stage to recover metallic cobalt the composition of the feeds the supernates after dd purified by precipitation for the extraction stage as well as concentrations of metal ions after the first and second steps of the extraction are given in table a2 appendix co ii extraction with cyanex 272 denoted as r 2 p o o h o r g in eqs 9 11 runs by h release from the extractant to the aqueous phase as the organophosphorous acids self associate forming dimers eq 10 that limits the number of extractant molecules available for the metal cations co ii extraction reactions can be written as follows 39 72 73 9 2 r 2 p o o h o r g c o a q 2 c o r 2 p o o 2 o r g 2 h a q 10 2 r 2 p o o h o r g r 2 p o o h 2 o r g 11 2 r 2 p o o h 2 o r g c o a q 2 c o r 2 p o o 2 r 2 p o o h 2 o r g 2 h a q pph during extraction must be controlled to provide a constant driving force for co ii exchange if ph decreases the equilibrium of reactions eqs 9 and 11 shifts to the left thus strongly determining metal ion extraction after two step extraction the concentration of ni ii cu ii and cr iii in the aqueous phase changed slightly while co ii content decreased significantly which means that the ions of this metal were almost completely transferred to the organic phase table 4 shows the obtained values of partition coefficients dm eq 5 of metal ions between the organic and aqueous phases for the 1st and 2nd extraction step high distribution ratios table 4 are consistent with efficient extraction values of extraction efficiency e eq 3 are presented in fig a3 in appendix although the highest value of d in the 1st step of e i was obtained for cu ii due to the small amount of this metal in the feed before extraction it can be considered a good result because the total concentration of cu ii in the organic phase was low the smallest d value in the 1st step occurs for ni ii either in the 1st and 2nd step of all the extractions carried out from 0 to 0 17 which is very desirable because enables ni ii to be separated from co ii this is also confirmed by high d values of co ii extraction in the 2nd steps of e i iii which means that these ions were selectively separated from the remaining ions present in the feed and transported to the organic phase the lowest separation factors of co ii from ni ii after e ii can be explained by local instability in ph control either overdosing of naoh solution or not efficient mixing ni ii can be extracted by cyanex 272 according to the same cation exchange reactions eqs 9 and 11 as co ii however nickel ii is octahedrally coordinated with the extractant e g n i r 2 p o o 2 r 2 p o o h x h 2 o 4 x on the contrary to tetrahedrally coordinated co ii i e c o r 2 p o o 2 r 2 p o o h 2 74 greater steric hindrance between the equatorial and axial ligands in the octahedral complex of ni ii than in the tetrahedral complex of co ii results in ineffective ni ii extraction which positively affects the selectivity of cobalt ii separation 75 the final stage of the investigation was the stripping of co ii from the loaded organic phase two various stripping phases were used i e 1 m h2so4 and dialysate obtained as a result of dd the dialysates from dd i iii described in section 3 2 were mixed together resulting in an acidic solution 2 72 m h containing small amounts of metal ions not rejected by the membrane i e 1 72 g dm3 ni ii 1 12 g dm3 co ii 0 002 g dm3 cu ii 0 31 g dm3 cr iii the idea of the dialysate application for stripping was to reuse the by product stream from dd and reduce the amount of waste produced during the process the efficiency of metal ion stripping is given in table 5 a comparison of the stripping with h2so4 and dialysate shows that the dialysate strips most of the metal ions more efficiently than the acid ni ii cu ii and cr iii were stripped quantitively however their final concentration in the electrolyte after stripping was much lower than co ii stripping was carried out at o a ratio 5 to enrich the electrolyte in co ii 3 5 regeneration of the organic phase during the stripping the extractant recovers h ions and returns to the acidic form of cyanex 272 that can be reused for extraction after stripping of metal ions to the acidic aqueous phase the extractant was subjected to a regeneration process consisting of the second stripping and washing the procedure of extraction 2 stages stripping 2 stages washing was repeated ten times and the results of total co ii extraction after two extraction stages with the regenerated cyanex 272 solution are presented in fig 7 it is clear that the efficiency of co ii extraction varies from 80 to 90 independently from the number of the extractant s regeneration cycles carried out moreover the lowest extraction percentage was noted for fresh extractant solution which was not subjected to any regeneration fluctuations are associated with the process conditions e g adding of naoh for ph control slight differences in local ph may lead to local increases which result in faster co ii transfer to the organic phase such high performances show a great opportunity to reuse the extractant which would contribute to less environmental burden and significantly lower operational costs 3 6 cobalt electrodeposition from stripping solution metals of the iron group can be deposited from sulfate solution typical bath composition for co electroplating contains over 100 g dm3 of co ii ph is about 5 0 cathode current efficiency is in the range 95 100 for current density 4 10 a dm2 76 in the situation of cobalt electrowinning from a high concentration of acid and low of co ii the release of gaseous h2 is thermodynamically preferred due to the lower reduction potential of metal ions compared to h the cathode reactions are as follows eqs 12 and 13 12 c o 2 2 e c o 13 2 h 2 e h 2 an increase in the rate of reaction eq 13 is preferred with a decrease in ph of the electrolyte 77 therefore the stripping solution for recovery of the purified co ii from the organic phase cannot be too acidic namely a compromise between stripping efficiency and further electrolysis efficiency should be worked out as a dialysate containing some admixtures of ni ii and cr iii was proposed as a stripping phase the preliminary electrowinning of metallic cobalt from a model solution containing 30 2 g dm3 co ii 4 64 g dm3 ni ii and 0 1 g dm3 cr iii in 0 74 m h was carried out the analysis of the metallic surface showed that cobalt covers the cathodes without significant inclusions of nickel or chromium at current density 4 6 a dm2 sem and edax images of metallic cobalt coating on a steel element obtained from the model solution are shown in fig 8 sem images and edax analysis showed relatively good coverage of cobalt on the steel cathode visible discontinuities of the coating in the form of a shape similar to a circle are areas in which hydrogen gas was released and blocked or hindered the metal deposition in the edax spectrum areas with the most intense hydrogen evolution have a blue color steel in the real stripping solution except admixtures of some metal ions also organic impurities extractant organic solvent can affect cobalt morphology and current efficiency of electrowinning 78 79 thus further efforts to investigate conditions of efficient cobalt electro deposition will be made in our future work 3 7 flowsheet of the integrated system for separation of co ii and ni ii from the industrial effluent to summarize the proposed process the masses of co ii and ni ii in the solutions after dd and in the ones after stripping are shown in table 6 the yield y of the four stage co ii separation process was calculated according to eq 7 and is presented also in table 6 the electrowinning of metallic cobalt has not been included in the flowsheet as only preliminary results for a model solution were presented in this study the co ii ni ii ratio in the stripping solution co ii rich electrolyte is completely inverse compared to the feed before and after dd although the total yield of co ii recovery in the integrated process is not high a valuable co ii rich electrolyte is produced the purification of the electrolyte for co electrowinning is an important stage due to the final quality of the deposited metal and energy consumption during electrolysis 77 79 the presence of several metals with similar reduction potentials in a solution makes the separation of a single element difficult while the reduction potentials for some accompanying metals e g iron fe 0 45 v are more negative than for cobalt ions 0 28 v these metals compete with cobalt electrolytic deposition only when a significant difference in their concentration in solution occurs low concentration of cobalt ions high of other metals however the presence of more noble metals e g cu 0 34 v ni 0 25 v interferes with the cobalt reduction and results in low current efficiency and contamination of the separated metal it should be mentioned that according to mishra et al 78 the current efficiency is unaffected by saturation of the electrolyte with traces of organic extractants it is noteworthy that yields of ni ii recovery to the raffinate after 1st step of extraction are in the range 56 63 not shown in table 6 moreover it should be highlighted that the proposed procedure allows the reuse of the treated waste streams which is in line with the assumptions of the circular economy 3 in the system proposed the only waste is the precipitated sludge mainly in the form of aluminium and chromium hydroxides and water from the regeneration washing of the extractant as the sludge contains mixed hydroxides difficult to be separated for saleable products after drying it should be safely landfilled the proposed procedure is also advantageous because it assumes the use of few reagents sodium hydroxide for precipitation and ph correction during extraction and the organic phase with the extractant which can be recycled and reused many times in the process as shown in section 3 5 based on the results presented in this work a block flow sheet of the integrated system for the separation of co ii and ni ii from the industrial effluent pls is proposed as shown in fig 9 the downstream processing of the cobalt ii containing pregnant leach solution in the integrated system for separation of co ii from wastewater comprised of diffusion dialysis dd to decrease the acidity of the industrial effluent followed by precipitation of al iii fe iii and cr iii hydroxides with cu ii admixture to mostly purify the target metal selective extraction of co ii with bis 2 4 4 trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid cyanex 272 and stripping of co ii from the loaded organic phase to form an electrolyte applied finally to recover the product in the form of metallic cobalt by electrowinning ni ii remained in the raffinate after extraction and formed ni ii rich electrolyte which can be also further treated to recover metallic nickel 3 8 practical applications and perspectives in the era of dwindling natural resources searching for other sources of raw materials is no longer an alternative but a necessity cobalt production constantly increases due to its importance for such strategic applications as batteries and cells catalysts superalloys hard materials pigments and ceramics magnets for example in 2000 the refined cobalt supply was on a level ca 40 000 mg in 2010 increased to about 70 000 mg and in 2025 its production and consumption are expected to be approximately 130 000 mg 80 it should be also emphasized that about 50 of world cobalt reserves are in the democratic republic of congo in central africa this high concentration of cobalt deposits in one politically sensitive country and global problems with increasing environmental pollution are the basic reason for searching for new sources of cobalt particularly regarding secondary resources 77 81 thus the paper presents the possibility of using an integrated system to recover cobalt as well as nickel in the metallic form from real industrial acidic wastewater the importance of this solution is mainly based on working with real effluents without their dilution or pre treatment step by step it was shown how to handle the wastewater concerning the process aspects moreover the investigated system presented schematically in fig 9 takes into account an important environmental aspect i e low emission thanks to using waste stream dialysate from dialysis as a stripping solution in the extraction step and further extractant regeneration and reuse the proposed process can be considered a starting point to elaborate in the future zero waste technology strongly supporting a circular economy by eliminating waste across the entire waste value chains through reuse and recycling 82 to reach this goal stepwise precipitation should be developed to deposit pure hydroxides of al iii fe iii cr iii that could be applied as coagulants pigments a mordant or further processed to oxides of these metals it is also noteworthy that the research carried out and the analysis of the scientific literature indicates further possibilities of improving the process efficiency its intensification could be obtained in some steps of the proposed integrated system e g by increasing the dd selectivity of the acid separation from metal salts in the feed it could be reached by changing the membrane material to high performance aem with a high density of membrane matrix and advanced surface modification i e by quaternary ammonium groups nevertheless it is important to select appropriate process parameters including flow rate at this stage of the research it can be stated that further improvement of the dd operation can be achieved without large investment outlays the next stages i e precipitation and extraction are strictly ph dependent so the most important issue in this case is the possibility of full and precise ph control the processes of electrolysis of cobalt compounds on an industrial scale in the presence of other heavy metal ions have been known for many years however for most of the 20th century the focus was on the electrolytic refining of cobalt from ores especially copper and nickel ones 20 81 83 however in comparison to the processes mentioned above the electrolytic metal separation from waste solutions differs as a consequence of the chemical composition of waste effluents especially a different level of metal ion concentration and pollutions and conductivity of the electrolyte preliminary results of the presented research show that using electrolytic methods on the technical scale of cobalt recovery from industrial waste is possible from a practical point of view the ability to scale up the process is also very important own preliminary studies indicate that the efficiency of the dd could be increased by the expansion of the membrane surface area it is known that one of the advantages of the membrane processes is the ease of scale enlargement precipitation scale up should be related to the stepwise deposition of hydroxides to limit the amount of sludge sent to waste landfills extraction stripping is easy to scale up and works on an industrial scale in some parts of the world in metal processing plants e g copper processing in chile for the scale up of electrolysis two factors should be considered low reduction potential of co2 co reaction and thermodynamically preferred reduction of h and ni2 it can result in low current efficiency for metallic cobalt production and or lower purity of the deposit 77 therefore it may be necessary to modify slightly the initial concentration of cobalt and nickel ions in the electrolyte and the value of the current density to summarize both own research and analysis of the available literature confirm the practical importance of the proposed integrated system for the recovery of metallic cobalt and nickel from waste solutions further investigation should focus on the improvement of the overall yield of the co ii separation process and on establishing of conditions for efficient electro deposition of metallic co from real stripping solutions taking into account the influence of contamination of the sulfate electrolyte with organic impurities i e the extractant and or organic solvent 4 conclusions the results indicate that diffusion dialysis allows an effective reduction in the acidity of the feed with a small loss of metal ions moreover it has been shown that the dialysates do not have to be treated as post process waste but can be successfully used as stripping agents thus forming co ii rich electrolyte for further electrodeposition of the metal hydroxide precipitation is an easy and effective way to separate multicomponent solutions containing al iii cr iii and fe iii ions separation of these metals is an important stage of solution preparation for the further extraction stage high distribution ratio values for co ii extraction with cyanex 272 at ph 5 2 mean that co ii can be selectively separated from the remaining ions present in the feed ni ii particularly and transported to the organic phase moreover effective regeneration and reuse of the extractant without any negative effect on the efficiency of co ii extraction was confirmed declaration of competing interest the

pregnant leach solution pls fig a2 shows the distribution of cu ii al iii and fe iii ion species respectively these ions are contaminants which precipitate in ph lower than 5 and therefore they have to be eliminated from the solution which is transferred to extraction step because extraction of co ii is carried out at ph above 5 in this figure there is also shown the distribution of nickel and cobalt ion species high concentration of sulfates of these metals is an advantage for the reaction with cyanex 272 in table a1 the results of dd of a pregnant leach solution are presented it is observed that the higher the flow rate of the aqueous phases in dd the less selective the membrane is for the metal ions present in the system the differences in the retention values of metal ions depending on the flow rate of the aqueous phases are presented in table a1 the composition of the feeds after dd the supernates in various conditions purified for extraction stage by precipitation as well as concentrations of metal ions after the first and second steps of the extraction are given in table a2 values of extraction efficiency of co ii ni ii cu ii and cr iii from the feed after dd with 0 6 m cyanex 272 at a o 2 ph 5 2 are presented in fig a3 
13753,this paper presents multistage hydrometallurgical separation of co ii from wastewater achieved in an integrated system containing diffusion dialysis dd to decrease the acidity of the industrial effluent pregnant leach solution pls followed by precipitation of al iii fe iii and cr iii hydroxides selective extraction of co ii with bis 2 4 4 trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid cyanex 272 stripping of co ii from the loaded organic phase to form an electrolyte dd results indicate that minimum metal ion content in the dialysate and high concentration of h 1 5 3 m can be achieved by conducting the process at a low flow rate but for a longer time the feed after dd was effectively purified by precipitation of cr iii al iii hydroxides and some admixtures of cu ii and fe iii to ensure that those metals will not disturb the liquid liquid extraction of co ii at ph 5 2 high distribution ratio values for co ii extraction mean that ions of this metal can be selectively separated from the remaining ions present in the feed especially ni ii and transported to the organic phase the application of h2so4 solution and the dialysate as stripping phases indicates that the dialysate more efficiently stripped most of the metal ions from the extract thus forming co ii rich electrolyte for further electrodeposition of the metal finally co ii electrowinning from a model stripping solution was investigated and the preliminary results showed that good quality metallic cobalt can be deposited keywords diffusion dialysis liquid liquid extraction cyanex 272 bis 2 4 4 trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid cobalt nickel separation cobalt recovery waste regeneration 1 introduction the increasing population and economic growth of the world demand a great volume of water potable and technological on the one hand and new resources of various materials e g metals on the other hand thus the recovery of metals from industrial effluents offers a promising solution by reducing the amount of wastewater and providing value added products that have a positive influence on the environmental protection the recovery conversion and re introduction of metals into the supply chain according to the concept of waste to resources wtr 1 become an integral part of sustainable economies of the developed countries e g circular economy in eu to minimize raw material input waste generation and the dependence on the imports of raw materials 2 4 metal containing industrial wastewaters come from various process activities e g cleaning processes and surface preparation degreasing pickling 5 6 metallic coatings

from such wastewaters before water recycling or dumping for this purpose various methods leading to water purification are proposed among them neutralization to precipitate metal hydroxides 5 membrane treatment ultrafiltration reverse osmosis 11 12 or biotechnologies biosorption microalgae 13 14 however these methods rather focus on water purification than on the recovery of metals for further use wtr concept instead ion exchange 15 16 classical or membrane based solvent extraction 5 6 17 and electrodeposition 18 19 are pointed out as regeneration methods with metal recovery facing huge demand for cobalt a key element in lithium ion batteries for electric cars and the lack of available sources of this metal in europe and the usa cobalt is considered a strategic or critical one 20 hence cobalt containing wastewaters are likely to become a prospective secondary resource of this metal as a chain link in the circular economy these mixtures in which cobalt is accompanied by iron and aluminium manganese zinc chromium and chemically similar nickel 21 need a multistage process to separate and recover particular metals either as metal ions salts or in the metallic form while numerous papers can be found concerning hydrometallurgical cobalt or nickel recovery from spent li ion 22 24 nimh 24 26 or other types of batteries 27 28 or spent catalysts e g hydrodesulfurization catalysts 10 29 extracting these metals from other spent materials is not so widely described also metal scraps of stainless steel can be considered a valuable source of nickel they contain up to 10 ni or cobalt special types of stainless steel for use in fuel cells coated with co 24 29 thus the hydrometallurgical route of steel scraps treatment which has a low operational cost and is considered more environmentally friendly and energy saving when compared to pyrometallurgy covers metal leaching with various mineral acids or their mixtures further some precious and valuable metals among them nickel and cobalt present in the pregnant leach solutions could be removed by further processing ahn and lee 30 have investigated ru iii separation from co ii containing model solutions based on real mixtures after leaching of a scrap of tungsten carbide cobalt hard metals with ruthenium admixture they have indicated that ion exchange was more efficient and less complicated to separate ru iii from co ii from hcl solution compared with solvent extraction with basic extractants i e trioctylmethylammonium chloride aliquat 336 and trioctylamine alamine 300 shen et al 31 have proposed five stage process for recovery and separation of co ii and ni ii from pls containing 24 85 g dm3 co ii 12 55 g dm3 ni ii 28 62 g dm3 fe ii 13 97 g dm3 cr iii and 0 44 g dm3 cu ii the multistage route includes metal leaching with 6 m hcl from alloy scraps cu ii cementation by iron scraps chemical precipitation of fe ii and cr iii selective extraction of co ii over ni ii with 30 trialkylamine in kerosene and tributylphosphate tbp and co ii stripping with 0 01 m hcl and finally crystallization of nickel chloride and electrodeposition of cobalt the final recovery amounted to 95 ni and 60 co with purity over 99 9 operations including precipitation and cementation have been also proposed to recover co ii and zn ii from zinc smelting slag 32 resulting in 88 cobalt and 98 zinc recoveries in the entire separation and purification processes it should be mentioned that to recover cobalt ii and separate it from nickel ii from other industrial effluents than pls other methods such as sorption at ion exchange resins or bio enhanced precipitation have been proposed 33 35 on the one hand iminodiacetate chelating resins have been more selective for ni ii than for co ii recovery from laterite leach tailings 33 on the other hand precipitation of metals with sulfide produced by sulfate reducing bacteria srb has given promising results for nickel ii cobalt ii separation from model solutions based on mine wastewater composition thanks to the differences in nickel ii and cobalt ii solubility in the presence of srb resulting from the complexation of ni ii by proteins produced by the bacteria i e desulfomicrobium baculatum stenotrophomonas maltophilia and desulfovibrio magneticus up to 99 ni ii remained soluble despite the availability of sulfide for precipitation while over 84 5 co ii sulfide was precipitated 34 a bio enhanced treatment of pyritic tailings containing up to 3 co deposited between 1967 and 1982 at the old tailings dam savage river in tasmania has shown that recovery of cobalt from this material is possible by a three step process including flotation biooxidation by a mixture of naturally occurring bacterial population acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and leptospirillum ferrooxidans and finally precipitation to produce co oh 2 intermediate salable product 35 liquid liquid extraction called also solvent extraction applied not only on an industrial scale e g recovery of cobalt from a complex oxide and sulfide ore in boleo process 36 but also to recover metals from low concentrated solutions or deposits of unconventional composition is proposed as an important stage for separation of nickel and cobalt to obtain clean products 37 our team has investigated extractive co ii removal from model and real sulfate solutions with bis 2 4 4 trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid cyanex 272 or its salts 10 38 40 in various conditions the finally proposed extractive separation of co ii from ni ii containing wastewater covers sustainable processing of waste as well as regeneration and reuse of the organic chemicals applied for extraction in two extraction stripping stages and three scrubbing stages 39 after this process a stripping phase is enriched in co ii and can be used as an electrolyte for further electrowinning of metallic cobalt since both wastewater treatment and recovery require complex solutions and rarely only one method is sufficient integrated systems for industrial effluents are proposed before extraction neutralization with alkaline solutions is proposed to purify the pls from accompanying metals such as al iii cr iii or iron ions 31 32 precipitation of metal hydroxides is an easy way to remove these contaminations however particularly in highly acidic solutions neutralization consumes a lot of alkaline reagents if the acidity of pls was reduced fewer chemicals would be necessary therefore our team has conducted a preliminary investigation on diffusion dialysis dd as a pretreatment step before precipitation and extraction stripping stages to reduce acidity and separate as much h as possible from metal ions contained in a real pls 41 dd is one of the cheapest membrane techniques considered as best available technique bat due to low operating and maintenance costs low energy consumption a considerable reduction of fresh chemicals consumption and wastewater dumping this technique is widely applied for the recovery of free acids or bases from spent treatment bath solutions in the surface finishing and textile processes 42 43 anion exchange membranes aem enable anions e g cl so4 2 no3 etc to be transported from a feed to a dialysate together with highly mobile hydrogen ions and as a consequence the ph of the feed increases although it is accepted that the recovery of metals from industrial wastewater is important and necessary for the rational management of raw materials none has assessed the possibility of cobalt recovery from real pregnant leach solutions in the metallic form the aim and main novelty of our research is the presentation of a novel integrated system including diffusion dialysis precipitation liquid liquid extraction and stripping for the effective separation of cobalt ii and nickel ii as value added products from the real industrial effluent pregnant leach solution also preliminary electrowinning of metallic cobalt from a model solution was proposed to investigate if some admixtures of ni ii and cr iii in the co ii solution disturb the deposition of metallic cobalt additionally regeneration of the organic phase used for extraction is proposed to reuse the extractant which would contribute to less environmental burden and significantly lower operational costs 2 experimental 2 1 materials a real undiluted pls was sulfate chloride leaching liquor received after the treatment of stainless steel scraps and it was supplied by one of the polish companies involved in waste treatment this real solution was taken for investigation of cobalt ii recovery the content of the main compounds in the pls is presented in table 1 because of the high acidity of the pls the ph value was not measured the following reagents were used for analytical purposes and separation procedures naoh volumetric solution or microgranulate hno3 65 hcl 35 38 acetone p a purchased from avantor performance materials poland s a h2so4 95

phosphinic acid cyanex 272 supplied by cytec industries inc usa solvay group all reagents were used as received without any purification the fumasep fad anion exchange membrane purchased from fumatech germany was used in dd according to the producer information the membrane has excellent properties regarding proton and anion transport as well as high efficiency given the metal ions rejection the basic properties are listed in table 2 this characteristic is predestinated for the operation in diffusions dialysis processes for the recovery of free acids from spent solutions 2 2 methods the proposed four stage process of metal ion separation from the actual post industrial wastewater integrates the following operations diffusion dialysis dd precipitation p extraction e stripping s the general sequence of the operations investigated in the study is presented in fig 1 2 2 1 diffusion dialysis procedure diffusion dialysis was carried out in a typical way both feed the real pls and dialysate deionized water phases were circulated counter current with a peristaltic pump for up to 120 min through the membrane module with the volume ratio vf vd 2 three various flow rates of phases were applied 2 3 3 9 and 4 8 dm3 h abbreviated in the work as dd i dd ii and dd iii respectively additionally to minimize the effect of local concentration differences upon the transport of the components through the membrane both solutions were intensively stirred in the dd module an anion exchange membrane fumasep fad fumatech germany was used with the operation area equal to 0 015 m2 during the dd the conductivity and concentrations of hydrogen cations and metal ions in dialysate as well as at the beginning and the end of dd in feed solution were measured 2 2 2 precipitation procedure precipitation of al iii and cr iii ions was carried out by slow addition of 30 naoh to the feed solution after dd up to ph 5 the precipitate was separated by centrifugation and the liquid phase was taken to the next step liquid liquid extraction 2 2 3 extraction stripping procedure extraction was carried out in a batch way with continuous monitoring of ph aqueous feed supernate after precipitation were mixed using a magnetic stirrer with the organic phase containing 0 6 m cyanex 272 and 5 v v decan 1 ol phase modifier in exxsol d80 volume ratio a o 2 at 23 2 c the extraction with 0 6 m cyanex 272 was carried out in two steps each time with the fresh organic phase to deplete co ii in the aqueous feed in each extraction step volume of the organic phase was twofold smaller than that of the aqueous one to concentrate co ii in the extract during the extraction 10 m naoh solution was added dropwise until the ph was set at 5 2 this ph value to separate co ii from ni ii was established in our previous research as the value resulting in the optimal selectivity of co ii extraction over ni ii 39 40 after the extraction was finished the mixtures were transferred to glass separation funnels and allowed to stand for phase separation the aqueous phase undergone a second stage of extraction in the same conditions as in the first stage stripping of metal ions from the mixed loaded organic phases obtained after both stages of extraction was carried out with 1 m h2so4 solution or a dialysate solution at volume ratio o a 5 for 15 min at 23 2 c in glass beakers equipped with magnetic stirrers then again the mixtures were transferred to glass separation funnels to allow phase separation standard deviations calculated for two repetitions of each step of the process did not exceed 8 for dd 8 for precipitation and extraction and 8 5 for stripping 2 2 4 regeneration procedure regeneration of the organic phase after one stage of stripping was carried out by the introduction of the second stripping stage with 1 m h2so4 to remove any possible metal residues and to restore cyanex 272 to its acidic form then the organic phase was washed several times with deionized water until a constant ph of the washings was achieved after phase separation the regenerated extractant was used for further extraction experiments as described in 2 2 3 section the procedure of extraction 2 stages stripping 2 stages washing was repeated ten times 2 2 5 electrolysis procedure the electrowinning of metallic cobalt has not been included in the sequence of the operations shown in fig 1 as only preliminary results for a model solution were presented in this study the model solution contained 30 2 g dm3 co ii 4 64 g dm3 ni ii and 0 1 g dm3 cr iii in 0 74 m h

approximated equations for current distribution in a hull cell 44 two electrode system was used the counter electrode was a pbcasn alloy autopart battery poland before the process the cathode surface was degreased in acetone 298 k 10 min in an ultrasonic washer and etched in 1 m hcl 298 k 5 min between each of these stages the surface was rinsed with distilled water thus the prepared electrode

made using quanta 250 feg fei thermofisher scientific device with energy dispersive spectroscopy module 2 2 7 theoretical determination of speciation the speciation program consists of two software packages 45 hydra which contains a database with log k data at 25 c to define a chemical system and medusa which creates speciation diagrams based on the algorithms solgaswater 46 and haltafall 47 respectively the speciation was done for the different metal ions present in the real solution before removal of the contaminating ions and after precipitation of al iii fe iii cr iii hydroxides so4 2

species in pls theoretical distribution of metal species existing in a real pls and in a solution after the precipitation of al iii fe iii and cr iii was estimated using the medusa program 45 and is shown in table 3 fractions of the species of one metal in pls are shown at ph 0 as the real solution is strongly acidic and 6 as after dd ph of the feed was increased to precipitate some metals for comparison also metal species of pls after precipitation solution depleted in fe iii al iii cr iii only at precipitation ph 6 are presented in this table plots of species distribution for pls before dd and after precipitation and ions of each metal in the ph range from 0 to 6 are shown in appendix figs a 1 and a 2 respectively the theoretical distribution shows that an increase in ph of the aqueous phase up to 6 does not cause significant changes in the distribution of nickel and cobalt sulfates however at ph 6 al iii and fe iii are present in solid form as al oh so4 and fe oh 2 7cl0 3 which is disadvantageous for further treatment i e extraction which is usually carried out with ph control at 5 0 although medusa does not display precipitation of cr iii at ph 6 in the real process it was confirmed that cr iii is precipitated and the results are presented in section 3 3 it is noteworthy that precipitation and change in solution composition resulting from this step decrease in ionic strength from 13 in the feed to 8 4 m does not affect the distribution of most metal species based on these theoretical calculations and our previous work 40 precipitation of co existing al iii cr iii and fe iii before extraction is necessary to avoid problems with phase separation during the extraction 3 2 diffusion dialysis dd the separation mechanism of the diffusion dialysis relies on the difference in concentration between the pls feed and deionized water which is the receiving solution dialysate since the effluent contains large amounts of metal ions and the membrane does not give full selectivity some of these metals are transferred across the membrane as presented for dd iii in fig 2 a similar relationship was observed for the other two dds i and ii with lower fluxes investigated in this study as well as by other authors 51 53 however the permeation of metal ions is much lower than that of proton h prajapati et al 52 concluded that low permeation of metal ions is due to high gibbs free energy of hydration of these ions thus the big size of hydrated metal ions and their hydrophilic nature hinder their permeation through the relatively hydrophobic membrane in the case of dd the effect of the applied flow rate is clearly visible fig 3 the higher the flow rate the less selective the membrane is for the metal ions present in the system as with the h ions this is a very beneficial phenomenon because more acid is removed from the pls solution the loss of metal ions especially co ii and ni ii is not the desired direction the results obtained shown in fig 3 translate into differences in the retention values of metal ions depending on the flow rate as presented in table a1 in the appendix the retention regardless of the metal ion under consideration decreases with increasing flow rate i e for co ii is equal to 99 3 96 3 and 94 2 respectively it is worth noting that the obtained relation between retention and flow rate was also observed by other researchers for example xiao and co workers 54 showed that the leakage ratios of metal ions na i k i mn ii zn ii mg ii increased as the flow rate decreased during dd with commercial anion exchange membrane aem from spent zinc sulfate electrolyte there is a trade off between hydrogen ions transport and metal ions hold in the dd process this problem is widely described in the literature 55 57 and scientists have been looking for solutions that will help to increase h mn selectivity the investigations indicated that this effect could be achieved by designing new types of anion exchange membranes i e quaternized poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide s with zwitterion groups 58 polysulfone graphene quantum dots composite 59 the self organized nanostructure of quaternary ammoniums with long hydrophilic side chains and hydrophobic poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide main chains 60 and via cationic functionalization of bromo poly 2 6 dimethyl 1 4 phenylene oxide 61 or hexacations cross linked poly arylene ether sulfone 62 thus even better selectivity and recovery of the acid could be achieved which indicates the high potential of the dd process it should be noted that in most cases r is very high over 96 as the exception to this rule considerably lower retention of iron ions 92 should be pointed out permeation of metal ions through the aem can be explained by several factors first of all the determining factor is the valence of the metal ion for example monovalent cation has smaller hydrated ion radii and also lower electric repulsion from the positively charged surface of the aem is observed thus the dense architecture of the membrane matrix helps to limit the transport of the hydrated metal ions with bigger size 61 moreover in the considered pls or waste acidic solutions different ionic and neutral complexes of metals may be present and as a consequence interactions among these new formed compounds as well as with the membrane material may occur these phenomena could affect the dd transport of the components 63 65 in the considered system neutral positively and negatively charged both sulfate and chloride complexes may be formed the formation of various forms of the metal complexes explains the retention results obtained fig 4 shows a diagram of the change in h ion concentration in the dialysate in all the dd processes considered the concentration difference between the successive measurements was observed to decrease so it can be concluded that the number of hydrogen ions transferred to dialysate decreased over time it was also shown that after 2 h of running the test a steady state for acid recovery was not reached the results of acid flux calculated from eq 2 confirm this assumption fig 4 the values of the flux decrease significantly along time due to the reduction in the concentration driving force for all the considered dd experiments which is consistent with fick s law the same tendency of the acid fluxes during dd run was observed by other authors 53 65 it should be noted that the dialysis aims to achieve the maximum concentration of h ions in the dialysate on the one hand the reduction of the acid amount in the effluent will allow less sodium hydroxide to be used during the precipitation process and on the other hand the dialysate solution rich in hydrogen ions will be able to serve as a receiving phase in the stripping step as shown in fig 1 the results obtained indicate that both objectives have been achieved as can be seen in fig 5 the diffusion dialysis process allowed a significant acid reduction in the pls up to 50 while the concentration of acid in the dialysate reaches up to 3 m fig 4 it is noteworthy that the acid recovery is high despite the presence of a significant amount of accompanying ions studies on model solutions e g hydrochloric acid and fe3 66 or zn2 67 ions indicate that the presence of metal ions reduces the maximum amount of the acid recovered with dd the desired result of dd is a minimum metal ion content and a high concentration of hydrogen ions in the dialysate analysis of the results indicates that this can be achieved by conducting the process at a low flow rate but for a longer time the final concentration of metal ions in the dialysates which is very important information for application to stripping are presented in fig 3 for the dd iii process after 90 min and for all dds in table 5 h ranged from 1 5 to 3 m after 90 min of dd depending on the phase flow rates as was presented in fig 4 3 3 precipitation of al iii and cr iii precipitation is widely used as one of the metal separation methods as it does not require specialized apparatus co precipitation of valuable metals may occur which leads to more complex precipitate on the one hand and a lower concentration of the desired products on the other hand thus it is important to select a suitable precipitation agent and an appropriate ph as various metals may precipitate in different conditions for example al iii starts to precipitate at ph around 3 0 and cr iii at around 3 8 while co ii and ni ii precipitate at ph 6 0 and 7 2 respectively 68 fig 6 presents the differences in metal concentrations before and after precipitation and separation of the precipitate for solutions obtained after dd processes cr iii was removed almost completely from the aqueous phase after dd i and dd iii while in the solution after dd ii 1 74 g dm3 was still left changes in the concentrations are also associated with unavoidable dilution of the solutions because of the addition of naoh slight difference in co ii and ni ii concentration in dd ii solution fig 6b may suggest that this precipitation process was conducted with much less local ph growths than the other two if the added naoh is not mixed well immediately with the solution ph may locally achieve value above 6 or 7 which in turn leads to more intensive precipitation of all the metals present in the solution precipitation of significant amounts of co ii and ni ii as observed from the solution after dd i fig 6a is undesired because it results in less product after the whole recovery process this also means that more complex precipitate will be formed and more hazardous metals will remain in the waste stream this shows how important it is to develop optimal precipitation conditions and how even small differences in the process can change the overall efficiency change in concentration of cu ii and fe iii is much less visible it decreased from 0 13 0 15 to 0 01 g dm3 and from 0 07 0 11 to 0 g dm3 for cu ii and fe iii respectively cu ii is expected to precipitate at ph above 5 0 69 since the final ph in the experiments was around 5 0 the removal of cu ii from the solution should not be associated with its precipitation as the starting concentration is low compared with cr iii its decrease can be explained by the incorporation of ions into formed precipitate of cr iii hydroxide precipitation of fe iii is usually conducted at ph 3 0 4 0 70 in all three solutions after dd the concentration of fe iii is more than one hundred times lower than the concentration of cr iii so they can be easily either precipitated at the same ph or incorporated into cr iii precipitate precipitation of al iii was carried out efficiently concentration in the pls after the dd process was around 8 8 g dm3 and after precipitation it achieved no more than 0 02 g dm3 effective removal of this metal is necessary before the extraction stage because it would impede co ii extraction in two main ways at ph around 3 0 al iii starts either to precipitate or it can be separated from aqueous sulfate solutions by cyanex 272 71 precipitation in the extraction mixture prevents the process because it hinders the mixing and even distribution of naoh during ph adjustment co extraction of al iii ions with co ii pollutes the final product and makes it less useful for some purposes it may also create operational difficulties during electrolysis the solution after precipitating cr iii al iii and some admixtures of cu ii and fe iii needs to be separated from the precipitate to ensure that those metals will not dissolve back to the solution or prevent extraction by embedding co ii ions into the precipitate after centrifugation the solutions were passed to the extraction stripping process 3 4 extraction and stripping of metal ions the supernate purified from al iii fe ions and almost from cr iii 83 99 of precipitated cr iii and cu ii was taken for extraction to separate co ii from ions of other metals particularly ni ii the aim of extraction was the formation of two solutions co ii and ni ii electrolytes for electrolysis planned at a later stage to recover metallic cobalt the composition of the feeds the supernates after dd purified by precipitation for the extraction stage as well as concentrations of metal ions after the first and second steps of the extraction are given in table a2 appendix co ii extraction with cyanex 272 denoted as r 2 p o o h o r g in eqs 9 11 runs by h release from the extractant to the aqueous phase as the organophosphorous acids self associate forming dimers eq 10 that limits the number of extractant molecules available for the metal cations co ii extraction reactions can be written as follows 39 72 73 9 2 r 2 p o o h o r g c o a q 2 c o r 2 p o o 2 o r g 2 h a q 10 2 r 2 p o o h o r g r 2 p o o h 2 o r g 11 2 r 2 p o o h 2 o r g c o a q 2 c o r 2 p o o 2 r 2 p o o h 2 o r g 2 h a q pph during extraction must be controlled to provide a constant driving force for co ii exchange if ph decreases the equilibrium of reactions eqs 9 and 11 shifts to the left thus strongly determining metal ion extraction after two step extraction the concentration of ni ii cu ii and cr iii in the aqueous phase changed slightly while co ii content decreased significantly which means that the ions of this metal were almost completely transferred to the organic phase table 4 shows the obtained values of partition coefficients dm eq 5 of metal ions between the organic and aqueous phases for the 1st and 2nd extraction step high distribution ratios table 4 are consistent with efficient extraction values of extraction efficiency e eq 3 are presented in fig a3 in appendix although the highest value of d in the 1st step of e i was obtained for cu ii due to the small amount of this metal in the feed before extraction it can be considered a good result because the total concentration of cu ii in the organic phase was low the smallest d value in the 1st step occurs for ni ii either in the 1st and 2nd step of all the extractions carried out from 0 to 0 17 which is very desirable because enables ni ii to be separated from co ii this is also confirmed by high d values of co ii extraction in the 2nd steps of e i iii which means that these ions were selectively separated from the remaining ions present in the feed and transported to the organic phase the lowest separation factors of co ii from ni ii after e ii can be explained by local instability in ph control either overdosing of naoh solution or not efficient mixing ni ii can be extracted by cyanex 272 according to the same cation exchange reactions eqs 9 and 11 as co ii however nickel ii is octahedrally coordinated with the extractant e g n i r 2 p o o 2 r 2 p o o h x h 2 o 4 x on the contrary to tetrahedrally coordinated co ii i e c o r 2 p o o 2 r 2 p o o h 2 74 greater steric hindrance between the equatorial and axial ligands in the octahedral complex of ni ii than in the tetrahedral complex of co ii results in ineffective ni ii extraction which positively affects the selectivity of cobalt ii separation 75 the final stage of the investigation was the stripping of co ii from the loaded organic phase two various stripping phases were used i e 1 m h2so4 and dialysate obtained as a result of dd the dialysates from dd i iii described in section 3 2 were mixed together resulting in an acidic solution 2 72 m h containing small amounts of metal ions not rejected by the membrane i e 1 72 g dm3 ni ii 1 12 g dm3 co ii 0 002 g dm3 cu ii 0 31 g dm3 cr iii the idea of the dialysate application for stripping was to reuse the by product stream from dd and reduce the amount of waste produced during the process the efficiency of metal ion stripping is given in table 5 a comparison of the stripping with h2so4 and dialysate shows that the dialysate strips most of the metal ions more efficiently than the acid ni ii cu ii and cr iii were stripped quantitively however their final concentration in the electrolyte after stripping was much lower than co ii stripping was carried out at o a ratio 5 to enrich the electrolyte in co ii 3 5 regeneration of the organic phase during the stripping the extractant recovers h ions and returns to the acidic form of cyanex 272 that can be reused for extraction after stripping of metal ions to the acidic aqueous phase the extractant was subjected to a regeneration process consisting of the second stripping and washing the procedure of extraction 2 stages stripping 2 stages washing was repeated ten times and the results of total co ii extraction after two extraction stages with the regenerated cyanex 272 solution are presented in fig 7 it is clear that the efficiency of co ii extraction varies from 80 to 90 independently from the number of the extractant s regeneration cycles carried out moreover the lowest extraction percentage was noted for fresh extractant solution which was not subjected to any regeneration fluctuations are associated with the process conditions e g adding of naoh for ph control slight differences in local ph may lead to local increases which result in faster co ii transfer to the organic phase such high performances show a great opportunity to reuse the extractant which would contribute to less environmental burden and significantly lower operational costs 3 6 cobalt electrodeposition from stripping solution metals of the iron group can be deposited from sulfate solution typical bath composition for co electroplating contains over 100 g dm3 of co ii ph is about 5 0 cathode current efficiency is in the range 95 100 for current density 4 10 a dm2 76 in the situation of cobalt electrowinning from a high concentration of acid and low of co ii the release of gaseous h2 is thermodynamically preferred due to the lower reduction potential of metal ions compared to h the cathode reactions are as follows eqs 12 and 13 12 c o 2 2 e c o 13 2 h 2 e h 2 an increase in the rate of reaction eq 13 is preferred with a decrease in ph of the electrolyte 77 therefore the stripping solution for recovery of the purified co ii from the organic phase cannot be too acidic namely a compromise between stripping efficiency and further electrolysis efficiency should be worked out as a dialysate containing some admixtures of ni ii and cr iii was proposed as a stripping phase the preliminary electrowinning of metallic cobalt from a model solution containing 30 2 g dm3 co ii 4 64 g dm3 ni ii and 0 1 g dm3 cr iii in 0 74 m h was carried out the analysis of the metallic surface showed that cobalt covers the cathodes without significant inclusions of nickel or chromium at current density 4 6 a dm2 sem and edax images of metallic cobalt coating on a steel element obtained from the model solution are shown in fig 8 sem images and edax analysis showed relatively good coverage of cobalt on the steel cathode visible discontinuities of the coating in the form of a shape similar to a circle are areas in which hydrogen gas was released and blocked or hindered the metal deposition in the edax spectrum areas with the most intense hydrogen evolution have a blue color steel in the real stripping solution except admixtures of some metal ions also organic impurities extractant organic solvent can affect cobalt morphology and current efficiency of electrowinning 78 79 thus further efforts to investigate conditions of efficient cobalt electro deposition will be made in our future work 3 7 flowsheet of the integrated system for separation of co ii and ni ii from the industrial effluent to summarize the proposed process the masses of co ii and ni ii in the solutions after dd and in the ones after stripping are shown in table 6 the yield y of the four stage co ii separation process was calculated according to eq 7 and is presented also in table 6 the electrowinning of metallic cobalt has not been included in the flowsheet as only preliminary results for a model solution were presented in this study the co ii ni ii ratio in the stripping solution co ii rich electrolyte is completely inverse compared to the feed before and after dd although the total yield of co ii recovery in the integrated process is not high a valuable co ii rich electrolyte is produced the purification of the electrolyte for co electrowinning is an important stage due to the final quality of the deposited metal and energy consumption during electrolysis 77 79 the presence of several metals with similar reduction potentials in a solution makes the separation of a single element difficult while the reduction potentials for some accompanying metals e g iron fe 0 45 v are more negative than for cobalt ions 0 28 v these metals compete with cobalt electrolytic deposition only when a significant difference in their concentration in solution occurs low concentration of cobalt ions high of other metals however the presence of more noble metals e g cu 0 34 v ni 0 25 v interferes with the cobalt reduction and results in low current efficiency and contamination of the separated metal it should be mentioned that according to mishra et al 78 the current efficiency is unaffected by saturation of the electrolyte with traces of organic extractants it is noteworthy that yields of ni ii recovery to the raffinate after 1st step of extraction are in the range 56 63 not shown in table 6 moreover it should be highlighted that the proposed procedure allows the reuse of the treated waste streams which is in line with the assumptions of the circular economy 3 in the system proposed the only waste is the precipitated sludge mainly in the form of aluminium and chromium hydroxides and water from the regeneration washing of the extractant as the sludge contains mixed hydroxides difficult to be separated for saleable products after drying it should be safely landfilled the proposed procedure is also advantageous because it assumes the use of few reagents sodium hydroxide for precipitation and ph correction during extraction and the organic phase with the extractant which can be recycled and reused many times in the process as shown in section 3 5 based on the results presented in this work a block flow sheet of the integrated system for the separation of co ii and ni ii from the industrial effluent pls is proposed as shown in fig 9 the downstream processing of the cobalt ii containing pregnant leach solution in the integrated system for separation of co ii from wastewater comprised of diffusion dialysis dd to decrease the acidity of the industrial effluent followed by precipitation of al iii fe iii and cr iii hydroxides with cu ii admixture to mostly purify the target metal selective extraction of co ii with bis 2 4 4 trimethylpentyl phosphinic acid cyanex 272 and stripping of co ii from the loaded organic phase to form an electrolyte applied finally to recover the product in the form of metallic cobalt by electrowinning ni ii remained in the raffinate after extraction and formed ni ii rich electrolyte which can be also further treated to recover metallic nickel 3 8 practical applications and perspectives in the era of dwindling natural resources searching for other sources of raw materials is no longer an alternative but a necessity cobalt production constantly increases due to its importance for such strategic applications as batteries and cells catalysts superalloys hard materials pigments and ceramics magnets for example in 2000 the refined cobalt supply was on a level ca 40 000 mg in 2010 increased to about 70 000 mg and in 2025 its production and consumption are expected to be approximately 130 000 mg 80 it should be also emphasized that about 50 of world cobalt reserves are in the democratic republic of congo in central africa this high concentration of cobalt deposits in one politically sensitive country and global problems with increasing environmental pollution are the basic reason for searching for new sources of cobalt particularly regarding secondary resources 77 81 thus the paper presents the possibility of using an integrated system to recover cobalt as well as nickel in the metallic form from real industrial acidic wastewater the importance of this solution is mainly based on working with real effluents without their dilution or pre treatment step by step it was shown how to handle the wastewater concerning the process aspects moreover the investigated system presented schematically in fig 9 takes into account an important environmental aspect i e low emission thanks to using waste stream dialysate from dialysis as a stripping solution in the extraction step and further extractant regeneration and reuse the proposed process can be considered a starting point to elaborate in the future zero waste technology strongly supporting a circular economy by eliminating waste across the entire waste value chains through reuse and recycling 82 to reach this goal stepwise precipitation should be developed to deposit pure hydroxides of al iii fe iii cr iii that could be applied as coagulants pigments a mordant or further processed to oxides of these metals it is also noteworthy that the research carried out and the analysis of the scientific literature indicates further possibilities of improving the process efficiency its intensification could be obtained in some steps of the proposed integrated system e g by increasing the dd selectivity of the acid separation from metal salts in the feed it could be reached by changing the membrane material to high performance aem with a high density of membrane matrix and advanced surface modification i e by quaternary ammonium groups nevertheless it is important to select appropriate process parameters including flow rate at this stage of the research it can be stated that further improvement of the dd operation can be achieved without large investment outlays the next stages i e precipitation and extraction are strictly ph dependent so the most important issue in this case is the possibility of full and precise ph control the processes of electrolysis of cobalt compounds on an industrial scale in the presence of other heavy metal ions have been known for many years however for most of the 20th century the focus was on the electrolytic refining of cobalt from ores especially copper and nickel ones 20 81 83 however in comparison to the processes mentioned above the electrolytic metal separation from waste solutions differs as a consequence of the chemical composition of waste effluents especially a different level of metal ion concentration and pollutions and conductivity of the electrolyte preliminary results of the presented research show that using electrolytic methods on the technical scale of cobalt recovery from industrial waste is possible from a practical point of view the ability to scale up the process is also very important own preliminary studies indicate that the efficiency of the dd could be increased by the expansion of the membrane surface area it is known that one of the advantages of the membrane processes is the ease of scale enlargement precipitation scale up should be related to the stepwise deposition of hydroxides to limit the amount of sludge sent to waste landfills extraction stripping is easy to scale up and works on an industrial scale in some parts of the world in metal processing plants e g copper processing in chile for the scale up of electrolysis two factors should be considered low reduction potential of co2 co reaction and thermodynamically preferred reduction of h and ni2 it can result in low current efficiency for metallic cobalt production and or lower purity of the deposit 77 therefore it may be necessary to modify slightly the initial concentration of cobalt and nickel ions in the electrolyte and the value of the current density to summarize both own research and analysis of the available literature confirm the practical importance of the proposed integrated system for the recovery of metallic cobalt and nickel from waste solutions further investigation should focus on the improvement of the overall yield of the co ii separation process and on establishing of conditions for efficient electro deposition of metallic co from real stripping solutions taking into account the influence of contamination of the sulfate electrolyte with organic impurities i e the extractant and or organic solvent 4 conclusions the results indicate that diffusion dialysis allows an effective reduction in the acidity of the feed with a small loss of metal ions moreover it has been shown that the dialysates do not have to be treated as post process waste but can be successfully used as stripping agents thus forming co ii rich electrolyte for further electrodeposition of the metal hydroxide precipitation is an easy and effective way to separate multicomponent solutions containing al iii cr iii and fe iii ions separation of these metals is an important stage of solution preparation for the further extraction stage high distribution ratio values for co ii extraction with cyanex 272 at ph 5 2 mean that co ii can be selectively separated from the remaining ions present in the feed ni ii particularly and transported to the organic phase moreover effective regeneration and reuse of the extractant without any negative effect on the efficiency of co ii extraction was confirmed declaration of competing interest the

pregnant leach solution pls fig a2 shows the distribution of cu ii al iii and fe iii ion species respectively these ions are contaminants which precipitate in ph lower than 5 and therefore they have to be eliminated from the solution which is transferred to extraction step because extraction of co ii is carried out at ph above 5 in this figure there is also shown the distribution of nickel and cobalt ion species high concentration of sulfates of these metals is an advantage for the reaction with cyanex 272 in table a1 the results of dd of a pregnant leach solution are presented it is observed that the higher the flow rate of the aqueous phases in dd the less selective the membrane is for the metal ions present in the system the differences in the retention values of metal ions depending on the flow rate of the aqueous phases are presented in table a1 the composition of the feeds after dd the supernates in various conditions purified for extraction stage by precipitation as well as concentrations of metal ions after the first and second steps of the extraction are given in table a2 values of extraction efficiency of co ii ni ii cu ii and cr iii from the feed after dd

drinking water multi response statistical optimization 1 introduction the natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in surface and underground water sources widely used in the production of drinking water nom is a complex mixture of organic compounds causing many problems in drinking water treatment plants dwtps 1 it greatly affects organoleptic properties of water taste color and odor 2 increases coagulant and disinfectant dose requirements in conventional dwtps promotes biological growth in distribution systems as well as increased levels of complexed metals and adsorbed organic pollutants 3 it is particularly concerning that chlorine may react even in the presence of tiny concentrations of dissolved organic matter dom in drinking water supplies to form disinfection by products dbps 4 well known as toxic hazardous and carcinogenic compounds 5 thus nom contents should be seriously minimized before the stream is fed in the disinfection unit at conventional dwtps in order to improve drinking water quality the conventional processes of water treatment even under optimal conditions exhibit an average efficiency to remove nom although usually higher coagulant dosages could be used it must be stressed the coagulation process being mainly efficient removing turbidity and just a fraction of the hydrophobic dissolved nom whereas in low turbid waters and strongly hydrophilic dissolved contents very high dosages of polymeric coagulants should be needed in turn conducting to all increased production of sludge low cost efficiency and some health issues by the remaining dissolved aluminum 6 thus along the past few years several advanced oxidation processes aops have been proposed as potential technologies to improve dwtps 3 7 10 they might reduce risks on public health mainly in low income countries aops primarily rely on the strong oxidation potential of hydroxyl radicals ho 2 8 v alongside other reactive oxygen species ros playing a significant role under circumneutral ph 11 to deplete a wide range of organic substances 3 12 accordingly aops promoting maximal degradation mainly mineralization of dissolved organic contaminants eq 1 under ambient conditions of temperature pressure and ph would be also the most cost effective and interesting to improve dwtps 9 1 n o m h o c o 2 h 2 o b y p r o d u c t s the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo has proven to be both efficient and inexpensive for degradation of toxic and bio resistant pollutants 13 furthermore the use of an appropriate solid catalyst is critical to maximize the efficiency improving consumption of the hydrogen peroxide the single reagent truly consumed along this heterogeneous fenton like process whereas achieving degradation even of the most refractory organic fractions 9 the effectiveness of any aop in this application strongly depends on the physicochemical characteristics of every particular water supply including ph temperature nom concentration and the presence of any other substance that may consume the oxidizing species ho and other ros in this regard alkalinity nitrates and nitrites 1 0 mg dm3 phosphates and sulfates 100 mg dm3 chlorides and bromides have shown to clearly affect the efficiency of the aops 14 the cwpo has demonstrated that it may operate in a wider ph range than the homogeneous fenton process 3 which is very important because surface waters supplying dwtps usually display circumneutral values cwpo is also environmental friendly and cheaper than other technologies such as ion exchange membranes or ultra nano filtration often used in drinking water treatment to solve such a kind of issues as it does not require either expensive devices large amounts of energy or sludge disposal the pillared interlayered clays pilcs have attracted special attention due to their high specific surface chemical stability abundance and low cost activating the cwpo process 13 15 al fe mixed pilcs constitute one of the most promising materials gathering these properties 3 their high activity eqs 2 4 has been mainly ascribed to iron sites incorporated through the pillaring process in the form of truly mixed pillars 16 17 this iron content is expected to be mainly represented in fe3 since the final annealing step is usually performed at 400 500 c under oxidizing atmosphere air 2 f e a l f e p i l c 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 f e a l f e p i l c 2 h 3 f e a l f e p i l c 2 h 2 o 2 f e a l f e p i l c 3 h o h o 4 f e a l f e p i l c 2 h o f e a l f e p i l c 3 h o in a previous study of the al fe pilc activated cwpo conducted on dissolved humic substances at ph 3 7 it was achieved up to 96 of chemical oxygen demand cod removal in 4 h alongside full color removal in less than 45 min 3 however such a low ph level is not feasible to be scaled up in the treatment of real surface waters in the purpose of improving dwtps regarding the solid catalyst perhaps its chemical stability against the metal leaching under conditions of reaction is the most important feature to care for real scale applications 9 but other key physicochemical properties might also be affected through its prolonged use in the oxidation of the highly challenging nom substrates 18 although several parameters have been reported affecting the cwpo performance including concentration of solid catalyst dose of hydrogen peroxide input organic content nom reaction time temperature starting ph 16 and concentration of the active metal usually fe in the solid catalyst fe active the catalyst concentration and hydrogen peroxide dosage are perhaps those most important parameters in the purpose of optimizing the process a proper balance between them could yield maximal efficiency whereas reducing parasitic reactions besides both parameters could be controlled in a real system while ph temperature and initial concentration would demand for extra costs in this sense the optimized fe h2o2 ratio fig 1 should be both the most cost effective by involving the lowest possible levels of both catalyst and concentration of free non reacted hydrogen peroxide in the reaction s effluent alongside the highest targeted responses 17 since it is quite easy to anticipate a strong correlation between the most influencing experimental factors the use of multivariate multi response statistical tools is compulsory in most of the reports dealing the removal of contaminants by heterogeneous fenton or photo fenton processes 19 20 the statistical tool response surface methodology rsm has been employed to assess combined effects of two or more factors on a target response however as long as we know there is a lack of studies under variable ambient conditions of parameters that could not be controlled in a real dwtp covariates besides the multi response desirability function that might allow obtaining a set of overall optimal conditions accomplishing all targeted responses at the same time has not been yet reported in this application also the levels of variables or covariates usually is adopted from literature reports but real parameters are crucial to enable best optimization finally to the best of our knowledge the cwpo degradation of nom using multivariate optimization has not been studied therefore this study was aimed at finding the optimal conditions of the main variables governing the cwpo degradation of nom using an al fe pilc clay catalyst by taking advantage of a not fully exploited chemometric method factorial design of experiments followed by rsm optimization with potential applicability assisting standard dwtps thus by means of a central composite design of experiments ccd the interactions between the main operational parameters of the process were assessed on a synthetic surrogate of surface water under variable levels of nom concentration resembling real water samples dose of hydrogen peroxide linked to the starting randomized content of nom and solid catalyst concentration were studied as experimental factors whereas input dissolved nom ph and temperature were considered as covariates the experimental ranges of the covariates were selected based on the reports of real water samples collected in advance at both coastal and mountain zones in nariño colombia the desirability allowed to determine the overall optimal conditions improving at the same time three responses color removal at 456 nm nom mineralization in terms of doc removal and consumption of hydrogen peroxide other catalytic experiments were then performed on a real surface water sample under optimized conditions of reaction the al fe pilc clay catalyst was fully characterized and its stability upon reuse throughout five sequential catalytic experiments studied in order to realize the more plausible causes of deactivation under prolonged use 2 experimental 2 1 materials the starting material for the preparation of the catalyst was a ca2 colombian bentonite clay the

characterization of the al fe pilc catalyst the al fe pilc clay catalyst was prepared according with the procedure recently reported by muñoz et al 22 a concentrated aqueous a l f e 13 7 interlayering precursor was prepared by mixing alcl3 6h2o and fecl3 6h2o in the lowest possible volume of water elemental aluminum was used as a self hydrolyzing agent stepwise added at 70 c under gentle stirring and reflux until its full dissolution the final experimental atomic metal ratio expressed in percentage of the active metal iron amrfe mol fe mol al mol fe was 22 1 and the final total metal concentration tmc al3 fe3 was 5 73 mol dm3 once ended the hydrolysis stage afterwards the refined starting clay 1 5 kg was slowly added over 4 h under constant and gentle stirring at 70 c to the previously prepared al fe hydrolyzed concentrated pillaring precursor the amount of clay was added in order to obtain a final content of 20 meq al3 fe3 g clay the so interlayered clay was repeatedly washed with distilled water by centrifugation a final heating at 400 c 2 h was applied to anchor pillars over the layered mineral surface the final product is hereafter denoted as the al fe pilc catalyst the cationic exchange capacity cec of the pillared material al fe pilc was determined by micro kjeldahl analysis on the nh4 homoionized materials 3 the elemental analysis of the solid materials was performed in a bruker s4 pioneer x ray fluorescence xrf dispersive wavelength equipment using 4 kw with a rh anode as x rays source and scintillation heavy elements from ti to u and flow light elements from na to sc detectors x ray diffraction patterns xrd were recorded over 60 mesh powdered samples using a bruker d8 advance diffractometer at 40 kv and 30 ma scanning speed of 2 29 2θ

micropore surfaces were determined using the t plot method harkins jura and de boer simultaneous gravimetric and dsc thermal analysis tga dsc were performed on a sdt q600 ta instruments apparatus on approximately 10 mg of sample measurements were taken at a heating rate of 10 c min from rt to 1000 c under 100 cm3 min of chromatographic zero air gas 78 1 of n2 99 999 and 21 9 of o2 99 6 0 5

all spectra were recorded at rt using the easidiff diffuse pike technology accessory with a 4 0 cm 1 resolution 2 3 synthetic surrogate and real surface water the synthetic water surrogate was prepared by mixing volumes in proper amount of every commercial standard in terms of doc percentage as shown in table 1 each standard represents one polar fraction either hydrophilic hydrophobic or transphilic and different molecular weights as close as possible to those fractions usually found dissolved in real surface waters streams 23 25 before mixing each standard was first dissolved in ultrahigh pure water σ 0 055 μs cm in the case of pgua and ha acids 2 0 cm3 of naoh 0 3 mol dm3 was also added once prepared the synthetic water total doc concentration 500 mg c dm3 proper dilutions were made to obtain the final synthetic water in the desired doc used in every catalytic experiment the set of optimized conditions of reaction was then applied over a raw surface water collected in the rural aqueduct vereda charandú ipiales nariño colombia and preserved at 4 0 c according to standard method 1060 26 main physicochemical properties of both the raw and the synthetic water samples are displayed in table 2 2 4 statistical multi response optimization of the cwpo degradation of nom taking into account that consumption of both the solid catalyst and h2o2 is the main component of costs of the fenton like cwpo operating in the treatment of real contaminated water hydrogen peroxide dose h2o2 d and catalyst concentration al fe pilc were selected as experimental factors while ph temperature of reaction and starting nom concentration were chosen as covariates since these are parameters affecting the cwpo overall performance but could not be easily controlled assisting a real drinking water treatment plant e g change of ph or temperature of an input stream could be expensive the optimal conditions of the al fe pilc catalyzed cwpo degradation of dissolved nom in synthetic water were determined through two sequential sets of 10 experiments each arranged in a rotational central composite 22 ccd statistical design of experiments doe1 and doe2 the levels of the experimental variables factors are shown in table 3 in order to account for the effect of the h2o2 d under variable input nom concentrations it was referred to the starting nom content mg h2o2 mg doc meanwhile the ranges of non controllable variables covariates were chosen by taking into account earlier measurements of the physicochemical properties exhibited by real water supplies 14 sample points 11 points from rural areas of the municipalities of tumaco and ipiales and 3 points from drinking water treatment plants dwtps of pasto ipiales and túquerres all in nariño southwest colombia the sample points represented a wide range of temperatures and altitudes 3 2900 meters over the sea level in order to perform the statistical optimization of the process under conditions as close as possible to those expected for real operation at urban dwtps and rural aqueducts the statistical distribution of every covariate parameter was determined from the collected data of all samples temperature 5 00 25 0 c mean 18 0 c standard deviation 5 67 c and doc concentrations 2 00 20 0 mg c dm3 mean 15 2 mg c dm3 standard deviation 5 0 mg c dm3 were simulated assuming normal distributions the ph was simulated through the cauchy distribution mode 7 03 scale 0 15 within a circumneutral range 6 0 9 0 the values of the covariates used in every design of experiments respected these distributions the response parameters were all analyzed at the final measured time of the cwpo reaction 3 h as follows i nom mineralization in terms of doc removal eq 5 ii fraction of hydrogen

response optimization by setting up a normalized desirability function from every single response optimum the statistical significance of each term was estimated by the probability value p value at 95 of confidence 27 the fitting capability of the models was evaluated by coefficient of determination r2 and adjusted r2 all statistical calculations were made using the statgraphics software package centurion xvi version 16 1 03 2 5 experiments of the cwpo removal of nom the catalytic experiments were performed under atmospheric pressure 72 kpa over 975 cm3 of the starting water sample in a 1 5 dm3 glass jacketed semi batch reactor equipped with continuous mechanical stirring of the reaction mixture 600 rpm and temperature controlled by an external thermostatic bath 0 1 c this catalytic test was slightly modified from a method reported in advance 3 as follows the powdered solid clay catalyst 60 mesh was dispersed into the water sample air bubbling 2 0 dm3 min was kept constant throughout the entire experiment the ph was only set at the beginning of the test only for synthetic water samples within the stage of 30 min starting the experiment without addition of hydrogen peroxide devoted to the equilibration between the solid and liquid phases 100 cm3 of hydrogen peroxide solution were then dropped gradually on the reacting suspension at 0 56 cm3 min constant flow rate throughout 3 h of catalytic reaction to promote its more efficient use by the catalytic system the targeted dose of hydrogen peroxide was controlled by the concentration of the added solution keeping constant the added volume table 4 table 1s see data statement periodic sampling 25 cm3 each time was made during 4 h of every full experiment 30 min of equilibration 3 h of cwpo reaction 30 min of final post reaction stage after the addition of hydrogen peroxide was complete every sample was immediately microfiltered millipore 0 45 μm once collected to determine true color and doc content in both cases excess of non reacted h2o2 was previously deactivated by adding 3 7 mg na2so3 mg h2o2 the error introduced in the measurements by nom adsorption in the micro filters was offset by applying an identical procedure on the starting water sample zero time of reaction 3 control experiments and the catalytic test at optimal conditions were performed in duplicates each 2 5 1 analytical methods nom concentrations were measured as doc in a toc l shimadzu apparatus detection limit 0 5 mg dm3 in the case of the starting or treated real water samples with doc concentrations 2 mg c dm3 a high sensitivity detection limit 4 0 μg dm3 platinum catalyst was instead used doc removal corresponds to nom mineralization further considering widespread quality control regulations on drinking water true color was used as response parameter standard method 2120c 26 using a 500 platinum cobalt units pcu standard color solution hach concentrations of free hydrogen peroxide were measured through the iodometric method at 361 nm linear range 0 0 mg dm3 15 0 mg dm3 28 all spectrophotometric measurements were made in an uv 2600 shimadzu spectrophotometer once finished every experiment the catalyst was filtered out and the total concentration of dissolved fe was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy in a perkin elmer 2380 spectrophotometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of the al fe pilc catalyst the al fe pilc catalyst has been characterized in its structural and textural properties to assess the success of the pillaring process table 5 more detailed properties displayed by the starting material and al fe pillared clays prepared from concentrated precursors are already available elsewhere 21 22 although conventional preparation of this kind of materials is usually performed with low total metal concentrations tmc 0 1 mol dm3 21 29 30 in this work a fairly higher tmc 5 73 mol dm3 was successfully used besides the iron incorporated in the final catalyst was 2 68 wt which is not only comparable but higher than 2 37 wt of incorporated iron obtained for a similar preparation but from diluted interlayering precursors 22 in accordance with previous works 16 31 the incorporated iron in the final solid predominantly in the form of keggin like mixed al fe polyoxocations can be considered as the content of the metal truly active in the cwpo process moreover the incorporation of aluminum and iron achieved compensating around 23 of the cec in the starting clay fairly lower against the one displayed by the same solid pillared from diluted precursors 59 21 probably due to the straight addition of the starting mineral over the interlayering solution which imposed significant diffusional restrictions as compared with the previous swelling of the clay mineral by suspension in water used in the standard procedure nevertheless taking into account that the increase in the microporous surface almost fully explained the increase in the bet surface table 5 an overwhelming evidence proving the successful pillaring of the clay 32 probably the lower cec compensation took place because the al fe polycations condensed in the concentrated precursor displayed lower average cationic charge but a similar content of aluminum and iron typically incorporated by means of diluted interlayering precursors besides the x ray diffraction patterns fig 1s see data statement of the starting clay and the al fe pilc also demonstrated the expansion of the basal spacing to 1 77 nm a value within the typical ranges exhibited by pillared clays 33 then all the textural properties incorporated amounts of al and fe and the xrd patterns of the al fe pilc catalyst support the successful pillaring procedure on the other hand since the drifts spectrum of the al fe pillared clay did not show significant changes in comparison with the starting clay figs 2 a and 2b it can be inferred that the chemical features of the layered framework were retained upon the pillaring process of the clay the al fe pilc catalyst displayed following absorptions in the medium ir ν max cm 1 1631 hoh 1026 and 478 siosi and si o 914 alaloh 694 cm 1 ho and 467 osio meanwhile in the near infrared region at 7072 cm 1 appeared an overtone of the stretching vibration of the structural oh in the starting layered mineral the ν δ combined band of water appeared at 5240 cm 1 whereas that of the structural oh bearing groups appeared at 4532 cm 1 strongly depending on the precise chemical environment 34 specially the one at the lower frequency in the near ir zone showed that no significant change in the chemistry of the surface took place upon the pillaring procedure or the reuse of the clay catalyst later analyzed as long as such groups are more prone to undergo reaction with extra framework interlayered species for instance either the al fe mixed oxide pillars in the final catalyst or some organic moieties blocking micropores through its sequential reuse in the oxidizing process therefore the al fe pilc catalyst prepared from highly concentrated precursors exhibited suitable physicochemical properties to be a high performing active material of the cwpo process thus to better figure out its true potential improving standard dwtps its main operating parameters were optimized in the degradation of dissolved nom 3 2 effect of main parameters on the catalytic response of cwpo doe1 the influence of both experimental factors catalyst concentration al fe pilc and hydrogen peroxide dose h2o2 d on the cwpo performance were first screened out by analysis of doe1 set of experiments for later comparison with the combined effects on all responses revealed by the statistical optimization doe2 the full results of doe1 experiments are summarized in table 1s see data statement the effect of the catalyst concentration on the nom removal can be estimated by comparison of the doe1 experiments at the same low level of h2o2 d 0 26 mg h2o2 mg doc at two very different catalyst concentrations 1 30 g dm3 and 5 20 g dm3 fig 3 a the highest values of nom mineralization 31 and hydrogen peroxide consumed 99 were achieved for the experiment with higher catalyst concentration 5 20 al fe pilc probably because at such low peroxide dosing the increasing catalyst concentration provided higher abundance of active metal sites leading to greater amount of oxidizing species potentially formed eqs 2 and 3 17 35 although the nom mineralization was rather low in both cases the higher doc conversion for 5 20 al fe pilc equivalent to 139 mg feactive dm3 respect to 1 30 al fe pilc equivalent to 35 mg feactive dm3 seemed fairly related to higher consumption of the added h2o2 inchaurrondo et al 36 recently found something similar varying the concentration of a catalyst cuo al2o3 from 1 0 25 g dm3 125 to 3125 mg cu2 dm3 under a constant peroxide to phenol ratio h2o2 phenol 18 where the conversion of hydrogen peroxide got improved from 22 to 100 whereas the mineralization slightly increased from 18 to 48 and the phenol conversion decreased from 75 to 71 however when the same comparison was performed at a different level of hydrogen peroxide dose 0 45 mg h2o2 mg doc fig 3b it was found a decreasing fraction of consumed h2o2 as a function of the amount of catalyst whereas the nom mineralization remained almost unchanged apparently in this case a high relative abundance of iron led to exaggerated consumption of radicals in the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 decreasing the efficiency of the oxidizing reagent in the degradation of the organic substrates eq 4 a somehow similar discrepancy was observed when the experiments were compared as a function of h2o2 d keeping constant the catalyst concentration first when increasing doses of the oxidizing agent were used in the presence of 3 25 g dm3 of catalyst 0 18 h2o2 vs 0 73 h2o2 fig 3c both the hydrogen peroxide consumed and the amount of mineralized substrate increased however such an increase was not proportional to the change in the experimental factor which was almost four fold increased suggesting that in this particular case probably the used catalyst concentration strongly limited the catalytic activation of the oxidizing reagent eq 2 meanwhile in the presence of a higher catalyst concentration 5 20 g dm3 a higher nom mineralization 42 was achieved at the higher plotted dose of hydrogen peroxide 0 65 h2o2 5 20 al fe pilc fig 3d eqs 2 and 3 accordingly it seems clear that realizing trends of a given factor in the fenton process by keeping constant the other one is not confident at all of course it also fails trying to realize the optimal conditions of reaction in order to maximize the catalytic responses at the lowest possible consumption of peroxide since the fenton mechanism shows a strong interaction between the variables catalyst concentration and dose of hydrogen peroxide a multivariate statistical approach may be then useful realizing optimal conditions of the fenton process 3 3 statistical optimization of the catalytic nom removal besides of explaining the above mentioned discrepancies the rsm treatment of the doe1 set of results table 1s see data statement showed that both experimental factors al fe pilc and h2o2 d displayed statistical significance on nom mineralization doc removal and color removal according to the pareto s diagrams not shown the influence of the response nom mineralization was positive as the factors increased the response also did whereas for color removal the influence of h2o2 d was negative over certain value the single response surface plots for nom mineralization and h2o2 consumed figs 2sa and 2sb see data statement showed increasing trends but without any noticeable curvature whereas the response surface as a function of color removal exhibited a curvature at middle peroxide dose and high catalyst concentrations fig 2sc see data statement eventually the multivariate response surface in terms of the desirability function fig 2sd see data statement allowed for the combination of the individual optimums of each response in order to elucidate a single set of optimal levels in the experimental factors favoring the simultaneous highest possible values in the three responses such optimum values and the corresponding modelled responses released by the doe1 set of experiments were 6 0 g dm3 of al fe clay catalyst and 0 34 mg h2o2 mg doc yielding 41 6 of nom mineralization 83 9 of h2o2 consumed and 63 1 of color removal respectively besides none of the covariates nom 0 t or ph displayed statistical significance within the studied ranges finally fig 2sd see data statement also suggested higher levels of the catalyst interesting to be surveyed together with narrowing the range of h2o2 d in order to better approach the optimal conditions of reaction in an extra set of experiments doe2 3 3 1 second set of experiments doe2 the full results of the doe2 set of experiments are displayed in table 4 and its rsm analysis targeting simultaneous maximization of all responses at fig 4 since the catalyst concentration increased significantly in this new set of experiments the statistical optimization was performed in this case using the responses previously divided per g of catalyst table 2s see data statement in order to offset the differential effect of the adsorption on the targeted responses the quadratic statistical models established for every single response are summarized in eqs 8 10 8 nom mineralization 134 96 560 15 h2o2 d 5 71 al fe pilc 683 54 h2o2 d 2 9 11 h2o2 d al fe pilc 0 78 al fe pilc 2 9 color removal 114 66 423 87 h2o2 d 8 96 al fe pilc 483 19 h2o2 d 2 1 79 h2o2 d al fe pilc 0 73 al fe pilc 2 10 h2o2 consumed 66 97 276 46 h2o2 d 6 97 al fe pilc 471 32 h2o2 d 2 23 43 h2o2 d al fe pilc 0 096 al fe pilc 2 the proposed models from individual responses displayed a good fitting based on the correlation coefficients r2 of 0 67 0 83 thereafter the simultaneous multi response optimization was successfully attained fig 4d from the individual models showing a pretty good desirability of 0 860 out of 1 0 in the optimum this is a good fitting considering the variable temperatures circumneutral ph values and starting doc concentrations employed in the set of catalytic experiments resembling natural conditions of diverse surface waters supplying dwtps at the tropic table 4 the found doe2 optimal conditions for every factor were al fe pilc 5 97 g dm3 and h2o2 d 0 45 mg h2o2 doc thus such statistical approach to this chemical problem achieved minimizing competitive reactions e g parasite consumption of h2o2 promoting the oxidizing radicals to preferentially react over the nom starting substrate or its by products at the same time it translated to maximal fraction of h2o2 consumed towards generation of strongly oxidizing species favoring the pathways of its previous catalytic activation over the straightforward attack on the organic substrates then improving the overall efficiency of the cwpo process the successful statistical optimization of the process here achieved probably obeyed to both i the dose of hydrogen peroxide was defined as a function of the starting nom concentration because it takes into account another crucial interaction between the main factors controlling the cwpo performance the h2o2 nom ratio fig 1 ii the use of the reacted fraction of h2o2 h2o2 consumed as one of the catalytic responses to be maximized resulted advantageous since this way the optimal conditions released by the statistical multi response optimization also took into account the most efficient possible use of the added hydrogen peroxide the only reagent actually consumed through the cwpo process it thereby ensured that the statistical optimization here achieved offers the most cost effective set of cwpo parameters targeting the dissolved nom depletion 3 3 2 effect of the ambient conditions covariates ph t and nom 0 no statistically significant effect at 95 confidence p values 0 05 of any of the studied covariates was found montgomery 37 reported that lack of significance may occur in this type of experimental designs when there is a large variance within the range of values of the experimental factors but it did not happen in this study thus the lack of significance of covariates in this application instead suggested that the cwpo process is not significantly affected within the experimental ranges of ph temperature and starting concentration of the targeted pollutant nom this is quite an interesting result since the assessed ranges for these covariates were those just found in real surface water supplies in other words it allows to infer a feasible al fe pilc activated cwpo process to be applied in the degradation of dissolved nom under ambient conditions where costly either ph or temperature control of the input stream would not be necessary within a broad range it might cost effectively assist conventional dwtps decreasing the typical chemical risk of the treated effluents occasioned by the standard disinfection via chlorination promoted by nom remnants 3 4 al fe pilc activated cwpo degradation of nom under optimal conditions of reaction using the optimal conditions of reaction found from doe2 another two catalytic tests were performed on both the synthetic and a real surface water sample control experiments were also performed to establish possible side effects affecting the measured catalytic responses catalyst s adsorption oxidizing effect by the straight attack of hydrogen peroxide on the organic substrates catalytic effect of the iron content in the starting clay homogeneous fenton and air bubbling 3 4 1 synthetic water the experiment under optimal conditions of reaction on the synthetic surrogate of water optimum exp table 4 displayed 75 4 of nom mineralization 56 6 of hydrogen peroxide consumed and 85 7 of color removal ph 7 0 19 c and 19 mg doc dm3 this is also compared with several control experiments fig 5 a murray et al 38 reported that 5 65 mg fe2 dm3 was necessary in the homogeneous fenton degradation of nom for drinking water production achieving around 90 95 of doc removal in 30 min of reaction ph 4 0 raw water initial doc 7 5 mg dm3 meanwhile moncayo lasso et al 39 employed 0 6 mg fe3 dm3 for the photo fenton degradation of nom raw water in the presence of 1 89 mg h2o2 mg doc with solar radiation from a compound parabolic collector cpc reactor at ph 6 5 this means that a dose almost 4 times higher of h2o2 than the optimal one here reported was required in that study to achieve 55 of mineralization of 5 3 mg dm3 of dissolved organic carbon from a real surface source it points out the outstanding performance of the optimized cwpo degradation of nom in the presence of al fe pilcs since it does not require any source of radiation the active metal is not leached in the treated effluent or precipitated forming residual sludge it is also worth noting the h2o2 dose 0 73 mg h2o2 mg doc and catalyst concentration 5 20 g dm3 employed in the control experiments which correspond to the two highest levels evaluated at doe1 as it can be seen even under such an extreme case of high catalyst concentration the catalyst adsorption could not explain more than 15 of the measured mineralization meanwhile straightforward attack of the oxidizing reagent in absence of catalyst showed less than 20 measured mineralization in third place the content of structural iron in the starting mineral clay showed negligible catalytic response sample starting material hydrogen peroxide confirming that the catalytic activity exhibited by al fe pillared catalyst in the cwpo reaction could be safely attributed to the metal content incorporated through the pillaring process 31 40 besides 61 9 mg dm3 of fe2 was used for comparison purposes with standard homogeneous system sample homogeneous fenton in this case although the nom mineralization was negligible almost 30 of the hydrogen peroxide got consumed fig 5c probably due to formation of insoluble iron oxy hydroxides significantly decomposing h2o2 under neutral ph 41 it has been reported that ph values greater than 4 0 lead to formation of ferrous ferric hydroxide complexes and eventually the solid oxyhydroxides deactivating the homogeneous fenton ferrous catalyst 42 in this sense tatibouet et al 43 reported the homogeneous fenton system achieving significant degradation of phenol even in the presence of strongly chelating organic substrates but the mineralization was very slow the opposite happening in the heterogeneous system therefore it ruled out any important homogeneous contribution e g leached iron from the catalyst to the observed overall performance of the process under close to neutral conditions of ph on the other hand the effect of n2 or air bubbling on the cwpo performance was compared at fig 5b it can be clearly seen that the air bubbling enhanced the catalytic performance 40 of nom mineralization in comparison with nitrogen or not bubbling at all which can be attributed to additional pathways of radical propagation provided by dissolved oxygen to the fenton mechanism 44 although nitrogen also increased a little the measured nom mineralization 22 against no bubbling 15 this likely occurred due to the constant removal of the co2 generated from the liquid phase favoring the overall mineralization of the contaminant finally the fraction of hydrogen peroxide consumed was evaluated at different conditions of reaction the fig 5c compares the theoretical h2o2 consumed assuming that it would be fully reacted at the same rate of the stepwise addition of the h2o2 into the reactor the reaction in ultrahigh pure water in the absence of any organic substrate the homogeneous fenton experiment and the experimental optimum test the control employing ultrapure water checked the catalytic decomposition of the h2o2 in very similar extent displayed by the rsm experimental optimum it also ruled out significant blocking of the metal active sites on the catalyst surface by adsorbed nom this effect was not meaningful probably due to the predominantly microporous nature of the catalyst surface since most of the active sites got stabilized through mixed al fe pillars in the interlayer space of the clay catalyst it also suggests that the heavier molecular weights of nom could not diffuse through and directly adsorb on the fe active sites preventing this way for the catalyst to get significantly inhibited by the above mentioned undesired effect it also agrees with the results reported by inchaurrondo et al 36 where they found higher decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in absence of phenol using a cuo al2o3 in that case attributed to higher h2o2 radical quenching therefore as reported 3 41 it is here unequivocally showed that the cwpo process activated by the al fe pilc clay catalyst essentially worked as an heterogeneous reaction then it is interesting to assess such optimal conditions in the cwpo treatment of a sample of real surface water to reveal its effectiveness on such a more complex real matrix 3 4 2 real surface water a catalytic test under found optimal conditions has been conducted on real surface water collected in the rural aqueduct charandú ipiales colombia physicochemical properties displayed in table 2 a comparison between the catalytic performance obtained on real surface water vs synthetic water is shown at fig 6 a in both cases the color removal 93 and 86 respectively was higher than nom mineralization 37 and 75 respectively moreover a more pronounced difference between both responses was observed in real water whereas in synthetic water almost all color degraded got fully mineralized the significant depletion in the carbon mineralization of the real water against the synthetic water is more likely explained by the fairly higher alkalinity 46 mg caco3 dm3 vs 5 0 mg caco3 dm3 chloride 13 3 mg cl dm3 vs 0 70 mg cl dm3 and sulfates 14 9 mg so4 2 dm3 vs 5 94 mg so4 2 dm3 contents displayed by the real system it is well known that either carbonate and bicarbonate chloride or sulfate contents may scavenge oxidizing radical species o x eqs 11 and 12 decreasing overall efficiency of the process 45 11 o x h c o 3 c o 3 o x 12 o x c l c l o x it has been reported that ho reacts with nom under a second order rate constant in the range of 1 4 4 5 108 m 1 s 1 meanwhile rate constants for ho quenching in natural waters under variable concentrations of either c o 3 2 1 0 10 mg dm3 s o 4 2 10 200 mg dm3 or c l 1 0 700 mg dm3 were recorded to be around 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 6 0 1010 m 1 s 1 and 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 respectively 45 46 it shows that a clear competitive effect is established between these inorganic anions and the organic targets for the oxidizing species generated in any fenton like aop including cwpo in this regard strong adsorption of these anions on the al fe pilc catalyst was not likely happening since its measured point of zero charge pzc was 4 52 47 determined by the batch equilibration method reported by cerovic et al 48 indicating that under circumneutral ph typical of nom dissolved in real surface waters the surface charge of the al fe pilc is essentially negative preventing significant adsorption of these anions on the surface furthermore although most of the dissolved nom fractions pka ph of reaction 7 0 should be also forbidden to be adsorbed on the negatively charged surface of the clay catalyst the weaker acidic fractions pka 7 0 would be still available to establish van der waals interactions with the catalyst surface this is perhaps the reason why even in the presence of scavenging concentrations of carbonates sulfates and chlorides the measured color removal was still significantly high nearly 95 of the starting true color content in the treatment of the real surface water however the doc mineralization was more affected in comparison with the synthetic surrogate depleting maximal elimination from around 75 to almost 40 after 3 5 h of the cwpo treatment in the other hand although both systems made similar use of the added hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the real surface water the reacted fraction was slightly higher also likely because of the presence of the scavenging anions nevertheless the al fe pilc cwpo treatment of a fully raw real surface water under improved conditions of reaction and ambient temperature and pressure proved to be useful for the almost full color removal and close to 40 mineralization of the organic carbon it might significantly improve drinking water quality in both rural and municipal aqueducts by enhancing organoleptic properties and decreasing chemical risk via lower dissolved organic matter available to form disinfection by products through the final chlorination at the lowest possible cost provided by this heterogeneous fenton like technology 3 5 stability and reusability of the clay catalyst to estimate the stability of the al fe pilc catalyst in a prolonged operation it was reused throughout five sequential catalytic trials table 4 recording the changes in the catalytic response specific surface simultaneous thermal tga dsc and drifts analyses the accumulated loss of catalytic response was around 1 5 in terms of nom mineralization and around of 3 5 in terms of color removal atomic absorption spectroscopy analyses of final treated water samples showed consistent concentrations of dissolved iron between 0 1 and 0 3 mg dm3 0 06 0 19 respect to the fe incorporated in the al fe pilc confirming a very low contribution of homogeneous fenton activation on either doc or color removal the high chemical stability of the al fe pilcs against the fe leaching under cwpo conditions of reaction has been reported in advance mainly for atomic metal rations below 5 0 in fe against the nominal full content of al plus fe 16 the adsorption isotherm of the starting clay was type iv according to the iupac system characteristic of mesoporous materials 22 the al fe pillared clay catalyst on the other hand exhibited an intermediate behavior between type i in the region of low relative pressures and type iv high relative pressures adsorption isotherms indicating a mixed microporous mesoporous nature fig 7 a as it can be seen the catalyst displayed a decrease in the specific surface upon reuse fig 7b but its adsorption isotherm remained showing mixed types i iv showing that no significant loss of either mechanical porous properties or catalytic performance table 4 would be expected after prolonged reuse such a decrease in sbet was almost fully represented by depletion in the external surface of the material sext suggesting that adsorption of high molecular weight fractions of nom was the more likely factor explaining this behavior it has been recently reported that long term operation of an fe3 al2o3 catalyst in the cwpo degradation of phenol mainly decayed by adsorption of permanent chelating organic acids 49 in other words it is remarkable that the microporous fraction of the specific surface the one generated upon pillaring of the starting clay and where those more active fe sites got located remained almost unchanged along the sequential reuse the simultaneous thermal analysis tga dsc of the al fe pilc fig 8 a displayed three thermal events typical of these kind of materials assigned as follows i desorption of physisorbed and coordinated water molecules endothermic peak tmin 87 9 c ii the so called structural dehydration endothermic peak tmin 454 3 c related to the condensation and subsequent release of water molecules coming from the structural hydroxyl groups dehydroxylation and iii phase transition corresponding to the thermal decomposition of the layered structure of the clay exothermic peak tmax 875 7 c more probably related with delamination of the clay phase the progressive adsorption of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface through reuse seems confirmed by the increasing mass loss displayed by al fe pilc 3 4 00 and al fe pilc 5 4 53 samples against the new al fe pilc 3 86 furthermore unlike formerly suggested 3 taking into account the negatively charged organic moieties of nom when dissolved at circumneutral ph apparently the accumulation of the carbonaceous content occurred on the external surface of the clay catalyst instead than blocking the micropores of the catalyst since the interaction with the catalyst surface also negatively charged is clearly disfavored it can be seen that mass loss at higher temperatures did not increase with longer use of the catalyst whereas the high temperature phase transition did not change either showing that the stability of the layered phase of the clay catalyst was not affected at all through reuse since no significant loss of activity was recorded on used catalysts table 4 reversible adsorption of either nom chelating intermediates and or oxidation by products on the catalyst surface must be then raised to happen at prolonged operation under continuous regime finally as a function of the reuse the al fe pilc catalyst showed decreasing intensity of all drifts signals fig 2 probably due to above mentioned accumulation of carbonaceous species on the external catalyst surface as well as by getting darker and hence less reflecting which affects the intensity of the signals obtained by this detection technique in the case of signals at ν max cm 1 444 700 and 914 for the al fe pilc 5 all were recorded in a similar fashion to the starting pillared clay catalyst however a new signal appeared at 1656 cm 1 that could be attributed to the co stretching vibrations in carboxylic acids or carbonyl species 50 the signal at 1026 cm 1 in the al fe pilc can be attributed to the sio structure the shifting towards lower wavenumbers may occur with the presence of natural organic matter due to the formation of localized chemical bonds with silanol groups at the edges of the clay mineral layers or a coordinative bond with metal cations coexisting or not with soft interactions like hydrogen bonding 51 furthermore the so called hydrophobic interactions may also took place favored by the highly complex structure of the natural organic matter macromolecules whose aromatic content is more likely to stay together and segregate from the water solution in this case it was more likely to occur very close to the surface at the edges of the clay layers taking into account that the siloxanes of the basal plane in this aluminosilicates by themselves are considered to be hydrophobic providing suitable spots for aromatic centers of nom 51 moreover as long as the signal at 4532 cm 1 in the nir spectral range corresponding to the structural oh bearing groups remained quite unchanged through the reuse it can be claimed that the mixed pillars predominantly stabilized within the microporous region of the clay catalyst persisted stable and active in the cwpo degradation of nom through the prolonged reuse 4 conclusions optimized degradation of dissolved natural organic matter was achieved by the al fe pilc activated catalytic wet peroxide oxidation under ambient and variable conditions of temperature nom content and circumneutral ph at semi batch scale the optimal operating conditions were found by the rsm multiresponse statistical approach desirability function in terms of catalyst concentration and dose of stepwise added hydrogen peroxide referred to the input content of nom doc content it strongly minimized the dose of hydrogen peroxide required for maximal carbon mineralization and color removal against those reported in advance for other fenton based processes besides since none of the assessed covariates ph t or nom concentration showed statistical significance on the overall efficiency of the process within the wide range of ambient conditions studied potential real scale application of this technology is favored to complement existing dwtps in order to enhance drinking water quality by reducing the chemical risk associated with the presence of doc at the final chlorine based disinfection stage moreover the presence of the scavenging species c l c o 3 2 a n d s o 4 2 typical in raw natural water supplies may significantly reduce the catalytic performance mainly the doc mineralization furthermore the al fe pillared clay catalyst exhibited negligible change in its catalytic performance as well as excellent stability throughout its reuse in up to five sequential catalytic rounds in terms of both i low iron leaching releasing iron concentrations always below 0 3 mg dm3 and ii scarce accumulation of low molecular weight nom by products presumably short chain carboxylic acids the slight decrease of the catalytic degradation along reuse then mainly occurred because of the reduction in the external surface of the catalyst by cumulative adsorption of high molecular weight nom fractions not significantly affecting the microporous region where most active sites of iron get primarily stabilized through the al fe mixed pillaring process

13754,the removal of dissolved natural organic matter nom using the fenton like catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo activated by an al fe pillared clay catalyst al fe pilc was optimized in a semi batch reactor the al fe pilc was prepared from concentrated precursors and fully characterized by standard physicochemical techniques drifts powder xrd xrf cec n2 adsorption and tga dsc analyses nom mineralization removal of dissolved organic carbon doc color removal and the fraction of h2o2 consumed were all successfully maximized by a multi response statistical desirability function circumneutral ph starting nom concentration and temperature were all assessed as non controllable variables covariates within ranges typical of real surface water found overall optimal conditions of reaction were 0 45 mg h2o2 mg doc 3 2 mg dm3 for 7 0 mg doc dm3 and 5 97 g dm3 of the al fe pilc clay catalyst that allowed obtaining up to 75 of doc mineralization and 86 of color removal from a synthetic surrogate of water meanwhile 37 of doc mineralization and 93 of color removal were achieved when applied on real raw surface water significant concentration of scavenging inorganic anions

drinking water multi response statistical optimization 1 introduction the natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in surface and underground water sources widely used in the production of drinking water nom is a complex mixture of organic compounds causing many problems in drinking water treatment plants dwtps 1 it greatly affects organoleptic properties of water taste color and odor 2 increases coagulant and disinfectant dose requirements in conventional dwtps promotes biological growth in distribution systems as well as increased levels of complexed metals and adsorbed organic pollutants 3 it is particularly concerning that chlorine may react even in the presence of tiny concentrations of dissolved organic matter dom in drinking water supplies to form disinfection by products dbps 4 well known as toxic hazardous and carcinogenic compounds 5 thus nom contents should be seriously minimized before the stream is fed in the disinfection unit at conventional dwtps in order to improve drinking water quality the conventional processes of water treatment even under optimal conditions exhibit an average efficiency to remove nom although usually higher coagulant dosages could be used it must be stressed the coagulation process being mainly efficient removing turbidity and just a fraction of the hydrophobic dissolved nom whereas in low turbid waters and strongly hydrophilic dissolved contents very high dosages of polymeric coagulants should be needed in turn conducting to all increased production of sludge low cost efficiency and some health issues by the remaining dissolved aluminum 6 thus along the past few years several advanced oxidation processes aops have been proposed as potential technologies to improve dwtps 3 7 10 they might reduce risks on public health mainly in low income countries aops primarily rely on the strong oxidation potential of hydroxyl radicals ho 2 8 v alongside other reactive oxygen species ros playing a significant role under circumneutral ph 11 to deplete a wide range of organic substances 3 12 accordingly aops promoting maximal degradation mainly mineralization of dissolved organic contaminants eq 1 under ambient conditions of temperature pressure and ph would be also the most cost effective and interesting to improve dwtps 9 1 n o m h o c o 2 h 2 o b y p r o d u c t s the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo has proven to be both efficient and inexpensive for degradation of toxic and bio resistant pollutants 13 furthermore the use of an appropriate solid catalyst is critical to maximize the efficiency improving consumption of the hydrogen peroxide the single reagent truly consumed along this heterogeneous fenton like process whereas achieving degradation even of the most refractory organic fractions 9 the effectiveness of any aop in this application strongly depends on the physicochemical characteristics of every particular water supply including ph temperature nom concentration and the presence of any other substance that may consume the oxidizing species ho and other ros in this regard alkalinity nitrates and nitrites 1 0 mg dm3 phosphates and sulfates 100 mg dm3 chlorides and bromides have shown to clearly affect the efficiency of the aops 14 the cwpo has demonstrated that it may operate in a wider ph range than the homogeneous fenton process 3 which is very important because surface waters supplying dwtps usually display circumneutral values cwpo is also environmental friendly and cheaper than other technologies such as ion exchange membranes or ultra nano filtration often used in drinking water treatment to solve such a kind of issues as it does not require either expensive devices large amounts of energy or sludge disposal the pillared interlayered clays pilcs have attracted special attention due to their high specific surface chemical stability abundance and low cost activating the cwpo process 13 15 al fe mixed pilcs constitute one of the most promising materials gathering these properties 3 their high activity eqs 2 4 has been mainly ascribed to iron sites incorporated through the pillaring process in the form of truly mixed pillars 16 17 this iron content is expected to be mainly represented in fe3 since the final annealing step is usually performed at 400 500 c under oxidizing atmosphere air 2 f e a l f e p i l c 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 f e a l f e p i l c 2 h 3 f e a l f e p i l c 2 h 2 o 2 f e a l f e p i l c 3 h o h o 4 f e a l f e p i l c 2 h o f e a l f e p i l c 3 h o in a previous study of the al fe pilc activated cwpo conducted on dissolved humic substances at ph 3 7 it was achieved up to 96 of chemical oxygen demand cod removal in 4 h alongside full color removal in less than 45 min 3 however such a low ph level is not feasible to be scaled up in the treatment of real surface waters in the purpose of improving dwtps regarding the solid catalyst perhaps its chemical stability against the metal leaching under conditions of reaction is the most important feature to care for real scale applications 9 but other key physicochemical properties might also be affected through its prolonged use in the oxidation of the highly challenging nom substrates 18 although several parameters have been reported affecting the cwpo performance including concentration of solid catalyst dose of hydrogen peroxide input organic content nom reaction time temperature starting ph 16 and concentration of the active metal usually fe in the solid catalyst fe active the catalyst concentration and hydrogen peroxide dosage are perhaps those most important parameters in the purpose of optimizing the process a proper balance between them could yield maximal efficiency whereas reducing parasitic reactions besides both parameters could be controlled in a real system while ph temperature and initial concentration would demand for extra costs in this sense the optimized fe h2o2 ratio fig 1 should be both the most cost effective by involving the lowest possible levels of both catalyst and concentration of free non reacted hydrogen peroxide in the reaction s effluent alongside the highest targeted responses 17 since it is quite easy to anticipate a strong correlation between the most influencing experimental factors the use of multivariate multi response statistical tools is compulsory in most of the reports dealing the removal of contaminants by heterogeneous fenton or photo fenton processes 19 20 the statistical tool response surface methodology rsm has been employed to assess combined effects of two or more factors on a target response however as long as we know there is a lack of studies under variable ambient conditions of parameters that could not be controlled in a real dwtp covariates besides the multi response desirability function that might allow obtaining a set of overall optimal conditions accomplishing all targeted responses at the same time has not been yet reported in this application also the levels of variables or covariates usually is adopted from literature reports but real parameters are crucial to enable best optimization finally to the best of our knowledge the cwpo degradation of nom using multivariate optimization has not been studied therefore this study was aimed at finding the optimal conditions of the main variables governing the cwpo degradation of nom using an al fe pilc clay catalyst by taking advantage of a not fully exploited chemometric method factorial design of experiments followed by rsm optimization with potential applicability assisting standard dwtps thus by means of a central composite design of experiments ccd the interactions between the main operational parameters of the process were assessed on a synthetic surrogate of surface water under variable levels of nom concentration resembling real water samples dose of hydrogen peroxide linked to the starting randomized content of nom and solid catalyst concentration were studied as experimental factors whereas input dissolved nom ph and temperature were considered as covariates the experimental ranges of the covariates were selected based on the reports of real water samples collected in advance at both coastal and mountain zones in nariño colombia the desirability allowed to determine the overall optimal conditions improving at the same time three responses color removal at 456 nm nom mineralization in terms of doc removal and consumption of hydrogen peroxide other catalytic experiments were then performed on a real surface water sample under optimized conditions of reaction the al fe pilc clay catalyst was fully characterized and its stability upon reuse throughout five sequential catalytic experiments studied in order to realize the more plausible causes of deactivation under prolonged use 2 experimental 2 1 materials the starting material for the preparation of the catalyst was a ca2 colombian bentonite clay the

characterization of the al fe pilc catalyst the al fe pilc clay catalyst was prepared according with the procedure recently reported by muñoz et al 22 a concentrated aqueous a l f e 13 7 interlayering precursor was prepared by mixing alcl3 6h2o and fecl3 6h2o in the lowest possible volume of water elemental aluminum was used as a self hydrolyzing agent stepwise added at 70 c under gentle stirring and reflux until its full dissolution the final experimental atomic metal ratio expressed in percentage of the active metal iron amrfe mol fe mol al mol fe was 22 1 and the final total metal concentration tmc al3 fe3 was 5 73 mol dm3 once ended the hydrolysis stage afterwards the refined starting clay 1 5 kg was slowly added over 4 h under constant and gentle stirring at 70 c to the previously prepared al fe hydrolyzed concentrated pillaring precursor the amount of clay was added in order to obtain a final content of 20 meq al3 fe3 g clay the so interlayered clay was repeatedly washed with distilled water by centrifugation a final heating at 400 c 2 h was applied to anchor pillars over the layered mineral surface the final product is hereafter denoted as the al fe pilc catalyst the cationic exchange capacity cec of the pillared material al fe pilc was determined by micro kjeldahl analysis on the nh4 homoionized materials 3 the elemental analysis of the solid materials was performed in a bruker s4 pioneer x ray fluorescence xrf dispersive wavelength equipment using 4 kw with a rh anode as x rays source and scintillation heavy elements from ti to u and flow light elements from na to sc detectors x ray diffraction patterns xrd were recorded over 60 mesh powdered samples using a bruker d8 advance diffractometer at 40 kv and 30 ma scanning speed of 2 29 2θ

micropore surfaces were determined using the t plot method harkins jura and de boer simultaneous gravimetric and dsc thermal analysis tga dsc were performed on a sdt q600 ta instruments apparatus on approximately 10 mg of sample measurements were taken at a heating rate of 10 c min from rt to 1000 c under 100 cm3 min of chromatographic zero air gas 78 1 of n2 99 999 and 21 9 of o2 99 6 0 5 absolute accuracy cryogas the 400 4000 cm 1 drifts spectra were recorded in a shimadzu ir tracer 100 spectrometer on approximately 1 5 mg of sample mixed with 100 mg of kbr fully dried at 110 c 1 h all spectra were recorded at rt using the easidiff diffuse pike technology accessory with a 4 0 cm 1 resolution 2 3 synthetic surrogate and real surface water the synthetic water surrogate was prepared by mixing volumes in proper amount of every commercial standard in terms of doc percentage as shown in table 1 each standard represents one polar fraction either hydrophilic hydrophobic or transphilic and different molecular weights as close as possible to those fractions usually found dissolved in real surface waters streams 23 25 before mixing each standard was first dissolved in ultrahigh pure water σ 0 055 μs cm in the case of pgua and ha acids 2 0 cm3 of naoh 0 3 mol dm3 was also added once prepared the synthetic water total doc concentration 500 mg c dm3 proper dilutions were made to obtain the final synthetic water in the desired doc used in every catalytic experiment the set of optimized conditions of reaction was then applied over a raw surface water collected in the rural aqueduct vereda charandú ipiales nariño colombia and preserved at 4 0 c according to standard method 1060 26 main physicochemical properties of both the raw and the synthetic water samples are displayed in table 2 2 4 statistical multi response optimization of the cwpo degradation of nom taking into account that consumption of both the solid catalyst and h2o2 is the main component of costs of the fenton like cwpo operating in the treatment of real contaminated water hydrogen peroxide dose h2o2 d and catalyst concentration al fe pilc were selected as experimental factors while ph temperature of reaction and starting nom concentration were chosen as covariates since these are parameters affecting the cwpo overall performance but could not be easily controlled assisting a real drinking water treatment plant e g change of ph or temperature of an input stream could be expensive the optimal conditions of the al fe pilc catalyzed cwpo degradation of dissolved nom in synthetic water were determined through two sequential sets of 10 experiments each arranged in a rotational central composite 22 ccd statistical design of experiments doe1 and doe2 the levels of the experimental variables factors are shown in table 3 in order to account for the effect of the h2o2 d under variable input nom concentrations it was referred to the starting nom content mg h2o2 mg doc meanwhile the ranges of non controllable variables covariates were chosen by taking into account earlier measurements of the physicochemical properties exhibited by real water supplies 14 sample points 11 points from rural areas of the municipalities of tumaco and ipiales and 3 points from drinking water treatment plants dwtps of pasto ipiales and túquerres all in nariño southwest colombia the sample points represented a wide range of temperatures and altitudes 3 2900 meters over the sea level in order to perform the statistical optimization of the process under conditions as close as possible to those expected for real operation at urban dwtps and rural aqueducts the statistical distribution of every covariate parameter was determined from the collected data of all samples temperature 5 00 25 0 c mean 18 0 c standard deviation 5 67 c and doc concentrations 2 00 20 0 mg c dm3 mean 15 2 mg c dm3 standard deviation 5 0 mg c dm3 were simulated assuming normal distributions the ph was simulated through the cauchy distribution mode 7 03 scale 0 15 within a circumneutral range 6 0 9 0 the values of the covariates used in every design of experiments respected these distributions the response parameters were all analyzed at the final measured time of the cwpo reaction 3 h as follows i nom mineralization in terms of doc removal eq 5 ii fraction of hydrogen

of confidence 27 the fitting capability of the models was evaluated by coefficient of determination r2 and adjusted r2 all statistical calculations were made using the statgraphics software package centurion xvi version 16 1 03 2 5 experiments of the cwpo removal of nom the catalytic experiments were performed under atmospheric pressure 72 kpa over 975 cm3 of the starting water sample in a 1 5 dm3 glass jacketed semi batch reactor equipped with continuous mechanical stirring of the reaction mixture 600 rpm and temperature controlled by an external thermostatic bath 0 1 c this catalytic test was slightly modified from a method reported in advance 3 as follows the powdered solid clay catalyst 60 mesh was dispersed into the water sample air bubbling 2 0 dm3 min was kept constant throughout the entire experiment the ph was only set at the beginning of the test only for synthetic water samples within the stage of 30 min starting the experiment without addition of hydrogen peroxide devoted to the equilibration between the solid and liquid phases 100 cm3 of hydrogen peroxide solution were then dropped gradually on the reacting suspension at 0 56 cm3 min constant flow rate throughout 3 h of catalytic reaction to promote its more efficient use by the catalytic system the targeted dose of hydrogen peroxide was controlled by the concentration of the added solution keeping constant the added volume table 4 table 1s see data statement periodic sampling 25 cm3 each time was made during 4 h of every full experiment 30 min of equilibration 3 h of cwpo reaction 30 min of final post reaction stage after the addition of hydrogen peroxide was complete every sample was immediately microfiltered millipore 0 45 μm once collected to determine true color and doc content in both cases excess of non reacted h2o2 was previously deactivated by adding 3 7 mg na2so3 mg h2o2 the error introduced in the measurements by nom adsorption in the micro filters was offset by applying an identical procedure on the starting water sample zero time of reaction 3 control experiments and the catalytic test at optimal conditions were performed in duplicates each 2 5 1 analytical methods nom concentrations were measured as doc in a toc l shimadzu apparatus detection limit 0 5 mg dm3 in the case of the starting or treated real water samples with doc concentrations 2 mg c dm3 a high

was filtered out and the total concentration of dissolved fe was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy in a perkin elmer 2380 spectrophotometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of the al fe pilc catalyst the al fe pilc catalyst has been characterized in its structural and textural properties to assess the success of the pillaring process table 5 more detailed properties displayed by the starting material and al fe pillared clays prepared from concentrated precursors are already available elsewhere 21 22 although conventional preparation of this kind of materials is usually performed with low total metal concentrations tmc 0 1 mol dm3 21 29 30 in this work a fairly higher tmc 5 73 mol dm3 was successfully used besides the iron incorporated in the final catalyst was 2 68 wt which is not only comparable but higher than 2 37 wt of incorporated iron obtained for a similar preparation but from diluted interlayering precursors 22 in accordance with previous works 16 31 the incorporated iron in the final solid predominantly in the form of keggin like mixed al fe polyoxocations can be considered as the content of the metal truly active in the cwpo process moreover the incorporation of aluminum and iron achieved compensating around 23 of the cec in the starting clay fairly lower against the one displayed by the same solid pillared from diluted precursors 59 21 probably due to the straight addition of the starting mineral over the interlayering solution which imposed significant diffusional restrictions as compared with the previous swelling of the clay mineral by suspension in water used in the standard procedure nevertheless taking into account that the increase in the microporous surface almost fully explained the increase in the bet surface table 5 an overwhelming evidence proving the successful pillaring of the clay 32 probably the lower cec compensation took place because the al fe polycations condensed in the concentrated precursor displayed lower average cationic charge but a similar content of aluminum and iron typically incorporated by means of diluted interlayering precursors besides the x ray diffraction patterns fig 1s see data statement of the starting clay and the al fe pilc also demonstrated the expansion of the basal spacing to 1 77 nm a value within the typical ranges exhibited by pillared clays 33 then all the textural properties incorporated amounts of al and fe and the xrd patterns of the al fe pilc catalyst support the successful pillaring procedure on the other hand since the drifts spectrum of the al fe pillared clay did not show significant changes in comparison with the starting clay figs 2 a and 2b it can be inferred that the chemical features of the layered framework were retained upon the pillaring process of the clay the al fe pilc catalyst displayed following absorptions in the medium ir ν max cm 1 1631 hoh 1026 and 478 siosi and si o 914 alaloh 694 cm 1 ho and 467 osio meanwhile in the near infrared region at 7072 cm 1 appeared an overtone of the stretching vibration of the structural oh in the starting layered mineral the ν δ combined band of water appeared at 5240 cm 1 whereas that of the structural oh bearing groups appeared at 4532 cm 1 strongly depending on the precise chemical environment 34 specially the one at the lower frequency in the near ir zone showed that no significant change in the chemistry of the surface took place upon the pillaring procedure or the reuse of the clay catalyst later analyzed as long as such groups are more prone to undergo reaction with extra framework interlayered species for instance either the al fe mixed oxide pillars in the final catalyst or some organic moieties blocking micropores through its sequential reuse in the oxidizing process therefore the al fe pilc catalyst prepared from highly concentrated precursors exhibited suitable physicochemical properties to be a high performing active material of the cwpo process thus to better figure out its true potential improving standard dwtps its main operating parameters were optimized in the degradation of dissolved nom 3 2 effect of main parameters on the catalytic response of cwpo doe1 the influence of both experimental factors catalyst concentration al fe pilc and hydrogen peroxide dose h2o2 d on the cwpo performance were first screened out by analysis of doe1 set of experiments for later comparison with the combined effects on all responses revealed by the statistical optimization doe2 the full results of doe1 experiments are summarized in table 1s see data statement the effect of the catalyst concentration on the nom removal can be estimated by comparison of the doe1 experiments at the same low level of h2o2 d 0 26 mg h2o2 mg doc at two very different catalyst concentrations 1 30 g dm3 and 5 20 g dm3 fig 3 a the highest values of nom mineralization 31 and hydrogen peroxide consumed 99 were achieved for the experiment with higher catalyst concentration 5 20 al fe pilc probably because at such low peroxide dosing the increasing catalyst concentration provided higher abundance of active metal sites leading to greater amount of oxidizing species potentially formed eqs 2 and 3 17 35 although the nom mineralization was rather low in both cases the higher doc conversion for 5 20 al fe pilc equivalent to 139 mg feactive dm3 respect to 1 30 al fe pilc equivalent to 35 mg feactive dm3 seemed fairly related to higher consumption of the added h2o2 inchaurrondo et al 36 recently found something similar varying the concentration of a catalyst cuo al2o3 from 1 0 25 g dm3 125 to 3125 mg cu2 dm3 under a constant peroxide to phenol ratio h2o2 phenol 18 where the conversion of hydrogen peroxide got improved from 22 to 100 whereas the mineralization slightly increased from 18 to 48 and the phenol conversion decreased from 75 to 71 however when the same comparison was performed at a different level of hydrogen peroxide dose 0 45 mg h2o2 mg doc fig 3b it was found a decreasing fraction of consumed h2o2 as a function of the amount of catalyst whereas the nom mineralization remained almost unchanged apparently in this case a high relative abundance of iron led to exaggerated consumption of radicals in the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 decreasing the efficiency of the oxidizing reagent in the degradation of the organic substrates eq 4 a somehow similar discrepancy was observed when the experiments were compared as a function of h2o2 d keeping constant the catalyst concentration first when increasing doses of the oxidizing agent were used in the presence of 3 25 g dm3 of catalyst 0 18 h2o2 vs 0 73 h2o2 fig 3c both the hydrogen peroxide consumed and the amount of mineralized substrate increased however such an increase was not proportional to the change in the experimental factor which was almost four fold increased suggesting that in this particular case probably the used catalyst concentration strongly limited the catalytic activation of the oxidizing reagent eq 2 meanwhile in the presence of a higher catalyst concentration 5 20 g dm3 a higher nom mineralization 42 was achieved at the higher plotted dose of hydrogen peroxide 0 65 h2o2 5 20 al fe pilc fig 3d eqs 2 and 3 accordingly it seems clear that realizing trends of a given factor in the fenton process by keeping constant the other one is not confident at all of course it also fails trying to realize the optimal conditions of reaction in order to maximize the catalytic responses at the lowest possible consumption of peroxide since the fenton mechanism shows a strong interaction between the variables catalyst concentration and dose of hydrogen peroxide a multivariate statistical approach may be then useful realizing optimal conditions of the fenton process 3 3 statistical optimization of the catalytic nom removal besides of explaining the above mentioned discrepancies the rsm treatment of the doe1 set of results table 1s see data statement showed that both experimental factors al fe pilc and h2o2 d displayed statistical significance on nom mineralization doc removal and color removal according to the pareto s diagrams not shown the influence of the response nom mineralization was positive as the factors increased the response also did whereas for color removal the influence of h2o2 d was negative over certain value the single response surface plots for nom mineralization and h2o2 consumed figs 2sa and 2sb see data statement showed increasing trends but without any noticeable curvature whereas the response surface as a function of color removal exhibited a curvature at middle peroxide dose and high catalyst concentrations fig 2sc see data statement eventually the multivariate response surface in terms of the desirability function fig 2sd see data statement allowed for the combination of the individual optimums of each response in order to elucidate a single set of optimal levels in the experimental factors favoring the simultaneous highest possible values in the three responses such optimum values and the corresponding modelled responses released by the doe1 set of experiments were 6 0 g dm3 of al fe clay catalyst and 0 34 mg h2o2 mg doc yielding 41 6 of nom mineralization 83 9 of h2o2 consumed and 63 1 of color removal respectively besides none of the covariates nom 0 t or ph displayed statistical significance within the studied ranges finally fig 2sd see data statement also suggested higher levels of the catalyst interesting to be surveyed together with narrowing the range of h2o2 d in order to better approach the optimal conditions of reaction in an extra set of experiments doe2 3 3 1 second set of experiments doe2 the full results of the doe2 set of experiments are displayed in table 4 and its rsm analysis targeting simultaneous maximization of all responses at fig 4 since the catalyst concentration increased significantly in this new set of experiments the statistical optimization was performed in this case using the responses previously divided per g of catalyst table 2s see data statement in order to offset the differential effect of the adsorption on the targeted responses the quadratic statistical models established for every single response are summarized in eqs 8 10 8 nom mineralization 134 96 560 15 h2o2 d 5 71 al fe pilc 683 54 h2o2 d 2 9 11 h2o2 d al fe pilc 0 78 al fe pilc 2 9 color removal 114 66 423 87 h2o2 d 8 96 al fe pilc 483 19 h2o2 d 2 1 79 h2o2 d al fe pilc 0 73 al fe pilc 2 10 h2o2 consumed 66 97 276 46 h2o2 d 6 97 al fe pilc 471 32 h2o2 d 2 23 43 h2o2 d al fe pilc 0 096 al fe pilc 2 the proposed models from individual responses displayed a good fitting based on the correlation coefficients r2 of 0 67 0 83 thereafter the simultaneous multi response optimization was successfully attained fig 4d from the individual models showing a pretty good desirability of 0 860 out of 1 0 in the optimum this is a good fitting considering the variable temperatures circumneutral ph values and starting doc concentrations employed in the set of catalytic experiments resembling natural conditions of diverse surface waters supplying dwtps at the tropic table 4 the found doe2 optimal conditions for every factor were al fe pilc 5 97 g dm3 and h2o2 d 0 45 mg h2o2 doc thus such statistical approach to this chemical problem achieved minimizing competitive reactions e g parasite consumption of h2o2 promoting the oxidizing radicals to preferentially react over the nom starting substrate or its by products at the same time it translated to maximal fraction of h2o2 consumed towards generation of strongly oxidizing species favoring the pathways of its previous catalytic activation over the straightforward attack on the organic substrates then improving the overall efficiency of the cwpo process the successful statistical optimization of the process here achieved probably obeyed to both i the dose of hydrogen peroxide was defined as a function of the starting nom concentration because it takes into account another crucial interaction between the main factors controlling the cwpo performance the h2o2 nom ratio fig 1 ii the use of the reacted fraction of h2o2 h2o2 consumed as one of the catalytic responses to be maximized resulted advantageous since this way the optimal conditions released by the statistical multi response optimization also took into account the most efficient possible use of the added hydrogen peroxide the only reagent actually consumed through the cwpo process it thereby ensured that the statistical optimization here achieved offers the most cost effective set of cwpo parameters targeting the dissolved nom depletion 3 3 2 effect of the ambient conditions covariates ph t and nom 0 no statistically significant effect at 95 confidence p values 0 05 of any of the studied covariates was found montgomery 37 reported that lack of significance may occur in this type of experimental designs when there is a large variance within the range of values of the experimental factors but it did not happen in this study thus the lack of significance of covariates in this application instead suggested that the cwpo process is not significantly affected within the experimental ranges of ph temperature and starting concentration of the targeted pollutant nom this is quite an interesting result since the assessed ranges for these covariates were those just found in real surface water supplies in other words it allows to infer a feasible al fe pilc activated cwpo process to be applied in the degradation of dissolved nom under ambient conditions where costly either ph or temperature control of the input stream would not be necessary within a broad range it might cost effectively assist conventional dwtps decreasing the typical chemical risk of the treated effluents occasioned by the standard disinfection via chlorination promoted by nom remnants 3 4 al fe pilc activated cwpo degradation of nom under optimal conditions of reaction using the optimal conditions of reaction found from doe2 another two catalytic tests were performed on both the synthetic and a real surface water sample control experiments were also performed to establish possible side effects affecting the measured catalytic responses catalyst s adsorption oxidizing effect by the straight attack of hydrogen peroxide on the organic substrates catalytic effect of the iron content in the starting clay homogeneous fenton and air bubbling 3 4 1 synthetic water the experiment under optimal conditions of reaction on the synthetic surrogate of water optimum exp table 4 displayed 75 4 of nom mineralization 56 6 of hydrogen peroxide consumed and 85 7 of color removal ph 7 0 19 c and 19 mg doc dm3 this is also compared with several control experiments fig 5 a murray et al 38 reported that 5 65 mg fe2 dm3 was necessary in the homogeneous fenton degradation of nom for drinking water production achieving around 90 95 of doc removal in 30 min of reaction ph 4 0 raw water initial doc 7 5 mg dm3 meanwhile moncayo lasso et al 39 employed 0 6 mg fe3 dm3 for the photo fenton degradation of nom raw water in the presence of 1 89 mg h2o2 mg doc with solar radiation from a compound parabolic collector cpc reactor at ph 6 5 this means that a dose almost 4 times higher of h2o2 than the optimal one here reported was required in that study to achieve 55 of mineralization of 5 3 mg dm3 of dissolved organic carbon from a real surface source it points out the outstanding performance of the optimized cwpo degradation of nom in the presence of al fe pilcs since it does not require any source of radiation the active metal is not leached in the treated effluent or precipitated forming residual sludge it is also worth noting the h2o2 dose 0 73 mg h2o2 mg doc and catalyst concentration 5 20 g dm3 employed in the control experiments which correspond to the two highest levels evaluated at doe1 as it can be seen even under such an extreme case of high catalyst concentration the catalyst adsorption could not explain more than 15 of the measured mineralization meanwhile straightforward attack of the oxidizing reagent in absence of catalyst showed less than 20 measured mineralization in third place the content of structural iron in the starting mineral clay showed negligible catalytic response sample starting material hydrogen peroxide confirming that the catalytic activity exhibited by al fe pillared catalyst in the cwpo reaction could be safely attributed to the metal content incorporated through the pillaring process 31 40 besides 61 9 mg dm3 of fe2 was used for comparison purposes with standard homogeneous system sample homogeneous fenton in this case although the nom mineralization was negligible almost 30 of the hydrogen peroxide got consumed fig 5c probably due to formation of insoluble iron oxy hydroxides significantly decomposing h2o2 under neutral ph 41 it has been reported that ph values greater than 4 0 lead to formation of ferrous ferric hydroxide complexes and eventually the solid oxyhydroxides deactivating the homogeneous fenton ferrous catalyst 42 in this sense tatibouet et al 43 reported the homogeneous fenton system achieving significant degradation of phenol even in the presence of strongly chelating organic substrates but the mineralization was very slow the opposite happening in the heterogeneous system therefore it ruled out any important homogeneous contribution e g leached iron from the catalyst to the observed overall performance of the process under close to neutral conditions of ph on the other hand the effect of n2 or air bubbling on the cwpo performance was compared at fig 5b it can be clearly seen that the air bubbling enhanced the catalytic performance 40 of nom mineralization in comparison with nitrogen or not bubbling at all which can be attributed to additional pathways of radical propagation provided by dissolved oxygen to the fenton mechanism 44 although nitrogen also increased a little the measured nom mineralization 22 against no bubbling 15 this likely occurred due to the constant removal of the co2 generated from the liquid phase favoring the overall mineralization of the contaminant finally the fraction of hydrogen peroxide consumed was evaluated at different conditions of reaction the fig 5c compares the theoretical h2o2 consumed assuming that it would be fully reacted at the same rate of the stepwise addition of the h2o2 into the reactor the reaction in ultrahigh pure water in the absence of any organic substrate the homogeneous fenton experiment and the experimental optimum test the control employing ultrapure water checked the catalytic decomposition of the h2o2 in very similar extent displayed by the rsm experimental optimum it also ruled out significant blocking of the metal active sites on the catalyst surface by adsorbed nom this effect was not meaningful probably due to the predominantly microporous nature of the catalyst surface since most of the active sites got stabilized through mixed al fe pillars in the interlayer space of the clay catalyst it also suggests that the heavier molecular weights of nom could not diffuse through and directly adsorb on the fe active sites preventing this way for the catalyst to get significantly inhibited by the above mentioned undesired effect it also agrees with the results reported by inchaurrondo et al 36 where they found higher decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in absence of phenol using a cuo al2o3 in that case attributed to higher h2o2 radical quenching therefore as reported 3 41 it is here unequivocally showed that the cwpo process activated by the al fe pilc clay catalyst essentially worked as an heterogeneous reaction then it is interesting to assess such optimal conditions in the cwpo treatment of a sample of real surface water to reveal its effectiveness on such a more complex real matrix 3 4 2 real surface water a catalytic test under found optimal conditions has been conducted on real surface water collected in the rural aqueduct charandú ipiales colombia physicochemical properties displayed in table 2 a comparison between the catalytic performance obtained on real surface water vs synthetic water is shown at fig 6 a in both cases the color removal 93 and 86 respectively was higher than nom mineralization 37 and 75 respectively moreover a more pronounced difference between both responses was observed in real water whereas in synthetic water almost all color degraded got fully mineralized the significant depletion in the carbon mineralization of the real water against the synthetic water is more likely explained by the fairly higher alkalinity 46 mg caco3 dm3 vs 5 0 mg caco3 dm3 chloride 13 3 mg cl dm3 vs 0 70 mg cl dm3 and sulfates 14 9 mg so4 2 dm3 vs 5 94 mg so4 2 dm3 contents displayed by the real system it is well known that either carbonate and bicarbonate chloride or sulfate contents may scavenge oxidizing radical species o x eqs 11 and 12 decreasing overall efficiency of the process 45 11 o x h c o 3 c o 3 o x 12 o x c l c l o x it has been reported that ho reacts with nom under a second order rate constant in the range of 1 4 4 5 108 m 1 s 1 meanwhile rate constants for ho quenching in natural waters under variable concentrations of either c o 3 2 1 0 10 mg dm3 s o 4 2 10 200 mg dm3 or c l 1 0 700 mg dm3 were recorded to be around 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 6 0 1010 m 1 s 1 and 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 respectively 45 46 it shows that a clear competitive effect is established between these inorganic anions and the organic targets for the oxidizing species generated in any fenton like aop including cwpo in this regard strong adsorption of these anions on the al fe pilc catalyst was not likely happening since its measured point of zero charge pzc was 4 52 47 determined by the batch equilibration method reported by cerovic et al 48 indicating that under circumneutral ph typical of nom dissolved in real surface waters the surface charge of the al fe pilc is essentially negative preventing significant adsorption of these anions on the surface furthermore although most of the dissolved nom fractions pka ph of reaction 7 0 should be also forbidden to be adsorbed on the negatively charged surface of the clay catalyst the weaker acidic fractions pka 7 0 would be still available to establish van der waals interactions with the catalyst surface this is perhaps the reason why even in the presence of scavenging concentrations of carbonates sulfates and chlorides the measured color removal was still significantly high nearly 95 of the starting true color content in the treatment of the real surface water however the doc mineralization was more affected in comparison with the synthetic surrogate depleting maximal elimination from around 75 to almost 40 after 3 5 h of the cwpo treatment in the other hand although both systems made similar use of the added hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the real surface water the reacted fraction was slightly higher also likely because of the presence of the scavenging anions nevertheless the al fe pilc cwpo treatment of a fully raw real surface water under improved conditions of reaction and ambient temperature and pressure proved to be useful for the almost full color removal and close to 40 mineralization of the organic carbon it might significantly improve drinking water quality in both rural and municipal aqueducts by enhancing organoleptic properties and decreasing chemical risk via lower dissolved organic matter available to form disinfection by products through the final chlorination at the lowest possible cost provided by this heterogeneous fenton like technology 3 5 stability and reusability of the clay catalyst to estimate the stability of the al fe pilc catalyst in a prolonged operation it was reused throughout five sequential catalytic trials table 4 recording the changes in the catalytic response specific surface simultaneous thermal tga dsc and drifts analyses the accumulated loss of catalytic response was around 1 5 in terms of nom mineralization and around of 3 5 in terms of color removal atomic absorption spectroscopy analyses of final treated water samples showed consistent concentrations of dissolved iron between 0 1 and 0 3 mg dm3 0 06 0 19 respect to the fe incorporated in the al fe pilc confirming a very low contribution of homogeneous fenton activation on either doc or color removal the high chemical stability of the al fe pilcs against the fe leaching under cwpo conditions of reaction has been reported in advance mainly for atomic metal rations below 5 0 in fe against the nominal full content of al plus fe 16 the adsorption isotherm of the starting clay was type iv according to the iupac system characteristic of mesoporous materials 22 the al fe pillared clay catalyst on the other hand exhibited an intermediate behavior between type i in the region of low relative pressures and type iv high relative pressures adsorption isotherms indicating a mixed microporous mesoporous nature fig 7 a as it can be seen the catalyst displayed a decrease in the specific surface upon reuse fig 7b but its adsorption isotherm remained showing mixed types i iv showing that no significant loss of either mechanical porous properties or catalytic performance table 4 would be expected after prolonged reuse such a decrease in sbet was almost fully represented by depletion in the external surface of the material sext suggesting that adsorption of high molecular weight fractions of nom was the more likely factor explaining this behavior it has been recently reported that long term operation of an fe3 al2o3 catalyst in the cwpo degradation of phenol mainly decayed by adsorption of permanent chelating organic acids 49 in other words it is remarkable that the microporous fraction of the specific surface the one generated upon pillaring of the starting clay and where those more active fe sites got located remained almost unchanged along the sequential reuse the simultaneous thermal analysis tga dsc of the al fe pilc fig 8 a displayed three thermal events typical of these kind of materials assigned as follows i desorption of physisorbed and coordinated water molecules endothermic peak tmin 87 9 c ii the so called structural dehydration endothermic peak tmin 454 3 c related to the condensation and subsequent release of water molecules coming from the structural hydroxyl groups dehydroxylation and iii phase transition corresponding to the thermal decomposition of the layered structure of the clay exothermic peak tmax 875 7 c more probably related with delamination of the clay phase the progressive adsorption of carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface through reuse seems confirmed by the increasing mass loss displayed by al fe pilc 3 4 00 and al fe pilc 5 4 53 samples against the new al fe pilc 3 86 furthermore unlike formerly suggested 3 taking into account the negatively charged organic moieties of nom when dissolved at circumneutral ph apparently the accumulation of the carbonaceous content occurred on the external surface of the clay catalyst instead than blocking the micropores of the catalyst since the interaction with the catalyst surface also negatively charged is clearly disfavored it can be seen that mass loss at higher temperatures did not increase with longer use of the catalyst whereas the high temperature phase transition did not change either showing that the stability of the layered phase of the clay catalyst was not affected at all through reuse since no significant loss of activity was recorded on used catalysts table 4 reversible adsorption of either nom chelating intermediates and or oxidation by products on the catalyst surface must be then raised to happen at prolonged operation under continuous regime finally as a function of the reuse the al fe pilc catalyst showed decreasing intensity of all drifts signals fig 2 probably due to above mentioned accumulation of carbonaceous species on the external catalyst surface as well as by getting darker and hence less reflecting which affects the intensity of the signals obtained by this detection technique in the case of signals at ν max cm 1 444 700 and 914 for the al fe pilc 5 all were recorded in a similar fashion to the starting pillared clay catalyst however a new signal appeared at 1656 cm 1 that could be attributed to the co stretching vibrations in carboxylic acids or carbonyl species 50 the signal at 1026 cm 1 in the al fe pilc can be attributed to the sio structure the shifting towards lower wavenumbers may occur with the presence of natural organic matter due to the formation of localized chemical bonds with silanol groups at the edges of the clay mineral layers or a coordinative bond with metal cations coexisting or not with soft interactions like hydrogen bonding 51 furthermore the so called hydrophobic interactions may also took place favored by the highly complex structure of the natural organic matter macromolecules whose aromatic content is more likely to stay together and segregate from the water solution in this case it was more likely to occur very close to the surface at the edges of the clay layers taking into account that the siloxanes of the basal plane in this aluminosilicates by themselves are considered to be hydrophobic providing suitable spots for aromatic centers of nom 51 moreover as long as the signal at 4532 cm 1 in the nir spectral range corresponding to the structural oh bearing groups remained quite unchanged through the reuse it can be claimed that the mixed pillars predominantly stabilized within the microporous region of the clay catalyst persisted stable and active in the cwpo degradation of nom through the prolonged reuse 4 conclusions optimized degradation of dissolved natural organic matter was achieved by the al fe pilc activated catalytic wet peroxide oxidation under ambient and variable conditions of temperature nom content and circumneutral ph at semi batch scale the optimal operating conditions were found by the rsm multiresponse statistical approach desirability function in terms of catalyst concentration and dose of stepwise added hydrogen peroxide referred to the input content of nom doc content it strongly minimized the dose of hydrogen peroxide required for maximal carbon mineralization and color removal against those reported in advance for other fenton based processes besides since none of the assessed covariates ph t or nom concentration showed statistical significance on the overall efficiency of the process within the wide range of ambient conditions studied potential real scale application of this technology is favored to complement existing dwtps in order to enhance drinking water quality by reducing the chemical risk associated with the presence of doc at the final chlorine based disinfection stage moreover the presence of the scavenging species c l c o 3 2 a n d s o 4 2 typical in raw natural water supplies may significantly reduce the catalytic performance mainly the doc mineralization furthermore the al fe pillared clay catalyst exhibited negligible change in its catalytic performance as well as excellent stability throughout its reuse in up to five sequential catalytic rounds in terms of both i low iron leaching releasing iron concentrations always below 0 3 mg dm3 and ii scarce accumulation of low molecular weight nom by products presumably short chain carboxylic acids the slight decrease of the catalytic degradation along reuse then mainly occurred because of the reduction in the external surface of the catalyst by cumulative adsorption of high molecular weight nom fractions not significantly affecting the microporous region where most active sites of iron get primarily stabilized through the al fe mixed pillaring process
