15970,in the current study we report enhanced treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by integration of electrooxidation eo with membrane bio reactor mbr for the first time integrated pre pilot eo mbr plant consisted of a 3d printed electrochemical flowcell equipped with graphite electrodes installed in the effluent recirculation line of an mbr equipped with a hollow fiber membrane module results demonstrated that 5 v was the optimum voltage level for an isolated eo system isolated eo system led to 40 cod removal and 2 5 fold biodegradability index bod5 cod improvement after 24 hr treatment at the optimum voltage of 5 v and 160 ml min 1 flowrate almost complete removal of cod and bod5 was observed for the eo mbr system with 160 ml min 1 recirculation rate and 24 hr hrt while respective values were 60 and 87 for the mbr system at same operational conditions oxidation of pharmaceutical compounds identified in real wastewater and the fate of main oxidation recalcitrant by products were confirmed using liquid chromatography techniques in addition the integrated eo mbr system led to significant membrane fouling mitigation with a 28 day extended operational time before reaching the trans membrane pressure tmp limit value of 30 kpa measurements revealed reduced extracellular polymeric substances eps concentration of membrane sludge cake layer of eo mbr along with significant reduction of proteinaceous compounds in the lb eps fraction of cake layer in comparison with isolated mbr system fouling behavior improvement of the eo mbr system was attributed to the electrophilic attack of electrochemically generated hydroxyl radicals to the electron rich moieties of eps organic foulants reduced proteinaceous humic like substances of lb eps from the cake layer were further confirmed by emission excitation matrix eem and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopic methods the results of current research provide a helpful basis for future studies by

have become a major concern throughout locations with an arid or semi arid climate scarcity of freshwater resources will lead to economic and environmental insecurity and eventually forced migration therefore to achieve sustainable growth objectives certain actions are required including water resource management and prioritizing between different sectors such as agriculture energy industries sanitation etc accurate policy implementation and most importantly wastewater treatment and reuse tortajada 2020 despite numerous studies and investments in this field industrial municipal wastewater treatment facilities face economic challenges such as high maintenance costs hernández chover et al 2021 or inadequate efficiency such as incapability of eliminating emerging pollutants including non metabolized or partially metabolized pharmaceutical compounds dyeing agents in textile industries microplastics etc from wastewater mirzaei et al 2019 khan et al 2020 maliwan et al 2021 due to its refractory nature emerging pollutants impose a serious challenge for the wastewater management concept and wastewater treatment industry to keep up with new effluent discharge quality regulations migo et al 2018 as an example a recent study by mirzaei et al 2019 demonstrates the incapability of conventional wastewater treatment plants a2o configuration anaerobic anoxic and oxic tanks for complete removal of commonly prescribed antibiotics from municipal wastewater streams accordingly there is a substantial necessity for the development of novel and cost effective wastewater treatment processes capable of efficient treatment of municipal industrial wastewater streams and removal of emerging pollutions among various wastewater treatment solutions membrane bio reactors mbr have shown great potential for effective removal of pharmaceuticals and micro pollutants in comparison with conventional activated sludge cas systems khan et al 2020 mbr systems benefit from the synergy of membrane separation processes and biological reactors ma et al 2018 however membrane fouling issues pumping energy requirements and biodegradability problem of organic pollutants incapability toward removal of bio recalcitrant drugs such as carbamazepine joannis cassan et al 2021 are the main drawbacks of mbr systems wang et al 2022 on the other hand advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation photocatalysis fenton reaction and electrochemical oxidation lead to substantial mineralization of refractory organic compounds and improvement of biodegradability of pollutants perisic et al 2016 rostamizadeh et al 2018 elmobarak et al 2021 pieus thanikkal and pooppana antony 2021 electrooxidation eo has been proposed as an inexpensive and green process for remediation of organics polluted wastewaters since it requires no hazardous chemicals and hydroxyl radicals which act as oxidizing agents are produced in situ gharibian et al 2020 however oxidation by products may become more toxic than parent organic compounds which require further polishing to meet discharge standards särkkä et al 2015 ouarda et al 2018 moreover refractory pollutants are oxidized to a certain mineralization degree where by products are not further oxidized by the electrophilic attack and become recalcitrant toward further chemical oxidation särkkä et al 2015 ouarda et al 2018 in recent years numerous studies have been dedicated to improving mbr performance such as the incorporation of nanoparticles into membranes ahsani et al 2021 the introduction of carriers for improving sludge characteristics hazrati and shayegan 2016 the addition of flocculants coagulants gkotsis et al 2017 combination with other water treatment techniques rostam and taghizadeh 2020 karimi et al 2021 revealing the role of extracellular polymeric substances eps and dynamic double layer of eps content around activated sludge cells li and yang 2007 su et al 2020 etc various studies report the application of aops as a pre post treatment step of biological mbr processes giwa et al 2019 rostam and taghizadeh 2020 ouarda et al 2018 investigated the treatment of synthetic hospital wastewater by coupling mbr with eo as both pre post treatment steps their results show that consideration of eo as a post treatment step leads to higher pharmaceuticals removal in comparison with eo as pre treatment toxicity assessments revealed that mbr effluent imposed no toxicity effects however there were clear toxicity effects observed for the effluent of eo as the polishing step of mbr effluent since the introduction of aops as a single pre treatment step could only improve the biodegradability of refractory pollutants up to a certain point joannis cassan et al 2021 pieus thanikkal and pooppana antony 2021 it seems the application of aops as a pre treatment step could not be a viable option as it leads to a higher retention time of overall wastewater treatment process and leads to insignificant improvement of removal efficiency joannis cassan et al 2021 pieus thanikkal and pooppana antony 2021 on the other hand the application of aops as a post treatment step ignores the issue of poor biodegradability of biological reactor mbr influent in the first place and oxidation by products may become more toxic than initial organic pollutants särkkä et al 2015 ouarda et al 2018 as a result several studies have explored the integration of the biological mbr process instead of sequencing the processes rostam and taghizadeh 2020 in an early study by chaturapruek et al 2005 integration of ozonation aop with mbr for treatment of landfill leachate was investigated and results were compared to sequential operation mode with ozonation as post treatment integration of o3 with mbr through the application of ozonation reactor in the recirculation stream of mbr effluent led to an increase in cod removal of 78 to 83 in comparison with sequential mode moreover lower molecular weight organics were observed for the effluent of the integrated system than post treatment of mbr effluent by o3 mascolo et al 2010 evaluated an integrated system of mbr and ozonation for the treatment of real pharmaceuticals wastewater and its results were compared to an mbr system with ozonation as a polishing step their results show that incorporation of ozonation in the mbr effluent recirculation line increases the efficiency of the system from 20 to 60 organics removal moreover it was demonstrated that the integrated system performs better in terms of removing ozonation by products found in the effluent of sequential system with ozonation as post treatment in another study laera et al 2012 investigated an integrated o3 or uv h2o2 with mbr system for treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater and their results were compared to the sequential operation mode o3 or uv h2o2 as post treatment results show that integration leads to no negative effect on biological system operation along with high cod removal rates being higher for the integrated aop mbr system pollice et al 2012 have reported nalidixic acid removal by application of ozonation in the effluent recirculation stream of mbr performance of the integrated system was compared with the sequential mode application of ozonation as single step mbr effluent polishing and results revealed the superior performance of the integrated system in terms of cod and ozonation by products removal in a recent study by joanis cassan et al 2021 removal of pharmaceutical residues was carried out by integration of mbr and photo oxidation authors have stated that the role of photo oxidation reactor in the recirculation line of mbr effluent is not complete degradation of organic pollutants but to moderately increase the biodegradability of pollutants to make them more readily biodegradable by mbr their results show that the application of photo oxidation as a pre treatment of the mbr system could improve pharmaceutical pollutants removal based on these results the authors concluded that since the application of photo oxidation reactor in the recirculation stream of mbr effluent leads to several oxidation biodegradation cycles the integrated system will perform better in comparison to the sequential mode of operation accordingly the available studies deal with sequential mbr and batch aop reactors asha et al 2014 giwa et al 2019 rostam and taghizadeh 2020 pieus thanikkal and pooppana antony 2021 the rest of the literature in this regard is limited to submerging the electrodes inside the mbr this mode has several physical chemical drawbacks such as interference with the aeration formation of a biological layer on the electrode surface chung et al 2016 which leads to lower active electrode area uncontrolled dissolution of the sacrificial anode guzmán et al 2016 which leads to electrically generated coagulants such as al oh 3 in case of using aluminum anode the occurrence of unwanted side reactions etc f f rivera et al 2015 therefore practical integration of eo with mbr requires a fully controlled electrochemical reactor with hydraulic superiority recent studies show that application of electrochemical flowcells was more fruitful in comparison with classical beaker batch reactor mode for the treatment of organics polluted wastewaters by eo aop and other electrochemical aop methods in terms of process reactor scale up reactors in series concept sandoval et al 2016 hydraulic superiority eliminating the need for application of two pumps for influent and effluent of the reactor kuleyin et al 2021 process modeling and simulation pérez et al 2015 sandoval et al 2016 gharibian et al 2020 controlled reaction medium small footprint etc f f rivera et al 2015 several studies report the feasibility of integrating electrochemical flowcell with other aop methods such as solar photoelectro fenton flow plant pérez et al 2017 coria et al 2018 based on the literature review there are no studies regarding the integration of electrooxidation aop and mbr through the application of eo in the recirculation line of mbr effluent and evaluation of membrane fouling behavior in the current study we report treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by exploiting synergistic effects of eo and mbr through the installation of a 3d printed eo flowcell equipped with graphite electrodes in the mbr effluent recirculation stream and subsequent evaluation of membrane fouling behavior graphite electrodes were selected due to their outstanding ability for the production of h2o2 oh medel et al 2020 this study has multifold novelty i the first time application of electrooxidation aop in the mbr effluent recirculation line with the aim of moderate biodegradability improvement ii the first time application of electrochemical flowcell in an integrated system of eo mbr iii the first time analysis of membrane fouling in a complete integrated bench scale eo mbr pilot plant in addition due to the presence of numerous studies in the literature regarding the application of different aops as post pre treatment step of mbr studying the effect of installing eo flowcell in pre post treatment of mbr was ignored we believe that the results of the present report provide fruitful insight for future studies unraveling the complex operating fouling mechanism of integrated aop mbr system and improving the operation of mbr systems for facile treatment of organics polluted wastewaters with low biodegradability 2 equipment and experimental methods characteristics of real pharmaceutical wastewater subjected to treatment in this study are presented in table 1 the concentrations of notable pharmaceutical compounds including nalidixic acid carbamazepine ibuprofen and azithromycin were identified as 15 2 16 87 17 26 and 10 62 mg l 1 using lc ms ms analysis vide infra the concentrations of all identified pharmaceutical compounds are summarized in table s3 delivered wastewater was stored in the refrigerator in dark at 5 c to prevent change in the chemical quality wastewater samples were used in all experiments as delivered without any additional pre treatment before tests deionized water di with 2 µs cm 1 was used upon requirement in test procedures chemicals required for analytical methods were purchased from merck company germany details regarding the mbr eo and eo mbr systems operation and sampling are provided in the supplementary data section 2 1 evaluation of membrane fouling the effect of integration of electrooxidation with mbr eo mbr system on the fouling behavior of the utilized membranes was investigated through monitoring tmp evolution using a pressure sensor installed before the peristaltic pump fig 1 during a 30 days operation period results were compared with tmp evolution obtained from the mbr system as control tests were terminated when the tmp value reached the approximate value of 30 kpa tmp limit value 2 2 membrane resistance analysis membrane fouling resistance can be estimated using darcy s law and resistance in the series model chung et al 2016 sabalanvand et al 2021 according to eqs 1 2 1 j δ p μ r t 2 r t r m e m b r a n e r c a k e r

rmembrane is the membrane intrinsic resistance m 1 rcake reversible is the membrane sludge cake layer which is considered to be reversible m 1 and rpore clogging irreversible is resistance value due to the blockage of membrane pores by biological fouling agents which is considered to be irreversible rmembrane was determined using the tmp value of pure water flux passing through the neat membrane rt was determined using the tmp value at the end of fouling tests after that membranes were washed gently with 250 ml of di water using a sponge to remove the deposited sludge cake layer and the solution was stored for further analysis tmp values of physically cleaned membranes were measured to obtain an estimated value of rmembrane rcake reversible after that values of pore blockage and sludge cake layer resistance values were calculated using values obtained from the last steps 2 3 analytical methods five day biological oxygen demand bod5 manometric respirometer method and chemical oxygen demand cod closed reflux colorimetric method values of samples obtained from each system were measured using standard methods apha 2005 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss content of bulk sludge and the cake layer was determined using common standard methods apha 2005 values of tb eps tightly bound eps and lb eps loosely bound eps and respective protein and polysaccharides fractions were determined by a modified heat extraction method using the solution of previously washed sludge cake layer based on methods stated in previous studies and standards li and yang 2007 hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 uv visible spectrophotometric analyses were carried out using a 6705 uv vis spectrophotometer jenway england after completion of fouling tests and determination of hydraulic resistance values 50 ml of sludge cake layer solution was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min after that precipitated fouling agents were dried in the oven at 55 c for 48 hr and analyzed for inspection of fourier transform infrared ftir spectra and detection of functional groups using tensor 27 spectrophotometer bruker usa excitation emission matrix eem spectra were obtained using a luminescence spectrometer ls55 perkinelmer usa through fluorescence measurements three dimensional spectra 5 nm stepwise were obtained over the excitation and emission wavelengths of 200 400 and 200 600 nm respectively the identification and quantification of pharmaceutical compounds present in real wastewater were carried out using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy lc ms ms analysis molecular size distribution of real pharmaceutical wastewater and final effluent of eo mbr and eo mbr systems was obtained using size exclusion liquid chromatography quantification of short chain organic acids generated as oxidation by products were carried out using ion exclusion high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis details of liquid chromatography methods can be found in supplementary section 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of voltage on eo performance applied electrical voltage has a profound effect on the economic state of electrochemical processes overvoltage the attrition rate of the sacrificial anode and the occurrence of unwanted side reactions such as oxygen hydrogen evolution reaction in the aqueous medium must be accounted for during the design stage of electrochemical processes f f rivera et al 2015 treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by eo system was carried out at 3 5 7 and 9 v properties of eo effluent after 24 hr of operation are presented in fig 2 results reveal that increasing electrical voltage between anode and cathode from 3 to 5 v led to a 24 increase in cod removal 17 increase in effluent bod5 and substantial increase of biodegradability index ca 22 this points out that eo is operating below the limiting current required for organics electrooxidation f f rivera et al 2015 periyasamy and muthuchamy 2018 gharibian et al 2020 technically increasing electrical voltage leads to more generation of hydroxyl radicals which will react with organic molecules r according to the following reactions eqs 3 4 occur at the anode surface padilla robles et al 2015 rivera et al 2018 while eqs 5 6 take place at the cathode surface and eq 7 is conducted in the bulk liquid zhang et al 2010 medel et al 2020 3 m a n o d e m a t e r i a l h 2 o m o h a d s h e 4 m o h a d s r c o 2 h 2 o 5 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 6 h 2 o 2 h e o h h 2 o 7 o h r c o 2 h 2 o an increase in the concentration of oxidizing agents will result in a more electrophilic attack on π system hydrogen subtraction medel et al 2020 and mineralization of refractory organic compounds and turn them into smaller fragments which in turn increases bod5 and biodegradability index values chaturapruek et al 2005 laera et al 2012 perisic et al 2016 however by increasing electrical voltage after 5 v marginal change in effluent properties and more rapid anode attrition was observed this could be due to the operation of the eo flowcell under a mass transfer limiting reaction regime after exceeding the limiting current periyasamy and muthuchamy 2018 gharibian et al 2020 moreover at elevated voltage values occurrence of unwanted side reactions such as oxygen evolution at the anode surface which disrupts mass transfer and anode attrition increases katal and pahlavanzadeh 2011 naje et al 2017 according to the results and related considerations the applied electrical voltage of 5 v was selected for further eo mbr integration tests 3 2 performance of eo mbr and eo mbr systems based on the main objective of moderate improvement of pharmaceutical pollutants biodegradability by application of eo flowcell at the recirculation line of mbr the performance of the integrated eo mbr system was compared with the isolated eo and mbr systems in terms of cod bod5 and biodegradability index cod and bod5 removal of eo mbr was almost complete during the studied operation period while cod and bod5 removal of mbr system was 60 15 and 87 10 respectively moreover it is worth mentioning that effluent tss was negligible for both mbr and eo mbr systems in addition results of performance evaluation of different systems during one hrt figs 3 5 show that integration of eo with mbr leads to significant improvement of cod removal in comparison with isolated eo and mbr systems effluent cod for eo mbr reached a negligible value while the respective value for eo and mbr was 422 and 277 mg l 1 respectively the low cod removal by the eo system could be attributed to the formation of primary by products which were recalcitrant to further degradation by the electrophilic attack by h2o2 oh chaturapruek et al 2005 medel et al 2020 this is confirmed by the higher bod5 value of effluent ca 234 mg l 1 in comparison with influent ca 154 mg l 1 and increasing trend of biodegradability index throughout eo reaching from 0 22 to 0 55 moreover the relatively high cod value of mbr effluent ca 277 mg l 1 could be due to the presence of slowly non biodegradable organic pollutants which is further confirmed by the low bod5 value of mbr effluent ca 19 mg l 1 and low biodegradability index ca 0 07 chaturapruek et al 2005 saidi et al 2017 in the case of the eo mbr system cyclic eo treatment of mbr effluent results in partial oxidation of bio refractory molecules into easily biodegradable compounds by the mbr this is confirmed by the negligible bod5 and low biodegradability index of eo mbr system effluent at 24 hr and moderate jump of biodegradability index at 12 hr chaturapruek et al 2005 these results are in agreement with results of previous studies regarding the installation of aops including o3 chaturapruek et al 2005 mascolo et al 2010 pollice et al 2012 h2o2 uv laera et al 2012 and photo oxidation joannis cassan et al 2021 in the recirculation line of mbr effluent for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewaters which demonstrate improved effluent quality in terms of organic pollutants elimination and removal of oxidation by products after comparison of the effluent properties and performance of eo mbr integrated system with eo and mbr isolated systems which elucidate the superior performance of eo mbr system in terms of treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater the effect of eo integration with mbr on membrane fouling behavior was further analyzed results of chromatographic analysis demonstrated successful removal of large molecular weight pharmaceutical compounds detected using lc ms ms analysis table s3 using the eo mbr system based on size exclusion chromatography results fig 6 the eo system leads to the generation of low molecular weight compounds along with reduction of large compounds olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 removal of peaks related to small organic molecules suggests that the mbr system is only capable of removing low molecular weight biodegradable compounds olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 however the negligible intensity of peaks in the eo mbr chromatogram shows that the eo mbr system leads to almost complete removal of all organic compounds from real pharmaceutical wastewater regarding the fate of oxidation by products in eo and eo mbr systems it is worth mentioning that in both systems concentration of initially detected pharmaceutical compounds table s3 falls below the detection limit of lc ms ms during the first 6 h olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 due to the presence of numerous aromatic cyclic by products as a result of oxidation of large molecular weight compounds found in the studied real pharmaceutical wastewater we only monitored the concentration of readily biodegradable short chain organic acids for better comparison of eo and eo mbr systems for further confirmation of the results of biodegradability index improvement figs 3 5 biodegradable short chain organic acids are generated due to oxidation of aromatic cyclic by products and according to the literature these compounds make up the majority of final oxidation by products which are mainly recalcitrant toward further oxidation by hydroxyl radicals such as oxamic and oxalic acids olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 figs s3 s4 demonstrate that the concentration of short chain organic acids reaches an almost constant value after the first 6 h of wastewater treatment using only the eo system while the concentration of these compounds depletes completely after 24 h of treatment using the eo mbr system after reaching a steady state which is in accordance with the results of the biodegradability index improvement figs 3 5 showing that cyclic eo treatment of mbr effluent results in partial oxidation of bio refractory molecules into easily biodegradable compounds which are readily consumed in the mbr olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 3 3 membrane fouling behavior of eo mbr system since membrane fouling tmp increase or flux deterioration is an important concept of mbr systems that leads to higher operational costs and deterioration of mbr system efficiency tmp evolution of mbr and eo mbr systems were analyzed results fig 7 show that the mbr system reached the tmp limit value of 30 kpa within 36 days of operation while the eo mbr system reached the tmp limit value in 64 days of operation period tmp evolution for both systems starts with a quasi steady state phase which is followed by a sharp tmp increase chung et al 2016 gkotsis et al 2020 however the rapid rise in tmp for the mbr system occurred within ca 18 days while this characteristic rise appeared within ca 52 days for the eo mbr system the slow tmp rise period is best characterized for the accumulation of sludge cake layer and organic foulant mainly eps chung et al 2016 on the membrane surface chung et al 2016 gkotsis et al 2020 souza et al 2020 and sharp increase of tmp is related to the situation where the reduced local flux exceeds the critical flux chung et al 2016 gkotsis et al 2020 souza et al 2020 postponed tmp rise of eo mbr system could be related to oxidation role of electrochemical generation of h2o2 oh in flowcell and subsequent recirculation to mbr which leads to alleviation of organic foulants accumulation on the membrane surface and consequently extended operation time before tmp reaches a limit value chung et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in addition investigation of hydraulic resistance values after achieving the tmp limit value for each system revealed that r t total fouling resistance of eo mbr and mbr systems were 3 34 10 12 m 1 and 3 28 10 12 m 1 respectively approximately equal fouling resistance of mbr and eo mbr systems is due to termination of fouling tests at equal tmp limit value of 30 kpa at constant flux while the mbr and eo mbr systems reached the tmp limit value within ca 36 and 64 days of operation period also the ratio of rcake reversible rt was 89 5 and 83 9 percent and rpore clogging irreversible rt was 2 4 and 7 9 percent for eo mbr and mbr respectively results show that the integrated eo mbr system exhibits lower irreversible resistance which is caused by pore blockage by organic foulants mainly eps content of sludge cake layer chung et al 2016 this could be related to the functionality of electrochemically generated h2o2 oh by eo and oxidation of organic fouling compounds through electrophilic attack to electron rich bonds yang et al 2020 several studies have reported the role of electrochemically generated oxidation agents such as hydroxyl radicals oh yang et al 2020 hydrogen peroxide laera et al 2012 and free chlorine chung et al 2016 on the extension of the fouling period in mbr systems through mitigation of eps content and specially proteinaceous compounds which are best characterized by strong adhesion ability on the membrane surface and pores laera et al 2012 chung et al 2016 su et al 2020 improved fouling behavior of integrated eo mbr system was further investigated by quantitative comparison of the double layer eps content and its constituent compounds such as proteins and polysaccharides of the sludge cake layer deposited on the surface of membranes after the termination of the fouling tests results fig 8 demonstrate that both the lb eps ca 117 mg gvss 1 and tb eps ca 106 mg gvss 1 content of the cake layer in eo mbr has decreased in comparison with the respective values of the mbr cake layer ca 196 and 142 mg gvss 1 for lb eps and tb eps respectively in addition protein to polysaccharide ratio p c of the tb eps fraction of eo mbr and mbr were ca 1 46 and ca 1 32 respectively p c ratio of the lb eps fraction of eo mbr and mbr were ca 2 07 and ca 3 08 respectively since the lb eps fraction of the cake layer especially the proteinaceous compounds are considered as the main factor of membrane fouling in mbr systems due to more hydrophobicity and stronger attachments to the membrane surface and pores than polysaccharide compounds meng et al 2006 drews et al 2007 chung et al 2016 farid et al 2019 yang et al 2020 extended operability of eo mbr system until limit tmp value and reduction of irreversible membrane resistance are in agreement with the reduced lb eps content and decreased p c ratio of the lb eps content of sludge cake layer in eo mbr relatively lower reduction of tb eps content of eo mbr cake layer could be related to the strong adhesion of microbial products around the cells which limits the mass transfer of oh radicals and hinders electrophilic substitution attack to the electron rich moieties while loosely bound eps content lb eps of the sludge cake layer on the membranes surface and pores are more accessible to oh radicals chung et al 2016 these results are in agreement with the results of yang et al 2020 and chung et al 2016 studying the effect of submerged electrodes in embr systems on the membrane fouling behavior their results demonstrate reduction of eps content by electrochemically generated oxidation agents along with extended operability of membrane before reaching the limit tmp value moreover the idea that installation of the eo flowcell in the recirculation line of mbr effluent leads to lower eps content due to consumption of eps as the carbon source by microorganisms in case of lower feed microorganism f m than control mbr battistelli et al 2018 is dismissed because results figs 3 6 suggest that in fact application of eo in the integrated process increases biodegradability of organic pollutants in the wastewater to confirm the presence and reduction of tb eps and lb eps contents of the sludge cake layer of eo mbr and mbr systems and their constituents a detailed analytical investigation was carried out using ftir and eem spectroscopy methods ftir spectra fig 9 are useful for identifying chemical bonds functional groups of the organic foulants in the cake layer the characteristic peak at ca 3400 cm 1 is attributed to the hydrogen bond of oh and nh functional groups in polysaccharides and proteins compounds hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 liu et al 2020 mohamadi et al 2020 the peaks at ca 1050 and ca 2910 2940 cm 1 are related to the c o groups of polysaccharide like compounds and aliphatic chains with oh groups respectively hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 liu et al 2020 mohamadi et al 2020 the peaks at ca 1650 and ca 1550 cm 1 are attributed to the amide type i and ii and proteins with secondary turn structure and deformation vibration of nh functional groups hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 liu et al 2020 mohamadi et al 2020 moreover the characteristics peaks at ca 1400 and ca 1250 cm 1 are attributed to amide type iii results of analyzing ftir spectra confirm the presence of polysaccharides humic humic like substances and proteins in the cake layer of the membranes however the intensity of characteristic peaks is less significant for the eo mbr sample which is attributed to the lower concentration of the proteins polysaccharides in the cake layer of the eo mbr membrane hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 liu et al 2020 mohamadi et al 2020 this further confirms slower fouling rate smaller irreversible membrane fouling resistance in the integrated eo mbr system after confirming the presence of proteins polysaccharides in the cake layer of the membranes a quantitative comparison of organic foulants were carried out using eem spectrophotometric analysis eem analysis has been proven to be a strong instrument for the determination of chemical composition and concentration of fluorescence compounds at concentrations even smaller than 1 mg l 1 in the sludge cake layer samples using spectral information wang et al 2012 hazrati and shayegan 2016 4 characteristic peaks a d are observed from results of eem analysis fig 10 details of these peaks along with respective intensities are gathered in table 2 peak a ex em 330 350 420 480 nm is best characterized for humic fulvic like organic matter peak b ex em 250 260 380 480 nm is related to humic like organic matter peak c ex em 250 280 280 350 nm is associated with tryptophan protein like organic matter peak d ex em 225 235 330 335 nm is often attributed to the aromatic protein protein like species wang et al 2012 chung et al 2016 hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 results show negligible no shift in the wavelength of characteristic peaks of organic compounds in eo mbr sludge cake layer analysis therefore no change in the structure or electron systems of organic compounds fluorophores as a result of the electrophilic attack of hydroxyl radicals to proteins and humic species was observed chung et al 2016 overall the intensity of peaks related to the protein and humic like species was smaller for both tb eps and lb eps of the eo mbr system which is in accordance with the results of figs 9 10 moreover the reduction of protein like compounds from the lb eps fraction is larger than the tb eps fraction which could be attributed to the mass transfer limitations of hydroxyl radicals into the tb eps fraction chung et al 2016 these results further confirm extended membrane operation and reduced irreversible fouling of the eo mbr system as a result of reduced eps content and more especially reduced hydrophobicity chung et al 2016 and concentration of protein like compounds in the sludge cake layer by hydroxyl radicals through electrophilic attack to electron rich bonds medel et al 2020 4 conclusion in the current study we report enhanced treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by integration of electrooxidation eo one of the widely studied advanced oxidation processes aops with membrane bio reactor mbr for the first time integrated pre pilot eo mbr plant consisted of a 3d printed electrochemical flowcell equipped with graphite electrodes installed in the effluent

have become a major concern throughout locations with an arid or semi arid climate scarcity of freshwater resources will lead to economic and environmental insecurity and eventually forced migration therefore to achieve sustainable growth objectives certain actions are required including water resource management and prioritizing between different sectors such as agriculture energy industries sanitation etc accurate policy implementation and most importantly wastewater treatment and reuse tortajada 2020 despite numerous studies and investments in this field industrial municipal wastewater treatment facilities face economic challenges such as high maintenance costs hernández chover et al 2021 or inadequate efficiency such as incapability of eliminating emerging pollutants including non metabolized or partially metabolized pharmaceutical compounds dyeing agents in textile industries microplastics etc from wastewater mirzaei et al 2019 khan et al 2020 maliwan et al 2021 due to its refractory nature emerging pollutants impose a serious challenge for the wastewater management concept and wastewater treatment industry to keep up with new effluent discharge quality regulations migo et al 2018 as an example a recent study by mirzaei et al 2019 demonstrates the incapability of conventional wastewater treatment plants a2o configuration anaerobic anoxic and oxic tanks for complete removal of commonly prescribed antibiotics from municipal wastewater streams accordingly there is a substantial necessity for the development of novel and cost effective wastewater treatment processes capable of efficient treatment of municipal industrial wastewater streams and removal of emerging pollutions among various wastewater treatment solutions membrane bio reactors mbr have shown great potential for effective removal of pharmaceuticals and micro pollutants in comparison with conventional activated sludge cas systems khan et al 2020 mbr systems benefit from the synergy of membrane separation processes and biological reactors ma et al 2018 however membrane fouling issues pumping energy requirements and biodegradability problem of organic pollutants incapability toward removal of bio recalcitrant drugs such as carbamazepine joannis cassan et al 2021 are the main drawbacks of mbr systems wang et al 2022 on the other hand advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation photocatalysis fenton reaction and electrochemical oxidation lead to substantial mineralization of refractory organic compounds and improvement of biodegradability of pollutants perisic et al 2016 rostamizadeh et al 2018 elmobarak et al 2021 pieus thanikkal and pooppana antony 2021 electrooxidation eo has been proposed as an inexpensive and green process for remediation of organics polluted wastewaters since it requires no hazardous chemicals and hydroxyl radicals which act as oxidizing agents are produced in situ gharibian et al 2020 however oxidation by products may become more toxic than parent organic compounds which require further polishing to meet discharge standards särkkä et al 2015 ouarda et al 2018 moreover refractory pollutants are oxidized to a certain mineralization degree where by products are not further oxidized by the electrophilic attack and become recalcitrant toward further chemical oxidation särkkä et al 2015 ouarda et al 2018 in recent years numerous studies have been dedicated to improving mbr performance such as the incorporation of nanoparticles into membranes ahsani et al 2021 the introduction of carriers for improving sludge characteristics hazrati and shayegan 2016 the addition of flocculants coagulants gkotsis et al 2017 combination with other water treatment techniques rostam and taghizadeh 2020 karimi et al 2021 revealing the role of extracellular polymeric substances eps and dynamic double layer of eps content around activated sludge cells li and yang 2007 su et al 2020 etc various studies report the application of aops as a pre post treatment step of biological mbr processes giwa et al 2019 rostam and taghizadeh 2020 ouarda et al 2018 investigated the treatment of synthetic hospital wastewater by coupling mbr with eo as both pre post treatment steps their results show that consideration of eo as a post treatment step leads to higher pharmaceuticals removal in comparison with eo as pre treatment toxicity assessments revealed that mbr effluent imposed no toxicity effects however there were clear toxicity effects observed for the effluent of eo as the polishing step of mbr effluent since the introduction of aops as a single pre treatment step could only improve the biodegradability of refractory pollutants up to a certain point joannis cassan et al 2021 pieus thanikkal and pooppana antony 2021 it seems the application of aops as a pre treatment step could not be a viable option as it leads to a higher retention time of overall wastewater treatment process and leads to insignificant improvement of removal efficiency joannis cassan et al 2021 pieus thanikkal and pooppana antony 2021 on the other hand the application of aops as a post treatment step ignores the issue of poor biodegradability of biological reactor mbr influent in the first place and oxidation by products may become more toxic than initial organic pollutants särkkä et al 2015 ouarda et al 2018 as a result several studies have explored the integration of the biological mbr process instead of sequencing the processes rostam and taghizadeh 2020 in an early study by chaturapruek et al 2005 integration of ozonation aop with mbr for treatment of landfill leachate was investigated and results were compared to sequential operation mode with ozonation as post treatment integration of o3 with mbr through the application of ozonation reactor in the recirculation stream of mbr effluent led to an increase in cod removal of 78 to 83 in comparison with sequential mode moreover lower molecular weight organics were observed for the effluent of the integrated system than post treatment of mbr effluent by o3 mascolo et al 2010 evaluated an integrated system of mbr and ozonation for the treatment of real pharmaceuticals wastewater and its results were compared to an mbr system with ozonation as a polishing step their results show that incorporation of ozonation in the mbr effluent recirculation line increases the efficiency of the system from 20 to 60 organics removal moreover it was demonstrated that the integrated system performs better in terms of removing ozonation by products found in the effluent of sequential system with ozonation as post treatment in another study laera et al 2012 investigated an integrated o3 or uv h2o2 with mbr system for treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater and their results were compared to the sequential operation mode o3 or uv h2o2 as post treatment results show that integration leads to no negative effect on biological system operation along with high cod removal rates being higher for the integrated aop mbr system pollice et al 2012 have reported nalidixic acid removal by application of ozonation in the effluent recirculation stream of mbr performance of the integrated system was compared with the sequential mode application of ozonation as single step mbr effluent polishing and results revealed the superior performance of the integrated system in terms of cod and ozonation by products removal in a recent study by joanis cassan et al 2021 removal of pharmaceutical residues was carried out by integration of mbr and photo oxidation authors have stated that the role of photo oxidation reactor in the recirculation line of mbr effluent is not complete degradation of organic pollutants but to moderately increase the biodegradability of pollutants to make them more readily biodegradable by mbr their results show that the application of photo oxidation as a pre treatment of the mbr system could improve pharmaceutical pollutants removal based on these results the authors concluded that since the application of photo oxidation reactor in the recirculation stream of mbr effluent leads to several oxidation biodegradation cycles the integrated system will perform better in comparison to the sequential mode of operation accordingly the available studies deal with sequential mbr and batch aop reactors asha et al 2014 giwa et al 2019 rostam and taghizadeh 2020 pieus thanikkal and pooppana antony 2021 the rest of the literature in this regard is limited to submerging the electrodes inside the mbr this mode has several physical chemical drawbacks such as interference with the aeration formation of a biological layer on the electrode surface chung et al 2016 which leads to lower active electrode area uncontrolled dissolution of the sacrificial anode guzmán et al 2016 which leads to electrically generated coagulants such as al oh 3 in case of using aluminum anode the occurrence of unwanted side reactions etc f f rivera et al 2015 therefore practical integration of eo with mbr requires a fully controlled electrochemical reactor with hydraulic superiority recent studies show that application of electrochemical flowcells was more fruitful in comparison with classical beaker batch reactor mode for the treatment of organics polluted wastewaters by eo aop and other electrochemical aop methods in terms of process reactor scale up reactors in series concept sandoval et al 2016 hydraulic superiority eliminating the need for application of two pumps for influent and effluent of the reactor kuleyin et al 2021 process modeling and simulation pérez et al 2015 sandoval et al 2016 gharibian et al 2020 controlled reaction medium small footprint etc f f rivera et al 2015 several studies report the feasibility of integrating electrochemical flowcell with other aop methods such as solar photoelectro fenton flow plant pérez et al 2017 coria et al 2018 based on the literature review there are no studies regarding the integration of electrooxidation aop and mbr through the application of eo in the recirculation line of mbr effluent and evaluation of membrane fouling behavior in the current study we report treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by exploiting synergistic effects of eo and mbr through the installation of a 3d printed eo flowcell equipped with graphite electrodes in the mbr effluent recirculation stream and subsequent evaluation of membrane fouling behavior graphite electrodes were selected due to their outstanding ability for the production of h2o2 oh medel et al 2020 this study has multifold novelty i the first time application of electrooxidation aop in the mbr effluent recirculation line with the aim of moderate biodegradability improvement ii the first time application of electrochemical flowcell in an integrated system of eo mbr iii the first time analysis of membrane fouling in a complete integrated bench scale eo mbr pilot plant in addition due to the presence of numerous studies in the literature regarding the application of different aops as post pre treatment step of mbr studying the effect of installing eo flowcell in pre post treatment of mbr was ignored we believe that the results of the present report provide fruitful insight for future studies unraveling the complex operating fouling mechanism of integrated aop mbr system and improving the operation of mbr systems for facile treatment of organics polluted wastewaters with low biodegradability 2 equipment and experimental methods characteristics of real pharmaceutical wastewater subjected to treatment in this study are presented in table 1 the concentrations of notable pharmaceutical compounds including nalidixic acid carbamazepine ibuprofen and azithromycin were identified as 15 2 16 87 17 26 and 10 62 mg l 1 using lc ms ms analysis vide infra the concentrations of all identified pharmaceutical compounds are summarized in table s3 delivered wastewater was stored in the refrigerator in dark at 5 c to prevent change in the chemical quality wastewater samples were used in all experiments as delivered without any additional pre treatment before tests deionized water di with 2 µs cm 1 was used upon requirement in test procedures chemicals required for analytical methods were purchased from merck company germany details regarding the mbr eo and eo mbr systems operation and sampling are provided in the supplementary data section 2 1 evaluation of membrane fouling the effect of integration of electrooxidation with mbr eo mbr system on the fouling behavior of the utilized membranes was investigated through monitoring tmp evolution using a pressure sensor installed before the peristaltic pump fig 1 during a 30 days operation period results were compared with tmp evolution obtained from the mbr system as control tests were terminated when the tmp value reached the approximate value of 30 kpa tmp limit value 2 2 membrane resistance analysis membrane fouling resistance can be estimated using darcy s law and resistance in the series model chung et al 2016 sabalanvand et al 2021 according to eqs 1 2 1 j δ p μ r t 2 r t r m e m b r a n e r c a k e r

solution was stored for further analysis tmp values of physically cleaned membranes were measured to obtain an estimated value of rmembrane rcake reversible after that values of pore blockage and sludge cake layer resistance values were calculated using values obtained from the last steps 2 3 analytical methods five day biological oxygen demand bod5 manometric respirometer method and chemical oxygen demand cod closed reflux colorimetric method values of samples obtained from each system were measured using standard methods apha 2005 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss content of bulk sludge and the cake layer was determined using common standard methods apha 2005 values of tb eps tightly bound eps and lb eps loosely bound eps and respective protein and polysaccharides fractions were determined by a modified heat extraction method using the solution of previously washed sludge cake layer based on methods stated in previous studies and standards li and yang 2007 hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 uv visible spectrophotometric analyses were carried out using a 6705 uv vis spectrophotometer jenway england after completion of fouling tests and determination of hydraulic resistance values 50 ml of sludge cake layer solution was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min after that precipitated fouling agents were dried in the oven at 55 c for 48 hr and analyzed for inspection of fourier transform infrared ftir spectra and detection of functional groups using tensor 27 spectrophotometer bruker usa excitation emission matrix eem spectra were obtained using a luminescence spectrometer ls55 perkinelmer usa through fluorescence measurements three dimensional spectra 5 nm stepwise were obtained over the excitation and emission wavelengths of 200 400 and 200 600 nm respectively the identification and quantification of pharmaceutical compounds present in real wastewater were carried out using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy lc ms ms analysis molecular size distribution of real pharmaceutical wastewater and final effluent of eo mbr and eo mbr systems was obtained using size exclusion liquid chromatography quantification of short chain organic acids generated as oxidation by products were carried out using ion exclusion high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis details of liquid chromatography methods can be found in supplementary section 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of voltage on eo performance applied electrical voltage has a profound effect on the economic state of electrochemical processes overvoltage the attrition rate of the sacrificial anode and the occurrence of unwanted side reactions such as oxygen hydrogen evolution reaction in the aqueous medium must be accounted for during the design stage of electrochemical processes f f rivera et al 2015 treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by eo system was carried out at 3 5 7 and 9 v properties of eo effluent after 24 hr of operation are presented in fig 2 results reveal that increasing electrical voltage between anode and cathode from 3 to 5 v led to a 24 increase in cod removal 17 increase in effluent bod5 and substantial increase of biodegradability index ca 22 this points out that eo is operating below the limiting current required for organics electrooxidation f f rivera et al 2015 periyasamy and muthuchamy 2018 gharibian et al 2020 technically increasing electrical voltage leads to more generation of hydroxyl radicals which will react with organic molecules r according to the following reactions eqs 3 4 occur at the anode surface padilla robles et al 2015 rivera et al 2018 while eqs 5 6 take place at the cathode surface and eq 7 is conducted in the bulk liquid zhang et al 2010 medel et al 2020 3 m a n o d e m a t e r i a l h 2 o m o h a d s h e 4 m o h a d s r c o 2 h 2 o 5 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 6 h 2 o 2 h e o h h 2 o 7 o h r c o 2 h 2 o an increase in the concentration of oxidizing agents will result in a more electrophilic attack on π system hydrogen subtraction medel et al 2020 and mineralization of refractory organic compounds and turn them into smaller fragments which in turn increases bod5 and biodegradability index values chaturapruek et al 2005 laera et al 2012 perisic et al 2016 however by increasing electrical voltage after 5 v marginal change in effluent properties and more rapid anode attrition was observed this could be due to the operation of the eo flowcell under a mass transfer limiting reaction regime after exceeding the limiting current periyasamy and muthuchamy 2018 gharibian et al 2020 moreover at elevated voltage values occurrence of unwanted side reactions such as oxygen evolution at the anode surface which disrupts mass transfer and anode attrition increases katal and pahlavanzadeh 2011 naje et al 2017 according to the results and related considerations the applied electrical voltage of 5 v was selected for further eo mbr integration tests 3 2 performance of eo mbr and eo mbr systems based on the main objective of moderate improvement of pharmaceutical pollutants biodegradability by application of eo flowcell at the recirculation line of mbr the performance of the integrated eo mbr system was compared with the isolated eo and mbr systems in terms of cod bod5 and biodegradability index cod and bod5 removal of eo mbr was almost complete during the studied operation period while cod and bod5 removal of mbr system was 60 15 and 87 10 respectively moreover it is worth mentioning that effluent tss was negligible for both mbr and eo mbr systems in addition results of performance evaluation of different systems during one hrt figs 3 5 show that integration of eo with mbr leads to significant improvement of cod removal in comparison with isolated eo and mbr systems effluent cod for eo mbr reached a negligible value while the respective value for eo and mbr was 422 and 277 mg l 1 respectively the low cod removal by the eo system could be attributed to the formation of primary by products which were recalcitrant to further degradation by the electrophilic attack by h2o2 oh chaturapruek et al 2005 medel et al 2020 this is confirmed by the higher bod5 value of effluent ca 234 mg l 1 in comparison with influent ca 154 mg l 1 and increasing trend of biodegradability index throughout eo reaching from 0 22 to 0 55 moreover the relatively high cod value of mbr effluent ca 277 mg l 1 could be due to the presence of slowly non biodegradable organic pollutants which is further confirmed by the low bod5 value of mbr effluent ca 19 mg l 1 and low biodegradability index ca 0 07 chaturapruek et al 2005 saidi et al 2017 in the case of the eo mbr system cyclic eo treatment of mbr effluent results in partial oxidation of bio refractory molecules into easily biodegradable compounds by the mbr this is confirmed by the negligible bod5 and low biodegradability index of eo mbr system effluent at 24 hr and moderate jump of biodegradability index at 12 hr chaturapruek et al 2005 these results are in agreement with results of previous studies regarding the installation of aops including o3 chaturapruek et al 2005 mascolo et al 2010 pollice et al 2012 h2o2 uv laera et al 2012 and photo oxidation joannis cassan et al 2021 in the recirculation line of mbr effluent for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewaters which demonstrate improved effluent quality in terms of organic pollutants elimination and removal of oxidation by products after comparison of the effluent properties and performance of eo mbr integrated system with eo and mbr isolated systems which elucidate the superior performance of eo mbr system in terms of treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater the effect of eo integration with mbr on membrane fouling behavior was further analyzed results of chromatographic analysis demonstrated successful removal of large molecular weight pharmaceutical compounds detected using lc ms ms analysis table s3 using the eo mbr system based on size exclusion chromatography results fig 6 the eo system leads to the generation of low molecular weight compounds along with reduction of large compounds olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 removal of peaks related to small organic molecules suggests that the mbr system is only capable of removing low molecular weight biodegradable compounds olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 however the negligible intensity of peaks in the eo mbr chromatogram shows that the eo mbr system leads to almost complete removal of all organic compounds from real pharmaceutical wastewater regarding the fate of oxidation by products in eo and eo mbr systems it is worth mentioning that in both systems concentration of initially detected pharmaceutical compounds table s3 falls below the detection limit of lc ms ms during the first 6 h olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 due to the presence of numerous aromatic cyclic by products as a result of oxidation of large molecular weight compounds found in the studied real pharmaceutical wastewater we only monitored the concentration of readily biodegradable short chain organic acids for better comparison of eo and eo mbr systems for further confirmation of the results of biodegradability index improvement figs 3 5 biodegradable short chain organic acids are generated due to oxidation of aromatic cyclic by products and according to the literature these compounds make up the majority of final oxidation by products which are mainly recalcitrant toward further oxidation by hydroxyl radicals such as oxamic and oxalic acids olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 figs s3 s4 demonstrate that the concentration of short chain organic acids reaches an almost constant value after the first 6 h of wastewater treatment using only the eo system while the concentration of these compounds depletes completely after 24 h of treatment using the eo mbr system after reaching a steady state which is in accordance with the results of the biodegradability index improvement figs 3 5 showing that cyclic eo treatment of mbr effluent results in partial oxidation of bio refractory molecules into easily biodegradable compounds which are readily consumed in the mbr olvera vargas et al 2021 saha et al 2021 3 3 membrane fouling behavior of eo mbr system since membrane fouling tmp increase or flux deterioration is an important concept of mbr systems that leads to higher operational costs and deterioration of mbr system efficiency tmp evolution of mbr and eo mbr systems were analyzed results fig 7 show that the mbr system reached the tmp limit value of 30 kpa within 36 days of operation while the eo mbr system reached the tmp limit value in 64 days of operation period tmp evolution for both systems starts with a quasi steady state phase which is followed by a sharp tmp increase chung et al 2016 gkotsis et al 2020 however the rapid rise in tmp for the mbr system occurred within ca 18 days while this characteristic rise appeared within ca 52 days for the eo mbr system the slow tmp rise period is best characterized for the accumulation of sludge cake layer and organic foulant mainly eps chung et al 2016 on the membrane surface chung et al 2016 gkotsis et al 2020 souza et al 2020 and sharp increase of tmp is related to the situation where the reduced local flux exceeds the critical flux chung et al 2016 gkotsis et al 2020 souza et al 2020 postponed tmp rise of eo mbr system could be related to oxidation role of electrochemical generation of h2o2 oh in flowcell and subsequent recirculation to mbr which leads to alleviation of organic foulants accumulation on the membrane surface and consequently extended operation time before tmp reaches a limit value chung et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in addition investigation of hydraulic resistance values after achieving the tmp limit value for each system revealed that r t total fouling resistance of eo mbr and mbr systems were 3 34 10 12 m 1 and 3 28 10 12 m 1 respectively approximately equal fouling resistance of mbr and eo mbr systems is due to termination of fouling tests at equal tmp limit value of 30 kpa at constant flux while the mbr and eo mbr systems reached the tmp limit value within ca 36 and 64 days of operation period also the ratio of rcake reversible rt was 89 5 and 83 9 percent and rpore clogging irreversible rt was 2 4 and 7 9 percent for eo mbr and mbr respectively results show that the integrated eo mbr system exhibits lower irreversible resistance which is caused by pore blockage by organic foulants mainly eps content of sludge cake layer chung et al 2016 this could be related to the functionality of electrochemically generated h2o2 oh by eo and oxidation of organic fouling compounds through electrophilic attack to electron rich bonds yang et al 2020 several studies have reported the role of electrochemically generated oxidation agents such as hydroxyl radicals oh yang et al 2020 hydrogen peroxide laera et al 2012 and free chlorine chung et al 2016 on the extension of the fouling period in mbr systems through mitigation of eps content and specially proteinaceous compounds which are best characterized by strong adhesion ability on the membrane surface and pores laera et al 2012 chung et al 2016 su et al 2020 improved fouling behavior of integrated eo mbr system was further investigated by quantitative comparison of the double layer eps content and its constituent compounds such as proteins and polysaccharides of the sludge cake layer deposited on the surface of membranes after the termination of the fouling tests results fig 8 demonstrate that both the lb eps ca 117 mg gvss 1 and tb eps ca 106 mg gvss 1 content of the cake layer in eo mbr has decreased in comparison with the respective values of the mbr cake layer ca 196 and 142 mg gvss 1 for lb eps and tb eps respectively in addition protein to polysaccharide ratio p c of the tb eps fraction of eo mbr and mbr were ca 1 46 and ca 1 32 respectively p c ratio of the lb eps fraction of eo mbr and mbr were ca 2 07 and ca 3 08 respectively since the lb eps fraction of the cake layer especially the proteinaceous compounds are considered as the main factor of membrane fouling in mbr systems due to more hydrophobicity and stronger attachments to the membrane surface and pores than polysaccharide compounds meng et al 2006 drews et al 2007 chung et al 2016 farid et al 2019 yang et al 2020 extended operability of eo mbr system until limit tmp value and reduction of irreversible membrane resistance are in agreement with the reduced lb eps content and decreased p c ratio of the lb eps content of sludge cake layer in eo mbr relatively lower reduction of tb eps content of eo mbr cake layer could be related to the strong adhesion of microbial products around the cells which limits the mass transfer of oh radicals and hinders electrophilic substitution attack to the electron rich moieties while loosely bound eps content lb eps of the sludge cake layer on the membranes surface and pores are more accessible to oh radicals chung et al 2016 these results are in agreement with the results of yang et al 2020 and chung et al 2016 studying the effect of submerged electrodes in embr systems on the membrane fouling behavior their results demonstrate reduction of eps content by electrochemically generated oxidation agents along with extended operability of membrane before reaching the limit tmp value moreover the idea that installation of the eo flowcell in the recirculation line of mbr effluent leads to lower eps content due to consumption of eps as the carbon source by microorganisms in case of lower feed microorganism f m than control mbr battistelli et al 2018 is dismissed because results figs 3 6 suggest that in fact application of eo in the integrated process increases biodegradability of organic pollutants in the wastewater to confirm the presence and reduction of tb eps and lb eps contents of the sludge cake layer of eo mbr and mbr systems and their constituents a detailed analytical investigation was carried out using ftir and eem spectroscopy methods ftir spectra fig 9 are useful for identifying chemical bonds functional groups of the organic foulants in the cake layer the characteristic peak at ca 3400 cm 1 is attributed to the hydrogen bond of oh and nh functional groups in polysaccharides and proteins compounds hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 liu et al 2020 mohamadi et al 2020 the peaks at ca 1050 and ca 2910 2940 cm 1 are related to the c o groups of polysaccharide like compounds and aliphatic chains with oh groups respectively hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 liu et al 2020 mohamadi et al 2020 the peaks at ca 1650 and ca 1550 cm 1 are attributed to the amide type i and ii and proteins with secondary turn structure and deformation vibration of nh functional groups hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 liu et al 2020 mohamadi et al 2020 moreover the characteristics peaks at ca 1400 and ca 1250 cm 1 are attributed to amide type iii results of analyzing ftir spectra confirm the presence of polysaccharides humic humic like substances and proteins in the cake layer of the membranes however the intensity of characteristic peaks is less significant for the eo mbr sample which is attributed to the lower concentration of the proteins polysaccharides in the cake layer of the eo mbr membrane hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 liu et al 2020 mohamadi et al 2020 this further confirms slower fouling rate smaller irreversible membrane fouling resistance in the integrated eo mbr system after confirming the presence of proteins polysaccharides in the cake layer of the membranes a quantitative comparison of organic foulants were carried out using eem spectrophotometric analysis eem analysis has been proven to be a strong instrument for the determination of chemical composition and concentration of fluorescence compounds at concentrations even smaller than 1 mg l 1 in the sludge cake layer samples using spectral information wang et al 2012 hazrati and shayegan 2016 4 characteristic peaks a d are observed from results of eem analysis fig 10 details of these peaks along with respective intensities are gathered in table 2 peak a ex em 330 350 420 480 nm is best characterized for humic fulvic like organic matter peak b ex em 250 260 380 480 nm is related to humic like organic matter peak c ex em 250 280 280 350 nm is associated with tryptophan protein like organic matter peak d ex em 225 235 330 335 nm is often attributed to the aromatic protein protein like species wang et al 2012 chung et al 2016 hazrati and shayegan 2016 hazrati et al 2017 results show negligible no shift in the wavelength of characteristic peaks of organic compounds in eo mbr sludge cake layer analysis therefore no change in the structure or electron systems of organic compounds fluorophores as a result of the electrophilic attack of hydroxyl radicals to proteins and humic species was observed chung et al 2016 overall the intensity of peaks related to the protein and humic like species was smaller for both tb eps and lb eps of the eo mbr system which is in accordance with the results of figs 9 10 moreover the reduction of protein like compounds from the lb eps fraction is larger than the tb eps fraction which could be attributed to the mass transfer limitations of hydroxyl radicals into the tb eps fraction chung et al 2016 these results further confirm extended membrane operation and reduced irreversible fouling of the eo mbr system as a result of reduced eps content and more especially reduced hydrophobicity chung et al 2016 and concentration of protein like compounds in the sludge cake layer by hydroxyl radicals through electrophilic attack to electron rich bonds medel et al 2020 4 conclusion in the current study we report enhanced treatment of real pharmaceutical wastewater by integration of electrooxidation eo one of the widely studied advanced oxidation processes aops with membrane bio reactor mbr for the first time integrated pre pilot eo mbr plant consisted of a 3d printed electrochemical flowcell equipped with graphite electrodes installed in the effluent recirculation line of an mbr equipped with a hollow fiber membrane module results demonstrated that 5 v was the optimum voltage level for an isolated eo system isolated eo system led to 40 cod removal and 2 5 fold biodegradability index bod5 cod improvement after 24 hr treatment at the optimum voltage of 5 v and 160 ml min 1 flowrate almost complete removal of cod and bod5 was observed for the eo mbr system with 160 ml min 1 recirculation rate and 24 hr hrt while respective values were 60 and 87 for the mbr system at same operational conditions liquid chromatography techniques further confirmed improvement of biodegradability index of real pharmaceutical wastewater through oxidation of pharmaceutical compounds identified in real wastewater and consumption of oxidation by products such as short chain organic acids by microorganisms in eo mbr integrated system in addition the integrated eo mbr system led to significant membrane fouling mitigation with a 28 day extended operational time before reaching the trans membrane pressure tmp limit value of 30 kpa measurements revealed reduced eps content of membrane sludge cake layer of eo mbr along with significant reduction of proteinaceous compounds in the lb eps fraction of cake layer in comparison with isolated mbr system fouling behavior improvement of the eo mbr system was attributed to the electrophilic attack of electrochemically generated hydroxyl radicals to the electron rich moieties of eps organic foulants these results were further confirmed by emission excitation matrix eem and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopic methods this study could be further extended by increasing membrane modules higher permeate volume and the number of electrochemical flowcells reactors in series

15971,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a group of common recalcitrant pollutant in industrial saline wastewater that raised significant concerns whereas traditional activated sludge as has limited tolerance to high salinity and pahs toxicity restricting its capacity to degrade pahs it is therefore urgent to develop a bioaugmented sludge bs system to aid in the effective degradation of these types of compounds under saline condition in this study a novel bioaugmentation strategy was developed by using halophilic martelella sp ad 3 for effectively augmented phenanthrene phe degradation under 3 salinity it was found that a 0 5 1 5 w w ratio of strain ad 3 to activated sludge was optimal for achieving high phe degradation activity of the bs system with degradation rates reaching 2 2 mg gvss 1 h 1 nearly 25 times that of the as system although 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid 1h2n was accumulated obviously the mineralization of phe was more complete in the bs system reads based metagenomic coupled metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that the expression values of ndob encoding a dioxygenase associated with phe ring cleavage was 5600 fold higher in the bs system than in the as system metagenome assembly showed the members of the corynebacterium and alcaligenes genera were abundant in the strain ad 3 bioaugmented bs system with expression of 10 3 1 8 and 1 9 0 26 respectively moreover phdi and nahg accused for metabolism of 1h2n have been annotated in both above two genera degradation assays of intermediates of phe confirmed that the activated sludge actually possessed considerable degradation capacity for downstream intermediates of phe including 1h2n the degradation capacity ratio of 1h2n to phe was 87 in bs system while it was 26 in strain ad 3 these results indicated that strain ad 3 contributed mainly in transforming phe to 1h2n in bs system while species in activated sludge utilized 1h2n as substrate to grow thus establishing a syntrophic interaction with strain ad 3 and achieving the complete mineralization of phe long term continuous experiment confirmed a stable phe removal efficiency of 93 and few 1h2n accumulation in bs sbr system this study demonstrated an effective bioaugmented strategy for the bioremediation of saline wastewater containing pahs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phenanthrene saline wastewater martelella sp ad 3 bioaugmented system synergistic effect 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a group of common persistent carcinogenic organic compounds in industrial saline wastewaters especially associated with petroleum refining and coal coking processes mojiri et al 2019 goudarzi et al 2018 yang and chen 2004 the salinity range of these pah containing wastewaters was reported from 1 to 12 lefebvre and moletta 2006 ding et al 2021 a typical example of a pah contaminant is phenanthrene phe which has been widely detected in diverse industrial wastewater sources with a reported pahs concentration range of 5 50 mg l 1 yu et al 2021 crisafully et al 2008 smol et al 2012 due to the reproductive toxicity of phe and other pahs in aquatic organisms as well as being a general threat to public health safety pahs are now considered a significant environmental pollutant attracting great attentions recently peng et al 2019 previously the physical chemical remediation of pahs contaminated industrial saline wastewater were intensively reported such as adsorption membrane filtration e g ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation processes e g persulfate yin et al 2021 li et al 2019 smol et al 2016 li et al 2021 however these non biological techniques are not only highly costly but also along with biproducts generation which may cause further secondary pollution peng et al 2018 bioremediation is recognized as a potential preferred way for eliminating pahs from saline wastewater due to its economical and environment friendly advantages raper et al 2018 nevertheless the traditional biological processes such as activated sludge can be readily inhibited by the high salinity or toxicity of the pahs compounds lefebvre and moletta 2006 to our knowledge few studies reported the biodegradation of pahs by as based system at high salinity 3 for example even below relatively low salinity of 1 limited pahs removal 50 was observed in a sequencing batch reactor sbr ofman and skoczko 2018 recently amounts of pure cultures such as members of the thalassospira hortaea staphylococcus have been isolated and proved to be capable of pahs degradation under high saline condition zhou et al 2016 al farraj et al 2019 nzila et al 2021 taken thalassospira as model strain the microbial metabolic pathways of pahs degradation under saline condition have also been illustrated zhou et al 2016 generally these halophilic bacterial aerobic degradations of pahs are activated by a dioxygenase then with the participation of dehydrogenases aldolases and hydroxylases a series of intermediates such as 1h2n phthalic acid pa and salicylic acid sa were generated finally these metabolites intermediates could be completely mineralized through the pa or sa pathway zhou et al 2016 sakshi and haritash 2020 although there are some halophilic pure cultures have been studied for pahs degrading few reports addressed strategies of halophilic microbes bioaugmentation into traditional as system for further significantly improving the effective degradation of pahs at high salinity to date we previously isolated a halophilic pahs degrader martelella sp strain ad 3 which can grow on a group of pahs as sole carbon in the salinity range of 1 8 feng et al 2012 cui et al 2016 strain ad 3 exhibits superhigh phe degrading rate of 62 4 mg g vss 1 h 1 at optimal 3 salinity feng et al 2012 in this study we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel bioaugmentation strategy through using strain ad 3 in activated sludge system for the reinforcement of phe removal performance under high salinity condition to this end we firstly conducted a series of phe degradation experiments to determine the optimized biomass ratio of extrinsic strain ad 3 to activated sludge we then used metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis to investigate the synergistic interaction relationship between the strain ad 3 and microbes in activated sludge for the complete mineralization of phe under high salinity condition the degradation experiments for intermediates from phe degradation were also performed to further confirm the syntrophic role of strain ad 3 in activated sludge for phe degradation finally two sbr bioreactors were set up for long term operation to confirm the phe degradation performance under high salinity condition by the bioaugmentation strategy 2 methods and materials 2 1 activated sludge culture medium and martelella sp ad 3 activated sludge was obtained from the outlet of an aeration tank at the chang qiao municipal wastewater treatment plant shanghai china and was transferred to a laboratory scale reactor with a working volume of 1 l that was operated in sequencing batch mode for one month the culture medium used had 3 minimal salt nacl and contained per l nh4cl 0 10 g k2hpo4 0 02 g mgcl2 6h2o 3 85 g mgso4 7h2o 5 23 g cacl2 0 38 g kcl 1 10 g nahco3 0 05 g nabr 0 13 g and 0 5 ml of trace element solution feng et al 2012 the influent was also supplemented with 0 25 g l 1 sodium acetate as carbon source but without phe the cod removal ratio was finally stable at about 82 3 other details for operation are available in li et al 2020a prior to bioaugmentation assays the activated sludge was aerated for 2 days to exhaust stores of carbon the pah degrading bacterium martelella sp ad 3 used in this study was previously isolated in our laboratory from petroleum contaminated high salinity soil by enrichment on anthracene as the sole carbon and energy source to prepare seed cultures pure cultures of strain ad 3 were cultivated in the mineral salt medium msm described above supplemented with phe at a concentration of 100 mg l 1 for 2 days 30 c cultured cells were harvested by centrifugation 12000 g 3 min and washed three times and then diluted with fresh msm to a final od600 of 0 25 which was equal to a final concentration of biomass of 0 35 mg cells ml 1 and then stored at 4 c for bioaugmentation experiments 2 2 bioaugmentation experiments to construct bioaugmented sludge bs starved seed activated sludge was first transferred into 3 msm giving a final volatile suspended solids vss of about 1 5 g l 1 which was determined according to li et al 2014 cells of ad 3 prepared as described above were added to this to give the following mass ratios w w of strain ad 3 to activated sludge 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 5 0 and 8 0 then phe dissolved in n n dimethylformamide as a stock solution 100 g l 1 was added to bs in an erlenmeyer flask resulting in an environmentally relevant concentration of phe of 20 mg l 1 within the reported pahs concentration ranges of 5 50 mg l 1 in industrial wastewater crisafully et al 2008 smol et al 2012 finally the ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 1 with 0 1 mol hcl l 1 the experiments were conducted at 30 c with shaking at 150 rpm control flasks with only activated sludge as or strain ad 3 were also assayed with all assays being done in triplicates to further investigate the degrade complete of the bs to the phe four reported main intermediate compounds imam et al 2021 were individually used as sole carbon source in the specific four groups of bs activity assays specifically the 1h2n gentisic acid ga catechol cat and protocatechuic acid pca were individually supplemented into 3 msm at a concentration of 20 mg l 1 the mixed culture was inoculated with a 1 mass ratio of strain ad 3 to activated sludge making the final mlvss concentration 1 5 g l 1 experiments for each compound were conducted at 30 c with shaking at 150 rpm with each group setting triplicates to normalize the degradation rate of phe and its metabolites in different bio systems the specific degradation rate sdr was calculated using the following formula 1 sdr c 0 c m t where c0 c m and t are the initial substrate concentration mg l 1 residual substrate concentration in first 2h mg l 1 biomass mg l 1 and reaction time h respectively to assess the bioaugmentation effect of strain ad 3 on phe degradation the expected sdr of bs bsexp based on sum activity of strain ad 3 and as was calculated assuming that there was no syntrophic nor antagonistic interaction in bs the syntrophic interaction was considered only when the determined sdr of bs eq 1 was higher than the sdr of bsexp 2 sdr of b s exp sd r as m as sd r ad 3 m ad 3 m as m ad 3 where sdras and sdrad 3 represent sdr of as and strain ad 3 respectively while mas and mad 3 represent biomass concentration of as and strain ad 3 respectively to further confirm the long term feasibility and stability of phe removal performance in the proposed bs system two sbrs with a working volume of 1 l have been set up for phe degradation experiments r1 was initially seeded with strain ad 3 and activated sludge w w 1 0 while r0 was seeded with only activated sludge as control the other operations were the same in both sbrs the reactor temperature was set at 25 1 c dissolved oxygen in sbr was maintained at 2 5 mg l 1 by aeration the initial sludge concentration in the reactor was 3 0 gvss l 1 the operating cycle was 240 min which comprised 5 min feeding 225 min aeration 5 min settling 5 min decanting and idling the volumetric exchange ratio was set at 65 corresponding to a hydraulic retention time of 6 h the influent contained phe of 20 mg l 1 and sodium acetate of 250 mg l 1 other influent substrates were the same as the msm stated above 2 3 dna and rna extraction and sequencing the bs mass ratio of strain ad 3 to activated sludge 1 0 as and strain ad 3 samples were collected during the reactive period of corresponding experiments for dna and rna extraction the total dna was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mo bio laboratories inc usa the total rna of samples was extracted using the powermicrobiome rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa the dna and rna libraries were sequenced on a novaseq 6000 illumina at magigene guangzhou china to generate 150 nt paired end reads sludge samples were also collected from r1 at day 1st day 25th and day 90th respectively the primer used for amplifying bacterial 16s rrna gene variable regions v3 v4 wang et al 2020b li et al 2017 was given in table s1 2 4 metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analysis raw reads were quality filtered using sickle version 1 33 joshi and fass 2011 as described by bhattacharjee et al 2017 diamond version 0 8 34 buchfink et al 2015 was used to compare sample dna and rna reads against a custom manually curated database of pahs degrading relative enzymes with the e value cut off 10 5 the database contains key enzymes associated with pahs degradation as defined by kegg https www kegg jp pathway ko00624 k18257 high quality metagenomic assembled genomes mags were recovered and their abundance and expression were determined as described in li et al 2018 checkm was used to assess the completeness and quality of each mags parks et al 2015 li et al 2020b bbduk with default settings was used to predict relative abundance and expression of each mag based on the number of dna or rna reads mapping to the genome li et al 2018 taxonomic assignment of the mags was carried out using gtdb tk v1 1 0 chaumeil et al 2019 annotation of the scaffolded genome bins was performed using metapathways version 2 0 against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway kegg database konwar et al 2013 raw sequencing data was available on ncbi prjna781786 2 5 analytical methods the phe and its downstream products were extracted from the mixture of water and sludge according to feng et al 2012 in brief ethyl acetate was used for extraction of targeted compounds with a volume ratio of 1 1 the extract was then evaporated at 40 c and then redissolved in methanol finally was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the parameter settings of the uv detector temperature oven and mobile phase when detecting 1h2n ga pca and cat were given in table s2 2 6 statistical analysis all tests were performed in triplicates and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation an analysis of variance anova was used to to identify statistical differences between samples from the control and bioaugmented sludge and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of phe degradation critical phe degrading performance of the strain ad 3 pure culture as system and bs system were shown in fig 1 respectively as expected strain ad 3 is highly active in the degradation of phe of which the sdr of phe is as high as 600 1200 times of as in control fig 1a moreover it was demonstrated that significant enhancement of phe degradation occurred in the bs after bioaugmentation by strain ad 3 fig 1b when the w w of activated sludge to strain ad 3 was tested at range of 0 25 8 0 all the sdr of phe in bs system were significantly higher than the theoretical sdr sum values of strain ad 3 and activated sludge p 0 05 besides the observed maximum sdr of in this bioaugmentation system could reach 2 2 mg gvss 1 h 1 which was even much higher than other previous reported non halophilic bioaugmented system with the sdr in the range of approximately 0 25 0 50 μgphe gvss 1 h 1 sfaelou et al 2016 chu et al 2021 further analysis noted that when w w was set at 0 5 1 5 the optimal bioaugmentation effect was achieved with the highest enhanced increment δsdr by per unit weight of strain ad 3 bioaugmented fig 1c δsdr was equal to the sdr of bs minus the sdr of bsexp which was used to describe the bioaugmentation effect with different mass ratio of strain ad 3 to activated sludge bioaugmentation effect was existent only when δsdr 0 when the w w of activated sludge to strain ad 3 was 0 1 and 0 2 sdr of phe in bs system were observed lower than the theoretical sdr sum values which suggest that there may be a threshold abundance of strain ad 3 to exhibit bioaugmented phe degradation performance it seemed necessary for pahs degraders with enough strain ad 3 population density to perform a high degradation activity which may regulate by quorum sensing li et al 2020c kumari et al 2016 the 1h2n is a typical observed metabolic intermediate during pah bio degrading sun et al 2021 leneva et al 2009 fig 1d f showed the accumulation profiles of 1h2n in strain ad 3 as and bs w w 1 0 respectively during phe degradation which was defined as the mass ratio of detected 1h2n to degraded phe results demonstrated that sdr of phe was relatively high 3 mg gvss h 1 in strain ad 3 but with a considerable accumulation of 1h2n 80 the sdr of phe and accumulation of 1h2n in as were 0 05 0 15 mg gvss h 1 and 0 6 6 0 respectively while that were 0 2 1 2 mg gvss h 1 and 9 19 respectively in bs the accumulation of 1h2n has been decreased significantly in bs system compared than that of strain ad 3 p 0 05 it has been reported that 1h2n is more toxic for plants than pah molecules for example the root length of sorghum could be shortened with the presence of 1h2n dubrovskaya et al 2016 what s more 1h2n has greater polarity and water solubility which means it has stronger migration ability in water environment parikh et al 2004 therefore bs is an efficient biosystem both for phe degradation and its intermediates removal which can reduce secondary pollution problem caused by pahs 3 2 reads based analysis of phe degrading genes based on the accumulation of 1h2n during phe degradation it is necessary to examine the functional genes profile of phe metabolic pathway some other downstream metabolites of phe like pca ga and cat have also been observed during pah biodegradation process liao et al 2021 kristanti et al 2018 jia et al 2019 it is rational to speculate the degradations of these metabolites are speed limiting steps during phe metabolism of this work fig 2 a thus we chose some key genes involving phe degrading for their relative abundance and expression analysis fig 2b demonstrates the abundance and expression values of phe initial dihydroxylation genes nida pah dioxygenase ndob naphthalene 1 2 dioxygenase 1h2n degradation genes phdi 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoate dioxygenase nahg salicylate hydroxylase and downstream products degradation genes nagg salicylate 5 hydroxylase nahh catechol 2 3 dioxygenase xlne gentisate 1 2 dioxygenase liga protocatechuate 4 5 dioxygenase pcag protocatechuate 3 4 dioxygenase the relative abundance and expression value were evaluated by normalizing the annotated reads to reads per million total reads rpm zhuang et al 2020 in strain ad 3 abundances of nida ndob nahh and xlne were at high level 50 rpm as well as their expression values however nahg salicylate hydroxylase and nagg salicylate 5 hydroxylase accusing for 1h2n and salicylic acid degradation respectively sanseverrino et al 1993 were few in both abundance and expression according to our previous study downstream degradation of phe in strain ad 3 was achieved mainly through salicylic acid pathway which rely on the expression of nahg nagg and xlne huang et al 2015 the low abundance and low expression of nahg might be the reason of the extensive accumulation of 1h2n observed in phe degradation performance by strain ad 3 in bs and as their tested key functional genes shared similar abundances while the expression value was much higher in bs than in as indicating that the metabolic activity of phe was triggered with the addition of strain ad 3 notably functional genes involving in 1h2n degradation phdi 1h2n dioxygenase and nahg salicylate hydroxylase were more highly expressed in bs than in as the expression value of nahg in bs was 14 times of that of strain ad 3 this explained the accumulation of 1h2n decreased a lot in bs system than in strain ad 3 what s more the expression values of downstream degradation genes for phe nahh xlne liga and pcag all presented an increase 9 folds in bs comparing to that of as that suggested two typical metabolic pathways of phe sa pathway and pa pathway might occurred simultaneously in bs system thus there must be a syntrophic interaction between strain ad 3 and species in activated sludge which resulted in the completely mineralization of phe 3 3 genome based analysis of key phe degrading species to investigate phe degradation functional community in the bioaugmented system metagenomic assembly was implemented and yielded 26 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags table s3 one mag identified as martelella was confirmed as the introduced exogenous strain ad 3 its relative abundances were 0 01 and 1 45 0 01 in as and bs respectively while its relative expressions were 0 01 and 1 59 0 02 in as and bs respectively fig 3 a strain ad 3 possessed with most key gene involving in phe degrading except nahg and nagg fig 3b it has been reported nahg and nahg like genes were effective in transforming 1h2n to its downstream product of 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene sanseverrino et al 1993 these results were consistent with the accumulation of 1h2n when degrading phe by strain ad 3 as expected taxonomic results showed that three genomes cbr1 corynebacterium alg1 alcaligenes and cb citrobacter were dominated in bs with relative abundances of 7 81 0 10 3 42 0 81 2 97 0 05 respectively what s more their relative expressions values were 8 65 1 53 1 16 0 24 0 08 0 01 respectively these three genomes all possessed with phdi gene which is responsible for transforming 1h2n to cis 2 carboxybenzalpyruvate among them alg1 encoding xlne and liga cb encoding xlne were able to utilize downstream products of phe such as gentisate and protocatechuate interestingly we also found nahg both in cbr3 and bcl bacillus this evidently proved 1h2n can be transformed to 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene in bs system nevertheless the relative abundance and expression of bcl exhibited an increase after strain ad 3 was added into activated sludge increasing from 0 01 to 0 62 0 02 and 0 01 to 0 25 0 01 respectively previous study showed that some bacillus can degrade pahs under extreme environmental conditions such as high salinity laothamteep et al 2021 in this study bcl possessing nahg was high likely to make a certain contribution in degrading 1h2n in bs system according to genome based analysis it can be speculated that most species in activated sludge have the potential to degrade downstream metabolites of phe this sort of potential could be triggered once the metabolites of phe were provided by strain ad 3 for its superhigh rate of phe degradation 3 4 synergistic interaction between strain ad 3 and activated sludge microbes to verify the synergistic interaction between strain ad 3 and activated sludge microbes the 1h2n cat ga and pca i e key metabolites of phe degradation assay was conducted by bs w w 1 0 as and strain ad 3 respectively fig 4 showed that the sdrs of three intermediates i e cat pca and ga were significantly higher than those of phe and 1h2n in all tested three groups p 0 05 that means transformation from above phe downstream intermediates products to further tca circle was much more common and easier than that of the steps of phe and 1h2n degradation which was also supported by the study of zada et al 2021 besides strain ad 3 demonstrated the strong ability to degrade phe with the sdr of 57 9 mg gvss 1 h 1 which is about 4 fold of the 1h2n sdr of 15 1 mg gvss 1 h 1 fig 4a it was supported by the high 1h2n accumulation during phe degradation by strain ad 3 in fig 1d at same condition in as although the sdr of 1h2n can be 0 33 mg gvss 1 h 1 but the phe degradation was limited by the first step with the sdr of only 0 03 mg gvss 1 h 1 fig 4b while in the bs system the sdrs of phe and 1h2n were as high as 0 55 and 0 47 mg gvss 1 h 1 respectively both were higher than those in as system fig 4c these results proved that strain ad 3 mainly made the contribution in transforming phe to 1h2n while the native species in activated sludge could utilize 1h2n as substrate which made the mineralization of phe more complete in bs system than that in as system or strain ad 3 above results strongly indicated a synergistic relationship between strain ad 3 and indigenous microbes in activated sludge was established for cooperative biodegradation of phe strain ad 3 was effective in transforming phe to 1h2n with tremendous accumulation of 1h2n which might place an inhibitory effect on itself and other microbes in activated sludge balashova et al 2001 species in activated sludge such as alcaligenes citrobacter and bacillus could fasten the degradation rate of 1h2n as demonstrated in the intermediates degradation assays thus a clear synergistic pattern could be drawn between strain ad 3 accused for upstream degradation of phe and species in activated sludge accused for downstream degradation fig 4d providing a novel strategy for potential application in such industry wastewater treatment 3 5 phe removal performance of bs in long term sbr operation the effects of bioaugmentation with strain ad 3 on removal of phe in the long term sbrs were finally examined to confirm the applicability and flexibility as shown in fig 5 a a significant enhancement of phe removal was observed in r1 compared with the r0 control throughout the experimental period days 23 91 the phe in effluent of r1 steadily decreased to lower level of less than 2 5 mg l 1 with the removal efficiently of 87 5 93 0 while that was always above 15 mg l 1 in r0 although 1h2n were detected in effluent of two reactors but after 55 days operation the concentrations were both detected below 0 55 mg l 1 fig 5b there are some important environmental variables that might place an influence on phe degradation it was suggested that the favored c n ratio for microbial pahs degradation under saline condition ranges from 10 1 to 10 4 moghadam et al 2014 simarro et al 2011 therefore the c n ratio in this study was set at around 10 1 which is also a typical value in coking wastewater yang et al 2017 do is another important variable for aerobic phe degradation although high do was always favored for aerobic pahs mineralization p 0 05 in this study the do concentration was controlled at 2 5 mg l 1 due to its effectiveness and economy boyd et al 2005 surfactants has been intensively reported with its increasement on pahs solubility in water which would enhance the bioavailability of pahs lu et al 2021 however such increasement is reported to be inefficient for biodegradation of phe at the milligram level xiao et al 2021 so the addition of surfactants was not considered in all the experiments what s more 16s rrna gene sequencing based community analysis for r1 showed that the relative abundance of strain ad 3 was increase from 0 6 at day 25 to 3 9 at day 90 besides the important partner of corynebacterium for phe degradation as speculated by mags analysis was also detected in the 16s rrna gene sequencing results with relative abundance of 1 1 at the end of experiment fig 5c while the relative abundance of alcaligenes citrobacter and bacillus were less than 0 1 these results confirmed that the synergistic interaction between strain ad 3 and some specific bacteria in activated sludge can build a stable relationship during long term operation 3 6 implication of this work traditional as system showed very limited pahs removal rates in saline wastewater due to the low tolerance to pahs toxicity and high salinity stress ahmadi et al 2017 although some pure strain culture system was reported to show high halophilic pah degradation capacity but it is hard to achieve complete mineralization wang et al 2020a in this study the built bs system is able to degrade pahs as well as their intermediates in an effective way through a synergistic corporation an optimal w w ratio 0 5 1 5 of strain ad 3 to activated sludge has also been revealed the complete mineralization of phe would occur under such ratio conditions when the rate of upstream degradation matched with that of downstream degradation which is conducted by different species respectively the meta omic analyses showed that members of corynebacterium alcaligenes bacillus and citrobacter in initial activated sludge system might share a synergistic relationship with strain ad 3 by the 1h2n scavenging long term operation of the bioaugmented sbr showed a 93 removal rate for phe with few 1h2n accumulated this means the bioaugmentation strategy can be predictably applied in the existing activated sludge system for enhancing pahs removal in saline wastewater pahs degradation under high salinity condition was rarely observed in activated sludge system ji et al 2016 the bs system built in this work pave the way for the bio treatment of saline industrial wastewater containing pahs using a halophilic strain based activated sludge system our findings might also provide a generalizable approach to reduce the pahs content for the bioremediation of other similar contaminated systems in natural environment with similar environmental conditions such as soil and ground water 4 conclusion in this work bioaugmented system build up by adding halophilic strain ad 3 into municipal activated sludge has been investigated for its performance of phe degrading under

15971,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a group of common recalcitrant pollutant in industrial saline wastewater that raised significant concerns whereas traditional activated sludge as has limited tolerance to high salinity and pahs toxicity restricting its capacity to degrade pahs it is therefore urgent to develop a bioaugmented sludge bs system to aid in the effective degradation of these types of compounds under saline condition in this study a novel bioaugmentation strategy was developed by using halophilic martelella sp ad 3 for effectively augmented phenanthrene phe degradation under 3 salinity it was found that a 0 5 1 5 w w ratio of strain ad 3 to activated sludge was optimal for achieving high phe degradation activity of the bs system with degradation rates reaching 2 2 mg gvss 1 h 1 nearly 25 times that of the as system although 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid 1h2n was accumulated obviously the mineralization of phe was more complete in the bs system reads based metagenomic coupled metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that the expression values of ndob encoding a dioxygenase associated with phe ring cleavage was 5600 fold higher in the bs system than in the as system metagenome assembly showed the members of the corynebacterium and alcaligenes genera were abundant in the strain ad 3 bioaugmented bs system with expression of 10 3 1 8 and 1 9 0 26 respectively moreover phdi and nahg accused for metabolism of 1h2n have been annotated in both above two genera degradation assays of intermediates of phe confirmed that the activated sludge actually possessed considerable degradation capacity for downstream intermediates of phe including 1h2n the degradation capacity ratio of 1h2n to phe was 87 in bs system while it was 26 in strain ad 3 these results indicated that strain ad 3 contributed mainly in transforming phe to 1h2n in bs system while species in activated sludge utilized 1h2n as substrate to grow thus establishing a syntrophic interaction with strain ad 3 and achieving the complete mineralization of phe long term continuous experiment confirmed a stable phe removal efficiency of 93 and few 1h2n accumulation in bs sbr system this study demonstrated an effective bioaugmented strategy for the bioremediation of saline wastewater containing pahs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phenanthrene saline wastewater martelella sp ad 3 bioaugmented system synergistic effect 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a group of common persistent carcinogenic organic compounds in industrial saline wastewaters especially associated with petroleum refining and coal coking processes mojiri et al 2019 goudarzi et al 2018 yang and chen 2004 the salinity range of these pah containing wastewaters was reported from 1 to 12 lefebvre and moletta 2006 ding et al 2021 a typical example of a pah contaminant is phenanthrene phe which has been widely detected in diverse industrial wastewater sources with a reported pahs concentration range of 5 50 mg l 1 yu et al 2021 crisafully et al 2008 smol et al 2012 due to the reproductive toxicity of phe and other pahs in aquatic organisms as well as being a general threat to public health safety pahs are now considered a significant environmental pollutant attracting great attentions recently peng et al 2019 previously the physical chemical remediation of pahs contaminated industrial saline wastewater were intensively reported such as adsorption membrane filtration e g ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation processes e g persulfate yin et al 2021 li et al 2019 smol et al 2016 li et al 2021 however these non biological techniques are not only highly costly but also along with biproducts generation which may cause further secondary pollution peng et al 2018 bioremediation is recognized as a potential preferred way for eliminating pahs from saline wastewater due to its economical and environment friendly advantages raper et al 2018 nevertheless the traditional biological processes such as activated sludge can be readily inhibited by the high salinity or toxicity of the pahs compounds lefebvre and moletta 2006 to our knowledge few studies reported the biodegradation of pahs by as based system at high salinity 3 for example even below relatively low salinity of 1 limited pahs removal 50 was observed in a sequencing batch reactor sbr ofman and skoczko 2018 recently amounts of pure cultures such as members of the thalassospira hortaea staphylococcus have been isolated and proved to be capable of pahs degradation under high saline condition zhou et al 2016 al farraj et al 2019 nzila et al 2021 taken thalassospira as model strain the microbial metabolic pathways of pahs degradation under saline condition have also been illustrated zhou et al 2016 generally these halophilic bacterial aerobic degradations of pahs are activated by a dioxygenase then with the participation of dehydrogenases aldolases and hydroxylases a series of intermediates such as 1h2n phthalic acid pa and salicylic acid sa were generated finally these metabolites intermediates could be completely mineralized through the pa or sa pathway zhou et al 2016 sakshi and haritash 2020 although there are some halophilic pure cultures have been studied for pahs degrading few reports addressed strategies of halophilic microbes bioaugmentation into traditional as system for further significantly improving the effective degradation of pahs at high salinity to date we previously isolated a halophilic pahs degrader martelella sp strain ad 3 which can grow on a group of pahs as sole carbon in the salinity range of 1 8 feng et al 2012 cui et al 2016 strain ad 3 exhibits superhigh phe degrading rate of 62 4 mg g vss 1 h 1 at optimal 3 salinity feng et al 2012 in this study we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel bioaugmentation strategy through using strain ad 3 in activated sludge system for the reinforcement of phe removal performance under high salinity condition to this end we firstly conducted a series of phe degradation experiments to determine the optimized biomass ratio of extrinsic strain ad 3 to activated sludge we then used metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis to investigate the synergistic interaction relationship between the strain ad 3 and microbes in activated sludge for the complete mineralization of phe under high salinity condition the degradation experiments for intermediates from phe degradation were also performed to further confirm the syntrophic role of strain ad 3 in activated sludge for phe degradation finally two sbr bioreactors were set up for long term operation to confirm the phe degradation performance under high salinity condition by the bioaugmentation strategy 2 methods and materials 2 1 activated sludge culture medium and martelella sp ad 3 activated sludge was obtained from the outlet of an aeration tank at the chang qiao municipal wastewater treatment plant shanghai china and was transferred to a laboratory scale reactor with a working volume of 1 l that was operated in sequencing batch mode for one month the culture medium used had 3 minimal salt nacl and contained per l nh4cl 0 10 g k2hpo4 0 02 g mgcl2 6h2o 3 85 g mgso4 7h2o 5 23 g cacl2 0 38 g kcl 1 10 g nahco3 0 05 g nabr 0 13 g and 0 5 ml of trace element solution feng et al 2012 the influent was also supplemented with 0 25 g l 1 sodium acetate as carbon source but without phe the cod removal ratio was finally stable at about 82 3 other details for operation are available in li et al 2020a prior to bioaugmentation assays the activated sludge was aerated for 2 days to exhaust stores of carbon the pah degrading bacterium martelella sp ad 3 used in this study was previously isolated in our laboratory from petroleum contaminated high salinity soil by enrichment on anthracene as the sole carbon and energy source to prepare seed cultures pure cultures of strain ad 3 were cultivated in the mineral salt medium msm described above supplemented with phe at a concentration of 100 mg l 1 for 2 days 30 c cultured cells were harvested by centrifugation 12000 g 3 min and washed three times and then diluted with fresh msm to a final od600 of 0 25 which was equal to a final concentration of biomass of 0 35 mg cells ml 1 and then stored at 4 c for bioaugmentation experiments 2 2 bioaugmentation experiments to construct bioaugmented sludge bs starved seed activated sludge was first transferred into 3 msm giving a final volatile suspended solids vss of about 1 5 g l 1 which was determined according to li et al 2014 cells of ad 3 prepared as described above were added to this to give the following mass ratios w w of strain ad 3 to activated sludge 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 5 0 and 8 0 then phe dissolved in n n dimethylformamide as a stock solution 100 g l 1 was added to bs in an erlenmeyer flask resulting in an environmentally relevant concentration of phe of 20 mg l 1 within the reported pahs concentration ranges of 5 50 mg l 1 in industrial wastewater crisafully et al 2008 smol et al 2012 finally the ph was adjusted to 7 5 0 1 with 0 1 mol hcl l 1 the experiments were conducted at 30 c with shaking at 150 rpm control flasks with only activated sludge as or strain ad 3 were also assayed with all assays being done in triplicates to further investigate the degrade complete of the bs to the phe four reported main intermediate compounds imam et al 2021 were individually used as sole carbon source in the specific four groups of bs activity assays specifically the 1h2n gentisic acid ga catechol cat and protocatechuic acid pca were individually supplemented into 3 msm at a concentration of 20 mg l 1 the mixed culture was inoculated with a 1 mass ratio of strain ad 3 to activated sludge making the final mlvss concentration 1 5 g l 1 experiments for each compound were conducted at 30 c with shaking at 150 rpm with each group setting triplicates to normalize the degradation rate of phe and its metabolites in different bio systems the specific degradation rate sdr was calculated using the following formula 1 sdr c 0 c m t where c0 c m and t are the initial substrate concentration mg l 1 residual substrate concentration in first 2h mg l 1 biomass mg l 1 and reaction time h respectively to assess the bioaugmentation effect of strain ad 3 on phe degradation the expected sdr of bs bsexp based on sum activity of strain ad 3 and as was calculated assuming that there was no syntrophic nor antagonistic interaction in bs the syntrophic interaction was considered only when the determined sdr of bs eq 1 was higher than the sdr of bsexp 2 sdr of b s exp sd r as m as sd r ad 3 m ad 3 m as m ad 3 where sdras and sdrad 3 represent sdr of as and strain ad 3 respectively while mas and mad 3 represent biomass concentration of as and strain ad 3 respectively to further confirm the long term feasibility and stability of phe removal performance in the proposed bs system two sbrs with a working volume of 1 l have been set up for phe degradation experiments r1 was initially seeded with strain ad 3 and activated sludge w w 1 0 while r0 was seeded with only activated sludge as control the other operations were the same in both sbrs the reactor temperature was set at 25 1 c dissolved oxygen in sbr was maintained at 2 5 mg l 1 by aeration the initial sludge concentration in the reactor was 3 0 gvss l 1 the operating cycle was 240 min which comprised 5 min feeding 225 min aeration 5 min settling 5 min decanting and idling the volumetric exchange ratio was set at 65 corresponding to a hydraulic retention time of 6 h the influent contained phe of 20 mg l 1 and sodium acetate of 250 mg l 1 other influent substrates were the same as the msm stated above 2 3 dna and rna extraction and sequencing the bs mass ratio of strain ad 3 to activated sludge 1 0 as and strain ad 3 samples were collected during the reactive period of corresponding experiments for dna and rna extraction the total dna was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mo bio laboratories inc usa the total rna of samples was extracted using the powermicrobiome rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa the dna and rna libraries were sequenced on a novaseq 6000 illumina at magigene guangzhou china to generate 150 nt paired end reads sludge samples were also collected from r1 at day 1st day 25th and day 90th respectively the primer used for amplifying bacterial 16s rrna gene variable regions v3 v4 wang et al 2020b li et al 2017 was given in table s1 2 4 metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analysis raw reads were quality filtered using sickle version 1 33 joshi and fass 2011 as described by bhattacharjee et al 2017 diamond version 0 8 34 buchfink et al 2015 was used to compare sample dna and rna reads against a custom manually curated database of pahs degrading relative enzymes with the e value cut off 10 5 the database contains key enzymes associated with pahs degradation as defined by kegg https www kegg jp pathway ko00624 k18257 high quality metagenomic assembled genomes mags were recovered and their abundance and expression were determined as described in li et al 2018 checkm was used to assess the completeness and quality of each mags parks et al 2015 li et al 2020b bbduk with default settings was used to predict relative abundance and expression of each mag based on the number of dna or rna reads mapping to the genome li et al 2018 taxonomic assignment of the mags was carried out using gtdb tk v1 1 0 chaumeil et al 2019 annotation of the scaffolded genome bins was performed using metapathways version 2 0 against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway kegg database konwar et al 2013 raw sequencing data was available on ncbi prjna781786 2 5 analytical methods the phe and its downstream products were extracted from the mixture of water and sludge according to feng et al 2012 in brief ethyl acetate was used for extraction of targeted compounds with a volume ratio of 1 1 the extract was then evaporated at 40 c and then redissolved in methanol finally was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the parameter settings of the uv detector temperature oven and mobile phase when detecting 1h2n ga pca and cat were given in table s2 2 6 statistical analysis all tests were performed in triplicates and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation an analysis of variance anova was used to to identify statistical differences between samples from the control and bioaugmented sludge and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of phe degradation critical phe degrading performance of the strain ad 3 pure culture as system and bs system were shown in fig 1 respectively as expected strain ad 3 is highly active in the degradation of phe of which the sdr of phe is as high as 600 1200 times of as in control fig 1a moreover it was demonstrated that significant enhancement of phe degradation occurred in the bs after bioaugmentation by strain ad 3 fig 1b when the w w of activated sludge to strain ad 3 was tested at range of 0 25 8 0 all the sdr of phe in bs system were significantly higher than the theoretical sdr sum values of strain ad 3 and activated sludge p 0 05 besides the observed maximum sdr of in this bioaugmentation system could reach 2 2 mg gvss 1 h 1 which was even much higher than other previous reported non halophilic bioaugmented system with the sdr in the range of approximately 0 25 0 50 μgphe gvss 1 h 1 sfaelou et al 2016 chu et al 2021 further analysis noted that when w w was set at 0 5 1 5 the optimal bioaugmentation effect was achieved with the highest enhanced increment δsdr by per unit weight of strain ad 3 bioaugmented fig 1c δsdr was equal to the sdr of bs minus the sdr of bsexp which was used to describe the bioaugmentation effect with different mass ratio of strain ad 3 to activated sludge bioaugmentation effect was existent only when δsdr 0 when the w w of activated sludge to strain ad 3 was 0 1 and 0 2 sdr of phe in bs system were observed lower than the theoretical sdr sum values which suggest that there may be a threshold abundance of strain ad 3 to exhibit bioaugmented phe degradation performance it seemed necessary for pahs degraders with enough strain ad 3 population density to perform a high degradation activity which may regulate by quorum sensing li et al 2020c kumari et al 2016 the 1h2n is a typical observed metabolic intermediate during pah bio degrading sun et al 2021 leneva et al 2009 fig 1d f showed the accumulation profiles of 1h2n in strain ad 3 as and bs w w 1 0 respectively during phe degradation which was defined as the mass ratio of detected 1h2n to degraded phe results demonstrated that sdr of phe was relatively high 3 mg gvss h 1 in strain ad 3 but with a considerable accumulation of 1h2n 80 the sdr of phe and accumulation of 1h2n in as were 0 05 0 15 mg gvss h 1 and 0 6 6 0 respectively while that were 0 2 1 2 mg gvss h 1 and 9 19 respectively in bs the accumulation of 1h2n has been decreased significantly in bs system compared than that of strain ad 3 p 0 05 it has been reported that 1h2n is more toxic for plants than pah molecules for example the root length of sorghum could be shortened with the presence of 1h2n dubrovskaya et al 2016 what s more 1h2n has greater polarity and water solubility which means it has stronger migration ability in water environment parikh et al 2004 therefore bs is an efficient biosystem both for phe degradation and its intermediates removal which can reduce secondary pollution problem caused by pahs 3 2 reads based analysis of phe degrading genes based on the accumulation of 1h2n during phe degradation it is necessary to examine the functional genes profile of phe metabolic pathway some other downstream metabolites of phe like pca ga and cat have also been observed during pah biodegradation process liao et al 2021 kristanti et al 2018 jia et al 2019 it is rational to speculate the degradations of these metabolites are speed limiting steps during phe metabolism of this work fig 2 a thus we chose some key genes involving phe degrading for their relative abundance and expression analysis fig 2b demonstrates the abundance and expression values of phe initial dihydroxylation genes nida pah dioxygenase ndob naphthalene 1 2 dioxygenase 1h2n degradation genes phdi 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoate dioxygenase nahg salicylate hydroxylase and downstream products degradation genes nagg salicylate 5 hydroxylase nahh catechol 2 3 dioxygenase xlne gentisate 1 2 dioxygenase liga protocatechuate 4 5 dioxygenase pcag protocatechuate 3 4 dioxygenase the relative abundance and expression value were evaluated by normalizing the annotated reads to reads per million total reads rpm zhuang et al 2020 in strain ad 3 abundances of nida ndob nahh and xlne were at high level 50 rpm as well as their expression values however nahg salicylate hydroxylase and nagg salicylate 5 hydroxylase accusing for 1h2n and salicylic acid degradation respectively sanseverrino et al 1993 were few in both abundance and expression according to our previous study downstream degradation of phe in strain ad 3 was achieved mainly through salicylic acid pathway which rely on the expression of nahg nagg and xlne huang et al 2015 the low abundance and low expression of nahg might be the reason of the extensive accumulation of 1h2n observed in phe degradation performance by strain ad 3 in bs and as their tested key functional genes shared similar abundances while the expression value was much higher in bs than in as indicating that the metabolic activity of phe was triggered with the addition of strain ad 3 notably functional genes involving in 1h2n degradation phdi 1h2n dioxygenase and nahg salicylate hydroxylase were more highly expressed in bs than in as the expression value of nahg in bs was 14 times of that of strain ad 3 this explained the accumulation of 1h2n decreased a lot in bs system than in strain ad 3 what s more the expression values of downstream degradation genes for phe nahh xlne liga and pcag all presented an increase 9 folds in bs comparing to that of as that suggested two typical metabolic pathways of phe sa pathway and pa pathway might occurred simultaneously in bs system thus there must be a syntrophic interaction between strain ad 3 and species in activated sludge which resulted in the completely mineralization of phe 3 3 genome based analysis of key phe degrading species to investigate phe degradation functional community in the bioaugmented system metagenomic assembly was implemented and yielded 26 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags table s3 one mag identified as martelella was confirmed as the introduced exogenous strain ad 3 its relative abundances were 0 01 and 1 45 0 01 in as and bs respectively while its relative expressions were 0 01 and 1 59 0 02 in as and bs respectively fig 3 a strain ad 3 possessed with most key gene involving in phe degrading except nahg and nagg fig 3b it has been reported nahg and nahg like genes were effective in transforming 1h2n to its downstream product of 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene sanseverrino et al 1993 these results were consistent with the accumulation of 1h2n when degrading phe by strain ad 3 as expected taxonomic results showed that three genomes cbr1 corynebacterium alg1 alcaligenes and cb citrobacter were dominated in bs with relative abundances of 7 81 0 10 3 42 0 81 2 97 0 05 respectively what s more their relative expressions values were 8 65 1 53 1 16 0 24 0 08 0 01 respectively these three genomes all possessed with phdi gene which is responsible for transforming 1h2n to cis 2 carboxybenzalpyruvate among them alg1 encoding xlne and liga cb encoding xlne were able to utilize downstream products of phe such as gentisate and protocatechuate interestingly we also found nahg both in cbr3 and bcl bacillus this evidently proved 1h2n can be transformed to 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene in bs system nevertheless the relative abundance and expression of bcl exhibited an increase after strain ad 3 was added into activated sludge increasing from 0 01 to 0 62 0 02 and 0 01 to 0 25 0 01 respectively previous study showed that some bacillus can degrade pahs under extreme environmental conditions such as high salinity laothamteep et al 2021 in this study bcl possessing nahg was high likely to make a certain contribution in degrading 1h2n in bs system according to genome based analysis it can be speculated that most species in activated sludge have the potential to degrade downstream metabolites of phe this sort of potential could be triggered once the metabolites of phe were provided by strain ad 3 for its superhigh rate of phe degradation 3 4 synergistic interaction between strain ad 3 and activated sludge microbes to verify the synergistic interaction between strain ad 3 and activated sludge microbes the 1h2n cat ga and pca i e key metabolites of phe degradation assay was conducted by bs w w 1 0 as and strain ad 3 respectively fig 4 showed that the sdrs of three intermediates i e cat pca and ga were significantly higher than those of phe and 1h2n in all tested three groups p 0 05 that means transformation from above phe downstream intermediates products to further tca circle was much more common and easier than that of the steps of phe and 1h2n degradation which was also supported by the study of zada et al 2021 besides strain ad 3 demonstrated the strong ability to degrade phe with the sdr of 57 9 mg gvss 1 h 1 which is about 4 fold of the 1h2n sdr of 15 1 mg gvss 1 h 1 fig 4a it was supported by the high 1h2n accumulation during phe degradation by strain ad 3 in fig 1d at same condition in as although the sdr of 1h2n can be 0 33 mg gvss 1 h 1 but the phe degradation was limited by the first step with the sdr of only 0 03 mg gvss 1 h 1 fig 4b while in the bs system the sdrs of phe and 1h2n were as high as 0 55 and 0 47 mg gvss 1 h 1 respectively both were higher than those in as system fig 4c these results proved that strain ad 3 mainly made the contribution in transforming phe to 1h2n while the native species in activated sludge could utilize 1h2n as substrate which made the mineralization of phe more complete in bs system than that in as system or strain ad 3 above results strongly indicated a synergistic relationship between strain ad 3 and indigenous microbes in activated sludge was established for cooperative biodegradation of phe strain ad 3 was effective in transforming phe to 1h2n with tremendous accumulation of 1h2n which might place an inhibitory effect on itself and other microbes in activated sludge balashova et al 2001 species in activated sludge such as alcaligenes citrobacter and bacillus could fasten the degradation rate of 1h2n as demonstrated in the intermediates degradation assays thus a clear synergistic pattern could be drawn between strain ad 3 accused for upstream degradation of phe and species in activated sludge accused for downstream degradation fig 4d providing a novel strategy for potential application in such industry wastewater treatment 3 5 phe removal performance of bs in long term sbr operation the effects of bioaugmentation with strain ad 3 on removal of phe in the long term sbrs were finally examined to confirm the applicability and flexibility as shown in fig 5 a a significant enhancement of phe removal was observed in r1 compared with the r0 control throughout the experimental period days 23 91 the phe in effluent of r1 steadily decreased to lower level of less than 2 5 mg l 1 with the removal efficiently of 87 5 93 0 while that was always above 15 mg l 1 in r0 although 1h2n were detected in effluent of two reactors but after 55 days operation the concentrations were both detected below 0 55 mg l 1 fig 5b there are some important environmental variables that might place an influence on phe degradation it was suggested that the favored c n ratio for microbial pahs degradation under saline condition ranges from 10 1 to 10 4 moghadam et al 2014 simarro et al 2011 therefore the c n ratio in this study was set at around 10 1 which is also a typical value in coking wastewater yang et al 2017 do is another important variable for aerobic phe degradation although high do was always favored for aerobic pahs mineralization p 0 05 in this study the do concentration was controlled at 2 5 mg l 1 due to its effectiveness and economy boyd et al 2005 surfactants has been intensively reported with its increasement on pahs solubility in water which would enhance the bioavailability of pahs lu et al 2021 however such increasement is reported to be inefficient for biodegradation of phe at the milligram level xiao et al 2021 so the addition of surfactants was not considered in all the experiments what s more 16s rrna gene sequencing based community analysis for r1 showed that the relative abundance of strain ad 3 was increase from 0 6 at day 25 to 3 9 at day 90 besides the important partner of corynebacterium for phe degradation as speculated by mags analysis was also detected in the 16s rrna gene sequencing results with relative abundance of 1 1 at the end of experiment fig 5c while the relative abundance of alcaligenes citrobacter and bacillus were less than 0 1 these results confirmed that the synergistic interaction between strain ad 3 and some specific bacteria in activated sludge can build a stable relationship during long term operation 3 6 implication of this work traditional as system showed very limited pahs removal rates in saline wastewater due to the low tolerance to pahs toxicity and high salinity stress ahmadi et al 2017 although some pure strain culture system was reported to show high halophilic pah degradation capacity but it is hard to achieve complete mineralization wang et al 2020a in this study the built bs system is able to degrade pahs as well as their intermediates in an effective way through a synergistic corporation an optimal w w ratio 0 5 1 5 of strain ad 3 to activated sludge has also been revealed the complete mineralization of phe would occur under such ratio conditions when the rate of upstream degradation matched with that of downstream degradation which is conducted by different species respectively the meta omic analyses showed that members of corynebacterium alcaligenes bacillus and citrobacter in initial activated sludge system might share a synergistic relationship with strain ad 3 by the 1h2n scavenging long term operation of the bioaugmented sbr showed a 93 removal rate for phe with few 1h2n accumulated this means the bioaugmentation strategy can be predictably applied in the existing activated sludge system for enhancing pahs removal in saline wastewater pahs degradation under high salinity condition was rarely observed in activated sludge system ji et al 2016 the bs system built in this work pave the way for the bio treatment of saline industrial wastewater containing pahs using a halophilic strain based activated sludge system our findings might also provide a generalizable approach to reduce the pahs content for the bioremediation of other similar contaminated systems in natural environment with similar environmental conditions such as soil and ground water 4 conclusion in this work bioaugmented system build up by adding halophilic strain ad 3 into municipal activated sludge has been investigated for its performance of phe degrading under salinity of 3 excellent phe degradation activity of 0 08 2 2 mg gvss 1 h 1 was obtained with the ratio of strain ad 3 to activated sludge w w at 0 1 8 0 this phe degradation performance was confirmed by long term 90 days operation in a sbr with the phe removal of 93 0 the syntrophic interaction pattern between strain ad 3 and indigenous bacteria in activated sludge was also revealed by using metagenomic combined metatranscriptomic analyses it showed that corynebacterium alcaligenes and citrobacter in activated sludge might share a synergistic interaction with strain ad 3 a complementary metabolism that strain ad 3 accusing for transforming phe to 1h2n while the indigenous bacteria made contribution in degrading 1h2n as well as its downstream products was considered to accelerated the

15972,microplastics fibers are abundant in aquatic environments and are an emerging environmental threat understanding how fibers are transported in aquatic environments is essential for identifying pollution hotspots and developing remediation strategies over recent years an increasing number of drag models have been proposed to describe the transport of microplastics in aquatic environments however none of the proposed models consider secondary motions which are responsible for non vertical settling motions to investigate the role of secondary motions an experimental setup with an image processing technique was developed to capture the spatial temporal kinematics of microplastic fibers settling in quiescent water a new drag model which adopts the crosswise sphericity to consider the effects of secondary motions of a microplastic fiber and the aschenbrenner shape factor to account for the unique morphology of the microplastic fiber was proposed and evaluated secondary motions of microplastic fibers have profound effects on their settling trajectories and deposited positions the settling motion and drag coefficient of a microplastic fiber is an orientation dependent process moreover the secondary motion is strongly dependent on the fiber dimension and density the here proposed drag model is proven to more accurately characterize the settling motion of microplastic fibers compared to existing models that neglect secondary motions the methodology and model from this study can be used to progress towards improved and realistic predictions of the transport of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic fiber transport aquatic environments secondary motions settling orientation orientation dependent drag model 1 introduction microplastic pollution has emerged as a pressing environmental concern blettler et al 2018 in particular aquatic environments are a major sink for microplastic pollution zhao et al 2019 among the microplastics detected in aquatic environments fibers which are generally released from laundry effluent napper and thompson 2016 and fishing gear xue et al 2020 are commonly reported chen et al 2021 more importantly microplastic fibers have been traced in the food chain bessa et al 2018 which may pose a threat to human health senathirajah et al 2021 evidently the identification of pollution hotspots and remediation strategies are urgently needed to tackle this problem the improved prediction of the transport of microplastic fibers is a prerequisite zobkov et al 2019 this is because transport governs the concentration depth profile cowger et al 2021 and residence time khatmullina and isachenko 2017 of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments generally the transport of microplastics in aquatic environments can be modeled using the modified maxey riley equation dibenedetto et al 2018 roy et al 2022 which is expressed as follows yin et al 2003 1 m m d u m d t f g f b f d f l f v f p where mm is the microplastic mass um is the microplastic velocity t is the motion time of the microplastic and d dt is the time derivative following the moving microplastic the terms on the right side of eq 1 represent the forces due to gravity fg buoyancy fb drag fd lift fl virtual mass fv and pressure gradient in the fluid fp respectively in industrial processing the basset history force and faxén terms are generally neglected where particles are considered to be large for example yin et al 2003 and carranza and zhang 2017 ignored these two terms for particles with lengths of 50 mm and 20 2 mm respectively as such the basset history force and faxén terms are generally neglected for microplastic particles dibenedetto et al 2018 roy et al 2022 eq 1 can be expanded to show each force as follows yin et al 2003 m m d u m d t m m g m m ρ f ρ m g 1 2 c d ρ f a p u p u f 2 1 2 c l ρ f a p u p u f 2 2 1 2 m m ρ f ρ m d d t u p u f ρ f m m ρ m d u f d t where ρ m and ρ f are the particle and fluid densities respectively g is the gravitational acceleration uf is the fluid velocity c d and c l are the drag and lift coefficients respectively ap is the projected area of the particle normal to the settling direction and d dt is the time derivative of the fluid element when using eq 2 to model the transport of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments the physical properties of the microplastic fiber and fluid i e m p ρ p ρ f and ap can be measured and the kinematics of the microplastic fiber and fluid i e up and uf are obtained by using the time derivative of the displacement at each time step for a cylindrical particle e g microplastic fiber mando and rosendahl 2010 reported that its drag coefficient governs its settling motion and its lift coefficient governs its lateral motion the lift coefficient of a cylindrical particle can be estimated using its drag coefficient and settling orientation yin et al 2003 zastawny et al 2012 as follows 3 c l c d c o s 2 θ s i n θ where θ is the settling orientation which is defined as the angle between the principal axis of the particle and the horizontal plane evidently appropriate drag coefficients are central to obtaining reasonable predictions of both the settling and lateral motions of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments while a multitude of drag models have been proposed for the prediction of the drag coefficients of microplastic fibers settling in water khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 zhang and choi 2022 existing models do not take into account the effects of the secondary motions on the drag coefficients in fact it has been demonstrated in other disciplines that secondary motions strongly influence the drag coefficient chow and adams 2011 will et al 2021 this is because secondary motions which are the oscillatory behaviors of a particle as it settles in quiescent water are generally initiated by shedding wake vortices bagheri and bonadonna 2016 with secondary motions the pressure acting along the surface of the particle is redistributed chow and adams 2011 which causes an additional lift force to change the settling orientation zastawny et al 2012 both the lift force and settling orientation induced by secondary motions can affect the drag coefficient and thus the transport of microplastic fibers cf eq 3 to characterize the effects of secondary motions on the drag coefficient holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 adopted the crosswise sphericity i e the ratio of the projected area of the volume equivalent sphere of the particle to the projected area of the particle normal to the settling direction in their drag models however the applicability of the models proposed by holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 for predictions of the drag coefficients of microplastic fibers remains questionable this is because holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 proposed their drag models for non microplastic particles in industrial processing e g aluminum and steel particles and adopted sphericity i e the ratio of the surface area of the volume equivalent sphere of the particle to the surface area of the particle normal to the settling direction as a second shape factor which has been demonstrated to have limitations for describing the morphology of microplastic fibers zhang and choi 2022 thus a drag model that can characterize the secondary motions of microplastic fibers is required to improve predictions of their transport in aquatic environments the aforementioned drag models in the literature for microplastic fibers and non microplastic particles are summarized in table s1 of the supplementary material this study aims to reveal and characterize the effects of the secondary motions of microplastic fibers on their transport to achieve this an experimental setup is developed along with a novel image processing technique to capture the secondary motions of the settling microplastic fibers a new drag model is developed to consider the effects of secondary motions the experimental data is then used to evaluate the newly developed drag model 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastic fibers the microplastic fibers used in this study were cut from strands of polyester ropes the titration method section sm2 of the supplementary material was used to measure the density of the microplastic fibers ρ m 1308 kg m3 the length and diameter of each microplastic fiber were measured based on images captured by the digital microscope section sm3 of the supplementary material the microplastic fiber lengths range from 5 to 15 mm and the fiber diameters range from 0 45 to 0 85 mm which are dimensions that are commonly used in similar settling experiments waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup consists of a water column image acquisition system and illumination system fig 1 a the settling motion of a given microplastic fiber in the water column is tracked by using a camera that captures videos with images at a pixel resolution of 1920 1080 and a frame rate of 50 frames per second a mirror was placed at the side of the column to enable the reflection of the motion of a given microplastic fiber from the side of the column by adjusting the position of the camera the camera can be used to simultaneously capture the motion of a given microplastic fiber from both its front and reflected side view in the mirror fig 1b shows a pair of images captured from two different views a given microplastic fiber will have the same vertical coordinate i e y and y coordinates in fig 1b in the front and reflected side views which can later be used as a frame of reference to reconstruct its 3d setting motion the advantage of this setup is that it enables images from two different views i e front and reflected side to be captured without the need for multiple cameras cf will et al 2021 to ensure high quality images an illumination system is required the system consists of led lamps with diffusers the experimental setup was placed inside a darkroom to avoid the influence of external lighting a white backdrop was positioned behind the column to maximize the color contrast between a given fiber and its background 2 3 3d reconstruction of microplastic fiber kinematics obtaining the kinematics of a microplastic fiber e g settling velocity and settling orientation is a prerequisite for capturing its secondary motion generally the settling velocity of a microplastic fiber can be determined by using either the particle tracking velocimetry ptv technique nguyen et al 2020 or particle image velocimetry piv technique waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 both ptv and piv can be used to track the velocity of an object by dividing the displacement between two successive frames by the time interval qureshi et al 2020 the main difference between ptv and piv lies in how the particle displacement is obtained more specifically ptv tracks the motion of an individual particle whereas piv tracks the image texture to acquire the particle displacement gollin et al 2017 however both ptv and piv techniques regard a given microplastic fiber as a point mass and thus cannot be used to determine its settling orientation which needs to be calculated by using the 3d coordinates of its endpoints carranza and zhang 2017 to address this problem an image processing method was developed to identify the endpoints of a settling microplastic fiber in real time details of the image processing method are provided in section sm4 of the supplementary material herein we only briefly introduce the development of the image processing method and how it reconstructs the 3d kinematics of a microplastic fiber settling in water since only a single camera is used to synchronously capture the two planes of interest the captured microplastic fiber contours will inevitably be distorted wu et al 2019 to address this problem the perspective transformation algorithm is adopted after which each corrected image is converted into binary using the background subtraction technique piccardi 2004 after binarization a given microplastic fiber contour on each image appears as a white area against a black background the endpoints of a given microplastic fiber from each pair of binarized images can then be identified using the moore neighbor tracing algorithm embedded in matlab the last step is to reconstruct the settling motion of a given microplastic fiber in three dimensions based on the 2d coordinates of its endpoints since the pair of images share the same vertical edge fig 1b the 3d coordinate of each endpoint can be found by comparing the vertical coordinates of a pair of images i e y and y coordinates in fig 1b subsequently an iterative procedure can be used to process each pair of images to record the time history of the 3d coordinates of each endpoint of a given microplastic fiber with the time varying 3d coordinates the spatial temporal kinematics of a given microplastic fiber that is settling including its position velocity and orientation in the 3d space can be obtained section sm5 of the supplementary material to evaluate the reliability of the proposed image processing method we compare reconstructed settling orientations and velocities against the ones measured from the experiments the evaluation details are provided in section sm6 of the supplementary material the evaluation results show that the proposed image processing method can successfully track the 3d motions of a given settling microplastic fiber 2 4 characterization of settling hydrodynamics of microplastic fibers based on eqs 1 and 2 the settling motion of a microplastic fiber in quiescent water can be expressed as follows 4 ρ m v m d u z d t ρ m v m g ρ f v m g 1 2 c d ρ f a p u z 2 1 2 ρ f v m d u z d t where vm is the microplastic fiber volume that is determined based on the fiber mass m and density ρm or estimated by using the fiber length l and diameter d i e vm m ρm 0 5πld2 and uz is the settling velocity of the microplastic fiber it should be noted that the force due to the pressure gradient in the fluid i e the last term in eq 2 is neglected herein because one way coupling between the settling microplastic fiber and water is assumed more specifically the settling microplastic fiber is assumed not to influence its ambient fluid field dibenedetto et al 2018 roy et al 2022 with this assumption the fluid velocity u f is zero and thus the force due to the pressure gradient is zero cf eq 2 the projected area of a given microplastic fiber settling with its principal axis parallel to the horizontal plane is calculated as the product of its length and diameter i e a p ld if a microplastic fiber settles at an orientation with an angle θ between its principal axis and the horizontal plane then its projected area is calculated as a p θ a p cos θ thus combining a p θ with eq 4 the drag coefficient can be expressed as follows 5 c d θ 1 cos θ 2 v m a p u z 2 ρ m ρ f 1 g 1 2 ρ m ρ f d u z d t based on eq 5 an orientation dependent drag coefficient c d θ can be obtained by using the settling velocities and orientations measured from the experiments of this study 2 5 experimental program and procedures the lengths of the microplastic fibers tested in this study were varied as 5 mm 10 mm and 15 mm respectively the diameters of these microplastic fibers are 0 45 mm 0 55 mm 0 65 mm and 0 85 mm respectively to ensure repeatability each test was conducted three times for a total of 36 unique tests the details of the test program are provided in table s2 after each experiment the images captured were processed by using the proposed 3d reconstruction method then the kinematics and hydrodynamics of each settling microplastic fiber were interpreted the detailed test procedures are described in section sm7 of the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 settling velocity the temporal change in the settling velocity of a typical microplastic fiber test id l05d45 is shown fig 2 the microplastic fiber initially accelerates i e acceleration stage before reaching a steady velocity i e steady stage despite exhibiting some velocity fluctuations during the steady stage the relative errors re between the maximum i e u z1max u z2max u z3max and minimum i e u z1min u z2min u z3min velocities are smaller than 5 thus the average values of the measured velocities in the steady stage i e u zt1 u zt2 u zt3 can be considered as the steady settling velocities of the microplastic fibers waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 the maximum relative error re max of the steady settling velocities among the three repeated tests is 4 3 which indicates a high degree of repeatability the time history of the settling velocities of all microplastic fibers used in this study is provided in section sm8 of the supplementary material all microplastic fibers tested in this study reach their steady settling velocities after an acceleration stage 3 2 settling trajectory and deposited position fig 3 a shows the reconstructed 3d settling trajectories of three typical microplastic fibers used in this study test ids l05d85 l10d65 and l15d55 it can be observed that the microplastic fibers which were all dropped from the centroid of the releasing platform cf fig s9a do not settle vertically in the column also the microplastic fibers are observed to settle at different orientations in the 3d space the reconstructed 3d settling trajectory of all microplastic fibers tested in this study is provided in section sm9 of the supplementary material the observed non vertical settling trajectories and settling orientations demonstrate the importance ofsecondary motions moreover the final deposited position of the microplastic fibers tested in this study is perhaps one of the most telling indicators of non vertical trajectories mrokowska 2018 the final positions follow a normal distribution around the position at the onset of the settling motion fig 3b findings further demonstrate that microplastic fibers indeed traverse laterally as a result of secondary motions these results are not surprising because microplastic fibers satisfy the criteria for the onset of secondary motions of a settling particle more specifically a settling cylindrical particle with an aspect ratio i e the ratio of length to diameter that is greater than 1 7 may exhibit secondary motions christiansen and barker 1965 mando and rosendahl 2010 as such the microplastic fibers with aspect ratios from 5 to 34 used in this study were observed to exhibit secondary motions as discussed secondary motions are initiated by wakes behind a settling particle jayaweera and mason 1965 reported that wakes appear as the reynolds number becomes larger than 26 for a cylindrical particle the reynolds numbers of microplastic fibers used in this study range from 30 to 88 furthermore the reynolds number of microplastic fibers that are settling in quiescent water can be up to 157 in the experiments reported by khatmullina and isachenko 2017 taken together it can be concluded that microplastic fibers are prone to secondary motions as they settle in water 3 3 settling orientation the temporal evolutions of the settling orientation of all microplastic fibers tested in this study are provided in section sm10 of the supplementary material since all tests exhibit a similar trend only a typical test result i e l05d65 is shown fig 4 it can be found that the orientation of a settling fiber changes during its acceleration and steady stages it is evident that the settling motion of a given microplastic fiber is an orientation dependent process moreover the settling orientations of all microplastic fibers tested in this study appear to show a sinusoidal dependency with time fig s12 as such the relationship between the settling orientation and time can be expressed as follows 6 θ a sin b t c d where a b c and d are constants that represent the amplitude phase phase shift and amplitude shift respectively the sinusoid dependent orientation of a settling slender body e g needle rod and fiber has also been reported by toupoint et al 2019 while we cannot observe a whole sine period for the fibers in this study due to our limited column height it is still possible to deduce that the settling orientation of a microplastic fiber oscillates following a sinusoidal pattern it should be noted that while the settling orientation of all microplastic fibers tested in this study exhibits a similar sinusoidal trend the sinusoid dependent orientations of each microplastic fiber has different constants eq 6 this is not surprising because the microplastic fibers used in different tests exhibit different settling velocities and thus they have different total settling times therefore to quantify the temporal variation of the settling orientation a characteristic time scale is required to enable a comparison of the settling times of the microplastic fibers used in different tests more specifically the instantaneous settling time e g settling time shown in figs 2 and 4 from different tests needs to be normalized the dimensionless settling time t which is calculated as the ratio of the instantaneous settling time t to the total settling time t i e t t t is used as a characteristic time scale for all of the tested microplastic fibers therefore as shown in fig 5 the expression of the sinusoid dependent orientations for all tested microplastic fibers in this study can be obtained by using non linear regression 7 θ 3 8 s i n 4 5 t 2 2 7 4 while eq 7 can be used to predict the temporal variation of the settling orientation of a given microplastic fiber the dimensionless settling time t t t in eq 7 must be known a priori however the total settling time t which is used to calculate t cannot be obtained before conducting a test therefore for time resolved modeling of microplastic transport e g eq 1 it is not trivial to directly incorporate the predicted settling orientation eq 7 into the governing equations to enhance the scalability of the prediction model of the settling orientation eq 7 the total settling time t should be obtainable based on measurable parameters e g microplastic fiber dimension density volume etc waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 reported that the settling velocities of microplastics are linearly dependent on the dimensionless fiber diameter d l d 2 ρ m ρ f 1 g ϑ 2 3 where ϑ is the viscosity of the fluid similarly a linearly dependent relationship between the average settling velocities and dimensionless fiber diameters is observed in this study fig 6 a moreover the settling distances of all tested microplastic fibers is constant fig 3a thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that the total settling time of each microplastic fiber which is the ratio of settling distance to the average settling velocity is also dependent on the dimensionless fiber diameter fig 6b shows the relationship between the total settling time and dimensionless fiber diameter it can be observed that the total settling times exhibit a linearly dependent relationship with the dimensionless fiber diameter 8 t 0 11 d 11 01 by combining eq 7 with eq 8 the prediction model of the settling orientations of a microplastic fiber can be recasted as 9 θ 3 8 sin 4 5 0 22 d 11 01 t 2 2 7 4 the dimensionless fiber diameter d l d 2 ρ m ρ f 1 g ϑ 2 3 can be determined a priori since both the fiber i e l d ρ m and fluid i e ρ f ϑ properties are measurable as such the settling orientation of a microplastic fiber can be estimated by using eq 9 at each time step for time resolved modeling based on the lagrangian particle tracking method e g eq 1 to evaluate the developed model for predictions of the settling orientation of a given microplastic fiber eq 9 the calculated settling orientation θ cal is compared with that measured θ mea in fig 7 the average error ae which is calculated by using eq 10 can be used to statistically evaluate the performance of the proposed model eq 9 10 a e 1 n i 1 n r e i 100 1 n i 1 n θ cal i θ mea i 1 100 it can be found that the proposed model eq 9 reasonably predicts the instantaneous settling orientation with average errors that range from 7 to 53 also it can be observed that the magnitudes of the settling orientations are from 3 to 15 with an average of about 6 these orientations are not surprising because the extent of secondary motions i e the magnitude of the settling orientation is positively correlated to the extent of wake instability behind a settling microplastic fiber jayaweera and mason 1965 reported that a wake behind a settling cylinder appears when the reynolds number is larger than 26 and the extent of wake shedding increases with the reynolds number the reynolds numbers of all the microplastic fibers used in this study are from 30 to 88 thus the magnitude of the settling orientations starts from 3 and covers a relatively small range i e 3 15 toupoint et al 2019 observed the settling orientation of about 7 for a cylinder with an aspect ratio l d of 12 settling in quiescent water which agrees with the range of the settling orientations 3 15 and aspect ratios 5 34 of the microplastic fibers used in this study 3 4 drag coefficient the temporal evolution of the drag coefficients of all microplastic fibers tested in this study are provided in section sm11 of the supplementary material it can be found that throughout the entire settling process i e both acceleration and steady stages the drag coefficient is strongly influenced by the time varying orientation of a microplastic fiber more specifically there is a positive correlation between the drag coefficient and settling orientation this further demonstrates the impact of secondary motions on the hydrodynamics of a settling microplastic fiber fig 8 compares the drag coefficients calculated by using existing models c d cal with the ones measured in this study c d mea it should be noted that the drag coefficients shown herein are time average ones from each experiment also the average errors which are calculated by substituting the settling orientations in eq 10 with the drag coefficients are shown to statistically evaluate the performance of existing drag models moreover all models evaluated herein were proposed for the characterization of the settling motion of a single particle in quiescent water it can be observed that the drag models proposed by holzer and sommerfeld 2008 song et al 2017 and zhang and choi 2022 show relatively low average errors i e ae 33 34 and 36 respectively for the predictions of the orientation dependent drag coefficients of microplastic fibers these results are not surprising because the models proposed by holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 adopt crosswise sphericity which is an orientation dependent shape factor to characterize the influences of settling orientations on drag coefficients in contrast the model proposed by zhang and choi 2022 adopts the aschenbrenner shape factor to characterize the unique shape of microplastic fibers the prediction errors of the models proposed by holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 mainly stem from the use of less suitable shape factors to describe the morphology of fibers i e the sphericity and crosswise sphericity the prediction error of the model proposed by zhang and choi 2022 mainly stems from neglecting the orientation dependency of the settling process of microplastic fibers because the aschenbrenner shape factor is independent of the settling orientation however the drag models proposed by khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 and dioguardi et al 2018 exhibit relatively large average errors i e ae 55 62 and 104 respectively the large errors are because the three models do not consider the effects of settling orientations on the drag coefficients moreover khatmullina and isachenko 2017 did not use a shape factor to account for the morphology of microplastic fibers and waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 and dioguardi et al 2018 used the unsuitable shape factors i e the corey shape factor and sphericity for characterizing the morphology of microplastic fibers zhang and choi 2022 taken together to improve the predictions of the orientation dependent drag coefficients of microplastic fibers both the crosswise sphericity and aschenbrenner shape factor need to be considered this is because the crosswise sphericity can account for the settling orientation holzer and sommerfeld 2008 song et al 2017 while the aschenbrenner shape factor can characterize the unique morphology of microplastic fibers zhang and choi 2022 3 5 new orientation dependent drag model to develop and evaluate a new drag model the data sets which include information on the drag coefficient settling velocity settling orientation and physical properties e g dimension density mass of the microplastic fibers are required under circumstances where data is limited researchers in the fields of geological sciences dioguardi et al 2018 and industrial processing song et al 2017 have resorted to using the same data set to develop and evaluate their proposed models in fact even well established drag models in the literature for microplastic fibers were developed and evaluated in the same manner khatmullina and isachenko 2017 however such an approach may not be ideal and subject to probity due to the lack of data on the settling orientation of microplastic fibers in the literature and the need to address the shortcomings of using the same data set for model development and evaluation we adopt a test training split method singh et al 2021 more specifically we adopt a 50 50 split ratio this means that 50 of the experimental data set produced in this study i e l05d45 l05d55 l10d55 l10d65 l15d65 and l15d85 is used to develop the new model and the unused 50 of the data set i e l05d65 l05d85 l10d45 l10d85 l15d45 and l15d55 is used to evaluate the model based on the 50 of the data set from the experiments conducted in this study the crosswise sphericity is incorporated into the drag model proposed by zhang and choi 2022 using nonlinear regression consequently the new orientation dependent model is expressed as follows 11 c d 41 28 a s f 0 49 s c 0 82 r e 0 7 where asf is the aschenbrenner shape factor asf l d and sc is the crosswise sphericity s c 6 π v m 4 d l cos θ note that the microplastic fibers are herein assumed to be straight and non deformable cylinders with circular cross sections khatmullina and isachenko 2017 the reynolds number re adopted is the same expression as the one used by zhang and choi 2022 i e r e u z 4 l d π ϑ 2 based on the unused 50 data set produced in this study fig 9 shows a comparison of the performance between the measured drag coefficients and the ones calculated using the proposed model eq 11 it can be observed that eq 11 can predict the orientation dependent drag coefficients of microplastic fibers with relatively low average errors i e ae 10 3 although the prediction errors for the microplastic fibers range from 1 5 l15d45 to 21 3 l10d85 the maximum prediction error ae 21 3 is still lower than the ones predicted using existing drag models i e ae from 33 to 104 shown in fig 8 the predictions errors of l10d85 i e ae 21 3 and l05d85 i e ae 19 6 may be attributed to the method of preparation of the microplastic fibers adopted in this study the microplastic fibers were cut from strands of polyester ropes so that the incised ends of some microplastic fibers are non circular in cross section cf the microscope images of l05d85 and l10d85 shown in fig s1 however the cylinder with circular cross section is a required assumption for calculations of the aschenbrenner shape factor and crosswise sphericity thus the microplastic fibers with non circular ends exhibit slightly larger prediction errors i e ae 21 3 for l10d85 and ae 19 6 for l05d85 compared with other fibers with more circular ends i e ae 15 0 for l05d65 l10d45 l15d45 and l15d55 4 discussions 4 1 applicability of experimental results the diameters of the microplastic fibers used in the experiments of this study i e 0 45 mm 0 85 mm are commonly used in similar settling experiments khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 however it is acknowledged that they may be larger than the ones detected in laundry effluent which have diameters that are in the order of tens of μm hernandez et al 2017 napper and thompson 2016 notwithstanding microplastic fibers can be released from a multitude of other sources besides laundry effluent these other sources produce fibers that are larger than those from laundry effluent for instance fishery activities are a significant source of microplastic fibers xue et al 2020 and can generate fibers larger than 2 mm in diameter chen et al 2018 tan et al 2020 which is larger than the fibers detected in laundry effluent wang et al 2019 as such the large microplastic fibers 0 45 mm 0 85 mm used in the experiments of this study also have relevance to those detected in natural aquatic environments the orientation dependent drag model eq 11 was developed by using microplastic fibers with diameters ranging from 0 45 mm to 0 85 mm therefore the applicability of eq 11 for modelling the secondary motions of fibers with smaller diameters needs to be evaluated fig 10 shows the relationship between the maximum settling orientation of the microplastic fibers tested in this study and their corresponding froude numbers i e f r ρ m ρ w d l which is a key parameter for the characterization of secondary motions chow and adams 2011 the maximum settling orientation θmax can be used as a parameter to describe the extent of secondary motions will et al 2021 it can be observed that there is an approximately linear relationship between the maximum settling orientation and froude number 12 θ m a x 25 1 f r 1 7 because the densities of water ρw and microplastic fibers ρm are constant variables the froude numbers of the settling microplastic fibers are dependent on their size i e described using d and l consequently the extent of secondary motions experienced is mainly dependent on the fiber size fig 11 shows the estimated maximum settling orientations for microplastic fibers with different sizes i e described using the aspect ratio l d and densities using eq 12 a negative correlation between the maximum settling orientation and the aspect ratio can be observed also it can be seen that although the diameter of some microplastic fibers detected in the field e g wwtp and laundry effluent is in the order of tens μm i e smaller than the ones used in this study the fibers in the field exhibit larger aspect ratios i e 46 655 than the ones used in this study i e 5 34 as such the maximum settling orientation detected in the field is smaller e g less than 6 for microplastic fibers detected from wwtp and less than 4 for microplastic fibers detected from laundry effluent than the ones observed in this study i e less than 15 this indicates that the secondary motions of microplastic fibers detected in the wwtp edo et al 2020 and laundry effluent napper and thomson 2016 are weaker than the ones used in this study the weaker secondary motions of microplastic fibers detected in wwtp and laundry effluent and the fibers used in this study re ranging from 30 to 88 belong to the laminar wake regime i e re 160 as proposed by bai and alam 2018 furthermore bai and alam 2018 demonstrated that the drag coefficients cd for all cylinders settling in the laminar wake regime exponentially decrease with an increase of re which is in agreement with the proposed drag model i e c d r e 0 7 in eq 11 evidently the proposed model eq 11 can be used to characterize the secondary motions of microplastic fibers with aspect ratios larger than five the microplastic fibers detected in the food chain jemec et al 2016 generally exhibit aspect ratios of less than four which is smaller than the ones used in this study i e 5 34 consequently the maximum settling orientation of the microplastic fibers detected in the food chain is larger i e 15 37 than the ones observed in this study i e less than 15 since there is a positive correlation between the maximum settling orientation and the extent of secondary motions will et al 2021 the microplastic fibers with aspect ratios of less than four will exhibit stronger secondary motions than the ones used in this study as a result the stronger secondary motions of fibers detected in the food chain may belong to the nonlaminar wake regime bai and alam 2018 where cd increases with re evidently the proposed model eq 11 which was developed based on a laminar wake regime i e cd decreases with re may be less suitable for the characterizations of secondary motions of microplastic fibers with aspect ratios of less than four consequently more data sets on the settling orientations of microplastic fibers that cover a broader range of aspect ratios will help to improve the proposed drag model eq 11 from an experimental perspective there are two additional reasons why microplastic fibers with larger diameters i e 0 45 mm 0 85 mm are favorable first conventional image acquisition systems i e the camera and image processing algorithm have limited capacity to detect microplastic fibers with diameters in the order of tens of μm second existing methods for preparing microplastic fibers such as cutting or cryogenically grinding synthetic threads cannot be used to prepare microplastic fibers that are less than 0 5 mm in size mossotti et al 2021 another idealization made in this study is the use of relatively stiff microplastic fibers in the field microplastic fibers may be flexible and can bend as they settle bagaev et al 2017 thus the proposed drag model eq 11 may be less suitable for the characterizations of the settling motions of flexible microplastic fibers the relatively stiff microplastic fibers used in this study only exhibit a slight curvature during the settling process cf figs s1 and s7b as such the microplastic fibers used in this study can be assumed to be straight and non deformable cylinders which is the common assumption for describing the microplastic fibers from fishing lines khatmullina and isachenko 2017 and idea for using the modified maxey riley equation i e eqs 1 and 2 which was developed for rigid particles evidently further investigation on the transport of flexible microplastic fibers is warranted 4 2 implications for the transport of microplastic fibers in natural aquatic environments this study is on the transport of microplastic fibers in quiescent water based on the modified maxey riley equation eq 2 the proposed drag model eq 11 can be used for making predictions of the transport of microplastic fibers in enclosed and semi enclosed aquatic bodies e g bay water this is because enclosed and semi enclosed aquatic bodies may be idealized as quiescent water conditions zazouli et al 2022 with inactive water exchange and wave conditions chen et al 2018 however non quiescent water conditions with waves and currents e g rivers and oceans are more common aquatic environments bagaev et al 2017 in fact microplastic fibers will settle under much higher reynolds numbers in non quiescent water conditions compared with the reynold numbers in quiescent water conditions higher reynolds numbers mean that secondary motions are more significant due to the enhanced wake instabilities produced behind the settling particles mando and rosendahl 2010 thus the drag model eq 11 which was proposed based on quiescent water conditions is less suitable for non quiescent water conditions furthermore fibers settling at higher reynolds numbers are prone to longer transport distances in the horizontal direction i e more significant lateral motions this is caused by the enhanced turbulence generated by waves kerpen et al 2020 or and currents pohl et al 2020 however the effects of turbulence on secondary motions are not considered in the proposed drag model eq 11 nor the modified maxey riley equation eq 2 further investigation of the effects of turbulence and extended applications of the proposed drag model for more natural aquatic environments is warranted 5 conclusions the effects of secondary motions on the settling behavior of microplastic fibers were experimentally investigated due to the presence of secondary motions the settling motion of microplastic fibers is an orientation dependent process that follows a sinusoidal pattern which governs the drag coefficient of a settling microplastic fiber a new drag model is proposed to describe the effects of secondary motions on drag coefficients the proposed drag model has been demonstrated to more accurately predict the drag coefficients of microplastic fibers compared to existing models that do not consider secondary motions combined with the modified maxey riley equation the proposed drag model can be used in future modeling to improve the prediction of microplastic fiber transport as the first step towards the realistic predictions of the transport of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments only stiff microplastic fibers in quiescent water conditions were investigated in this study however to further improve the predictions of the transport of a wider range of microplastic fiber types research is required to study the secondary motions

15972,microplastics fibers are abundant in aquatic environments and are an emerging environmental threat understanding how fibers are transported in aquatic environments is essential for identifying pollution hotspots and developing remediation strategies over recent years an increasing number of drag models have been proposed to describe the transport of microplastics in aquatic environments however none of the proposed models consider secondary motions which are responsible for non vertical settling motions to investigate the role of secondary motions an experimental setup with an image processing technique was developed to capture the spatial temporal kinematics of microplastic fibers settling in quiescent water a new drag model which adopts the crosswise sphericity to consider the effects of secondary motions of a microplastic fiber and the aschenbrenner shape factor to account for the unique morphology of the microplastic fiber was proposed and evaluated secondary motions of microplastic fibers have profound effects on their settling trajectories and deposited positions the settling motion and drag coefficient of a microplastic fiber is an orientation dependent process moreover the secondary motion is strongly dependent on the fiber dimension and density the here proposed drag model is proven to more accurately characterize the settling motion of microplastic fibers compared to existing models that neglect secondary motions the methodology and model from this study can be used to progress towards improved and realistic predictions of the transport of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic fiber transport aquatic environments secondary motions settling orientation orientation dependent drag model 1 introduction microplastic pollution has emerged as a pressing environmental concern blettler et al 2018 in particular aquatic environments are a major sink for microplastic pollution zhao et al 2019 among the microplastics detected in aquatic environments fibers which are generally released from laundry effluent napper and thompson 2016 and fishing gear xue et al 2020 are commonly reported chen et al 2021 more importantly microplastic fibers have been traced in the food chain bessa et al 2018 which may pose a threat to human health senathirajah et al 2021 evidently the identification of pollution hotspots and remediation strategies are urgently needed to tackle this problem the improved prediction of the transport of microplastic fibers is a prerequisite zobkov et al 2019 this is because transport governs the concentration depth profile cowger et al 2021 and residence time khatmullina and isachenko 2017 of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments generally the transport of microplastics in aquatic environments can be modeled using the modified maxey riley equation dibenedetto et al 2018 roy et al 2022 which is expressed as follows yin et al 2003 1 m m d u m d t f g f b f d f l f v f p where mm is the microplastic mass um is the microplastic velocity t is the motion time of the microplastic and d dt is the time derivative following the moving microplastic the terms on the right side of eq 1 represent the forces due to gravity fg buoyancy fb drag fd lift fl virtual mass fv and pressure gradient in the fluid fp respectively in industrial processing the basset history force and faxén terms are generally neglected where particles are considered to be large for example yin et al 2003 and carranza and zhang 2017 ignored these two terms for particles with lengths of 50 mm and 20 2 mm respectively as such the basset history force and faxén terms are generally neglected for microplastic particles dibenedetto et al 2018 roy et al 2022 eq 1 can be expanded to show each force as follows yin et al 2003 m m d u m d t m m g m m ρ f ρ m g 1 2 c d ρ f a p u p u f 2 1 2 c l ρ f a p u p u f 2 2 1 2 m m ρ f ρ m d d t u p u f ρ f m m ρ m d u f d t where ρ m and ρ f are the particle and fluid densities respectively g is the gravitational acceleration uf is the fluid velocity c d and c l are the drag and lift coefficients respectively ap is the projected area of the particle normal to the settling direction and d dt is the time derivative of the fluid element when using eq 2 to model the transport of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments the physical properties of the microplastic fiber and fluid i e m p ρ p ρ f and ap can be measured and the kinematics of the microplastic fiber and fluid i e up and uf are obtained by using the time derivative of the displacement at each time step for a cylindrical particle e g microplastic fiber mando and rosendahl 2010 reported that its drag coefficient governs its settling motion and its lift coefficient governs its lateral motion the lift coefficient of a cylindrical particle can be estimated using its drag coefficient and settling orientation yin et al 2003 zastawny et al 2012 as follows 3 c l c d c o s 2 θ s i n θ where θ is the settling orientation which is defined as the angle between the principal axis of the particle and the horizontal plane evidently appropriate drag coefficients are central to obtaining reasonable predictions of both the settling and lateral motions of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments while a multitude of drag models have been proposed for the prediction of the drag coefficients of microplastic fibers settling in water khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 zhang and choi 2022 existing models do not take into account the effects of the secondary motions on the drag coefficients in fact it has been demonstrated in other disciplines that secondary motions strongly influence the drag coefficient chow and adams 2011 will et al 2021 this is because secondary motions which are the oscillatory behaviors of a particle as it settles in quiescent water are generally initiated by shedding wake vortices bagheri and bonadonna 2016 with secondary motions the pressure acting along the surface of the particle is redistributed chow and adams 2011 which causes an additional lift force to change the settling orientation zastawny et al 2012 both the lift force and settling orientation induced by secondary motions can affect the drag coefficient and thus the transport of microplastic fibers cf eq 3 to characterize the effects of secondary motions on the drag coefficient holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 adopted the crosswise sphericity i e the ratio of the projected area of the volume equivalent sphere of the particle to the projected area of the particle normal to the settling direction in their drag models however the applicability of the models proposed by holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 for predictions of the drag coefficients of microplastic fibers remains questionable this is because holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 proposed their drag models for non microplastic particles in industrial processing e g aluminum and steel particles and adopted sphericity i e the ratio of the surface area of the volume equivalent sphere of the particle to the surface area of the particle normal to the settling direction as a second shape factor which has been demonstrated to have limitations for describing the morphology of microplastic fibers zhang and choi 2022 thus a drag model that can characterize the secondary motions of microplastic fibers is required to improve predictions of their transport in aquatic environments the aforementioned drag models in the literature for microplastic fibers and non microplastic particles are summarized in table s1 of the supplementary material this study aims to reveal and characterize the effects of the secondary motions of microplastic fibers on their transport to achieve this an experimental setup is developed along with a novel image processing technique to capture the secondary motions of the settling microplastic fibers a new drag model is developed to consider the effects of secondary motions the experimental data is then used to evaluate the newly developed drag model 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastic fibers the microplastic fibers used in this study were cut from strands of polyester ropes the titration method section sm2 of the supplementary material was used to measure the density of the microplastic fibers ρ m 1308 kg m3 the length and diameter of each microplastic fiber were measured based on images captured by the digital microscope section sm3 of the supplementary material the microplastic fiber lengths range from 5 to 15 mm and the fiber diameters range from 0 45 to 0 85 mm which are dimensions that are commonly used in similar settling experiments waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup consists of a water column image acquisition system and illumination system fig 1 a the settling motion of a given microplastic fiber in the water column is tracked by using a camera that captures videos with images at a pixel resolution of 1920 1080 and a frame rate of 50 frames per second a mirror was placed at the side of the column to enable the reflection of the motion of a given microplastic fiber from the side of the column by adjusting the position of the camera the camera can be used to simultaneously capture the motion of a given microplastic fiber from both its front and reflected side view in the mirror fig 1b shows a pair of images captured from two different views a given microplastic fiber will have the same vertical coordinate i e y and y coordinates in fig 1b in the front and reflected side views which can later be used as a frame of reference to reconstruct its 3d setting motion the advantage of this setup is that it enables images from two different views i e front and reflected side to be captured without the need for multiple cameras cf will et al 2021 to ensure high quality images an illumination system is required the system consists of led lamps with diffusers the experimental setup was placed inside a darkroom to avoid the influence of external lighting a white backdrop was positioned behind the column to maximize the color contrast between a given fiber and its background 2 3 3d reconstruction of microplastic fiber kinematics obtaining the kinematics of a microplastic fiber e g settling velocity and settling orientation is a prerequisite for capturing its secondary motion generally the settling velocity of a microplastic fiber can be determined by using either the particle tracking velocimetry ptv technique nguyen et al 2020 or particle image velocimetry piv technique waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 both ptv and piv can be used to track the velocity of an object by dividing the displacement between two successive frames by the time interval qureshi et al 2020 the main difference between ptv and piv lies in how the particle displacement is obtained more specifically ptv tracks the motion of an individual particle whereas piv tracks the image texture to acquire the particle displacement gollin et al 2017 however both ptv and piv techniques regard a given microplastic fiber as a point mass and thus cannot be used to determine its settling orientation which needs to be calculated by using the 3d coordinates of its endpoints carranza and zhang 2017 to address this problem an image processing method was developed to identify the endpoints of a settling microplastic fiber in real time details of the image processing method are provided in section sm4 of the supplementary material herein we only briefly introduce the development of the image processing method and how it reconstructs the 3d kinematics of a microplastic fiber settling in water since only a single camera is used to synchronously capture the two planes of interest the captured microplastic fiber contours will inevitably be distorted wu et al 2019 to address this problem the perspective transformation algorithm is adopted after which each corrected image is converted into binary using the background subtraction technique piccardi 2004 after binarization a given microplastic fiber contour on each image appears as a white area against a black background the endpoints of a given microplastic fiber from each pair of binarized images can then be identified using the moore neighbor tracing algorithm embedded in matlab the last step is to reconstruct the settling motion of a given microplastic fiber in three dimensions based on the 2d coordinates of its endpoints since the pair of images share the same vertical edge fig 1b the 3d coordinate of each endpoint can be found by comparing the vertical coordinates of a pair of images i e y and y coordinates in fig 1b subsequently an iterative procedure can be used to process each pair of images to record the time history of the 3d coordinates of each endpoint of a given microplastic fiber with the time varying 3d coordinates the spatial temporal kinematics of a given microplastic fiber that is settling including its position velocity and orientation in the 3d space can be obtained section sm5 of the supplementary material to evaluate the reliability of the proposed image processing method we compare reconstructed settling orientations and velocities against the ones measured from the experiments the evaluation details are provided in section sm6 of the supplementary material the evaluation results show that the proposed image processing method can successfully track the 3d motions of a given settling microplastic fiber 2 4 characterization of settling hydrodynamics of microplastic fibers based on eqs 1 and 2 the settling motion of a microplastic fiber in quiescent water can be expressed as follows 4 ρ m v m d u z d t ρ m v m g ρ f v m g 1 2 c d ρ f a p u z 2 1 2 ρ f v m d u z d t where vm is the microplastic fiber volume that is determined based on the fiber mass m and density ρm or estimated by using the fiber length l and diameter d i e vm m ρm 0 5πld2 and uz is the settling velocity of the microplastic fiber it should be noted that the force due to the pressure gradient in the fluid i e the last term in eq 2 is neglected herein because one way coupling between the settling microplastic fiber and water is assumed more specifically the settling microplastic fiber is assumed not to influence its ambient fluid field dibenedetto et al 2018 roy et al 2022 with this assumption the fluid velocity u f is zero and thus the force due to the pressure gradient is zero cf eq 2 the projected area of a given microplastic fiber settling with its principal axis parallel to the horizontal plane is calculated as the product of its length and diameter i e a p ld if a microplastic fiber settles at an orientation with an angle θ between its principal axis and the horizontal plane then its projected area is calculated as a p θ a p cos θ thus combining a p θ with eq 4 the drag coefficient can be expressed as follows 5 c d θ 1 cos θ 2 v m a p u z 2 ρ m ρ f 1 g 1 2 ρ m ρ f d u z d t based on eq 5 an orientation dependent drag coefficient c d θ can be obtained by using the settling velocities and orientations measured from the experiments of this study 2 5 experimental program and procedures the lengths of the microplastic fibers tested in this study were varied as 5 mm 10 mm and 15 mm respectively the diameters of these microplastic fibers are 0 45 mm 0 55 mm 0 65 mm and 0 85 mm respectively to ensure repeatability each test was conducted three times for a total of 36 unique tests the details of the test program are provided in table s2 after each experiment the images captured were processed by using the proposed 3d reconstruction method then the kinematics and hydrodynamics of each settling microplastic fiber were interpreted the detailed test procedures are described in section sm7 of the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 settling velocity the temporal change in the settling velocity of a typical microplastic fiber test id l05d45 is shown fig 2 the microplastic fiber initially accelerates i e acceleration stage before reaching a steady velocity i e steady stage despite exhibiting some velocity fluctuations during the steady stage the relative errors re between the maximum i e u z1max u z2max u z3max and minimum i e u z1min u z2min u z3min velocities are smaller than 5 thus the average values of the measured velocities in the steady stage i e u zt1 u zt2 u zt3 can be considered as the steady settling velocities of the microplastic fibers waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 the maximum relative error re max of the steady settling velocities among the three repeated tests is 4 3 which indicates a high degree of repeatability the time history of the settling velocities of all microplastic fibers used in this study is provided in section sm8 of the supplementary material all microplastic fibers tested in this study reach their steady settling velocities after an acceleration stage 3 2 settling trajectory and deposited position fig 3 a shows the reconstructed 3d settling trajectories of three typical microplastic fibers used in this study test ids l05d85 l10d65 and l15d55 it can be observed that the microplastic fibers which were all dropped from the centroid of the releasing platform cf fig s9a do not settle vertically in the column also the microplastic fibers are observed to settle at different orientations in the 3d space the reconstructed 3d settling trajectory of all microplastic fibers tested in this study is provided in section sm9 of the supplementary material the observed non vertical settling trajectories and settling orientations demonstrate the importance ofsecondary motions moreover the final deposited position of the microplastic fibers tested in this study is perhaps one of the most telling indicators of non vertical trajectories mrokowska 2018 the final positions follow a normal distribution around the position at the onset of the settling motion fig 3b findings further demonstrate that microplastic fibers indeed traverse laterally as a result of secondary motions these results are not surprising because microplastic fibers satisfy the criteria for the onset of secondary motions of a settling particle more specifically a settling cylindrical particle with an aspect ratio i e the ratio of length to diameter that is greater than 1 7 may exhibit secondary motions christiansen and barker 1965 mando and rosendahl 2010 as such the microplastic fibers with aspect ratios from 5 to 34 used in this study were observed to exhibit secondary motions as discussed secondary motions are initiated by wakes behind a settling particle jayaweera and mason 1965 reported that wakes appear as the reynolds number becomes larger than 26 for a cylindrical particle the reynolds numbers of microplastic fibers used in this study range from 30 to 88 furthermore the reynolds number of microplastic fibers that are settling in quiescent water can be up to 157 in the experiments reported by khatmullina and isachenko 2017 taken together it can be concluded that microplastic fibers are prone to secondary motions as they settle in water 3 3 settling orientation the temporal evolutions of the settling orientation of all microplastic fibers tested in this study are provided in section sm10 of the supplementary material since all tests exhibit a similar trend only a typical test result i e l05d65 is shown fig 4 it can be found that the orientation of a settling fiber changes during its acceleration and steady stages it is evident that the settling motion of a given microplastic fiber is an orientation dependent process moreover the settling orientations of all microplastic fibers tested in this study appear to show a sinusoidal dependency with time fig s12 as such the relationship between the settling orientation and time can be expressed as follows 6 θ a sin b t c d where a b c and d are constants that represent the amplitude phase phase shift and amplitude shift respectively the sinusoid dependent orientation of a settling slender body e g needle rod and fiber has also been reported by toupoint et al 2019 while we cannot observe a whole sine period for the fibers in this study due to our limited column height it is still possible to deduce that the settling orientation of a microplastic fiber oscillates following a sinusoidal pattern it should be noted that while the settling orientation of all microplastic fibers tested in this study exhibits a similar sinusoidal trend the sinusoid dependent orientations of each microplastic fiber has different constants eq 6 this is not surprising because the microplastic fibers used in different tests exhibit different settling velocities and thus they have different total settling times therefore to quantify the temporal variation of the settling orientation a characteristic time scale is required to enable a comparison of the settling times of the microplastic fibers used in different tests more specifically the instantaneous settling time e g settling time shown in figs 2 and 4 from different tests needs to be normalized the dimensionless settling time t which is calculated as the ratio of the instantaneous settling time t to the total settling time t i e t t t is used as a characteristic time scale for all of the tested microplastic fibers therefore as shown in fig 5 the expression of the sinusoid dependent orientations for all tested microplastic fibers in this study can be obtained by using non linear regression 7 θ 3 8 s i n 4 5 t 2 2 7 4 while eq 7 can be used to predict the temporal variation of the settling orientation of a given microplastic fiber the dimensionless settling time t t t in eq 7 must be known a priori however the total settling time t which is used to calculate t cannot be obtained before conducting a test therefore for time resolved modeling of microplastic transport e g eq 1 it is not trivial to directly incorporate the predicted settling orientation eq 7 into the governing equations to enhance the scalability of the prediction model of the settling orientation eq 7 the total settling time t should be obtainable based on measurable parameters e g microplastic fiber dimension density volume etc waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 reported that the settling velocities of microplastics are linearly dependent on the dimensionless fiber diameter d l d 2 ρ m ρ f 1 g ϑ 2 3 where ϑ is the viscosity of the fluid similarly a linearly dependent relationship between the average settling velocities and dimensionless fiber diameters is observed in this study fig 6 a moreover the settling distances of all tested microplastic fibers is constant fig 3a thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that the total settling time of each microplastic fiber which is the ratio of settling distance to the average settling velocity is also dependent on the dimensionless fiber diameter fig 6b shows the relationship between the total settling time and dimensionless fiber diameter it can be observed that the total settling times exhibit a linearly dependent relationship with the dimensionless fiber diameter 8 t 0 11 d 11 01 by combining eq 7 with eq 8 the prediction model of the settling orientations of a microplastic fiber can be recasted as 9 θ 3 8 sin 4 5 0 22 d 11 01 t 2 2 7 4 the dimensionless fiber diameter d l d 2 ρ m ρ f 1 g ϑ 2 3 can be determined a priori since both the fiber i e l d ρ m and fluid i e ρ f ϑ properties are measurable as such the settling orientation of a microplastic fiber can be estimated by using eq 9 at each time step for time resolved modeling based on the lagrangian particle tracking method e g eq 1 to evaluate the developed model for predictions of the settling orientation of a given microplastic fiber eq 9 the calculated settling orientation θ cal is compared with that measured θ mea in fig 7 the average error ae which is calculated by using eq 10 can be used to statistically evaluate the performance of the proposed model eq 9 10 a e 1 n i 1 n r e i 100 1 n i 1 n θ cal i θ mea i 1 100 it can be found that the proposed model eq 9 reasonably predicts the instantaneous settling orientation with average errors that range from 7 to 53 also it can be observed that the magnitudes of the settling orientations are from 3 to 15 with an average of about 6 these orientations are not surprising because the extent of secondary motions i e the magnitude of the settling orientation is positively correlated to the extent of wake instability behind a settling microplastic fiber jayaweera and mason 1965 reported that a wake behind a settling cylinder appears when the reynolds number is larger than 26 and the extent of wake shedding increases with the reynolds number the reynolds numbers of all the microplastic fibers used in this study are from 30 to 88 thus the magnitude of the settling orientations starts from 3 and covers a relatively small range i e 3 15 toupoint et al 2019 observed the settling orientation of about 7 for a cylinder with an aspect ratio l d of 12 settling in quiescent water which agrees with the range of the settling orientations 3 15 and aspect ratios 5 34 of the microplastic fibers used in this study 3 4 drag coefficient the temporal evolution of the drag coefficients of all microplastic fibers tested in this study are provided in section sm11 of the supplementary material it can be found that throughout the entire settling process i e both acceleration and steady stages the drag coefficient is strongly influenced by the time varying orientation of a microplastic fiber more specifically there is a positive correlation between the drag coefficient and settling orientation this further demonstrates the impact of secondary motions on the hydrodynamics of a settling microplastic fiber fig 8 compares the drag coefficients calculated by using existing models c d cal with the ones measured in this study c d mea it should be noted that the drag coefficients shown herein are time average ones from each experiment also the average errors which are calculated by substituting the settling orientations in eq 10 with the drag coefficients are shown to statistically evaluate the performance of existing drag models moreover all models evaluated herein were proposed for the characterization of the settling motion of a single particle in quiescent water it can be observed that the drag models proposed by holzer and sommerfeld 2008 song et al 2017 and zhang and choi 2022 show relatively low average errors i e ae 33 34 and 36 respectively for the predictions of the orientation dependent drag coefficients of microplastic fibers these results are not surprising because the models proposed by holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 adopt crosswise sphericity which is an orientation dependent shape factor to characterize the influences of settling orientations on drag coefficients in contrast the model proposed by zhang and choi 2022 adopts the aschenbrenner shape factor to characterize the unique shape of microplastic fibers the prediction errors of the models proposed by holzer and sommerfeld 2008 and song et al 2017 mainly stem from the use of less suitable shape factors to describe the morphology of fibers i e the sphericity and crosswise sphericity the prediction error of the model proposed by zhang and choi 2022 mainly stems from neglecting the orientation dependency of the settling process of microplastic fibers because the aschenbrenner shape factor is independent of the settling orientation however the drag models proposed by khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 and dioguardi et al 2018 exhibit relatively large average errors i e ae 55 62 and 104 respectively the large errors are because the three models do not consider the effects of settling orientations on the drag coefficients moreover khatmullina and isachenko 2017 did not use a shape factor to account for the morphology of microplastic fibers and waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 and dioguardi et al 2018 used the unsuitable shape factors i e the corey shape factor and sphericity for characterizing the morphology of microplastic fibers zhang and choi 2022 taken together to improve the predictions of the orientation dependent drag coefficients of microplastic fibers both the crosswise sphericity and aschenbrenner shape factor need to be considered this is because the crosswise sphericity can account for the settling orientation holzer and sommerfeld 2008 song et al 2017 while the aschenbrenner shape factor can characterize the unique morphology of microplastic fibers zhang and choi 2022 3 5 new orientation dependent drag model to develop and evaluate a new drag model the data sets which include information on the drag coefficient settling velocity settling orientation and physical properties e g dimension density mass of the microplastic fibers are required under circumstances where data is limited researchers in the fields of geological sciences dioguardi et al 2018 and industrial processing song et al 2017 have resorted to using the same data set to develop and evaluate their proposed models in fact even well established drag models in the literature for microplastic fibers were developed and evaluated in the same manner khatmullina and isachenko 2017 however such an approach may not be ideal and subject to probity due to the lack of data on the settling orientation of microplastic fibers in the literature and the need to address the shortcomings of using the same data set for model development and evaluation we adopt a test training split method singh et al 2021 more specifically we adopt a 50 50 split ratio this means that 50 of the experimental data set produced in this study i e l05d45 l05d55 l10d55 l10d65 l15d65 and l15d85 is used to develop the new model and the unused 50 of the data set i e l05d65 l05d85 l10d45 l10d85 l15d45 and l15d55 is used to evaluate the model based on the 50 of the data set from the experiments conducted in this study the crosswise sphericity is incorporated into the drag model proposed by zhang and choi 2022 using nonlinear regression consequently the new orientation dependent model is expressed as follows 11 c d 41 28 a s f 0 49 s c 0 82 r e 0 7 where asf is the aschenbrenner shape factor asf l d and sc is the crosswise sphericity s c 6 π v m 4 d l cos θ note that the microplastic fibers are herein assumed to be straight and non deformable cylinders with circular cross sections khatmullina and isachenko 2017 the reynolds number re adopted is the same expression as the one used by zhang and choi 2022 i e r e u z 4 l d π ϑ 2 based on the unused 50 data set produced in this study fig 9 shows a comparison of the performance between the measured drag coefficients and the ones calculated using the proposed model eq 11 it can be observed that eq 11 can predict the orientation dependent drag coefficients of microplastic fibers with relatively low average errors i e ae 10 3 although the prediction errors for the microplastic fibers range from 1 5 l15d45 to 21 3 l10d85 the maximum prediction error ae 21 3 is still lower than the ones predicted using existing drag models i e ae from 33 to 104 shown in fig 8 the predictions errors of l10d85 i e ae 21 3 and l05d85 i e ae 19 6 may be attributed to the method of preparation of the microplastic fibers adopted in this study the microplastic fibers were cut from strands of polyester ropes so that the incised ends of some microplastic fibers are non circular in cross section cf the microscope images of l05d85 and l10d85 shown in fig s1 however the cylinder with circular cross section is a required assumption for calculations of the aschenbrenner shape factor and crosswise sphericity thus the microplastic fibers with non circular ends exhibit slightly larger prediction errors i e ae 21 3 for l10d85 and ae 19 6 for l05d85 compared with other fibers with more circular ends i e ae 15 0 for l05d65 l10d45 l15d45 and l15d55 4 discussions 4 1 applicability of experimental results the diameters of the microplastic fibers used in the experiments of this study i e 0 45 mm 0 85 mm are commonly used in similar settling experiments khatmullina and isachenko 2017 waldschlager and schuttrumpf 2019 however it is acknowledged that they may be larger than the ones detected in laundry effluent which have diameters that are in the order of tens of μm hernandez et al 2017 napper and thompson 2016 notwithstanding microplastic fibers can be released from a multitude of other sources besides laundry effluent these other sources produce fibers that are larger than those from laundry effluent for instance fishery activities are a significant source of microplastic fibers xue et al 2020 and can generate fibers larger than 2 mm in diameter chen et al 2018 tan et al 2020 which is larger than the fibers detected in laundry effluent wang et al 2019 as such the large microplastic fibers 0 45 mm 0 85 mm used in the experiments of this study also have relevance to those detected in natural aquatic environments the orientation dependent drag model eq 11 was developed by using microplastic fibers with diameters ranging from 0 45 mm to 0 85 mm therefore the applicability of eq 11 for modelling the secondary motions of fibers with smaller diameters needs to be evaluated fig 10 shows the relationship between the maximum settling orientation of the microplastic fibers tested in this study and their corresponding froude numbers i e f r ρ m ρ w d l which is a key parameter for the characterization of secondary motions chow and adams 2011 the maximum settling orientation θmax can be used as a parameter to describe the extent of secondary motions will et al 2021 it can be observed that there is an approximately linear relationship between the maximum settling orientation and froude number 12 θ m a x 25 1 f r 1 7 because the densities of water ρw and microplastic fibers ρm are constant variables the froude numbers of the settling microplastic fibers are dependent on their size i e described using d and l consequently the extent of secondary motions experienced is mainly dependent on the fiber size fig 11 shows the estimated maximum settling orientations for microplastic fibers with different sizes i e described using the aspect ratio l d and densities using eq 12 a negative correlation between the maximum settling orientation and the aspect ratio can be observed also it can be seen that although the diameter of some microplastic fibers detected in the field e g wwtp and laundry effluent is in the order of tens μm i e smaller than the ones used in this study the fibers in the field exhibit larger aspect ratios i e 46 655 than the ones used in this study i e 5 34 as such the maximum settling orientation detected in the field is smaller e g less than 6 for microplastic fibers detected from wwtp and less than 4 for microplastic fibers detected from laundry effluent than the ones observed in this study i e less than 15 this indicates that the secondary motions of microplastic fibers detected in the wwtp edo et al 2020 and laundry effluent napper and thomson 2016 are weaker than the ones used in this study the weaker secondary motions of microplastic fibers detected in wwtp and laundry effluent and the fibers used in this study re ranging from 30 to 88 belong to the laminar wake regime i e re 160 as proposed by bai and alam 2018 furthermore bai and alam 2018 demonstrated that the drag coefficients cd for all cylinders settling in the laminar wake regime exponentially decrease with an increase of re which is in agreement with the proposed drag model i e c d r e 0 7 in eq 11 evidently the proposed model eq 11 can be used to characterize the secondary motions of microplastic fibers with aspect ratios larger than five the microplastic fibers detected in the food chain jemec et al 2016 generally exhibit aspect ratios of less than four which is smaller than the ones used in this study i e 5 34 consequently the maximum settling orientation of the microplastic fibers detected in the food chain is larger i e 15 37 than the ones observed in this study i e less than 15 since there is a positive correlation between the maximum settling orientation and the extent of secondary motions will et al 2021 the microplastic fibers with aspect ratios of less than four will exhibit stronger secondary motions than the ones used in this study as a result the stronger secondary motions of fibers detected in the food chain may belong to the nonlaminar wake regime bai and alam 2018 where cd increases with re evidently the proposed model eq 11 which was developed based on a laminar wake regime i e cd decreases with re may be less suitable for the characterizations of secondary motions of microplastic fibers with aspect ratios of less than four consequently more data sets on the settling orientations of microplastic fibers that cover a broader range of aspect ratios will help to improve the proposed drag model eq 11 from an experimental perspective there are two additional reasons why microplastic fibers with larger diameters i e 0 45 mm 0 85 mm are favorable first conventional image acquisition systems i e the camera and image processing algorithm have limited capacity to detect microplastic fibers with diameters in the order of tens of μm second existing methods for preparing microplastic fibers such as cutting or cryogenically grinding synthetic threads cannot be used to prepare microplastic fibers that are less than 0 5 mm in size mossotti et al 2021 another idealization made in this study is the use of relatively stiff microplastic fibers in the field microplastic fibers may be flexible and can bend as they settle bagaev et al 2017 thus the proposed drag model eq 11 may be less suitable for the characterizations of the settling motions of flexible microplastic fibers the relatively stiff microplastic fibers used in this study only exhibit a slight curvature during the settling process cf figs s1 and s7b as such the microplastic fibers used in this study can be assumed to be straight and non deformable cylinders which is the common assumption for describing the microplastic fibers from fishing lines khatmullina and isachenko 2017 and idea for using the modified maxey riley equation i e eqs 1 and 2 which was developed for rigid particles evidently further investigation on the transport of flexible microplastic fibers is warranted 4 2 implications for the transport of microplastic fibers in natural aquatic environments this study is on the transport of microplastic fibers in quiescent water based on the modified maxey riley equation eq 2 the proposed drag model eq 11 can be used for making predictions of the transport of microplastic fibers in enclosed and semi enclosed aquatic bodies e g bay water this is because enclosed and semi enclosed aquatic bodies may be idealized as quiescent water conditions zazouli et al 2022 with inactive water exchange and wave conditions chen et al 2018 however non quiescent water conditions with waves and currents e g rivers and oceans are more common aquatic environments bagaev et al 2017 in fact microplastic fibers will settle under much higher reynolds numbers in non quiescent water conditions compared with the reynold numbers in quiescent water conditions higher reynolds numbers mean that secondary motions are more significant due to the enhanced wake instabilities produced behind the settling particles mando and rosendahl 2010 thus the drag model eq 11 which was proposed based on quiescent water conditions is less suitable for non quiescent water conditions furthermore fibers settling at higher reynolds numbers are prone to longer transport distances in the horizontal direction i e more significant lateral motions this is caused by the enhanced turbulence generated by waves kerpen et al 2020 or and currents pohl et al 2020 however the effects of turbulence on secondary motions are not considered in the proposed drag model eq 11 nor the modified maxey riley equation eq 2 further investigation of the effects of turbulence and extended applications of the proposed drag model for more natural aquatic environments is warranted 5 conclusions the effects of secondary motions on the settling behavior of microplastic fibers were experimentally investigated due to the presence of secondary motions the settling motion of microplastic fibers is an orientation dependent process that follows a sinusoidal pattern which governs the drag coefficient of a settling microplastic fiber a new drag model is proposed to describe the effects of secondary motions on drag coefficients the proposed drag model has been demonstrated to more accurately predict the drag coefficients of microplastic fibers compared to existing models that do not consider secondary motions combined with the modified maxey riley equation the proposed drag model can be used in future modeling to improve the prediction of microplastic fiber transport as the first step towards the realistic predictions of the transport of microplastic fibers in aquatic environments only stiff microplastic fibers in quiescent water conditions were investigated in this study however to further improve the predictions of the transport of a wider range of microplastic fiber types research is required to study the secondary motions

15973,halobenzoquinones hbqs as disinfection byproducts dbps in drinking water is prioritized for research due to their prevalent occurrence and high toxicity however only fifteen hbqs can be identified among a high diversity using targeted lc ms ms analysis in previous studies due to the lack of chemical standards in this study we developed a pseudo targeted lc ms ms method for detecting and quantifying diverse hbqs distinct fragment characteristics of hbqs was observed according to the halogen substituent effects and extended to the development of a multiple reaction monitoring mrm method for the quantification of the 46 hbqs that were observed in simulated drinking water using non targeted analysis the fragmentation mechanism was supported by the changes of gibbs free energy δg and a linear relationship between the δg and the ionization efficiency of analytes was developed accordingly for quantification of these 46 hbqs 30 of which were lack of chemical standards it is noted that 29 of the 30 newly identified hbqs were halo methyl benzoquinones hmbqs which were predicted to be carcinogens related with drinking water bladder cancer risk and be more toxic than non methyl hbqs using the new method twelve hmbqs were detected in actual drinking water samples with concentrations up to 100 4 ng l 3 times higher than that reported previously the cytotoxicity in cho cells of hmbqs was over 1 fold higher than that of non methyl hbqs therefore hmbqs are an essential highly toxic group of hbqs in drinking water which deserve particular monitoring and control graphical

identification of more hbqs in drinking water using the targeted mrm method as a primary precursor to hbqs dbps nom is a complex mixture of microbial metabolites debris and plant organic materials copy and mcknight 2005 which may result in a variety of previously uncharacterized or overlooked hbqs during water chlorination especially halo methyl benzoquinones hmbqs the only hbqs predicted to be bladder carcinogen according to qsar analysis du et al 2013 showed vary limited occurrence concentration and frequencies in drinking water in previous studies therefore developing a method that can recognize hbqs without chemical standards is necessary to recognize the occurrence of unknown hbqs in actual drinking water and identify the priority hbqs for risk assessment and regulation pseudo targeted metabolomics method combining the strengths of both nontargeted method high coverage and mrm methods accurate quantification has been applied to identify thousands of metabolites with high confidence lv et al 2020 xuan et al 2018 the method is a promising approach to analyze potential dbps even though it is seldom applied presently distinct from mrm that requires standards the pseudo targeted method can provide comprehensive profiling of hbqs in real chlorinated water samples even without hbqs standards the observed characteristic fragments of x m h hx co or m h hx of hbqs in previous studies were proposed to be candidate ion pairs in the pseudo targeted method huang et al 2013 lou et al 2019 the ionization efficiency of compounds in esi was influenced by several properties such as pk a octanol water distribution parameters kruve et al 2014 ginnings and baum 1937 li et al 2020 thereafter recognition of the relationship between chemical properties of hbqs and the ionization efficiencies ms signal intensities of selected ion transitions is proposed to be a potential approach for the quantification of hbqs without chemical standards in this study we first developed a pseudo targeted method for high coverage identification and high accuracy quantification of more hbqs thereafter the method was applied to analyze hbqs in real drinking water samples

sciex we proposed the hydrogen on the aromatic ring of hydroquinone structure was substituted by halogen chloro bromo iodo or mixed or methyl functional groups and then 46 types of hbqs except isomers that were identified in the stimulated drinking water were selected for the downstream analysis for visual graphic display of hbqs kendrick mass defect kmd plots vs carbon number were constructed as kmd c number map to demonstrate the characteristic of hbqs in fig s1 kmd is obtained by the difference between the nominal kendrick mass km values and the km kune et al 2019 plotting kmd as a function

which was developed by fu et al 2020 briefly the ms data was inputted into the calculation progress and each peak was deduced with all mathematically probable formulae within a mass error of 10 ppm if all formulae of a given peak are halogen free these formulae are excluded by the rule of the limited number of nonoxygen heteroatoms or the isotopic patterns of halogen containing formulae were analyzed in succession once the given formulae containing one or more halogens are validated with isotopic patterns the formula was optimized with a priority of the maximum number of halogens and oxygen finally the calculated results and annotation summaries are automatically created fu et al 2020 the code has simultaneously identified non organohalogens and organohalogens from the spectra of natural water it comprehensively considered the distinctive isotopologue peak characteristics selection of optimum halogenated dbp formulae the formula assignment patterns and inspection of the presence of formed halogenated dbps only parent peaks with over 0 5 relative abundance were considered for the downstream analysis and 2815 molecular ion peaks with 11 583 isotopologues were successfully assigned with formula with the annotation ratio of over 97 fu et al 2020 once the m z value of exacted compounds was identical to the chemical standards of hbqs the compounds were considered as potential candidates of hbqs for the ms ms fragments analysis according to the criteria proposed in previous study all of hbqs were deduced by three confidence levels schymanski et al 2014 level 1 refers to the confirmed structure which was identified by reference standards nineteen kinds of standard hbqs were available in our laboratory to identify hbqs at level 1 13 kinds of reported and 6 unreported level 2 refers to the probable structure which was confirmed by library spectra level 2a or diagnostic evidence level 2b level 3 is defined as tentative candidates the substructure was deduced by the ms ms spectra while the evidence for one exact chemical structure was sometimes insufficient the presence and diagnostic intensity ratio of hbqs with br 79br and 81br and or cl 35cl and 37cl substituents were checked by screening m z values the isotope mass difference of cl isotope and br isotope was 1 99705 0 00015 and 1 99795 0 00015 respectively the isotopic abundance ratios m m 2 of hbqs were validated to be 3 12 0 94 for 1 cl 1 03 0 31 for 1 br 1 56 0 47 for 2 cl 0 51 0 15 for 2 br 1 04 0 31 for 3 cl 0 34 0 10 for 3 br liu et al 2020 optimization of hbqs analysis an ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ion triple quadrupole ion trap tandem mass spectrometer uplc esi qtrap ms ms waters uplc system qtrap 5500 sciex concord on canada in negative ion mode was operated for mrm based hbqs analysis first we optimized the separation condition of six hmbqs on a beh c18 column 2 1 100 mm i d 1 7 μm waters ireland at column temperature of 50 c methanol 0 1 fa and water 0 1 fa was selected as suitable mobile phase for hbqs analysis in previous studies huang et al 2013 whereas the signal was inhibited by fa in the detection of hmbqs and then methanol and water were tested as more appropriate mobile phase for hmbqs analysis thus methanol and water were selected for the separation of deduced hmbqs in the pseudo targeted method the collision energy ce and declustering potential dp were optimized for the mixture of hbqs at level 1 3 which can be found in table s5 the method detection limits mdls of hmbqs at level 1were in the range of 0 6 2 4 ng l and the recoveries were 79 91 table s6 finally hbqs at level 1 was used to establish the concentration standard curves 2 5 theoretical calculation of fragments energy and quantification the theoretical calculations were conducted using the gaussian 03 program frisch et al 2003 1984 which optimized the equilibrium geometries of the compounds and calculated the frequency by the m06 2x method with 6 311 g d p and sdd only for i substituted hbqs zhang et al 2019 vibrational frequencies at the same level of theory were conducted on all optimized structures to identify stationary points as local minima the gauss view software display the optimized structures to explain the difference of hbqs fragments we calculated the g of mcmbq mbmbq mimbq and their corresponding m h ch3 and m h x using the above method the gibbs free energy of the deprotonation reaction δgd of hbqs that took place in the negative ion mode of esi was calculated by using gaussian 03 in the water phase briefly the δgd value of 17 hbqs at level 1 was calculated and correlated with the corresponding esi intensity combined with the standard curves mentioned in section 2 2 and the propagation the measurement errors of hbqs e g syringe volume uncertainties isomers and uncertainties in peak area determination the 1σ uncertainty for the intensities of hbqs at level 3 was determined to be at 30 subsequently the linear relationship between δgd and esi intensity was extended to predict the theoretical esi intensity of hbqs at level 3 the concentrations of hbqs at level 3 were calculated by the peak areas of the highest selective ion and the theoretical intensity under the negative esi mode which is described in the section 2 4 2 6 cytotoxicity test the cytotoxicity of 2 6 dcbq dcmbq 2 3 dc 5 6 dmbq 2 mcbq 2 cl 6 mbq and 5 cl 2 3 dmbq was tested with chinese hamster ovary cho cells based on a reported method wagner and plewa 2017 briefly 100 μl solution contained different concentration of hbqs 3 103 cho cells and f12 kmedium were added into the inner 60 wells of the 96 well flat bottomed microplates for tests and 100 μl phosphate buffered saline was added into the outer 36 wells nine concentration gradients were set for each hbqs and 0 5 dmso contained f12 k medium was set as the negative control due to 0 5 dmso was used to improve the solubility of hbqs in the tested solution then the 96 well microplates were exposed in the humidified atmosphere with at 37 c for 72 h finally discard the medium in each well and then 100 μl solution mixed with cultured and cck 8 at 10 1 was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h the absorbance of each well at 450 nm was determined using a microplate reader tecan infinite m200 pro a one way analysis of variance anova test combined with holm sidak multiple comparisons were conducted to confirm the lowest cytotoxic concentration according to the statistical difference between the hbqs ic50 values the power of the test statistic 1 β equal or over 0 8 at α value of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 pesudo targeted method for hbqs recognition in addition to the hbqs with chemical standards we hypothesized that more hbqs are generated during chlorination of drinking water the workflow of the pseudo targeted hbqs analysis method based on uhplc qtof ms is shown in fig s2 first a model nom sample was chlorinated to acquire as many hbqs as possible second an information dependent acquisition ida based auto ms ms non targeted analysis method with varied collision energy ce 15 30 and 45 ev was applied for obtaining occurrence information about hbqs fig s3 third the nonmdbp tool in matlab were used for the identification of hbqs among the 58 peaks identified fig s4 46 potential hbqs were confirmed based on retention time isotopes distribution and characteristic fragments table s7 they can be divided into four groups according to the halogen substituted of hbq cl benzoquinone six of hbqs and ten of hmbqs were identified in this group among which 2 mcbq 2 6 dcbq 2 5 dcbq 2 6 dc 3 mbq 2 3 6 tricbq tetrac 1 4 bq 2 cl 6 mbq 2 3 dc 5 6 dmbq 5 cl 2 3 dmbq and tetrac 1 2 bq were confirmed at level 1 by the chemical standards mcmbq 4 isomers were identified with mass errors of 2 5 ppm fig 2a the characteristic fragments of mcmbq was m h hcl and m h hcl co fig 2a which were consistent with reported hbqs in the ms ms spectra there were insufficient diagnostic fragments to confirm the position of the cl atom and mcmbq can only be classified into level 3 the cl hbqs were the most abundant group in authentic water samples dcmbq has been reported as the only hmbq in drinking water wang et al 2016 considering structural similarity we speculated that other hmbqs e g mcmbq dcdmbq may also be formed during drinking water chlorination br benzoquinone in this group five of hbqs and eight of hmbqs were confirmed at level 3 or above table s7 2 6 dbbq 2 mbbq 2 3 db 5 6 dmbq and tetrab 1 4 bq were found as level 1 with the standards tribbq dbdmbq mbmbq mbdmbq and mbtrimbq 4 isomers were identified with a mass error of 6 8 9 6 ppm on the basis of the exact mass and the isotopic distribution figs 2b and s5 tribbq was identified by the characteristic fragments of m h hbr and m h hbr co fig s5 however both dbdmbq and mbmbq have the fragments of m 15 and m 43 figs 2 b and s5 which correspond to the loss of ch3 and ch3 co respectively the different characteristic fragments deserved deep exploration all of the above analytes only can be identified as level 3 due to the lack of clear evidence for the substituted position of br and ch3 on the benzene ring i benzoquinone seven benzoquinones were found with hydrogen replaced by iodine and or methyl 2 ibq and 2 6 dibq were confirmed as level 1 by the standards mimbq midmbq dimbq and didmbq two isomers were identified at level 3 with mass errors of 2 6 9 2 ppm figs 2c and s6 and the uncertainty of the i and ch3 substitution position similar with br methyl hbqs the fragments of m h ch3 or m h ch3 co as well as the i were also found in the ms ms spectra of i methyl hbqs figs 2c and s6 previous studies have shown that iodinated hbqs such as 2 6 dibq have stronger cytotoxicity compared to chlorinated and brominated hbqs on human hepatoma cells hepg2 cells and cho cells hu et al 2020 thus particular attention should be paid to this class in the actual aquatic environment x benzoquinone x benzoquinone x hbqs was featured by two or more different halogens replacing by multiple halogen in hbqs in this group 2 cl 6 ibq 2 br 5 cl 3 6 dmbq and 2 6 db 3 cl 5 mbq were confirmed at level 1 by the standards mimcmbq mbmcmbq and mimcdmbq four isomers were confirmed at level 3 by the acceptable mass accuracy and the characteristic fragments of m h hcl m h hi or x table s8 there was no significant regulation of the fragments of x hbqs on the basis of hbqs at level 3 we further searched their ms and ms ms spectra in the open access library of sirius and csi fingerid in order to determine the confidence level of hbqs sirius and csi fingerid are molecular structure database which allow the mass deviation of parent ions and fragments within 20 ppm duhrkop et al 2015 2019 none of hbqs were detected in the library and thus they were judged into level 3 subsequently the product ions of the highest intensities of each analyte were selected as the characteristic product ions of the precursor ions if no product ion was detected the precursor ion was considered as the identical mass as its product ion and the ion pair was called as sham ion pair the selected ion pair were verified by uplc coupled with qtrap ms in scheduled mrm mode and the ion pairs that could not be well detected were classified as false positive finally the detection method for 46 potential hbqs was established figs 1 d and s7 notably only one ion pair was demonstrated and more details were described in table s8 3 2 validation of the pseudo targeted hbqs method the accuracy of detected hbqs at level 3 using pseudo targeted method was examined by checking the ms ms fragments and formation potential first the structures of all hbqs were confirmed by the accurate ms ms fragments table s8 all hbqs could generate halogen ions e g cl br i in the collision cell cl hbq br hbq i hbq and cl methyl hbq shared common fragments of m h hcl or m h hcl co conversely the major fragment ions found in the ms ms spectra of br methyl hbqs and i methyl hbqs were m h ch3 or m h ch3 co we calculated the formation probability of different fragments from hbqs with different substituted groups in fig 2a br methyl hbqs and i methyl hbqs had the product ions of x i and br characteristic fragments of m h ch3 co and m h ch3 whereas residual hbqs share the ion pairs of m h m h hx or m h m h co hx x cl i and br fig 2a to confirm the effectiveness of br i methyl hbqs fragments and reveal the mechanism of the different ionization behaviors in the different halogen substituted hbqs we selected mcmbq mbmbq and mimbq as model hbqs to calculate the g of fragmentation methyl and halogen elimination channels were proposed for the dissociation of mcmbq mbmbq and mimbq according to the results of the ms ms spectra as shown in fig 2b the δg of mbmbq h hbr and mimbq h hi fragments were 45 2 and 33 4 kcal mol respectively the negative δg leads to the unstable of m h hx and thus only the m h ch3 can be observed in their esi process conversely the δg of mcmbq h hcl was 52 4 kcal mol higher than that of the precursor ion and thus the subsequent dissociation was restrained because of the considerable energy barrier meanwhile the estimated δg for mcmbq h ch3 was higher than that of mcmbq h hcl thus only mcmbq h hcl can be observed in the esi process therefore the substituted halogen affects the energic barrier to produce different fragments in the ms spectra furthermore we have obtained the ms ms spectrum and concentration curve of 2 i 6 mbq in fig s8 which confirmed the reliability of the common fragments regulation and the identification of 2 i 6 mbq as such the common fragments regulation and the identification of 2 i 6 mbq supported the feasibility of the pseudo targeted method second we investigated the repeatability of speculative hbqs using the pseudo targeted method relative standard deviation rsd of peak areas were calculated by the three replicate injections of triplicate parallel samples the rsd values for all hbqs at level 3 were less than 5 table s9 moreover we examined the intensity of hbqs at level 3 after chlorination of varied concentrations of nom as shown in table s10 the intensity of hbqs at level 3 were strongly correlated with the initial nom concentration r 2 0 85 thus we excluded the background interference therefore the pseudo targeted method was a reliable method to discern hbqs and we further explored the quantification of hbqs at level 3 in the absence of standards 3 3 pseudo targeted method for quantification of hbqs in the esi process the ionization efficiency ie of compounds were affected by several key factors oss et al 2010 for example there is a relationship between chlorophenol and benzoquinone response and pka value which is related to basicity henriksen and juhler 2005 the chemical structure and property of hbqs are close to chlorophenol and benzoquinone and negative correlations exist between ionization sensitivity and their chemical basicity henriksen and juhler 2005 therefore a linear correlation between the basicity of hbqs expressed in terms of δgd combined with esi sensitivity expressed as the ms intensity of the most intensive transition of hbqs at level 1 with the concentration of 10 ppb were observed with r 2 0 60 y 1477 4x 403 327 fig s9 table s11 demonstrated the measured concentration based on authentic standards and calculated ones using the linear relationship the standard deviation was in the range of 3 7 97 4 the deviation of the trend line is 50 6 whereas the average 1σ uncertainty of 50 6 66 3 for hbqs at level 3 due to the peak integration uncertainty in the instrument analysis and the uncertainty of hbqs structures we have evaluated the accuracy of the predication equation by measuring the ms intensity of 2 i 6 mbq the measured and predicted signal intensity of 2 i 6 mbq of 10 ppb was 1 3 105 and 9 1 104 respectively the relative error was calculated to be 30 0 which was in the tolerance range ten hbqs at level 1 were identified in the six drinking water samples as demonstrated in fig 3 including 2 6 dcbq tetrac 1 2 bq 2 6 dibq 2 cl 6 mbq 2 mibq 2 mcbq 2 mbbq 2 br 5 cl 3 6 bq 2 6 dbbq and 5 cl 2 3 dmbq fig 3a the total concentrations of the ten hbqs were ranged from 49 5 to 74 2 ng l which was 2 30 folds higher than that of previous studies lou et al 2021 the concentration of hbqs was closer to the value measured in 2019 lou et al 2021 the increase of hbqs concentration in the identical sampled site can be attributed to the discovery of more hmbqs 2 cl 6 mbq was detected in the concentration range of 12 5 23 2 ng l median concentration was 17 3 ng l with 100 occurrence the concentration of 5 cl 2 3 dmbq was ranked third with a concentration range of 5 4 8 9 ng l median concentration was 6 7 ng l in all samples others occurred in 67 100 samples at trace concentrations with median concentrations of 1 9 2 8 ng l previous studies have proposed that 2 6 dihalo 1 4 benzoquinones might be the major species of hbqs in drinking water hu et al 2020 and thus the detection of hbqs was focused on these categories in the previous study indeed 2 6 dcbq was the most frequently detected hbqs with high concentration in drinking water however the total concentration of hmbqs ranged from 21 9 to 32 3 ng l which accounted for over 40 of hbqs at level 1 therefore the occurrence of hmbqs could not be ignored the concentrations of hbqs detected by using the pseudo targeted method were shown in fig 3b 11 hmbqs were observed in drinking water samples the total concentration of hmbqs at level 3 was in the range of 1 4 30 0 ng l fig 3b the concentrations of hbqs in the samples d f were significantly higher than that of samples a c especially for mbmbq didmbq mbtrimbq and mimbq the samples d f were collected from a coast city with higher i and br concentrations and bromide to chlorine ratios act an important role in the generation of dbps categories hua et al 2006 symons et al 1993 thus more br i substituted hbqs were observed in these samples other factors such as iodinated and brominated compounds also contributed to the generation of i and br substituted hbqs for example iopamidol an iodinated x ray contrast medium was measured at a level of μg l in a u s source water and turned as precursors of dbps seitz et al 2006 duirk et al 2011 wendel et al 2016 therefore the total concentration of hbqs at level 3 or above were ranged from 63 4 to 100 4 ng l although the calculated concentration was not accurate it still can reflect the underestimated hbqs in previous studies the method provides a rapid and comprehensive method to estimate the boundary of hbqs in different water systems to comprehensively understand the occurrence of hbqs species in drinking water we classified 46 hbqs into 10 categories according to the halogen and methyl number fig s10 monohalo methyl benzoquinones were the most frequently detected accounting for 50 of the total hbqs the km plots of cho nom features had shown that methyl was prevalent group in the nom compositions phungsai et al 2018 the ubiquitous methyl groups may lead to the generation of methyl substituted hbqs finally all hbqs including hmbqs can be detected using the existing means and our method were visualized in fig 4 to date 19 hbqs at level 1 and 27 hbqs at level 3 can be analyzed which was much more comprehensive than the targeted method in previous studies 15 hbqs at level 1 including 29 methyl substituted hbqs and 2 hbqs for the first time moreover only 8 hbqs have been reported in authentic drinking water our study expanded the number to 21 and 12 hmbqs were detected for the first time thus this method extended our recognition on the species and occurrence of hbqs especially for hmbqs 3 4 cytotoxicity of hmbqs in cho cells according to the abovementioned investigation 2 6 dcbq and 2 cl 6 mbq were the tested hbqs of the highest occurrence frequency and concentrations it s essential to evaluate their cytotoxicity simultaneously the effect of methyl on the cytotoxicity of hbqs was deserved to explore because 12 hmbqs were measured in drinking water thereafter we conducted the cytotoxicity test in cho cells of six hbqs with the basic structure of dcbq or mcbq including 2 3 dcdmbq 2 6 dcmbq 5 cl 2 3 dmbq and 2 cl 6 mbq previous studies have pointed that hbqs were unstable in media they could transform to oh hbqs or react with the contents of media hung et al 2019 trentscher et al 2021 in our study the life time of the six tested hbqs was ranged from 0 5 to 2 h which was within 72 h in the f12 k media fig s11 thus the cell toxicity was caused by hbqs combined with their transformation products the cell viability of the six hbqs including transformation products at concentrations of 1 40 μμ is demonstrated in fig 5 according to the mean ic50 values the cytotoxicity of dichloro basic hbqs and their corresponding products ranked as 2 3 dcdmbq 18 8 0 8 μm 2 6 dcmbq 24 6 1 3 μm 2 6 dcbq 29 2 1 9 μm the cytotoxicity of monochloro basic hbqs ranked as 5 cl 2 3 dmbq 7 9 0 7 μm 2 cl 6 mbq 8 1 0 7 μm 2 mcbq 21 7 1 6 μm the represents that the ic50 data between two groups were not significantly different table s12 the lowest cytotoxic concentration which defines as a statistically significant change compared to the negative control of 6 hbqs was obtained by the holm sidak method with p value 0 05 table s13 the lowest cytotoxic concentration of six analytes was 2 6 dcbq 15 μm 2 6 dc 5 mbq 8 μm 2 3 dc 5 6 dmbq 8 μm 2 cbq 10 μm 2 cl 6 mbq 2 μm and 5 cl 2 3 dmbq 2 μm the results indicated that the substitution of more methyl groups led to higher cytotoxicity in cho cells and thus hmbqs deserve particularly attentions 4 conclusion hbqs with high occurrence and toxicity were listed as priority dbps but the hmbqs were barely studied which limited the comprehensive understanding of hbqs and associated risks in this study we developed a method for qualitative and quantitative characterization of 46 hbqs using this method 21 hbqs were identified in tested drinking water at concentrations of 100 higher than that reported by previous studies the overlooked hmbqs unexpectedly accounted for over 50 of total hbq concentrations in practice the method only provides the theoretical chemistry results of quantification and only considers a relative indicator of esi sensitivity not absolute determining factors the precision and more parameters need to be improved in future researches regardless the high throughput reproducible pseudo targeted approach provides a novel approach for future hbq studies

15973,halobenzoquinones hbqs as disinfection byproducts dbps in drinking water is prioritized for research due to their prevalent occurrence and high toxicity however only fifteen hbqs can be identified among a high diversity using targeted lc ms ms analysis in previous studies due to the lack of chemical standards in this study we developed a pseudo targeted lc ms ms method for detecting and quantifying diverse hbqs distinct fragment characteristics of hbqs was observed according to the halogen substituent effects and extended to the development of a multiple reaction monitoring mrm method for the quantification of the 46 hbqs that were observed in simulated drinking water using non targeted analysis the fragmentation mechanism was supported by the changes of gibbs free energy δg and a linear relationship between the δg and the ionization efficiency of analytes was developed accordingly for quantification of these 46 hbqs 30 of which were lack of chemical standards it is noted that 29 of the 30 newly identified hbqs were halo methyl benzoquinones hmbqs which were predicted to be carcinogens related with drinking water bladder cancer risk and be more toxic than non methyl hbqs using the new method twelve hmbqs were detected in actual drinking water samples with concentrations up to 100 4 ng l 3 times higher than that reported previously the cytotoxicity in cho cells of hmbqs was over 1 fold higher than that of non methyl hbqs therefore hmbqs are an essential highly toxic group of hbqs in drinking water which deserve particular monitoring and control graphical

bladder carcinogen according to qsar analysis du et al 2013 showed vary limited occurrence concentration and frequencies in drinking water in previous studies therefore developing a method that can recognize hbqs without chemical standards is necessary to recognize the occurrence of unknown hbqs in actual drinking water and identify the priority hbqs for risk assessment and regulation pseudo targeted metabolomics method combining the strengths of both nontargeted method high coverage and mrm methods accurate quantification has been applied to identify thousands of metabolites with high confidence lv et al 2020 xuan et al 2018 the method is a promising approach to analyze potential dbps even though it is seldom applied presently distinct from mrm that requires standards the pseudo targeted method can provide comprehensive profiling of hbqs in real chlorinated water samples even without hbqs standards the observed characteristic fragments of x m h hx co or m h hx of hbqs in previous studies were proposed to be candidate ion pairs in the pseudo targeted method huang et al 2013 lou et al 2019 the ionization efficiency of compounds in esi was influenced by several properties such as pk a octanol water distribution parameters kruve et al 2014 ginnings and baum 1937 li et al 2020 thereafter recognition of the relationship between chemical properties of hbqs and the ionization efficiencies ms signal intensities of selected ion transitions is proposed to be a potential approach for the quantification of hbqs without chemical standards in this study we first developed a pseudo targeted method for high coverage identification and high accuracy quantification of more hbqs thereafter the method was applied to analyze hbqs in real drinking water samples

which was developed by fu et al 2020 briefly the ms data was inputted into the calculation progress and each peak was deduced with all mathematically probable formulae within a mass error of 10 ppm if all formulae of a given peak are halogen free these formulae are excluded by the rule of the limited number of nonoxygen heteroatoms or the isotopic patterns of halogen containing formulae were analyzed in succession once the given formulae containing one or more halogens are validated with isotopic patterns the formula was optimized with a priority of the maximum number of halogens and oxygen finally the calculated results and annotation summaries are automatically created fu et al 2020 the code has simultaneously identified non organohalogens and organohalogens from the spectra of natural water it comprehensively considered the distinctive isotopologue peak characteristics selection of optimum halogenated dbp formulae the formula assignment patterns and inspection of the presence of formed halogenated dbps only parent peaks with over 0 5 relative abundance were considered for the downstream analysis and 2815 molecular ion peaks with 11 583 isotopologues were successfully assigned with formula with the annotation ratio of over 97 fu et al 2020 once the m z value of exacted compounds was identical to the chemical standards of hbqs the compounds were considered as potential candidates of hbqs for the ms ms fragments analysis according to the criteria proposed in previous study all of hbqs were deduced by three confidence levels schymanski et al 2014 level 1 refers to the confirmed structure which was identified by reference standards nineteen kinds of standard hbqs were available in our laboratory to identify hbqs at level 1 13 kinds of reported and 6 unreported level 2 refers to the probable structure which was confirmed by library spectra level 2a or diagnostic evidence level 2b level 3 is defined as tentative candidates the substructure was deduced by the ms ms spectra while the evidence for one exact chemical structure was sometimes insufficient the presence and diagnostic intensity ratio of hbqs with br 79br and 81br

hbqs analysis an ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ion triple quadrupole ion trap tandem mass spectrometer uplc esi qtrap ms ms waters uplc system qtrap 5500 sciex concord on canada in negative ion mode was operated for mrm based hbqs analysis first we optimized the separation condition of six hmbqs on a beh c18 column 2 1 100 mm i d 1 7 μm waters ireland at column temperature of 50 c methanol 0 1 fa and water 0 1 fa was selected as suitable mobile phase for hbqs analysis in previous studies huang et al 2013 whereas the signal was inhibited by fa in the detection of hmbqs and then methanol and water were tested as more appropriate mobile phase for hmbqs analysis thus methanol and water were selected for the separation of deduced hmbqs in the pseudo targeted method the collision energy ce and declustering potential dp were optimized for the mixture of hbqs at level 1 3 which can be found in table s5 the method detection limits mdls of hmbqs at level 1were in the range of 0 6 2 4 ng l and the recoveries were 79 91 table s6 finally hbqs at level 1 was used to establish the concentration standard curves 2 5 theoretical calculation of fragments energy and quantification the theoretical calculations were conducted using the gaussian 03 program frisch et al 2003 1984 which optimized the equilibrium geometries of the compounds and calculated the frequency by the m06 2x method with 6 311 g d p and sdd only for i substituted hbqs zhang et al 2019 vibrational frequencies at the same level of theory were conducted on all optimized structures to identify stationary points as local minima the gauss view software display the optimized structures to explain the difference of hbqs fragments we calculated the g of mcmbq mbmbq mimbq and their corresponding m h ch3 and m h x using the above method the gibbs free energy of the deprotonation reaction δgd of hbqs that took place in the negative ion mode of esi was calculated by using gaussian 03 in the water phase briefly the δgd value of 17 hbqs at level 1 was calculated and correlated with the corresponding esi intensity combined with the standard curves mentioned in section 2 2 and the propagation the measurement errors of hbqs e g syringe volume uncertainties isomers and uncertainties in peak area determination the 1σ uncertainty for the intensities of hbqs at level 3 was determined to be at 30 subsequently the linear relationship between δgd and esi intensity was extended to predict the theoretical esi intensity of hbqs at level 3 the concentrations of hbqs at level 3 were calculated by the peak areas of the highest selective ion and the theoretical intensity under the negative esi mode which is described in the section 2 4 2 6 cytotoxicity test the cytotoxicity of 2 6 dcbq dcmbq 2 3 dc 5 6 dmbq 2 mcbq 2 cl 6 mbq and 5 cl 2 3 dmbq was tested with chinese hamster ovary cho cells based on a reported method wagner and plewa 2017 briefly 100 μl solution contained different concentration of hbqs 3 103 cho cells and f12 kmedium were added into the inner 60 wells of the 96 well flat bottomed microplates for tests and 100 μl phosphate buffered saline was added into the outer 36 wells nine concentration gradients were set for each hbqs and 0 5 dmso contained f12 k medium was set as the negative control due to 0 5 dmso was used to improve the solubility of hbqs in the tested solution then the 96 well microplates were exposed in the humidified atmosphere with at 37 c for 72 h finally discard the medium in each well and then 100 μl solution mixed with cultured and cck 8 at 10 1 was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h the absorbance of each well at 450 nm was determined using a microplate reader tecan infinite m200 pro a one way analysis of variance anova test combined with holm sidak multiple comparisons were conducted to confirm the lowest cytotoxic concentration according to the statistical difference between the hbqs ic50 values the power of the test statistic 1 β equal or over 0 8 at α value of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 pesudo targeted method for hbqs recognition in addition to the hbqs with chemical standards we hypothesized that more hbqs are generated during chlorination of drinking water the workflow of the pseudo targeted hbqs analysis method based on uhplc qtof ms is shown in fig s2 first a model nom

was applied for obtaining occurrence information about hbqs fig s3 third the nonmdbp tool in matlab were used for the identification of hbqs among the 58 peaks identified fig s4 46 potential hbqs were confirmed based on retention time isotopes distribution and characteristic fragments table s7 they can be divided into four groups according to the halogen substituted of hbq cl benzoquinone six of

consistent with reported hbqs in the ms ms spectra there were insufficient diagnostic fragments to confirm the position of the cl atom and mcmbq can only be classified into level 3 the cl hbqs were the most abundant group in authentic water samples dcmbq has been reported as the only hmbq in drinking water wang et al 2016 considering structural similarity we speculated that other hmbqs e g mcmbq dcdmbq may also be formed during drinking water chlorination br benzoquinone in this group five of hbqs and eight of hmbqs were confirmed at level 3 or above table s7 2 6 dbbq 2 mbbq 2 3 db 5 6 dmbq

isotopic distribution figs 2b and s5 tribbq was identified by the characteristic fragments of m h hbr and m h hbr co fig s5 however both dbdmbq and mbmbq have the fragments of m 15 and m 43 figs 2 b and s5 which correspond to the loss of ch3 and ch3 co respectively the different characteristic fragments deserved deep exploration all of the above analytes only can be identified as level 3 due to the lack of clear evidence for the substituted position of br and ch3 on the benzene ring i benzoquinone seven benzoquinones were found with hydrogen replaced by iodine and or methyl 2 ibq and 2 6 dibq were confirmed as level 1 by the standards mimbq midmbq dimbq and didmbq two isomers were identified at level 3 with mass errors of 2 6 9 2 ppm figs 2c and s6 and the uncertainty of the i and ch3 substitution position similar with br methyl hbqs the fragments of m h ch3 or m h ch3 co as well as the i were also found in the ms ms spectra of i methyl hbqs figs 2c and s6 previous studies have shown that iodinated hbqs such as 2 6 dibq have stronger cytotoxicity compared to chlorinated and brominated hbqs on human hepatoma cells hepg2 cells and cho cells hu et al 2020 thus particular attention should be paid to this class in the actual aquatic environment x benzoquinone x benzoquinone x hbqs was featured by two or more different halogens replacing by multiple halogen in hbqs in this group 2 cl 6 ibq 2 br 5 cl 3 6 dmbq and 2 6 db 3 cl 5 mbq were confirmed at level 1 by the standards mimcmbq mbmcmbq and mimcdmbq four isomers were confirmed at level 3 by the acceptable mass accuracy and the characteristic fragments of m h hcl m h hi or x table s8 there was no significant regulation of the fragments of x hbqs on the basis of hbqs at level 3 we further searched their ms and ms ms spectra in the open access library of sirius and csi fingerid in order to determine the confidence level of hbqs sirius and csi fingerid are molecular structure database which allow the mass deviation of parent ions and fragments within 20 ppm duhrkop et al 2015 2019 none of hbqs were detected in the library and thus they were judged into level 3 subsequently the product ions of the highest intensities of each analyte were selected as the characteristic product ions of the precursor ions if no product ion was detected the precursor ion was considered as the identical mass as its product ion and the ion pair was called as sham ion pair the selected ion pair were verified by uplc coupled with qtrap ms in scheduled mrm mode and the ion pairs that could not be well detected were classified as false positive finally the detection method for 46 potential hbqs was established figs 1 d and s7 notably only one ion pair was demonstrated and more details were described in table s8 3 2 validation of the pseudo targeted hbqs method the accuracy of detected hbqs at level 3 using pseudo targeted method was examined by checking the ms ms fragments and formation potential first the structures of all hbqs were confirmed by the accurate ms ms fragments table s8 all hbqs could generate halogen ions e g cl br i in the collision cell cl hbq br hbq i hbq and cl methyl hbq shared common fragments of m h hcl or m h hcl co conversely the major fragment ions found in the ms ms spectra of br methyl hbqs and i methyl hbqs were m h ch3 or m h ch3 co we calculated the formation probability of different fragments from hbqs with different substituted groups in fig 2a br methyl hbqs and i methyl hbqs had the product ions of x i and br characteristic fragments of m h ch3 co and m h ch3 whereas residual hbqs share the ion pairs of m h m h hx or m h m h co hx x cl i and br fig 2a to confirm the effectiveness of br i methyl hbqs fragments and reveal the mechanism of the different ionization behaviors in the different halogen substituted hbqs we selected mcmbq mbmbq and mimbq as model hbqs to calculate the g of fragmentation methyl and halogen elimination channels were proposed for the dissociation of mcmbq mbmbq and mimbq according to the results of the ms ms spectra as shown in fig 2b the δg of mbmbq h hbr and mimbq h hi fragments were 45 2 and 33 4 kcal mol respectively the negative δg leads to the unstable of m h hx and thus only the m h ch3 can be observed in their esi process conversely the δg of mcmbq h hcl was 52 4 kcal mol higher than that of the precursor ion and thus the subsequent dissociation was restrained because of the considerable energy barrier meanwhile the estimated δg for mcmbq h ch3 was higher than that of mcmbq h hcl thus only mcmbq h hcl can be observed in the esi process therefore the substituted halogen affects the energic barrier to produce different fragments in the ms spectra furthermore we have obtained the ms ms spectrum and concentration curve of 2 i 6 mbq in fig s8 which confirmed the reliability of the common fragments regulation and the identification of 2 i 6 mbq as such the common fragments regulation and the identification of 2 i 6 mbq supported the feasibility of the pseudo targeted method second we investigated the repeatability of speculative hbqs using the pseudo targeted method relative standard deviation rsd of peak areas were calculated by the three replicate injections of triplicate parallel samples the rsd values for all hbqs at level 3 were less than 5 table s9 moreover we examined the intensity of hbqs at level 3 after chlorination of varied concentrations of nom as shown in table s10 the intensity of hbqs at level 3 were strongly correlated with the initial nom concentration r 2 0 85 thus we excluded the background interference therefore the pseudo targeted method was a reliable method to discern hbqs and we further explored the quantification of hbqs at level 3 in the absence of standards 3 3 pseudo targeted method for quantification of hbqs in the esi process the ionization efficiency ie of compounds were affected by several key factors oss et al 2010 for example there is a relationship between chlorophenol and benzoquinone response and pka value which is related to basicity henriksen and juhler 2005 the chemical structure and property of hbqs are close to chlorophenol and benzoquinone and negative correlations exist between ionization sensitivity and their chemical basicity henriksen and juhler 2005 therefore a linear correlation between the basicity of hbqs expressed in terms of δgd combined with esi sensitivity expressed as the ms intensity of the most intensive transition of hbqs at level 1 with the concentration of 10 ppb were observed with r 2 0 60 y 1477 4x 403 327 fig s9 table s11 demonstrated the measured concentration based on authentic standards and calculated ones using the linear relationship the standard deviation was in the range of 3 7 97 4 the deviation of the trend line is 50 6 whereas the average 1σ uncertainty of 50 6 66 3 for hbqs at level 3 due to the peak integration uncertainty in the instrument analysis and the uncertainty of hbqs structures we have evaluated the accuracy of the predication equation by measuring the ms intensity of 2 i 6 mbq the measured and predicted signal intensity of 2 i 6 mbq of 10 ppb was 1 3 105 and 9 1 104 respectively the relative error was calculated to be 30 0 which was in the tolerance range ten hbqs at level 1 were identified in the six drinking water samples as demonstrated in fig 3 including 2 6 dcbq tetrac 1 2 bq 2 6 dibq 2 cl 6 mbq 2 mibq 2 mcbq 2 mbbq 2 br 5 cl 3 6 bq 2 6 dbbq and 5 cl 2 3 dmbq fig 3a the total concentrations of the ten hbqs were ranged from 49 5 to 74 2 ng l which was 2 30 folds higher than that of previous studies lou et al 2021 the concentration of hbqs was closer to the value measured in 2019 lou et al 2021 the increase of hbqs concentration in the identical sampled site can be attributed to the discovery of more hmbqs 2 cl 6 mbq was detected in the concentration range of 12 5 23 2 ng l median concentration was 17 3 ng l with 100 occurrence the concentration of 5 cl 2 3 dmbq was ranked third with a concentration range of 5 4 8 9 ng l median concentration was 6 7 ng l in all samples others occurred in 67 100 samples at trace concentrations with median concentrations of 1 9 2 8 ng l previous studies have proposed that 2 6 dihalo 1 4 benzoquinones might be the major species of hbqs in drinking water hu et al 2020 and thus the detection of hbqs was focused on these categories in the previous study indeed 2 6 dcbq was the most frequently detected hbqs with high concentration in drinking water however the total concentration of hmbqs ranged from 21 9 to 32 3 ng l which accounted for over 40 of hbqs at level 1 therefore the occurrence of hmbqs could not be ignored the concentrations of hbqs detected by using the pseudo targeted method were shown in fig 3b 11 hmbqs were observed in drinking water samples the total concentration of hmbqs at level 3 was in the range of 1 4 30 0 ng l fig 3b the concentrations of hbqs in the samples d f were significantly higher than that of samples a c especially for mbmbq didmbq mbtrimbq and mimbq the samples d f were collected from a coast city with higher i and br concentrations and bromide to chlorine ratios act an important role in the generation of dbps categories hua et al 2006 symons et al 1993 thus more br i substituted hbqs were observed in these samples other factors such as iodinated and brominated compounds also contributed to the generation of i and br substituted hbqs for example iopamidol an iodinated x ray contrast medium was measured at a level of μg l in a u s source water and turned as precursors of dbps seitz et al 2006 duirk et al 2011 wendel et al 2016 therefore the total concentration of hbqs at level 3 or above were ranged from 63 4 to 100 4 ng l although the calculated concentration was not accurate it still can reflect the underestimated hbqs in previous studies the method provides a rapid and comprehensive method to estimate the boundary of hbqs in different water systems to comprehensively understand the occurrence of hbqs species in drinking water we classified 46 hbqs into 10 categories according to the halogen and methyl number fig s10 monohalo methyl benzoquinones were the most frequently detected accounting for 50 of the total hbqs the km plots of cho nom features had shown that methyl was prevalent group in the nom compositions phungsai et al 2018 the ubiquitous methyl groups may lead to the generation of methyl substituted hbqs finally all hbqs including hmbqs can be detected using the existing means and our method were visualized in fig 4 to date 19 hbqs at level 1 and 27 hbqs at level 3 can be analyzed which was much more comprehensive than the targeted method in previous studies 15 hbqs at level 1 including 29 methyl substituted hbqs and 2 hbqs for the first time moreover only 8 hbqs have been reported in authentic drinking water our study expanded the number to 21 and 12 hmbqs were detected for the first time thus this method extended our recognition on the species and occurrence of hbqs especially for hmbqs 3 4 cytotoxicity of hmbqs in cho cells according to the abovementioned investigation 2 6 dcbq and 2 cl 6 mbq were the tested hbqs of the highest occurrence frequency and concentrations it s essential to evaluate their cytotoxicity simultaneously the effect of methyl on the cytotoxicity of hbqs was deserved to explore because 12 hmbqs were measured in drinking water thereafter we conducted the cytotoxicity test in cho cells of six hbqs with the basic structure of dcbq or mcbq including 2 3 dcdmbq 2 6 dcmbq 5 cl 2 3 dmbq and 2 cl 6 mbq previous studies have pointed that hbqs were unstable in media they could transform to oh hbqs or react with the contents of media hung et al 2019 trentscher et al 2021 in our study the life time of the six tested hbqs was ranged from 0 5 to 2 h which was within 72 h in the f12 k media fig s11 thus the cell toxicity was caused by hbqs combined with their transformation products the cell viability of the six hbqs including transformation products at concentrations of 1 40 μμ is demonstrated in fig 5 according to the mean ic50 values the cytotoxicity of dichloro basic hbqs and their corresponding products ranked as 2 3 dcdmbq 18 8 0 8 μm 2 6 dcmbq 24 6 1 3 μm 2 6 dcbq 29 2 1 9 μm the cytotoxicity of monochloro basic hbqs ranked as 5 cl 2 3 dmbq 7 9 0 7 μm 2 cl 6 mbq 8 1 0 7 μm 2 mcbq 21 7 1 6 μm the represents that the ic50 data between two groups were not significantly different table s12 the lowest cytotoxic concentration which defines as a statistically significant change compared to the negative control of 6 hbqs was obtained by the holm sidak method with p value 0 05 table s13 the lowest cytotoxic concentration of six analytes was 2 6 dcbq 15 μm 2 6 dc 5 mbq 8 μm 2 3 dc 5 6 dmbq 8 μm 2 cbq 10 μm 2 cl 6 mbq 2 μm and 5 cl 2 3 dmbq 2 μm the results indicated that the substitution of more methyl groups led to higher cytotoxicity in cho cells and thus hmbqs deserve particularly attentions 4 conclusion hbqs with high occurrence and toxicity were listed as priority dbps but the hmbqs were barely studied which limited the comprehensive understanding of hbqs and associated risks in this study we developed a method for qualitative and quantitative characterization of 46 hbqs using this method 21 hbqs were identified in tested drinking water at concentrations of 100 higher than that reported by previous studies the overlooked hmbqs unexpectedly accounted for over 50 of total hbq concentrations in practice the method only provides the theoretical chemistry results of quantification and only considers a relative indicator of esi sensitivity not absolute determining factors the precision and more parameters need to be improved in future researches regardless the high throughput reproducible pseudo targeted approach provides a novel approach for future hbq studies

15974,a novel approach for the enhancement of phosphorus p recovery from fe bound p compounds feps bearing sludge by co fermentation with protein rich biomass prb is reported four prbs silkworm chrysalis meal fish meal corn gluten meal and soya bean meal were used for co fermentation the results revealed that prbs with strong surface hydrophobicity and loose structure favored the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes sulfide produced by prb could react with feps to form fes and promote p release due to the neutralization of volatile fatty acids vfas by a relatively high concentration of ammonia the ph was maintained near neutral and thus prevented the dissolution of metal ions e g fe and ca this was beneficial to save the cost of subsequent p recovery and form high purity struvite compared with the control the soluble orthophosphate and vfas increased by 88 3 and 531 3 respectively in the co fermentation system with silkworm chrysalis meal cysteine was the important intermediate the metagenomics analysis indicated that the gene abundances of phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase which were key enzymes in the acetate metabolism increased by 117 7 and 52 2 respectively the gene abundances of serine o acetyltransferase and cysteine synthase increased by 63 4 and 54 4 respectively cysteine was primarily transformed to pyruvate and sulfide this study

plants xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xrd x ray diffractometer 1 introduction phosphorus p is a limited resource related to food supply yu et al 2021 it is a vital element for plant growth thus p fertilizers are extensively used in agriculture wang et al 2021a with the growing demand for food the consumption of non renewable phosphate rock which is the main source of p increases rapidly if no changes are made a p shortage crisis will occur before the end of this century cordell et al 2009 wu et al 2021 thus p recovery using secondary resource e g sewage sludge liu et al 2021 technologies is required for the recycling of p wilfert et al 2020 p as a nutrient pollutant present in domestic wastewater is primarily removed at municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps where chemical p removal with iron dosing is widely applied li et al 2020a this results in fe bound p compounds feps in the waste activated sludge was therefore feps bearing sludge feps was as p rich waste in wwtps is a potential p resource some methods have been used to release p from feps was acidification is one of the effective methods to dissolve p especially from the feps was ash after incineration quist jensen et al 2018 however the infrastructure costs are high prot et al 2020 acidogenic p recovery during anaerobic co fermentation of feps was and food waste can achieve a high p release efficiency 38 8 54 0 li et al 2018b dissimilatory iron reduction is also promoted during anaerobic fermentation and the resulting fe ii ps are easily dissolved however chemical acidification extraction and acidogenic co fermentation have two major drawbacks first heavy metal ions e g zn cd and ni in sludge can also be released from the solid phase to the liquid phase under an acidic condition especially a strong acidic condition quist jensen et al 2018 and the released metals can be incorporated into p recovery products struvite or vivianite in the following step lowering the quality of the products second in the subsequent step for p recovery as struvite or vivianite from the supernatant a large amount of alkaline reagents are required to adjust the ph resulting in a higher cost therefore it is essential to find a more environment friendly and cost effective technology to release p from feps was protein rich biomass prb can produce volatile fatty acids vfas during anaerobic fermentation shen et al 2017 yu et al 2018 at the same time a relatively large amount of ammonia can be produced and this could function as an alkaline substance for neutralization of vfas to increase the ph and also as a nitrogen source to form struvite for p recovery during post treatment in addition to abundant carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen prb also contains a certain amount of sulfur for example the sulfur content ranges from 0 3 to 0 5 in silkworms and soybeans alaswad et al 2021 ji et al 2016 sulfur in prb is primarily bound to amino acids cysteine and methionine during anaerobic fermentation sulfur amino acids can be degraded to produce sulfide liu and chen 2018 it has been reported that sulfide can react with feps to form fesx and release p from feps was wilfert et al 2020 therefore we assumed that co fermentation of feps was with prb had the potential to promote p release and p could be recovered as struvite subsequently from the supernatant rich p and ammonia however so far little is known about the effect of prb on p recovery from feps was a novel strategy for effective p release and recovery from feps was via co fermentation with prb is proposed in this study we hypothesize that the ph will not drop below 6 0 during co fermentation to prevent the release of metal ions and the sulfur in the prb will be transformed to sulfide that can react with feps to enhance p release by forming fesx the aim of this study is to examine this hypothesis first the performance of the anaerobic co fermentation of feps was with various prbs for p release and vfa production was investigated then the mechanism was explored using a chemical instrumental analysis and a metagenomics analysis finally the metabolic pathways of sulfur amino acids and acetogenesis were revealed in detail to clarify the fate of sulfur and carbon during co fermentation it is anticipated that an environment friendly approach for p recovery from feps was will be provided in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of feps was and prb two types of feps wass were used in this study to examine the hypothesis and verify the co fermentation performance one was from a laboratory reactor where nutrient removal was achieved using the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process without dosing any coagulants the excess sludge was collected from the reactor and concentrated by settling for 24 h at 4 c then fepo4 4h2o was added to the settled sludge to form the feps was the dosage of fepo4 4h2o was 73 1 mg fe g total suspended solid tss quist jensen et al 2018 another was obtained from a secondary sedimentation tank in a wwtp located in suzhou jiangsu province china where a ferric based chemical coagulant was added for p removal the wwtp sludge was filtered using an 18 mesh screen then it was concentrated by settling for 24 h at 4 c the initial properties of the lab was and the wwtp sludge prior to the co fermentation tests are summarized in table 1 four types of prbs silkworm chrysalis meal scm fish meal fm corn gluten meal cgm and soya bean meal sbm were purchased from the nanjing bangnuo biotechnology co ltd china scm and fm are by products of the silk reeling industry and the fish processing industry respectively belonging to animal prbs cgm and sbm are by products during corn starch production and soya bean oil extraction respectively belonging to plant prbs the prbs were crushed in a crusher and homogenized in a mortar they were then sieved using an 80 mesh screen the protein carbohydrate p s and ca contents of the prbs were measured 2 2 batch co fermentation tests batch experiments for the anaerobic co fermentation of the lab feps was with various prbs were conducted according to the following procedure first 450 ml of lab feps was was poured into a glass serum bottle 600 ml then one type of prb was added to the bottle all of the prbs were added at an equivalent total chemical oxygen demand tcod 0 8 g tcodprb g tcodsludge li et al 2018b and the corresponding doses of the scm fm cgm and sbm were 2 4 2 7 2 3 and 1 9 g respectively the sludge without the addition of any prb was considered as the control nitrogen gas was used to purge the remaining air in the bottles finally the bottles were immediately capped with rubber stoppers and placed in a thermostatic air bath shaker 35 1 c 200 rpm for seven days all of the bottles were sampled daily to measure the change in soluble chemical substances including orthophosphate po4 p fe ca mg ammonia nitrogen nh4 n vfas protein polysaccharide and fluorescence components to exclude the influence of p release from a prb anaerobic fermentation tests of each prb were conducted the experimental procedure was the same as the above anaerobic co fermentation experiment except that the lab feps was was replaced by deionized water to verify the co fermentation performance and further investigate the mechanism for p release the co fermentation tests using wwtp sludge rich in feps precipitates and the prbs were conducted 450 ml of the wwtp sludge rich in feps precipitates was poured into a glass serum bottle 600 ml according to the co fermentation results of the lab feps was with various prbs the prb with best performance was added at a dosage of 0 8 g tcodprb g tcodsludge and the corresponding dose of the scm was 5 7 g two control groups were set up one containing 450 ml of the wwtp sludge the other containing 450 ml of deionized water and the same amount of prb nitrogen gas was used to purge the remaining air in the bottles finally the bottles were immediately capped with rubber stoppers and placed in a thermostatic air bath shaker 35 1 c 200 rpm for seven days all of the bottles were sampled daily to measure the change in soluble chemical substances including po4 p fe ca s vfas and free amino acids 2 3 recovery of p from the co fermentation supernatant significant amounts of phosphate and ammonia existed in the co fermentation supernatant based on the concentration of po4 3 in the supernatant an external magnesium source mgcl2 6h2o was added at a po4 3 mg2 molar ratio of 1 1 1 to produce struvite according to our previous study ping et al 2016 and the mg2 contained in the supernatant was neglected in addition 1 mol l of naoh was used to adjust the ph to 8 5 followed by stirring for 30 min then the precipitates were collected by gravity settling the solid products were washed with deionized water and dried at 40 c 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 chemical analytical methods a portable ph meter 6010m jenco usa was used to measure the ph of the fermented sludge a tgl 16m refrigerated centrifuge cence china was used for centrifugation the sludge samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 c and 8000 rpm to obtain the separated supernatant

described in the supplementary material 2 4 2 metagenomics sequencing and bioinformatics analysis the metagenomics analysis was conducted for the co fermented sludge on day 7 an e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek usa was used to extract dna from each sample then the dna was sheared using a m220 focused ultrasonicator covaris usa to generate dna fragments of approximately 400 bp in length libraries were constructed using nextflex rapid dna seq bioo scientific and they were sequenced on an illumina novaseq 6000 see the supplementary material for details gene functions were annotated based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database using blastp and kobas 2 0 the significantly enriched pathways of the anaerobic fermentation were identified and the gene abundance related to enzymes in the metabolic pathways of the anaerobic fermentation was analyzed the raw datasets were deposited in the genome sequence archive at the national genomics data center with the accession number cra004503 2 4 3 statistical analysis all of the co fermentation tests were conducted in triplicate spss 25 software was used for the statistical analysis an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of the results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant the pearson correlation coefficient r was used to evaluate the correlation among the ph vfas and nh4 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition of the prbs the primary organic components of the four prbs were protein and carbohydrate fig 1 the carbohydrate contents in the scm cgm and sbm were similar accounting for 55 7 58 5 and 55 2 respectively while the protein contents accounted for 28 3 36 2 and 29 1 respectively the fm contained 27 8 carbohydrates and a much higher protein content 40 8 than the others the protein contents of these four prbs were all greater than 12 0 so they could be classified as protein rich substances nhc 2011 fish processing by products and trimmings are the primary ingredients in fm since these by products contain a large portion of bones rich in insoluble ca p compounds hydroxyapatite ytteborg et al 2016 the contents of ca and p in fm were much higher than those of the other prbs according to the high resolution p 2p spectra fig s1 the p species in the scm fm and sbm were inorganic phosphate while the p species in the cgm were h2po4 and organic p the peak at 133 1 ev in the p 2p spectra of the fm and the peaks at 347 1 and 350 6 ev in the high resolution ca 2p spectra of the fm fig s2 were attributed to ca3 po4 2 nh2o chusuei et al 1999 which is a poorly soluble mineral that is stable during anaerobic fermentation 3 2 co fermentation for p release and vfa production after co fermentation with prb the soluble po4 p increased significantly fig 2 a the soluble po4 p were 86 8 163 5 128 8 153 8 and 115 8 mg l in the control sample and the sludge samples with the scm fm cgm and sbm on day 7 respectively compared with the control sample the soluble po4 p increased by 88 3 48 4 77 2 and 33 4 in the sludge samples with the scm fm cgm and sbm on day 7 respectively the soluble po4 p in the sludge sample with the scm was the highest during co fermentation however p was not only released from the sludge according to the results of the anaerobic fermentation of sole prbs fig s3 the soluble po4 p released from the scm fm cgm and sbm were 26 3 44 7 0 4 and 13 0 mg l respectively after the soluble po4 p released from the prb was subtracted the soluble po4 p increased by 58 1 76 7 and 18 4 in the sludge samples with the scm cgm and sbm on day 7 respectively compared with the control sample while it decreased by 3 2 in the sludge sample with the fm on day 7 this indicates that co fermentation with the scm cgm and sbm could promote the release of p whereas the fm had no synergistic effect on p release from the feps was the solubility of p precipitates e g feps is significantly affected by ph fe ii compounds which are the reduced products of fe iii compounds by iron reducing microorganisms were abundant in the fermented sludge over 83 4 of the total fe was in the form of solid fe ii i e vivianite after 7 days of co fermentation fig s4 and fig 2d fe ii compounds have a much higher solubility than fe iii compounds li et al 2018b it has been reported that the lower the ph in the range of 5 7 the higher the solubility of fe ii compounds li et al 2018a as shown in fig 2b the ph in the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm dropped to 5 3 and 5 4 within the first four days respectively thus fe ii dissolved and p was released in the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm within the first four days fig 2c in the sludge sample with the sbm soluble fe ii would reprecipitate with po4 p during the ph increase stage 5 7 days resulting in a decrease of soluble po4 p in addition the trend of soluble ca and mg was consistent with that of the soluble po4 p and fe ii in the sludge sample with the sbm fig s5 indicating that soluble po4 p might also interact with ca and mg to form amorphous ca p and mg p precipitates during anaerobic fermentation zhang et al 2021 in the sludge sample with the scm soluble ca gradually declined to 2 6 mg l day 7 and soluble mg reached a peak value on day 3 41 7 mg l and then dropped slightly this was beneficial for p recovery from the supernatant in the form of high quality struvite hydrolysis and acidogenesis were the two main stages during the co fermentation soluble proteins and polysaccharides increased during the hydrolysis stage and the content of proteins was much higher than that of polysaccharides fig s6 the maximum soluble protein 424 7 mg l was obtained in the sludge sample with the scm and it was 7 8 times that of the control sludge this indicates that the particulate organics in the scm were more susceptible to hydrolyzation and protein was the primary soluble organic matter to further evaluate the soluble organic matter 3d eem spectra combined with a parafac analysis were conducted fig s7 a four component model was appropriate which was indicated by the residual analysis and the split half analysis fig s8 components 1 2 3 and 4 c1 c2 c3 and c4 represented the tryptophan like protein like tyrosine like and humic like substances respectively fig s9 and table s1 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax that reflects the relative concentrations of these components is shown in fig 3 in the sludge samples with the scm and fm both the biodegradable substances tryptophan like protein like and tyrosine like and recalcitrant substances humic like increased significantly in the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm tryptophan like substances were the primary fluorescent organic matter this indicates that more fluorescent substances could be produced with the addition of the scm and fm in addition the faster reduction rate of fe iii in the sludge sample with the scm fig s4b might have been related to the abundant humic like substances because the reduction rates of poorly soluble fe iii minerals can be increased by humic like substances piepenbrock et al 2014 the sufficient biodegradable organic matter was utilized by microorganisms for vfa production during the acidogenesis stage in the co fermentation systems the vfa production increased significantly fig 4 moreover acetic acid and propionic acid were the dominant vfa products compared with the control sample the vfa yield 2938 8 mg cod l in the sludge sample with the scm increased by 5 3 times on day 7 which was the highest of all the tests in addition nh4 n was 440 9 mg l on day 7 in the sludge sample with the scm which was much higher than those in the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm fig s6b free ammonia was low 3 9 mg l fig s6d in all the samples and had no significant effect on the anaerobic fermentation luo et al 2020 in this study protein was the primary substrate utilized by microorganisms when protein was degraded into vfas nh4 n was also produced the correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between vfas and nh4 n p 0 01 r 0 819 and a significant negative correlation between vfas nh4 n and ph p 0 01 r 0 780 table s2 indicating that the contents of the vfas and nh4 n had an important influence on ph for the control sample and the sludge samples with the scm fm cgm and sbm on day 7 the values of vfas nh4 n were 5 9 6 7 5 6 13 7 and 11 4 respectively the sludge samples with the scm and fm had lower vfas nh4 n ratios compared with the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm so that they had higher ph than the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm fig 2b in addition the acetic acid yield reached a peak value on day 4 in the sludge sample with the sbm and then apparently dropped fig 4 this may have been the primary factor for the ph increase in the sludge sample with the sbm fig 2b overall the above results suggest that the co fermentation of lab feps was with the scm promoted p release and vfa production similar results were obtained in the co fermentation tests of the feps bearing wwtp sludge with the scm fig s10 further confirming the potential application of this strategy for enhancing p release and vfa production 3 3 mechanisms for p release and vfa production the chemical forms of c in prbs were determined using xps the peaks at 284 8 286 4 288 0 and 289 2 ev in the high resolution c 1s spectra fig s11 were attributed to c c c h c o c n c o and coor respectively dai et al 2020 among the four prbs the highest content of c c c h 83 4 and the lowest content of c o 2 6 were found in the scm table s3 indicating a stronger nonpolar surface dai et al 2020 the result is well supported by atr ftir and water contact angle measurement fig 5 a and 5b the atr ftir spectra primarily indicate hydrocarbon 3282 2926 and 2854 cm 1 and protein 1644 1539 and 1398 cm 1 you et al 2017 the information about protein secondary structures was obtained from the derivative spectra in the amide i band 1700 1600 cm 1 that was obtained using curve fitting based on the known structure of the protein and peptide models li et al 2020c you et al 2017 the fitting results show that the value of the α helix β sheet random coil was in the order of scm fm cgm sbm fig 5c f and table 2 the low ratio of α helix β sheet random coil means a loose structure of the protein molecule li et al 2020c therefore hydrophobic groups or sites in the scm protein were exposed to the environment easily resulting in the relatively strong hydrophobicity of the surface the larger contact angle of the scm confirms the above result fig 5b strong hydrophobicity is unfavorable to the generation of a hydration layer that can cut off the direct contact between substances and hinder chemical interactions on the surface of the scm yong et al 2019 this suggests rich interaction sites at the protein surface of the scm that would be easily accessed and hydrolyzed by microorganisms the sem images show that the scm had a rough and porous surface the fm had a dense surface and looked like irregular particles tightly gathered together the surface morphologies of the cgm and sbm were in between those of the scm and fm fig 6 this further confirms that the scm was more easily broken down compared with the other three types of prbs therefore both the p release and vfa production were the highest in the co fermentation system with the scm the mechanism of p release during the co fermentation with scm was further explored amino acids were important intermediates in protein fermentation proline tyrosine cysteine and phenylalanine were detected in the co fermentation system with the scm fig s12 cysteine is a sulfur amino acid it can not only improve the activity of acetate kinase and coa transferase key enzymes of vfa production but can also generate sulfide through self degradation liu and chen 2018 the measurement results of the soluble total s fig 7 a show that a phase transfer of s occurred and the products could be fesx precipitates and h2s gas wilfert et al 2020 according to the p species analysis for the sludge sample with the scm after 7 days of co fermentation fig 7b di p na2s p and organic p decreased by 10 6 12 3 and 9 5 respectively this result indicates that p was released from weakly adsorbed p feps and organic p therefore p release from feps was promoted with the addition of the scm the relative content of fes 161 9 ev skinner et al 2004 in the sludge sample with the scm 8 8 was much higher than that in the control sample 4 3 fig 7c these results suggest that feps reacted with sulfide forming fes and releasing p wilfert et al 2020 3 4 metabolic pathways of the major processes during co fermentation amino acid degradation sulfate reduction acetogenesis and methanogenesis were the major processes during the co fermentation of the lab feps was with the prb the related metabolic pathways are shown in fig 8 and their corresponding gene abundances are summarized in table s4 phosphate acetyltransferase enzyme commission ec number 2 3 1 8 and acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 were the key enzymes in the acetate metabolism liu and chen 2018 compared with the control sample the gene abundances of phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase were all significantly increased due to co fermentation with the prbs the maximum increase in the gene abundances 117 7 for phosphate acetyltransferase and 52 2 for acetate kinase was obtained in the sludge sample with the scm which agreed with the results of the vfa production in the cysteine metabolism the gene abundances of serine o acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 30 and cysteine synthase ec 2 5 1 47 which are related to cysteine synthesis increased by 63 4 and 54 4 respectively and the gene abundances of transaminase a ec 2 6 1 1 and 3 mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase ec 2 8 1 2 which are related to cysteine degradation decreased by 5 8 and 32 0 respectively in the sludge sample with the scm compared with the control sample this might facilitate the production of cysteine but cysteine was still effectively degraded from the 3rd day of co fermentation fig 7a the gene abundance of cysteine dioxygenase ec 1 13 11 20 was very low in the all samples because the catalytic reaction requires oxygen joseph and maroney 2007 thus cysteine was primarily transformed to pyruvate and h2s in the methionine degradation metabolism methionine was primarily transformed to homocysteine and methanethiol and the gene abundances of related enzymes ec 4 4 1 11 2 5 1 6 2 1 1 37 and 3 3 1 1 were increased by co fermentation with the prb especially the scm in addition homocysteine can be further transformed to cysteine cao et al 2020 followed by cysteine metabolism in the sulfur metabolism sulfate was reduced to sulfide less obvious changes were found in the gene abundances of related enzymes due to the low sulfate content in this study sulfide s2 hs and h2s generated by the degradation of s containing substances was transferred to the outside of the cell and could then react with extracellular feps to form fes and promote p release in the methane metabolism the generation of methane is directly affected by the activity of methyl coenzyme m reductase ec 2 8 4 1 of methanogen wang et al 2021b the data in table s4 reveal that the gene numbers of methyl coenzyme m reductase were 4 182 176 70 and 332 in the control sample and the sludge samples with the scm fm cgm and sbm respectively compared with the control sample the gene abundance of methyl coenzyme m reductase increased by 44 5 43 0 16 5 and 82 0 times in the sludge samples with the scm fm cgm and sbm respectively indicating co fermentation with prb might enhance the activity of methanogenesis 3 5 recovery of p from the co fermentation supernatant after adding mg to the co fermentation supernatant of the lab feps was with scm for p recovery as struvite the precipitates were characterized using sem xrd atr ftir and raman as shown in fig 9 the sem image indicates that the solid particles had tectiform morphology li et al 2020b the xrd analysis clearly shows that the precipitate was struvite the atr ftir spectrum shows that the peaks at 3220 and 1630 cm 1 were the o h stretching and bending vibrations of water molecules respectively polat and sayan 2020 the peak at 2349 cm 1 was the o h bond between po4 3 and h2o zin et al 2020 the peak at 878 cm 1 was the o h bond between nh4 and h2o zin et al 2020 the peak at 752 cm 1 was the o h bond between h2o and h2o zin et al 2020 the peaks at 2917 and 1435 cm 1 were the n h symmetric stretching and asymmetric bending vibrations of nh4 respectively li et al 2020b the peak at 990 cm 1 was the stretching vibration of po4 3 polat and sayan 2020 the raman spectrum shows that the peaks at 565 and 944 cm 1 were the antisymmetric bending and symmetric stretching vibrations of po4 3 respectively liao et al 2020 the peaks at 183 and 295 cm 1 were the o mg o bending and stretching vibrations respectively liao et al 2020 the peaks at 455 and 992 cm 1 were attributed to magnesium phosphate ping et al 2016 the atr ftir and raman results indicate that the primary ions or molecules in the precipitates were mg2 nh4 po4 3 and h2o according to the struvite purity analysis 90 2 of the precipitates were struvite ca cd cr cu fe ni pb and zn were not detected and the molar ratio of nh4 po4 3 mg2 k was 1 1 11 1 18 0 01 indicating that the primary impurity was magnesium phosphate after the precipitation for p recovery the concentrations of vfas po4 p and nh4 n in the supernatant were decreased by 3 8 80 4 and 12 2 respectively and the weight ratio of the remaining vfas nh4 n po4 p was 88 12 1 fig s13 the remaining supernatant had a too high concentration of nh4 n to be directly used as an economical carbon source for nutrient removal in wwtps therefore a further process for nh4 n removal was required based on previous studies the high concentration of nh4 n can be effectively removed by anammox driessen et al 2020 kartal et al 2010 or ammonia stripping guštin and marinšek logar 2011 then the remaining supernatant can be used as an economical carbon source for nutrient removal in wwtps mass balance analysis was performed for p n and mg throughout the anaerobic co fermentation of feps was with scm and the p recovery processes based on the lab experiments as shown in fig 10 in the anaerobic fermenter the overall p release efficiency was 52 0 and approximately 48 3 of p was released from the feps was which was comparable to the acidogenic co fermentation of feps was with rice 38 8 58 6 li and li 2017 li et al 2018b in the subsequent step for p recovery 80 4 of p in the supernatant was recovered as struvite the overall p recovery efficiency from the feps was and the scm was 41 8 whilst 10 2 of p was remained in the supernatant and 48 0 of p was in the residual biosolids the anaerobic co fermentation of feps was with prb is an environment friendly approach for p release and is beneficial to save the operation costs of subsequent p recovery as struvite however there are still some challenges for the potential large scale operation of the co fermentation process with prb first scm as a by product of the silk reeling industry is a sulfur containing protein biomass waste and is suitable for co fermentation with feps was for p recovery but it is only easily available in large quantities in areas where sericulture is developed further research is required to find a universal sulfur rich protein biomass waste and the optimal co fermentation conditions to improve p recovery efficiency from the feps was second heavy metals have great impact on the quality of struvite and its further use it is necessary and meaningful to investigate the fate of heavy metals in the sludge during the anaerobic co fermentation of feps was with prb in the following work 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that co fermentation of feps was with prb could enhance p release and vfa production prbs with strong surface hydrophobicity and loose structure favored the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes compared with the control the soluble po4 p and vfas increased by 88 3 and 531 3 respectively in the co fermentation system with scm the gene abundances of phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase which were key enzymes in the acetate metabolism increased by 117 7 and 52 2 respectively the gene abundances of serine o acetyltransferase and cysteine synthase increased by 63 4 and 54 4 respectively cysteine was the important intermediate and it was primarily transformed to pyruvate and sulfide which could react with feps to form fes and promote p release in addition the ph was maintained near neutral due to a relatively greater amount of nh4 n production that also provided a sufficient nitrogen resource for the following p recovery as struvite a neutral ph not only prevented the dissolution of metal ions but also reduced the amount of naoh used in the p recovery process with the addition of magnesium salt and a ph adjustment to 8 5 struvite precipitates with a purity of 90 2 were obtained the remaining supernatant after further nitrogen removal could be used as an economical carbon source for nutrient removal in wwtps these findings suggest that co fermentation of feps was and sulfur rich protein biomass waste is a potential method to improve p recovery and vfa production efficiency this can also achieve the simultaneous recovery of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus resources this study

15974,a novel approach for the enhancement of phosphorus p recovery from fe bound p compounds feps bearing sludge by co fermentation with protein rich biomass prb is reported four prbs silkworm chrysalis meal fish meal corn gluten meal and soya bean meal were used for co fermentation the results revealed that prbs with strong surface hydrophobicity and loose structure favored the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes sulfide produced by prb could react with feps to form fes and promote p release due to the neutralization of volatile fatty acids vfas by a relatively high concentration of ammonia the ph was maintained near neutral and thus prevented the dissolution of metal ions e g fe and ca this was beneficial to save the cost of subsequent p recovery and form high purity struvite compared with the control the soluble orthophosphate and vfas increased by 88 3 and 531 3 respectively in the co fermentation system with silkworm chrysalis meal cysteine was the important intermediate the metagenomics analysis indicated that the gene abundances of phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase which were key enzymes in the acetate metabolism increased by 117 7 and 52 2 respectively the gene abundances of serine o acetyltransferase and cysteine synthase increased by 63 4 and 54 4 respectively cysteine was primarily transformed to pyruvate and sulfide this study

plants xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xrd x ray diffractometer 1 introduction phosphorus p is a limited resource related to food supply yu et al 2021 it is a vital element for plant growth thus p fertilizers are extensively used in agriculture wang et al 2021a with the growing demand for food the consumption of non renewable phosphate rock which is the main source of p increases rapidly if no changes are made a p shortage crisis will occur before the end of this century cordell et al 2009 wu et al 2021 thus p recovery using secondary resource e g sewage sludge liu et al 2021 technologies is required for the recycling of p wilfert et al 2020 p as a nutrient pollutant present in domestic wastewater is primarily removed at municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps where chemical p removal with iron dosing is widely applied li et al 2020a this results in fe bound p compounds feps in the waste activated sludge was therefore feps bearing sludge feps was as p rich waste in wwtps is a potential p resource some methods have been used to release p from feps was acidification is one of the effective methods to dissolve p especially from the feps was ash after incineration quist jensen et al 2018 however the infrastructure costs are high prot et al 2020 acidogenic p recovery during anaerobic co fermentation of feps was and food waste can achieve a high p release efficiency 38 8 54 0 li et al 2018b dissimilatory iron reduction is also promoted during anaerobic fermentation and the resulting fe ii ps are easily dissolved however chemical acidification extraction and acidogenic co fermentation have two major drawbacks first heavy metal ions e g zn cd and ni in sludge can also be released from the solid phase to the liquid phase under an acidic condition especially a strong acidic condition quist jensen et al 2018 and the released metals can be incorporated into p recovery products struvite or vivianite in the following step lowering the quality of the products second in the subsequent step for p recovery as struvite or vivianite from the supernatant a large amount of alkaline reagents are required to adjust the ph resulting in a higher cost therefore it is essential to find a more environment friendly and cost effective technology to release p from feps was protein rich biomass prb can produce volatile fatty acids vfas during anaerobic fermentation shen et al 2017 yu et al 2018 at the same time a relatively large amount of ammonia can be produced and this could function as an alkaline substance for neutralization of vfas to increase the ph and also as a nitrogen source to form struvite for p recovery during post treatment in addition to abundant carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen prb also contains a certain amount of sulfur for example the sulfur content ranges from 0 3 to 0 5 in silkworms and soybeans alaswad et al 2021 ji et al 2016 sulfur in prb is primarily bound to amino acids cysteine and methionine during anaerobic fermentation sulfur amino acids can be degraded to produce sulfide liu and chen 2018 it has been reported that sulfide can react with feps to form fesx and release p from feps was wilfert et al 2020 therefore we assumed that co fermentation of feps was with prb had the potential to promote p release and p could be recovered as struvite subsequently from the supernatant rich p and ammonia however so far little is known about the effect of prb on p recovery from feps was a novel strategy for effective p release and recovery from feps was via co fermentation with prb is proposed in this study we hypothesize that the ph will not drop below 6 0 during co fermentation to prevent the release of metal ions and the sulfur in the prb will be transformed to sulfide that can react with feps to enhance p release by forming fesx the aim of this study is to examine this hypothesis first the performance of the anaerobic co fermentation of feps was with various prbs for p release and vfa production was investigated then the mechanism was explored using a chemical instrumental analysis and a metagenomics analysis finally the metabolic pathways of sulfur amino acids and acetogenesis were revealed in detail to clarify the fate of sulfur and carbon during co fermentation it is anticipated that an environment friendly approach for p recovery from feps was will be provided in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of feps was and prb two types of feps wass were used in this study to examine the hypothesis and verify the co fermentation performance one was from a laboratory reactor where nutrient removal was achieved using the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process without dosing any coagulants the excess sludge was collected from the reactor and concentrated by settling for 24 h at 4 c then fepo4 4h2o was added to the settled sludge to form the feps was the dosage of fepo4 4h2o was 73 1 mg fe g total suspended solid tss quist jensen et al 2018 another was obtained from a secondary sedimentation tank in a wwtp located in suzhou jiangsu province china where a ferric based chemical coagulant was added for p removal the wwtp sludge was filtered using an 18 mesh screen then it was concentrated by settling for 24 h at 4 c the initial properties of the lab was and the wwtp sludge prior to the co fermentation tests are summarized in table 1 four types of prbs silkworm chrysalis meal scm fish meal fm corn gluten meal cgm and soya bean meal sbm were purchased from the nanjing bangnuo biotechnology co ltd china scm and fm are by products of the silk

2018b and the corresponding doses of the scm fm cgm and sbm were 2 4 2 7 2 3 and 1 9 g respectively the sludge without the addition of any prb was considered as the control nitrogen gas was used to purge the remaining air in the bottles finally the bottles were immediately capped with rubber stoppers and placed in a thermostatic air bath shaker 35 1 c 200 rpm for seven days all of the bottles were sampled daily to measure the change in soluble chemical substances including orthophosphate po4 p fe ca mg ammonia nitrogen nh4 n vfas protein polysaccharide and fluorescence components to exclude the influence of p release from a prb anaerobic fermentation tests of each prb were conducted the experimental procedure was the same as the above anaerobic co fermentation experiment except that the lab feps was was replaced by deionized water to verify the co fermentation performance and further investigate the mechanism for p release the co fermentation tests using wwtp sludge rich in feps precipitates and the prbs were conducted 450 ml of the wwtp sludge rich in feps precipitates was poured into a glass serum bottle 600 ml according to the co fermentation results of the lab feps was with various prbs the prb with best performance was added at a dosage of 0 8 g tcodprb g tcodsludge and the corresponding dose of the scm was 5 7 g two control groups were set up one containing 450 ml of the wwtp sludge the other containing 450 ml of deionized water and the same amount of prb nitrogen gas was used to purge the remaining air in the bottles finally the bottles were immediately capped with rubber stoppers and placed in a thermostatic air bath shaker 35 1 c 200 rpm for seven days all of the bottles were sampled daily to measure the change in soluble chemical substances

nh4 n 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition of the prbs the primary organic components of the four prbs were protein and carbohydrate fig 1 the carbohydrate contents in the scm cgm and sbm were similar accounting for 55 7 58 5 and 55 2 respectively while the protein contents accounted for 28 3 36 2 and 29 1 respectively the fm contained 27 8 carbohydrates and a much higher protein content 40 8 than the others the protein contents of these four prbs were all greater than 12 0 so they could be classified as protein rich substances nhc 2011 fish processing by products and trimmings are the primary ingredients in fm since these by products contain a large portion of bones rich in insoluble ca p compounds hydroxyapatite ytteborg et al 2016 the contents of ca and p in fm were much higher

soluble po4 p increased by 88 3 48 4 77 2 and 33 4 in the sludge samples with the scm fm cgm and sbm on day 7 respectively the soluble po4 p in the sludge sample with the scm was the highest during co fermentation however p was not only released from the sludge according to the results of the anaerobic fermentation of sole prbs fig s3 the soluble po4 p released from the scm fm cgm and sbm were 26 3 44 7 0 4 and 13 0 mg l respectively after the soluble po4 p released from the prb was subtracted the soluble po4 p increased by 58 1 76 7 and 18 4 in the sludge samples with the scm cgm and sbm on day 7 respectively compared with the control sample while it decreased by 3 2 in the sludge sample with the fm on day 7 this indicates that co fermentation with the scm cgm and sbm could promote the release of p whereas the fm had no synergistic effect on p release from the feps was the solubility of p precipitates e g feps is significantly affected by ph fe ii compounds which are the reduced products of fe iii compounds by iron reducing microorganisms were abundant in the fermented sludge over 83 4 of the total fe was in the form of solid fe ii i e vivianite after 7 days of co fermentation fig s4 and fig 2d fe ii compounds have a much higher solubility than fe iii compounds li et al 2018b it has been reported that the lower the ph in the range of 5 7 the higher the solubility of fe ii compounds li et al 2018a as shown in fig 2b the ph in the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm dropped to 5 3 and 5 4 within the first four days respectively thus fe ii dissolved and p was released in the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm within the first four days fig 2c in the sludge sample with the sbm soluble fe ii would reprecipitate with po4 p during the ph increase stage 5 7 days resulting in a decrease of soluble po4 p in addition the trend of soluble ca and mg was consistent with that of the soluble po4 p and fe ii in the sludge sample with the sbm fig s5 indicating that soluble po4 p might also interact with ca and mg to form amorphous ca p and mg p precipitates during anaerobic fermentation zhang et al 2021 in the sludge sample with the scm soluble ca gradually declined to 2 6 mg l day 7 and soluble mg reached a peak value on day 3 41 7 mg l and then dropped slightly this was beneficial for p recovery from the supernatant in the form of high quality struvite hydrolysis and acidogenesis were the two main stages during the co fermentation soluble proteins and polysaccharides increased during the hydrolysis stage and the content of proteins was much higher than that of polysaccharides fig s6 the maximum soluble protein 424 7 mg l was obtained in the sludge sample with the scm and it was 7 8 times that of the control sludge this indicates that the particulate organics in the scm were more susceptible to hydrolyzation and protein was the primary soluble organic matter to further evaluate the soluble organic matter 3d eem spectra combined with a parafac analysis were conducted fig s7 a four component model was appropriate which was indicated by the residual analysis and the split half analysis fig s8 components 1 2 3 and 4 c1 c2 c3 and c4 represented the tryptophan like protein like tyrosine like and humic like substances respectively fig s9 and table s1 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax that reflects the relative concentrations of these components is shown in fig 3 in the sludge samples with the scm and fm both the biodegradable substances tryptophan like protein like and tyrosine like and recalcitrant substances humic like increased significantly in the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm tryptophan like substances were the primary fluorescent organic matter this indicates that more fluorescent substances could be produced with the addition of the scm and fm in addition the faster reduction rate of fe iii in the sludge sample with the scm fig s4b might have been related to the abundant humic like substances because the reduction rates of poorly soluble fe iii minerals can be increased by humic like substances piepenbrock et al 2014 the sufficient biodegradable organic matter was utilized by microorganisms for vfa production during the acidogenesis stage in the co fermentation systems the vfa production increased significantly fig 4 moreover acetic acid and propionic acid were the dominant vfa products compared with the control sample the vfa yield 2938 8 mg cod l in the sludge sample with the scm increased by 5 3 times on day 7 which was the highest of all the tests in addition nh4 n was 440 9 mg l on day 7 in the sludge sample with the scm which was much higher than those in the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm fig s6b free ammonia was low 3 9 mg l fig s6d in all the samples and had no significant effect on the anaerobic fermentation luo et al 2020 in this study protein was the primary substrate utilized by microorganisms when protein was degraded into vfas nh4 n was also produced the correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between vfas and nh4 n p 0 01 r 0 819 and a significant negative correlation between vfas nh4 n and ph p 0 01 r 0 780 table s2 indicating that the contents of the vfas and nh4 n had an important influence on ph for the control sample and the sludge samples with the scm fm cgm and sbm on day 7 the values of vfas nh4 n were 5 9 6 7 5 6 13 7 and 11 4 respectively the sludge samples with the scm and fm had lower vfas nh4 n ratios compared with the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm so that they had higher ph than the sludge samples with the cgm and sbm fig 2b in addition the acetic acid yield reached a peak value on day 4 in the sludge sample with the sbm and then apparently dropped fig 4 this may have been the primary factor for the ph increase in the sludge sample with the sbm fig 2b overall the above results suggest that the co fermentation of lab feps was with the scm promoted p release and vfa production similar results were obtained in the co fermentation tests of the feps bearing wwtp sludge with the scm fig s10 further confirming the potential application of this strategy for enhancing p release and vfa production 3 3 mechanisms for p release and vfa production the chemical forms of c in prbs were determined using xps the peaks at 284 8 286 4 288 0 and 289 2 ev in the high resolution c 1s spectra fig s11 were attributed to c c c h c o c n c o and coor respectively dai et al 2020 among the four prbs the highest content of c c c h 83 4 and the lowest content of c o 2 6 were found in the scm table s3 indicating a stronger nonpolar surface dai et al 2020 the result is well supported by atr ftir and water contact angle measurement fig 5 a and 5b the atr ftir spectra primarily indicate hydrocarbon 3282 2926 and 2854 cm 1 and protein 1644 1539 and 1398 cm 1 you et al 2017 the information about protein secondary structures was obtained from the derivative spectra in the amide i band 1700 1600 cm 1 that was obtained using curve fitting based on the known structure of the protein and peptide models li et al 2020c you et al 2017 the fitting results show that the value of the α helix β sheet random coil was in the order of scm fm cgm sbm fig 5c f and table 2 the low ratio of α helix β sheet random coil means a loose structure of the protein molecule li et al 2020c therefore hydrophobic groups or sites in the scm protein were exposed to the environment easily resulting in the relatively strong hydrophobicity of the surface the larger contact angle of the scm confirms the above result fig 5b strong hydrophobicity is unfavorable to the generation of a hydration layer that can cut off the direct contact between substances and hinder chemical interactions on the surface of the scm yong et al 2019 this suggests rich interaction sites at the protein surface of the scm that would be easily accessed and hydrolyzed by microorganisms the sem images show that the scm had a rough and porous surface the fm had a dense surface and looked like irregular particles tightly gathered together the surface morphologies of the cgm and sbm were in between those of the scm and fm fig 6 this further confirms that the scm was more easily broken down compared with the other three types of prbs therefore both the p release and vfa production were the highest in the co fermentation system with the scm the mechanism of p release during the co fermentation with scm was further explored amino acids were important intermediates in protein fermentation proline tyrosine cysteine and phenylalanine were detected in the co fermentation system with the scm fig s12 cysteine is a sulfur amino acid it can not only improve the activity of acetate kinase and coa transferase key enzymes of vfa production but can also generate sulfide through self degradation liu and chen 2018 the measurement results of the soluble total s fig 7 a show that a phase transfer of s occurred and the products could be fesx precipitates and h2s gas wilfert et al 2020 according to the p species analysis for the sludge sample with the scm after 7 days of co fermentation fig 7b di p na2s p and organic p decreased by 10 6 12 3 and 9 5 respectively this result indicates that p was released from weakly adsorbed p feps and organic p therefore p release from feps was promoted with the addition of the scm the relative content of fes 161 9 ev skinner et al 2004 in the sludge sample with the scm 8 8 was much higher than that in the control sample 4 3 fig 7c these results suggest that feps reacted with sulfide forming fes and releasing p wilfert et al 2020 3 4 metabolic pathways of the major processes during co fermentation amino acid degradation sulfate reduction acetogenesis and methanogenesis were the major processes during the co fermentation of the lab feps was with the prb the related metabolic pathways are shown in fig 8 and their corresponding gene abundances are summarized in table s4 phosphate acetyltransferase enzyme commission ec number 2 3 1 8 and acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 were the key enzymes in the acetate metabolism liu and chen 2018 compared with the control sample the gene abundances of phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase were all significantly increased due to co fermentation with the prbs the maximum increase in the gene abundances 117 7 for phosphate acetyltransferase and 52 2 for acetate kinase was obtained in the sludge sample with the scm which agreed with the results of the vfa production in the cysteine metabolism the gene abundances of serine o acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 30 and cysteine synthase ec 2 5 1 47 which are related to cysteine synthesis increased by 63 4 and 54 4 respectively and the gene abundances of transaminase a ec 2 6 1 1 and 3 mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase ec 2 8 1 2 which are related to cysteine degradation decreased by 5 8 and 32 0 respectively in the sludge sample with the scm compared with the control sample this might facilitate the production of cysteine but cysteine was still effectively degraded from the 3rd day of co fermentation fig 7a the gene abundance of cysteine dioxygenase ec 1 13 11 20 was very low in the all samples because the catalytic reaction requires oxygen joseph and maroney 2007 thus cysteine was primarily transformed to pyruvate and h2s in the methionine degradation metabolism methionine was primarily transformed to homocysteine and methanethiol and the gene abundances of related enzymes ec 4 4 1 11 2 5 1 6 2 1 1 37 and 3 3 1 1 were increased by co fermentation with the prb especially the scm in addition homocysteine can be further transformed to cysteine cao et al 2020 followed by cysteine metabolism in the sulfur metabolism sulfate was reduced to sulfide less obvious changes were found in the gene abundances of related enzymes due to the low sulfate content in this study sulfide s2 hs and h2s generated by the degradation of s containing substances was transferred to the outside of the cell and could then react with extracellular feps to form fes and promote p release in the methane metabolism the generation of methane is directly affected by the activity of methyl coenzyme m reductase ec 2 8 4 1 of methanogen wang et al 2021b the data in table s4 reveal that the gene numbers of methyl coenzyme m reductase were 4 182 176 70 and 332 in the control sample and the sludge samples with the scm fm cgm and sbm respectively compared with the control sample the gene abundance of methyl coenzyme m reductase increased by 44 5 43 0 16 5 and 82 0 times in the sludge samples with the scm fm cgm and sbm respectively indicating co fermentation with prb might enhance the activity of methanogenesis 3 5 recovery of p from the co fermentation supernatant after adding mg to the co fermentation supernatant of the lab feps was with scm for p recovery as struvite the precipitates were characterized using sem xrd atr ftir and raman as shown in fig 9 the sem image indicates that the solid particles had tectiform morphology li et al 2020b the xrd analysis clearly shows that the precipitate was struvite the atr ftir spectrum shows that the peaks at 3220 and 1630 cm 1 were the o h stretching and bending vibrations of water molecules respectively polat and sayan 2020 the peak at 2349 cm 1 was the o h bond between po4 3 and h2o zin et al 2020 the peak at 878 cm 1 was the o h bond between nh4 and h2o zin et al 2020 the peak at 752 cm 1 was the o h bond between h2o and h2o zin et al 2020 the peaks at 2917 and 1435 cm 1 were the n h symmetric stretching and asymmetric bending vibrations of nh4 respectively li et al 2020b the peak at 990 cm 1 was the stretching vibration of po4 3 polat and sayan 2020 the raman spectrum shows that the peaks at 565 and 944 cm 1 were the antisymmetric bending and symmetric stretching vibrations of po4 3 respectively liao et al 2020 the peaks at 183 and 295 cm 1 were the o mg o bending and stretching vibrations respectively liao et al 2020 the peaks at 455 and 992 cm 1 were attributed to magnesium phosphate ping et al 2016 the atr ftir and raman results indicate that the primary ions or molecules in the precipitates were mg2 nh4 po4 3 and h2o according to the struvite purity analysis 90 2 of the precipitates were struvite ca cd cr cu fe ni pb and zn were not detected and the molar ratio of nh4 po4 3 mg2 k was 1 1 11 1 18 0 01 indicating that the primary impurity was magnesium phosphate after the precipitation for p recovery the concentrations of vfas po4 p and nh4 n in the supernatant were decreased by 3 8 80 4 and 12 2 respectively and the weight ratio of the remaining vfas nh4 n po4 p was 88 12 1 fig s13 the remaining supernatant had a too high concentration of nh4 n to be directly used as an economical carbon source for nutrient removal in wwtps therefore a further process for nh4 n removal was required based on previous studies the high concentration of nh4 n can be effectively removed by anammox driessen et al 2020 kartal et al 2010 or ammonia stripping guštin and marinšek logar 2011 then the remaining supernatant can be used as an economical carbon source for nutrient removal in wwtps mass balance analysis was performed for p n and mg throughout the anaerobic co fermentation of feps was with scm and the p recovery processes based on the lab experiments as shown in fig 10 in the anaerobic fermenter the overall p release efficiency was 52 0 and approximately 48 3 of p was released from the feps was which was comparable to the acidogenic co fermentation of feps was with rice 38 8 58 6 li and li 2017 li et al 2018b in the subsequent step for p recovery 80 4 of p in the supernatant was recovered as struvite the overall p recovery efficiency from the feps was and the scm was 41 8 whilst 10 2 of p was remained in the supernatant and 48 0 of p was in the residual biosolids the anaerobic co fermentation of feps was with prb is an environment friendly approach for p release and is beneficial to save the operation costs of subsequent p recovery as struvite however there are still some challenges for the potential large scale operation of the co fermentation process with prb first scm as a by product of the silk reeling industry is a sulfur containing protein biomass waste and is suitable for co fermentation with feps was for p recovery but it is only easily available in large quantities in areas where sericulture is developed further research is required to find a universal sulfur rich protein biomass waste and the optimal co fermentation conditions to improve p recovery efficiency from the feps was second heavy metals have great impact on the quality of struvite and its further use it is necessary and meaningful to investigate the fate of heavy metals in the sludge during the anaerobic co fermentation of feps was with prb in the following work 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that co fermentation of feps was with prb could enhance p release and vfa production prbs with strong surface hydrophobicity and loose structure favored the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes compared with the control the soluble po4 p and vfas increased by 88 3 and 531 3 respectively in the co fermentation system with scm the gene abundances of phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase which were key enzymes in the acetate metabolism increased by 117 7 and 52 2 respectively the gene abundances of serine o acetyltransferase and cysteine synthase increased by 63 4 and 54 4 respectively cysteine was the important intermediate and it was primarily transformed to pyruvate and sulfide which could react with feps to form fes and promote p release in addition the ph was maintained near neutral due to a relatively greater amount of nh4 n production that also provided a sufficient nitrogen resource for the following p recovery as struvite a neutral ph not only prevented the dissolution of metal ions but also reduced the amount of naoh used in the p recovery process with the addition of magnesium salt and a ph adjustment to 8 5 struvite precipitates with a purity of 90 2 were obtained the remaining supernatant after further nitrogen removal could be used as an economical carbon source for nutrient removal in wwtps these findings suggest that co fermentation of feps was and sulfur rich protein biomass waste is a potential method to improve p recovery and vfa production efficiency this can also achieve the simultaneous recovery of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus resources this study
