10425,rapidly changing hydrological conditions under climate change upstream developments and local water infrastructures require transformative changes in water management strategies for the agriculture sector in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd for more than three decades the agricultural policies in vietnam have emphasized the intensification of rice production in recent years however the vietnamese government has started to pay more attention to longer term sustainability considerations recent regional plans and high level policies including the mekong delta plan and the resolution 120 emphasize the development of high value sustainable and climate resilient agriculture and food production this shift has its challenges one of them relates to changes in the government mandated flood control strategy the increased awareness of the agricultural and environmental benefits of seasonal floods including soil fertility maintenance and pest management has resulted in new government regulations that require farmers to adopt a so called 3 3 2 cropping cycle which means that every three years farmers protected by high dikes should allow their rice fields to get flooded during the third rice season some of the farmers however have been reluctant to shift their farming cycle away from the triple rice cropping system because of livelihood security related concerns our study examines rice farmers livelihood sustainability in the upper delta by applying a sustainable livelihood framework to systematically identify prospects and challenges for more sustainable flood based livelihoods we interviewed 160 rice farmers and conducted two focus group discussions in two communes in an giang province our results show that appreciation of the benefits of the 3 3 2 cycle has increased while the results of the livelihood capital index calculations show relatively good status of livelihood sustainability of farming households indicated by the overall 5 capital scores of over 0 4 the study also identifies other constraints to sustainable farm based livelihoods including unstable rice markets and shortage of labor a key finding however is that unless more supportive policies and enhanced viability of flood based crops are developed farmers will not be sufficiently motivated to change their farming practices keywords water management flood rice livelihood sustainability mekong 1 introduction agricultural sustainability and farmers sustainable livelihoods 1 1 this study refers to the definition of ellis highlighted by niehof 2004 that a livelihood comprises the assets of natural physical human financial and social capitals while the activities and the access to assets together determine the living gained by the individual or household especially in rural areas have received increasing consideration globally especially regarding strategies in food and water resources management chapman and darby 2016 makate et al 2017 tran et al 2018a tran and tuan 2020 agricultural intensification has been considered the main measure to ensure food security in many countries tran et al 2018a 2018b tran and james 2019 but in recent years more holistic strategies for achieving sustainable livelihoods have gained pace carswell 2011 and considerations of adverse environmental impacts have increased however sustainable agricultural intensification is a system defined as where agricultural yields are increased without an adverse environmental impact struik and kuyper 2017 the success of farming systems is increasingly measured against longer term perspectives and in relation to numerous social economic environmental and political factors rasul and thapa 2004 the mekong is one of the most important rivers in the world it runs across china throughout lower basin countries myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam before draining into east sea also known as the south china sea the river is therefore also known as the principal ultimate source of sediment of the vietnamese mekong delta vmd with a total area of 3 9 million hectares the vmd supports the lives of approximately 18 million people while catering for half of the country s supplies of agricultural products with a dominance of rice vegetables and aquaculture mekong delta plan 2013 shrestha et al 2016 nguyen et al 2020 being the largest delta in vietnam the vmd contributes to the average 18 of the national gdp every year making it one of southeast asia s largest food baskets of eslami et al 2019 gsovn 2016 mervyn piesse 2019 the sustainable development of vmd which currently is one of the priorities in the national socio economic development plans is under several environmental pressures emerging from both natural disasters and human activities arias et al 2019 tri et al 2013 triet et al 2017 these include increasing salinity intrusion and sea level rise eslami et al 2019 the changes in flood regimes dynamics dung et al 2018 park et al 2020 and the politically controversial challenging upstream dam development which threatens to drastically reduce the mekong s sediment load anthony et al 2015 arias et al 2019 2014 brown et al 2014 eslami et al 2019 hoang et al 2019 in the vmd the government has adhered to rice based agriculture development plans both in production volumes and cultivated areas gsovn 2016 in doing so several measures have been taken including both non structural and structural the structural measures can be realized through the rapid changes in flood protection strategies with dikes and pumps in particular for the rice production intensification from the 1980s and early 1990s for the country s food security käkönen 2008 after the severe flood in 2000 large scale high dike compartments were constructed in the upper floodplains especially an giang province to protect the paddy fields against floods and to make sure the cultivation of three crops of rice per year is feasible however triple rice or intensive agricultural production requires the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides dan 2015 kien 2014 in a pristine condition seasonal floodwaters usually occurring from july to november would flush these agrochemical deposits while fertilizing the soil with new sediments from upstream but high dikes prevent these beneficial floods from entering the fields thus gradually deteriorating the soil quality hung et al 2012 manh et al 2014 in fact the flood frequency and retention capacity of the vmd have substantially decreased over the last 20 years park et al 2020 with the majority of the dike system completed since 2007 provincial authorities have approved an 8 crops in 3 years regulation 2 2 in this scheme farmers protected by high dikes should allow their rice fields to get flooded every three years during the third rice season namely the monsoon season from august to december whereas the first and the second crops are winter spring december april and summer autumn april july howie 2011 3 3 2 cycle via decision no 76 3 3 this decision was issued by the an giang provincial people s committee on 21st november 2007 to guide the regulations for rice crop calendar in the province requesting farmers to allow their rice lands to be flooded in the third season of the third year so that toxic chemicals can be removed while new sediments can be deposited tran and weger 2017 the 3 3 2 scheme nonetheless has never been entirely adhered to by the farmers as they have not been entirely convinced of the sustainability benefits of the floodwaters to their farming systems and have not been motivated enough to comply with the new government regulations recently the mekong delta plan mekong delta plan 2013 highlighted the importance of food based agriculture and flood relief measures in the upper floodplains and thus the production government approved document as the resolution 120 4 4 government resolution 120 nq cp on sustainable and climate resilient development of the mekong delta of vietnam dated on november 17 2017 with further information found at ihe delft institute for water education iucn et al 2017 and the recent study of vo et al 2019 was issued in 2017 to reformulate its flood control related policies tran and weger 2017 have highlighted on the one hand how farmers have become aware of the environmental consequences of non stop cultivation practices and how this awareness has not translated into willingness on the other hand to change the farming practices sufficiently enough to result in any changes in the course of actions the farmers seem to have neither enough incentives to follow nor disincentive not to follow the new regulations decision no 76 thus constitutes an example of an ineffective agricultural strategy wherein local officials have not managed farmers to successfully cooperate with farmers and convince them to comply with the government plans whether the livelihoods of the triple rice farmers protected by high dikes have been sustainable or not remains an unanswered question especially if one seeks to examine this question from multiple angles as suggested by the sustainable livelihoods framework developed by scoones 1998 and ashley and carney 1999 furthermore the optimization of flood benefits to the upper delta s farmers still deserves more systematic consideration phu tan one of the districts of an giang province is the only high dike protection area of the upper floodplains of the vmd where the regulated floodwaters have been allowed to enter the fields otherwise under intensive triple rice cropping systems see fig 1 in practice the district belongs to the north vam nao nvn flood control scheme which consists of a system of sluice gates based on high dike compartments protected by a ring embankment of 100 km2 tran and james 2019 tran et al 2020 this nvn scheme thus serves as a relevant case for examining the prospects and constraints of the water management strategy based on the decision no 76 the objective of the strategy is to make use of the benefits from floodwaters including wild fisheries and fertile sediment deposits previous studies have examined the nvn scheme s water management strategy in terms of assessing the efficiency of the adaptive water policy approach in relation to environmental considerations tran and tuan 2020 and farmers perspectives on the socio hydrological barriers of the water management system tran and weger 2017 however the livelihood sustainability of triple rice farmers under the floodwater management scheme of nvn i e social economic and physical and labor capacities under natural changes has not yet been carefully examined also the application of the existing floodwater management scheme following the decision no 76 deserves to be analyzed from the perspective of sustainable livelihoods in contrast to a relatively rich body of literature on assessing livelihood sustainability of all time closed dike systems not much is known about the impacts of practicing the 3 3 2 scheme on local livelihoods studies on the impacts of implementing high dike systems in the vmd floodplains showed that farmers livelihoods are often susceptible to changes in the configurations of water infrastructure chapman and darby 2016 chapman et al 2016 tran et al 2018a tran and weger 2017 loc et al 2017 loc et al 2020 it is therefore likely that the 3 3 2 system has triggered changes in local livelihoods and the long term sustainability of the floodplain system particularly it is crucial to identify and analyze the key effects of shifting the floodwater management regime on local livelihoods and identify adaptation if needed next to analyzing emerging impacts and challenges this paper aims to identify beneficial adaptation measures that can address the challenges in such a context the resolution 120 has recently proposed the local authorities of the nvn scheme to apply a new floodwater management scheme of 5 crop 2 year the 3 2 scheme for maximizing floodwater space for the 3 3 2 scheme however the farmers perspectives have not been clarified this study addresses the identified research gaps by analyzing the existing floodwater management scheme related to the sustainability of local livelihoods and by assessing the prospects and challenges relating to flood based agriculture practices we have done this by applying the sustainable livelihoods framework that allows systematic assessment of how the 3 3 2 scheme has affected farmers livelihoods this study also aims to identify measures that could enhance more beneficial flood adaptation strategies thus based on farmer interviews and focus group discussions carried out in 2019 we analyzed farmers perspectives on the current floodwater management scheme and how it could be improved compared to that analyzed using the secondary data in 2015 and their perspectives on the proposed floodwater management 2 site description phu tan is one of the 11 districts of an giang province fig 1 it is located on the islet between two main rivers of the tien and the hau of the vmd with abundant alluvial soils accumulated annually by deposits of silt by the rivers the economic growth of the district mostly belongs to agricultural production especially sticky rice phu tan district consists of 19 administrative regions including 2 towns and 17 communes the total natural area is 31 313 ha of which agricultural land is 25 647 ha accounting for 81 9 of the total area specialized land is 1798 ha and residential area is 1 203 ha an giang statistical office 2019 the district has 53 736 households with 208 004 people of those 99 6 of the population is the kinh ethnic group while the rest is khmer hoa and cham phu tan is one of the two districts of an giang province that belongs to the north vam nao nvn flood control scheme specifically 83 of the scheme area is situated within phu tan and the remaining 17 area administratively belongs to tan chau district tran et al 2020 tran and tuan 2020 the nvn scheme which was funded and supervised by ausaid and the ministry of agriculture and rural development aims to protect local infrastructure systems from high floods enable intensive rice production and agricultural diversity production tran and james 2019 according to tran and weger 2017 the nvn scheme is the only farming system in the delta floodplains that operates a sluice gate system allowing floodwater in and out the fields to implement the triennial cropping off season advised by the local government or 3 3 2 cycle overall this scheme has followed a flood based water management strategy which has been considered as the best option for maximizing flood benefits for triple rice production areas in an giang province in particular and in the floodplains of the vmd in general using comparison table s1 summarizes the yield data of phu tan district from 2011 to 2019 the nvn scheme was initiated in 1993 under pre feasibility and design however its first component was completed in 2000 and the complete project was tested and operated from 2009 to 2012 the scheme covers 30 836 ha including 100 km of closed ring embankments and 300 km of internal dikes to regulate river waters in and out to the rice fields protected by the system of 23 dike compartments the scheme of 16 primary sluices and 40 culverts were installed along the ring embankments and the internal dikes along with the dike system the system has 91 nested canals with a length of 321 km ensuring water supply throughout the region tran et al 2020 tran and tuan 2020 3 methods 3 1 sustainable livelihoods framework and livelihood capital index scoones 1998 was the first to provide an analytical framework for sustainable rural livelihoods a question was raised in a specific external context in terms of the policy environment politics history ecology and socio economic conditions with the combination of livelihood capital these five different types of capital sources create the ability to carry out livelihood activities i e agricultural production fishing aquaculture tourism and migration to achieve specific livelihood outcomes in this analytical framework institutions and policies play an essential role in carrying out livelihood activities and achieving desired livelihood outcomes in 1999 the united kingdom agency for international development dfid introduced a sustainable livelihood framework whereby all households have means of earning a living based on five resources of livelihood capital availability in a given local policy and institutional context these factors are influenced by external factors such as storms and floods and seasonal effects household livelihood activities are based on current livelihoods resources as a result of the interaction between these factors dfid 1999 the general idea of the above sustainable livelihood framework slf is that households are based on existing livelihood capitals including human natural financial physical and social capital fig 2 in the particular context of local institutions and policies livelihood activities such as agricultural production fishing and aquaculture tourism diversification of livelihoods will be implemented achieving sustainable livelihood outcomes such as creating more jobs increasing incomes reducing risks and vulnerabilities improving food security and more sustainable use of resources is under the influence of external context more specifically the analysis of a sustainable livelihood framework will help answer the question i what livelihood capitals are and ii which livelihood activities institutions policies are essential for achieving sustainable livelihoods for various stakeholder groups in this study the sustainable livelihood framework based on dfid 1999 was used to analyze livelihood assets or capitals of triple rice farmers in the flood prone case study of the vmd and the factors affecting sustainability in agricultural livelihoods fig 2 to make it suitable for this specific context we adjusted the original framework based on literature review and experienced observations ding et al 2018 pandey et al 2017 su et al 2019 thao et al 2019 lan et al 2018 wei et al 2019 2016 yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 therefore this framework was analyzed based on the five capitals and the context of the study area to classify into different components which were then embedded into the survey questionnaire table 1 3 2 livelihood capital index lci in this study lci analysis was applied to identify the levels of livelihood sustainability of a particular community in the context of climate change or sudden changes ding et al 2018 ma et al 2018 wei et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 we classified the components under five different livelihood capitals in the slf of dfid including human social physical financial and natural capitals lan et al 2018 human capitals consist of health knowledge and skills experience and labor resources associated with livelihood strategy whereas physical capital includes land and equipment of housing vehicles and production means social capital comprises socio demography and social networks covering social institutions training participation access to the market and media natural capital focuses on natural changes such as rainfall flood and drought and climate variability financial capital in principle is finance and income therefore the five key components are classified into indicators or sub components to examine community sustainability under the impacts of the changing context each of the sub components is initially measured at different units or scales these sub components thus need to be standardized to become an index without unit according to the equation hahn et al 2009 as follows 1 i n d e x s d s d s m i n s m a x s m i n where s d is one of the sub components of area d either phu hiep or phu long commune and s max and s min are the minimum and maximum value respectively for example the sub component of the proportion of households heads hhs passed primary school at phu hiep has the following values s d 73 3 s max 100 and s min 0 after the sub components are standardized they are averaged to calculate each key component s value using the following equation 2 m d i 1 n i n d e x s d i n m d is one of the main components in area d index sdi shows up sub components are recorded indicators i and n is the number of sub components in each main component when the value of the key components is determined livelihood capital index is calculated as follows 3 l c i d i 1 7 w m i m d i i 1 7 w m i lci d is the livelihood capital index for the area d corresponding to the weighted average of all five main components the weight of each main component w mi is determined by the number of sub components contributing to the main components the lci d values range from 0 to 1 the lowest to the highest sustainability please find our calculation results in table 3 3 3 sampling methods the sampling procedures used in this study respected observation surveys interviews with farmers focus group discussion with farmers and discussion with local officials this approach assumes that by considering viewpoints from farmers and local officials based on two different contexts the findings were obtained and more comprehensively assessed 3 3 1 observation survey during the study field trips observation methods were applied to comprehensively understand the current context of the study site such as floodwater flow conditions infrastructures such as housing schools sluices and culverts dikes or embankments and crop practice especially the flood based farming systems 3 3 2 interviews with farmers and discussion with local officials in 2019 we interviewed 60 farmers in two communes of phu hiep and phu tan of phu tan district in each commune 30 farmers were selected using a random sampling approach based on the condition that they were the households heads who experienced at least some years cultivating triple rice table 2 the number of determined interviews not only ensures spatial distribution but also the objectives and research questions were able to be answered criteria for selecting these communes are based on geographic location type of cultivation and location nearby major cities phu hiep commune is near the main road main river and chau doc city while phu long commune is farther from the city which may face more difficulties than phu hiep a questionnaire was formulated based on literature review and discussion with experts it was divided into seven sections including general characteristics five sections of the five capitals and finally farmers perception of the flood based adaptation measures the questionnaire was pre tested with there colleagues and two farmers to ensure the readability in measuring attitudes of all questions and the clear question structures before conducting principal surveys after the first day of the survey we carefully revised and corrected the questionnaire based on the first responses to have a complete version before going to interview farmers we met local officials at each commune to collect general information and discuss the physical conditions and livelihood conditions of farmers and agricultural activities our study used a qualitative method in data collection due to farmers livelihood sustainability based on their perspectives thus we did not ﬁx the number of interviews in each region in advance rather we continued to conduct interviews until the information had reached a saturation point kumar 2014 we realized that the saturation in the information was reached between the fifteenth to twentieth interviews secondary data are used in this study based on 100 interviews carried out in 2015 of the center of water management and climate change at the three communes of phu lam 40 phu thanh 30 and tan trung 30 communes of phu tan district most interviewed farmers practiced mono triple rice year round while some of them also cultivated vegetables in their garden these data sources are valuable to expand our understanding of the characteristics of triple rice farmers in phu tan district and their perspectives on the floodwater management scheme based on these data we can compare the economic status of triple rice farmers in the same study area in spatial and temporal terms 3 3 3 focus group discussion with farmers two focus group discussion meetings with ten farmers each were carried out in each commune local officials invited these farmers with the criteria that they are the household heads who have at least five years of experience in rice production such criteria were required due to the need for knowledge sharing from the interaction during the meetings farmers were asked questions in an interactive setting based on maps and a guideline this guideline was formulated following the contents of the questionnaire to double check the farmers perspective farmers were encouraged to discuss thoughts freely with others the open and free discussions typically generated ideas and provided a wealth of information in terms of triple rice production based on five capitals rice market and their perspective about the flood based adaptation options and agreements to adopt a new water management scheme of 5 crop 2 year from their current water management scheme of 3 3 2 4 results 4 1 general characteristics of interviewees the interview results in 2019 show similar patterns in characteristics to those in 2015 in terms of the gender of the head of household age years of experience in rice production number of household members and average labor in families table 2 in general almost all large household heads are male in terms of age the number of household heads over 30 years old accounts for 93 97 and only 3 7 of household heads are younger than 30 half of the interviewed household heads are aged 31 50 45 52 and 38 45 of the household heads are between 51 and 70 years old and 3 7 household heads over the age of 70 still practice agriculture the age distribution leads to similarities in the number of years of farming experience of household heads at about 25 years most farming households have a large number of members average of 4 6 members per family compared to the national norm 2 members per household the interview analysis also shows structural similarities by educational level cultivated area and farm households profitability in terms of education level the majority of households with secondary k6 k9 and tertiary education k10 k12 accounted for the majority 53 72 followed by families with primary school accounting for 47 according to 2015 data compared to 25 according to 2019 data only a few households with illiterate education 3 in terms of arable land most of the household heads own small areas of which the heads of households have less than 1 ha of cultivation area accounting for 17 42 cultivated area from 1 3 hectares and 49 55 in contrast the head of the household has a cultivated area of more than 3 ha which accounts for 9 28 only in terms of income the average net profit is low at only about us 65 68 for 1000 m2 of rice cultivation over a 3 month of each cultivation season notably the mean net profit of households in 2019 is slightly higher than that based on data collection in 2015 4 2 livelihood sustainability based on lci analysis an overview of the livelihood sustainability for the two surveyed communities is presented in fig 3 accompanied by more detailed specifications in table 3 overall the lci scores in fig 3 show a relatively sustainable livelihood condition for both phu long and phu hiep communities while the two communes show similar patterns in terms of the lci scores under each capital phu long shows a slightly better status with an aggregated lci of 0 508 compared to 0 562 at phu hiep this difference is explained by the factors of access to education household income levels and access to reliable rice traders table 3 natural capital shows the highest scores in both communities while social and financial capitals show weaker aspects of the livelihood sustainability these weaker links are explained by limited roles of social networks and by an unstable rice market for the human capital phu long is generally more sustainable than phu hiep lcipl 0 557 compared to lciph 0 488 the ratio of household heads passing primary school is 0 733 in phu long higher than 0 700 found in phu hiep however the proportion of households with the age lower than 30 is the same for both communes 0 100 for the social capital both phu hiep and phu long show low sustainability lciph 0 413 compared to lcipl 0 462 notably a lower ratio of households in phu long 0 275 than phu hiep 0 400 have not attended training in agricultural productivity also the ratio is low in both communes in respect of selling rice production to reliable traders 0 133 versus 0 067 in terms of the physical capital households in phu long are likely to be more sustainable 0 580 than those in phu hiep 0 526 particularly the low ratios are found in both communes from the households having good living means 0 367 versus 0 300 and the households expanding their land area in the last five years 0 030 versus 0 167 for the financial capital households in phu long may be more sustainable than those in phu hiep lcipl 0 536 compared to lciph 0 459 specifically the household outcome of over 30 million vnd equivalent to us 1282 annually with triple rice production is quite low in phu hiep 0 300 for the natural capital households in both communes seem to have relatively good natural conditions supporting rice production lciph 0 643 compared to lcipl 0 667 however a low radio of households agreed that lands are not degraded over time lciph 0 330 compared to lcipl 0 200 and the long term hot weather and rains did not increase insect infection and decease to their rice crop over the past five years lciph 0 033 compared to lcipl 0 000 4 3 prospects challenges and adaptation options 4 3 1 prospects for flood based land use change from farmers perspectives fig 4 presents the proportion of agreement of households heads based on the two interview surveys of 2015 and 2019 in choosing land use options for their third crop during the flood seasons specifically the farmers were asked which land use options are suitable for the third crop season to sustain their livelihoods the 2015 survey data showed the high proportion of household heads 55 reported that they preferred cultivating rice in the flood season in contrast vegetables were the second option 29 and only 8 of household heads agreed to flood their fields with the same pattern the 2019 survey data revealed the highest proportion of agreement of the household heads 86 7 in flooding their rice fields in the third season a few factors explain the remarkable increase in acceptance level by farmers on the flood based rice production model first farmers experienced increasing rice cultivation challenges under a high dike system including soil and water pollution in particular farmers experienced rapid accumulation of pollutants in the rice fields due to heavy use of agro chemicals therefore they reported that exchanging water in and out of the fields during flood events is the only effective mechanism for flushing pollutants out of the rice fields furthermore farmers have to increase the amount of fertilizer to sustain rice yields over the years since the nutrient rich sediments carried by floods do not reach rice fields under the triple rice model tran et al 2018b the remaining portion of 13 3 of the household heads preferred rice and vegetables the survey data based on the two surveys indicated that the farmers perspective might change in terms of accepting the benefits of floodwater for sustainable livelihoods 4 3 2 prospects and challenges in adopting a new water management scheme perspectives of farmers based on focus group discussions are presented in terms of prospects and challenges in their rice based livelihoods under the existing water management scheme table 4 and fig 5 with the current water management scheme 8 rice crops in 3 years or 3 3 2 farmers reported that they have long experience in rice production but they had to deal with labor shortages and migration in recent years in terms of the social aspect farmers have suitable social activities i e training in agriculture organized by agriculture extension agencies and local social networking of farmer groups however they were worried about unreliable traders or companies for rice outputs regarding the physical aspect farmers responded that they have moral infrastructure systems however most farmers did not agree to implement a new water management scheme 5 rice crops in 2 years or 3 2 for the financial aspect although the triple rice cropping pattern has helped farmers earn additional income farmers especially smallholders had low net profit due to low selling rice prices and high input costs despite having a good state of nature farmers agricultural activities have undermined natural values i e land and water degradation overall farmers have good conditions but livelihoods are not sustainable particularly in terms of economic and environmental aspects table 4 despite farmer discussion on many challenges in the adoption of the new water management scheme five key challenges were highly perceived fig 5 first rice is a cultural crop of many local farmers second technologies skills and initial investments are a constraint for many farmers in adopting flood based crops third the new scheme would add more leisure time for rice farmers fourth most farmers stated that floods nowadays bring no or much fewer sediments than historical floods meanwhile they do not know what to do to earn money finally farmers informed that the market for flood based crops might be more unstable than rice if this crop will be developed at a large scale in the flood season 4 3 3 adaptation options our observation revealed that farmers had practiced flood based farming systems on their flooded fields along the main roads fig 6 these fields belong to the dike compartments flooded following the yearly schedule of the nvn scheme in these fields farmers have cultivated various water crop models such as fish aquaculture aquaculture mixed with coconut planted on the bank water mimosa and lotus or water lily and so on for the fish aquaculture model earth low dike polders were made before the flooding and some farmers used the polder banks to cultivate coconut or vegetables for the models of mimosa lotus or water lily farmers used small areas of their rice fields to plant these crops 5 discussion 5 1 key findings our assessment of farming households using the dfid framework shows the relatively good status of the farmers livelihood sustainability all the average scores for livelihood capital indices are above 0 4 suggesting no critical bottleneck in the livelihood system the indices however also show a certain degree of differentiation amongst the capitals and amongst the sub indices regarding the capitals social and financial capitals show relatively lower scores this differentiation is explained by the limited role of social networks in sustaining and improving local livelihoods in phu hiep for example less than 50 of the households participate in a social organization such as the farmer union or women association in this case limited participation in social networks impedes the farmers abilities to exchange and learn from each other to improve their daily farming activities which could create inequalities between social groups and increase the social exclusion of the non skilled and the poor hoang et al 2006 additionally market instability also creates a critical limitation in the assessed farming communities tran et al 2018b during focus group discussion many farmers reported that they experience challenges created by low and unstable selling prices for rice table 4 as found by tran et al 2018b that ranked the market stability as the most important factor contributing to rice based farmers livelihood sustainability lastly it should be noted that some well performing capitals also exhibit limitations in certain aspects for instance while natural capital performs relatively well many farmers also expressed their concerns about environmental degradation caused by intensive use of agrochemicals and by reducing the natural sedimentation nurturing the rice fields kien 2014 tran and weger 2017 it could clarify our findings revealed that the farmers perspectives were changed from 2015 to 2019 by accepting the benefits of floodwater for sustainable livelihoods given these differentiations we recommend analyzing the sub indices instead of focusing on the average capital performance looking beyond the farmers livelihood further into the three original pillars of the sustainability concept environmental economy and social a contrasting inference might be drawn firstly triple rice and many other monoculture farming practices are based on the model of industrial agriculture which inherently disregards the dynamics of living ecosystems of approaches essentially the back to back crops that depend on the heavy doses of crop protection agrochemicals inflict irreversible damages to the environment such as water contamination soil nutrient depletion and loss of biodiversity isenring 2010 li et al 2020 pfiffner and balmer 2011 tan et al 2020 economic wise even though rice is the country s pivotal crop one of the world s key staple foods the rice farmers are constantly prone to poverty the paradox relates to the network of intermediate dealers who efficiently hamper the selling prices as shared by one of the farmer respondents this also explains why rice farmers mean net profit remains relatively constant over the five years based on our data analysis finally the farmers lack the power to negotiate over prices that could sustain their livelihoods many fall into cycles of indebtedness that may eventually force the farmers to sell their lands to major domestic and external investors which in turn triggers the migration from rural to urban areas dun 2011 huy 2009 creating serious issues for both communes while the latter will be forced to absorb additional laborers coming from the countryside the former gradually transform into neo colonies in which large scaled corporate ones gradually sabotage mid sized family farms our discussion with farmers on feasible practices and expansions of flood based crops shows that while such farming practices contribute to livelihood sustainability there are challenges regarding both financial and technical perspectives new farming practices require up front investments which can turn out to be unaffordable for farming households for instance many farmers indicated that they would need wooden boats for navigation and transportation of farming equipment during the flood season which they cannot afford these reasons are in line with our findings on the limited financial capacity based on the dfid assessment furthermore the spatial expansion of flood based farming is also challenging due to a short time floodwater duration of a couple of months during the rainy season our observation and mapping of flood based farming practices also point in the same direction where this particular farming system is only implemented along the main river fig 6 historically the region s soil and water management system is highly conditioned towards intensive rice farming tran and weger 2017 these past legacies make it difficult to shift to more flood based farming practices although transitioning towards more flood based farming practices in the rainy seasons could enhance the flood resilience nguyen and james 2013 limited motivation to transition into more flood based farming practices in the research area also relates to the farmers perspectives that the third rice crop has brought extra proﬁt with less risks tran et al 2019 farmers expressed their need for technical assistance to get ready to implement alternative crops such as water plants or fish farming during the flood season one of the vital constraints to flood based farming is the lack of stable markets for flood based crops such as lotus water lily and water mimosa it should also be noted that important challenges under triple rice production such as decreasing farming profits and higher demands for agro chemicals represent strong motives for transitioning towards flood based rice farming tran et al 2018b although a new scheme of water management of 3 2 could help to maximize field based floodwater storage this replacement for the scheme of 3 3 2 has not been fully supported by farmers farmers prefer triple rice production because this ensures their work and income are more equally spread over the year joep 2015 farmers also do not see floodwaters bringing similar benefits in terms of nutrient sediments and wild fish as before another reason for preferring a more intensive cropping calendar is that it keeps the farmers more occupied during the whole year and thus keeps them away from social problems like gambling and drinking associated with increased leisure time joep 2015 finally farmers have not yet developed the skills that the flood based crops require and are thus reluctant to shift to more flood based farming systems additionally the flood based crops require more labor sources than rice which are shrinking because young and skilled people have moved out of the region seeking better jobs therefore the government should carefully consider the pros and cons of the two schemes and ensure higher benefits for farmers if the new water management scheme of 3 2 cycle is applied 5 2 limitation and future outlook we have put considerable effort into assessing triple rice farmers livelihood sustainability and the feasibility of expanding flood based cropping alternatives however three limitations could be noted for future work first interviews might be carried out with local farmers who have been practicing flood based crops along the main roads to explicitly explain their social technical and financial difficulties and benefits in cultivation second focus group discussion meetings in other communes of phu tan district could consolidate our findings third the methodological framework of livelihood sustainability of dfid applied in this study possibly presents a theory based story under sustainability criteria assessment therefore it is recommended to transfer the method to the other vmd floodplain regions for dynamic adoption innovation however the study has presented an operational analytical framework for immediate findings to accommodate long term dynamics monitoring referring to past observations our findings could provide baseline information for future research to investigate a mechanism in developing a market sustainable for crop production in the vmd floodplains based on our research findings farmers showed their willingness to transform their triple rice crop to a new agricultural model i e flood based plants if their products are completely sold economic benefits are ensured hence a model which connects agricultural output complement with value chains would provide a stable market and help localities change their land use transition perspectives for instance flood based farming systems under a value chain model might offer high and durable profits for the triple rice farmers farmers might also change rice crop patterns by adaptation options such as maximizing flood based crops along the road in the flood season besides it helps create jobs that ensure additional income for rice farmers when their fields are flooded 6 conclusions this study has used the sustainable livelihood framework to assess triple rice farmers livelihood changes particularly concerning a changed water management strategy in the vmd floodplains rice farmers livelihoods seem to be relatively sustainable but the study has also identified several constraints that would need to be addressed to enhance the environmental and economic assets of the farmers the selected case study areas under the north vam nao scheme were considered to be particularly suitable for analyzing the potential for expanding the implementation of the more flood based cropping systems specifically the water management scheme following of 8 crop 3 year 3 3 2 scheme was evaluated to be replaced by the even more flood based systems of 5 crop 2 year system 3 2 scheme the findings of this study lead to the following conclusions the livelihood sustainability of farmers should be examined not only by overall indicators but also by specific indicators based on farmers perspectives for instance the of the overall indicators sustainability score are 0 508 and 0 562 for the two studied communes whereas the scores are lower in terms of social 0 291 and 0 324 and financial capitals 0 300 and 0 673 besides the perspectives of farmers could be explicitly understood if the observation discussion and data analysis are examined together our findings showed higher agreement levels by triple rice farmers 87 in the survey 2019 compared to those in 2015 8 on flooding their fields in the flood season positive outcomes from more flood based farming give a signal for developing more nature based adaptation measures instead of large scale dike based infrastructural schemes a more flood based and ecological friendly rice production is promising in terms of enhanced net profits and reduced land degradation since higher profits help to persuade farmers to cultivate two rice crops per year also many farmers might agree to flood their rice fields if they have other alternatives besides the flood based livelihoods the existing water management scheme has its prospects alongside challenges transitioning to a new system is challenging positive results from pilot projects could convince farmers to shift to the new system farmers are reluctant to shift from rice to other higher value crops unless there are clear market potentials for the new crops the new government policies have not immediately altered the existing water management scheme except for limited areas to make farmers motivated to shift to the new scheme the government could consider the following measures in the short term the following alternatives deserve more support crop rotation with new seeds two rice crops only but high quality varieties development of farmer friendly contracts between farmers and reliable traders innovative measures to enable pesticide and fertilizer reduction and creation of alternative of the farm work for farmers in the flood season in the long term the linkages between the state management agencies enterprises and farmers along the value chain in agricultural production should be strengthened and regulated by the government in ways that are supportive for farmers and the national food system whereas this study put a great effort into assessing rice farmers livelihood sustainability in the selected case study areas and the possible adoption of more flood based water management schemes two key points would benefit from further investigations we first believe that apart from looking for replicating our methods in investigating more interviews with rice farmers in other areas future research should then look for examining perspectives of local officials scientists and policy makers against farmers views regarding the research problems these will help develop an effective flood based water management strategy for the

10425,rapidly changing hydrological conditions under climate change upstream developments and local water infrastructures require transformative changes in water management strategies for the agriculture sector in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd for more than three decades the agricultural policies in vietnam have emphasized the intensification of rice production in recent years however the vietnamese government has started to pay more attention to longer term sustainability considerations recent regional plans and high level policies including the mekong delta plan and the resolution 120 emphasize the development of high value sustainable and climate resilient agriculture and food production this shift has its challenges one of them relates to changes in the government mandated flood control strategy the increased awareness of the agricultural and environmental benefits of seasonal floods including soil fertility maintenance and pest management has resulted in new government regulations that require farmers to adopt a so called 3 3 2 cropping cycle which means that every three years farmers protected by high dikes should allow their rice fields to get flooded during the third rice season some of the farmers however have been reluctant to shift their farming cycle away from the triple rice cropping system because of livelihood security related concerns our study examines rice farmers livelihood sustainability in the upper delta by applying a sustainable livelihood framework to systematically identify prospects and challenges for more sustainable flood based livelihoods we interviewed 160 rice farmers and conducted two focus group discussions in two communes in an giang province our results show that appreciation of the benefits of the 3 3 2 cycle has increased while the results of the livelihood capital index calculations show relatively good status of livelihood sustainability of farming households indicated by the overall 5 capital scores of over 0 4 the study also identifies other constraints to sustainable farm based livelihoods including unstable rice markets and shortage of labor a key finding however is that unless more supportive policies and enhanced viability of flood based crops are developed farmers will not be sufficiently motivated to change their farming practices keywords water management flood rice livelihood sustainability mekong 1 introduction agricultural sustainability and farmers sustainable livelihoods 1 1 this study refers to the definition of ellis highlighted by niehof 2004 that a livelihood comprises the assets of natural physical human financial and social capitals while the activities and the access to assets together determine the living gained by the individual or household especially in rural areas have received increasing consideration globally especially regarding strategies in food and water resources management chapman and darby 2016 makate et al 2017 tran et al 2018a tran and tuan 2020 agricultural intensification has been considered the main measure to ensure food security in many countries tran et al 2018a 2018b tran and james 2019 but in recent years more holistic strategies for achieving sustainable livelihoods have gained pace carswell 2011 and considerations of adverse environmental impacts have increased however sustainable agricultural intensification is a system defined as where agricultural yields are increased without an adverse environmental impact struik and kuyper 2017 the success of farming systems is increasingly measured against longer term perspectives and in relation to numerous social economic environmental and political factors rasul and thapa 2004 the mekong is one of the most important rivers in the world it runs across china throughout lower basin countries myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam before draining into east sea also known as the south china sea the river is therefore also known as the principal ultimate source of sediment of the vietnamese mekong delta vmd with a total area of 3 9 million hectares the vmd supports the lives of approximately 18 million people while catering for half of the country s supplies of agricultural products with a dominance of rice vegetables and aquaculture mekong delta plan 2013 shrestha et al 2016 nguyen et al 2020 being the largest delta in vietnam the vmd contributes to the average 18 of the national gdp every year making it one of southeast asia s largest food baskets of eslami et al 2019 gsovn 2016 mervyn piesse 2019 the sustainable development of vmd which currently is one of the priorities in the national socio economic development plans is under several environmental pressures emerging from both natural disasters and human activities arias et al 2019 tri et al 2013 triet et al 2017 these include increasing salinity intrusion and sea level rise eslami et al 2019 the changes in flood regimes dynamics dung et al 2018 park et al 2020 and the politically controversial challenging upstream dam development which threatens to drastically reduce the mekong s sediment load anthony et al 2015 arias et al 2019 2014 brown et al 2014 eslami et al 2019 hoang et al 2019 in the vmd the government has adhered to rice based agriculture development plans both in production volumes and cultivated areas gsovn 2016 in doing so several measures have been taken including both non structural and structural the structural measures can be realized through the rapid changes in flood protection strategies with dikes and pumps in particular for the rice production intensification from the 1980s and early 1990s for the country s food security käkönen 2008 after the severe flood in 2000 large scale high dike compartments were constructed in the upper floodplains especially an giang province to protect the paddy fields against floods and to make sure the cultivation of three crops of rice per year is feasible however triple rice or intensive agricultural production requires the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides dan 2015 kien 2014 in a pristine condition seasonal floodwaters usually occurring from july to november would flush these agrochemical deposits while fertilizing the soil with new sediments from upstream but high dikes prevent these beneficial floods from entering the fields thus gradually deteriorating the soil quality hung et al 2012 manh et al 2014 in fact the flood frequency and retention capacity of the vmd have substantially decreased over the last 20 years park et al 2020 with the majority of the dike system completed since 2007 provincial authorities have approved an 8 crops in 3 years regulation 2 2 in this scheme farmers protected by high dikes should allow their rice fields to get flooded every three years during the third rice season namely the monsoon season from august to december whereas the first and the second crops are winter spring december april and summer autumn april july howie 2011 3 3 2 cycle via decision no 76 3 3 this decision was issued by the an giang provincial people s committee on 21st november 2007 to guide the regulations for rice crop calendar in the province requesting farmers to allow their rice lands to be flooded in the third season of the third year so that toxic chemicals can be removed while new sediments can be deposited tran and weger 2017 the 3 3 2 scheme nonetheless has never been entirely adhered to by the farmers as they have not been entirely convinced of the sustainability benefits of the floodwaters to their farming systems and have not been motivated enough to comply with the new government regulations recently the mekong delta plan mekong delta plan 2013 highlighted the importance of food based agriculture and flood relief measures in the upper floodplains and thus the production government approved document as the resolution 120 4 4 government resolution 120 nq cp on sustainable and climate resilient development of the mekong delta of vietnam dated on november 17 2017 with further information found at ihe delft institute for water education iucn et al 2017 and the recent study of vo et al 2019 was issued in 2017 to reformulate its flood control related policies tran and weger 2017 have highlighted on the one hand how farmers have become aware of the environmental consequences of non stop cultivation practices and how this awareness has not translated into willingness on the other hand to change the farming practices sufficiently enough to result in any changes in the course of actions the farmers seem to have neither enough incentives to follow nor disincentive not to follow the new regulations decision no 76 thus constitutes an example of an ineffective agricultural strategy wherein local officials have not managed farmers to successfully cooperate with farmers and convince them to comply with the government plans whether the livelihoods of the triple rice farmers protected by high dikes have been sustainable or not remains an unanswered question especially if one seeks to examine this question from multiple angles as suggested by the sustainable livelihoods framework developed by scoones 1998 and ashley and carney 1999 furthermore the optimization of flood benefits to the upper delta s farmers still deserves more systematic consideration phu tan one of the districts of an giang province is the only high dike protection area of the upper floodplains of the vmd where the regulated floodwaters have been allowed to enter the fields otherwise under intensive triple rice cropping systems see fig 1 in practice the district belongs to the north vam nao nvn flood control scheme which consists of a system of sluice gates based on high dike compartments protected by a ring embankment of 100 km2 tran and james 2019 tran et al 2020 this nvn scheme thus serves as a relevant case for examining the prospects and constraints of the water management strategy based on the decision no 76 the objective of the strategy is to make use of the benefits from floodwaters including wild fisheries and fertile sediment deposits previous studies have examined the nvn scheme s water management strategy in terms of assessing the efficiency of the adaptive water policy approach in relation to environmental considerations tran and tuan 2020 and farmers perspectives on the socio hydrological barriers of the water management system tran and weger 2017 however the livelihood sustainability of triple rice farmers under the floodwater management scheme of nvn i e social economic and physical and labor capacities under natural changes has not yet been carefully examined also the application of the existing floodwater management scheme following the decision no 76 deserves to be analyzed from the perspective of sustainable livelihoods in contrast to a relatively rich body of literature on assessing livelihood sustainability of all time closed dike systems not much is known about the impacts of practicing the 3 3 2 scheme on local livelihoods studies on the impacts of implementing high dike systems in the vmd floodplains showed that farmers livelihoods are often susceptible to changes in the configurations of water infrastructure chapman and darby 2016 chapman et al 2016 tran et al 2018a tran and weger 2017 loc et al 2017 loc et al 2020 it is therefore likely that the 3 3 2 system has triggered changes in local livelihoods and the long term sustainability of the floodplain system particularly it is crucial to identify and analyze the key effects of shifting the floodwater management regime on local livelihoods and identify adaptation if needed next to analyzing emerging impacts and challenges this paper aims to identify beneficial adaptation measures that can address the challenges in such a context the resolution 120 has recently proposed the local authorities of the nvn scheme to apply a new floodwater management scheme of 5 crop 2 year the 3 2 scheme for maximizing floodwater space for the 3 3 2 scheme however the farmers perspectives have not been clarified this study addresses the identified research gaps by analyzing the existing floodwater management scheme related to the sustainability of local livelihoods and by assessing the prospects and challenges relating to flood based agriculture practices we have done this by applying the sustainable livelihoods framework that allows systematic assessment of how the 3 3 2 scheme has affected farmers livelihoods this study also aims to identify measures that could enhance more beneficial flood adaptation strategies thus based on farmer interviews and focus group discussions carried out in 2019 we analyzed farmers perspectives on the current floodwater management scheme and how it could be improved compared to that analyzed using the secondary data in 2015 and their perspectives on the proposed floodwater management 2 site description phu tan is one of the 11 districts of an giang province fig 1 it is located on the islet between two main rivers of the tien and the hau of the vmd with abundant alluvial soils accumulated annually by deposits of silt by the rivers the economic growth of the district mostly belongs to agricultural production especially sticky rice phu tan district consists of 19 administrative regions including 2 towns and 17 communes the total natural area is 31 313 ha of which agricultural land is 25 647 ha accounting for 81 9 of the total area specialized land is 1798 ha and residential area is 1 203 ha an giang statistical office 2019 the district has 53 736 households with 208 004 people of those 99 6 of the population is the kinh ethnic group while the rest is khmer hoa and cham phu tan is one of the two districts of an giang province that belongs to the north vam nao nvn flood control scheme specifically 83 of the scheme area is situated within phu tan and the remaining 17 area administratively belongs to tan chau district tran et al 2020 tran and tuan 2020 the nvn scheme which was funded and supervised by ausaid and the ministry of agriculture and rural development aims to protect local infrastructure systems from high floods enable intensive rice production and agricultural diversity production tran and james 2019 according to tran and weger 2017 the nvn scheme is the only farming system in the delta floodplains that operates a sluice gate system allowing floodwater in and out the fields to implement the triennial cropping off season advised by the local government or 3 3 2 cycle overall this scheme has followed a flood based water management strategy which has been considered as the best option for maximizing flood benefits for triple rice production areas in an giang province in particular and in the floodplains of the vmd in general using comparison table s1 summarizes the yield data of phu tan district from 2011 to 2019 the nvn scheme was initiated in 1993 under pre feasibility and design however its first component was completed in 2000 and the complete project was tested and operated from 2009 to 2012 the scheme covers 30 836 ha including 100 km of closed ring embankments and 300 km of internal dikes to regulate river waters in and out to the rice fields protected by the system of 23 dike compartments the scheme of 16 primary sluices and 40 culverts were installed along the ring embankments and the internal dikes along with the dike system the system has 91 nested canals with a length of 321 km ensuring water supply throughout the region tran et al 2020 tran and tuan 2020 3 methods 3 1 sustainable livelihoods framework and livelihood capital index scoones 1998 was the first to provide an analytical framework for sustainable rural livelihoods a question was raised in a specific external context in terms of the policy environment politics history ecology and socio economic conditions with the combination of livelihood capital these five different types of capital sources create the ability to carry out livelihood activities i e agricultural production fishing aquaculture tourism and migration to achieve specific livelihood outcomes in this analytical framework institutions and policies play an essential role in carrying out livelihood activities and achieving desired livelihood outcomes in 1999 the united kingdom agency for international development dfid introduced a sustainable livelihood framework whereby all households have means of earning a living based on five resources of livelihood capital availability in a given local policy and institutional context these factors are influenced by external factors such as storms and floods and seasonal effects household livelihood activities are based on current livelihoods resources as a result of the interaction between these factors dfid 1999 the general idea of the above sustainable livelihood framework slf is that households are based on existing livelihood capitals including human natural financial physical and social capital fig 2 in the particular context of local institutions and policies livelihood activities such as agricultural production fishing and aquaculture tourism diversification of livelihoods will be implemented achieving sustainable livelihood outcomes such as creating more jobs increasing incomes reducing risks and vulnerabilities improving food security and more sustainable use of resources is under the influence of external context more specifically the analysis of a sustainable livelihood framework will help answer the question i what livelihood capitals are and ii which livelihood activities institutions policies are essential for achieving sustainable livelihoods for various stakeholder groups in this study the sustainable livelihood framework based on dfid 1999 was used to analyze livelihood assets or capitals of triple rice farmers in the flood prone case study of the vmd and the factors affecting sustainability in agricultural livelihoods fig 2 to make it suitable for this specific context we adjusted the original framework based on literature review and experienced observations ding et al 2018 pandey et al 2017 su et al 2019 thao et al 2019 lan et al 2018 wei et al 2019 2016 yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 therefore this framework was analyzed based on the five capitals and the context of the study area to classify into different components which were then embedded into the survey questionnaire table 1 3 2 livelihood capital index lci in this study lci analysis was applied to identify the levels of livelihood sustainability of a particular community in the context of climate change or sudden changes ding et al 2018 ma et al 2018 wei et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 we classified the components under five different livelihood capitals in the slf of dfid including human social physical financial and natural capitals lan et al 2018 human capitals consist of health knowledge and skills experience and labor resources associated with livelihood strategy whereas physical capital includes land and equipment of housing vehicles and production means social capital comprises socio demography and social networks covering social institutions training participation access to the market and media natural capital focuses on natural changes such as rainfall flood and drought and climate variability financial capital in principle is finance and income therefore the five key components are classified into indicators or sub components to examine community sustainability under the impacts of the changing context each of the sub components is initially measured at different units or scales these sub components thus need to be standardized to become an index without unit according to the equation hahn et al 2009 as follows 1 i n d e x s d s d s m i n s m a x s m i n where s d is one of the sub components of area d either phu hiep or phu long commune and s max and s min are the minimum and maximum value respectively for example the sub component of the proportion of households heads hhs passed primary school at phu hiep has the following values s d 73 3 s max 100 and s min 0 after the sub components are standardized they are averaged to calculate each key component s value using the following equation 2 m d i 1 n i n d e x s d i n m d is one of the main components in area d index sdi shows up sub components are recorded indicators i and n is the number of sub components in each main component when the value of the key components is determined livelihood capital index is calculated as follows 3 l c i d i 1 7 w m i m d i i 1 7 w m i lci d is the livelihood capital index for the area d corresponding to the weighted average of all five main components the weight of each main component w mi is determined by the number of sub components contributing to the main components the lci d values range from 0 to 1 the lowest to the highest sustainability please find our calculation results in table 3 3 3 sampling methods the sampling procedures used in this study respected observation surveys interviews with farmers focus group discussion with farmers and discussion with local officials this approach assumes that by considering viewpoints from farmers and local officials based on two different contexts the findings were obtained and more comprehensively assessed 3 3 1 observation survey during the study field trips observation methods were applied to comprehensively understand the current context of the study site such as floodwater flow conditions infrastructures such as housing schools sluices and culverts dikes or embankments and crop practice especially the flood based farming systems 3 3 2 interviews with farmers and discussion with local officials in 2019 we interviewed 60 farmers in two communes of phu hiep and phu tan of phu tan district in each commune 30 farmers were selected using a random sampling approach based on the condition that they were the households heads who experienced at least some years cultivating triple rice table 2 the number of determined interviews not only ensures spatial distribution but also the objectives and research questions were able to be answered criteria for selecting these communes are based on geographic location type of cultivation and location nearby major cities phu hiep commune is near the main road main river and chau doc city while phu long commune is farther from the city which may face more difficulties than phu hiep a questionnaire was formulated based on literature review and discussion with experts it was divided into seven sections including general characteristics five sections of the five capitals and finally farmers perception of the flood based adaptation measures the questionnaire was pre tested with there colleagues and two farmers to ensure the readability in measuring attitudes of all questions and the clear question structures before conducting principal surveys after the first day of the survey we carefully revised and corrected the questionnaire based on the first responses to have a complete version before going to interview farmers we met local officials at each commune to collect general information and discuss the physical conditions and livelihood conditions of farmers and agricultural activities our study used a qualitative method in data collection due to farmers livelihood sustainability based on their perspectives thus we did not ﬁx the number of interviews in each region in advance rather we continued to conduct interviews until the information had reached a saturation point kumar 2014 we realized that the saturation in the information was reached between the fifteenth to twentieth interviews secondary data are used in this study based on 100 interviews carried out in 2015 of the center of water management and climate change at the three communes of phu lam 40 phu thanh 30 and tan trung 30 communes of phu tan district most interviewed farmers practiced mono triple rice year round while some of them also cultivated vegetables in their garden these data sources are valuable to expand our understanding of the characteristics of triple rice farmers in phu tan district and their perspectives on the floodwater management scheme based on these data we can compare the economic status of triple rice farmers in the same study area in spatial and temporal terms 3 3 3 focus group discussion with farmers two focus group discussion meetings with ten farmers each were carried out in each commune local officials invited these farmers with the criteria that they are the household heads who have at least five years of experience in rice production such criteria were required due to the need for knowledge sharing from the interaction during the meetings farmers were asked questions in an interactive setting based on maps and a guideline this guideline was formulated following the contents of the questionnaire to double check the farmers perspective farmers were encouraged to discuss thoughts freely with others the open and free discussions typically generated ideas and provided a wealth of information in terms of triple rice production based on five capitals rice market and their perspective about the flood based adaptation options and agreements to adopt a new water management scheme of 5 crop 2 year from their current water management scheme of 3 3 2 4 results 4 1 general characteristics of interviewees the interview results in 2019 show similar patterns in characteristics to those in 2015 in terms of the gender of the head of household age years of experience in rice production number of household members and average labor in families table 2 in general almost all large household heads are male in terms of age the number of household heads over 30 years old accounts for 93 97 and only 3 7 of household heads are younger than 30 half of the interviewed household heads are aged 31 50 45 52 and 38 45 of the household heads are between 51 and 70 years old and 3 7 household heads over the age of 70 still practice agriculture the age distribution leads to similarities in the number of years of farming experience of household heads at about 25 years most farming households have a large number of members average of 4 6 members per family compared to the national norm 2 members per household the interview analysis also shows structural similarities by educational level cultivated area and farm households profitability in terms of education level the majority of households with secondary k6 k9 and tertiary education k10 k12 accounted for the majority 53 72 followed by families with primary school accounting for 47 according to 2015 data compared to 25 according to 2019 data only a few households with illiterate education 3 in terms of arable land most of the household heads own small areas of which the heads of households have less than 1 ha of cultivation area accounting for 17 42 cultivated area from 1 3 hectares and 49 55 in contrast the head of the household has a cultivated area of more than 3 ha which accounts for 9 28 only in terms of income the average net profit is low at only about us 65 68 for 1000 m2 of rice cultivation over a 3 month of each cultivation season notably the mean net profit of households in 2019 is slightly higher than that based on data collection in 2015 4 2 livelihood sustainability based on lci analysis an overview of the livelihood sustainability for the two surveyed communities is presented in fig 3 accompanied by more detailed specifications in table 3 overall the lci scores in fig 3 show a relatively sustainable livelihood condition for both phu long and phu hiep communities while the two communes show similar patterns in terms of the lci scores under each capital phu long shows a slightly better status with an aggregated lci of 0 508 compared to 0 562 at phu hiep this difference is explained by the factors of access to education household income levels and access to reliable rice traders table 3 natural capital shows the highest scores in both communities while social and financial capitals show weaker aspects of the livelihood sustainability these weaker links are explained by limited roles of social networks and by an unstable rice market for the human capital phu long is generally more sustainable than phu hiep lcipl 0 557 compared to lciph 0 488 the ratio of household heads passing primary school is 0 733 in phu long higher than 0 700 found in phu hiep however the proportion of households with the age lower than 30 is the same for both communes 0 100 for the social capital both phu hiep and phu long show low sustainability lciph 0 413 compared to lcipl 0 462 notably a lower ratio of households in phu long 0 275 than phu hiep 0 400 have not attended training in agricultural productivity also the ratio is low in both communes in respect of selling rice production to reliable traders 0 133 versus 0 067 in terms of the physical capital households in phu long are likely to be more sustainable 0 580 than those in phu hiep 0 526 particularly the low ratios are found in both communes from the households having good living means 0 367 versus 0 300 and the households expanding their land area in the last five years 0 030 versus 0 167 for the financial capital households in phu long may be more sustainable than those in phu hiep lcipl 0 536 compared to lciph 0 459 specifically the household outcome of over 30 million vnd equivalent to us 1282 annually with triple rice production is quite low in phu hiep 0 300 for the natural capital households in both communes seem to have relatively good natural conditions supporting rice production lciph 0 643 compared to lcipl 0 667 however a low radio of households agreed that lands are not degraded over time lciph 0 330 compared to lcipl 0 200 and the long term hot weather and rains did not increase insect infection and decease to their rice crop over the past five years lciph 0 033 compared to lcipl 0 000 4 3 prospects challenges and adaptation options 4 3 1 prospects for flood based land use change from farmers perspectives fig 4 presents the proportion of agreement of households heads based on the two interview surveys of 2015 and 2019 in choosing land use options for their third crop during the flood seasons specifically the farmers were asked which land use options are suitable for the third crop season to sustain their livelihoods the 2015 survey data showed the high proportion of household heads 55 reported that they preferred cultivating rice in the flood season in contrast vegetables were the second option 29 and only 8 of household heads agreed to flood their fields with the same pattern the 2019 survey data revealed the highest proportion of agreement of the household heads 86 7 in flooding their rice fields in the third season a few factors explain the remarkable increase in acceptance level by farmers on the flood based rice production model first farmers experienced increasing rice cultivation challenges under a high dike system including soil and water pollution in particular farmers experienced rapid accumulation of pollutants in the rice fields due to heavy use of agro chemicals therefore they reported that exchanging water in and out of the fields during flood events is the only effective mechanism for flushing pollutants out of the rice fields furthermore farmers have to increase the amount of fertilizer to sustain rice yields over the years since the nutrient rich sediments carried by floods do not reach rice fields under the triple rice model tran et al 2018b the remaining portion of 13 3 of the household heads preferred rice and vegetables the survey data based on the two surveys indicated that the farmers perspective might change in terms of accepting the benefits of floodwater for sustainable livelihoods 4 3 2 prospects and challenges in adopting a new water management scheme perspectives of farmers based on focus group discussions are presented in terms of prospects and challenges in their rice based livelihoods under the existing water management scheme table 4 and fig 5 with the current water management scheme 8 rice crops in 3 years or 3 3 2 farmers reported that they have long experience in rice production but they had to deal with labor shortages and migration in recent years in terms of the social aspect farmers have suitable social activities i e training in agriculture organized by agriculture extension agencies and local social networking of farmer groups however they were worried about unreliable traders or companies for rice outputs regarding the physical aspect farmers responded that they have moral infrastructure systems however most farmers did not agree to implement a new water management scheme 5 rice crops in 2 years or 3 2 for the financial aspect although the triple rice cropping pattern has helped farmers earn additional income farmers especially smallholders had low net profit due to low selling rice prices and high input costs despite having a good state of nature farmers agricultural activities have undermined natural values i e land and water degradation overall farmers have good conditions but livelihoods are not sustainable particularly in terms of economic and environmental aspects table 4 despite farmer discussion on many challenges in the adoption of the new water management scheme five key challenges were highly perceived fig 5 first rice is a cultural crop of many local farmers second technologies skills and initial investments are a constraint for many farmers in adopting flood based crops third the new scheme would add more leisure time for rice farmers fourth most farmers stated that floods nowadays bring no or much fewer sediments than historical floods meanwhile they do not know what to do to earn money finally farmers informed that the market for flood based crops might be more unstable than rice if this crop will be developed at a large scale in the flood season 4 3 3 adaptation options our observation revealed that farmers had practiced flood based farming systems on their flooded fields along the main roads fig 6 these fields belong to the dike compartments flooded following the yearly schedule of the nvn scheme in these fields farmers have cultivated various water crop models such as fish aquaculture aquaculture mixed with coconut planted on the bank water mimosa and lotus or water lily and so on for the fish aquaculture model earth low dike polders were made before the flooding and some farmers used the polder banks to cultivate coconut or vegetables for the models of mimosa lotus or water lily farmers used small areas of their rice fields to plant these crops 5 discussion 5 1 key findings our assessment of farming households using the dfid framework shows the relatively good status of the farmers livelihood sustainability all the average scores for livelihood capital indices are above 0 4 suggesting no critical bottleneck in the livelihood system the indices however also show a certain degree of differentiation amongst the capitals and amongst the sub indices regarding the capitals social and financial capitals show relatively lower scores this differentiation is explained by the limited role of social networks in sustaining and improving local livelihoods in phu hiep for example less than 50 of the households participate in a social organization such as the farmer union or women association in this case limited participation in social networks impedes the farmers abilities to exchange and learn from each other to improve their daily farming activities which could create inequalities between social groups and increase the social exclusion of the non skilled and the poor hoang et al 2006 additionally market instability also creates a critical limitation in the assessed farming communities tran et al 2018b during focus group discussion many farmers reported that they experience challenges created by low and unstable selling prices for rice table 4 as found by tran et al 2018b that ranked the market stability as the most important factor contributing to rice based farmers livelihood sustainability lastly it should be noted that some well performing capitals also exhibit limitations in certain aspects for instance while natural capital performs relatively well many farmers also expressed their concerns about environmental degradation caused by intensive use of agrochemicals and by reducing the natural sedimentation nurturing the rice fields kien 2014 tran and weger 2017 it could clarify our findings revealed that the farmers perspectives were changed from 2015 to 2019 by accepting the benefits of floodwater for sustainable livelihoods given these differentiations we recommend analyzing the sub indices instead of focusing on the average capital performance looking beyond the farmers livelihood further into the three original pillars of the sustainability concept environmental economy and social a contrasting inference might be drawn firstly triple rice and many other monoculture farming practices are based on the model of industrial agriculture which inherently disregards the dynamics of living ecosystems of approaches essentially the back to back crops that depend on the heavy doses of crop protection agrochemicals inflict irreversible damages to the environment such as water contamination soil nutrient depletion and loss of biodiversity isenring 2010 li et al 2020 pfiffner and balmer 2011 tan et al 2020 economic wise even though rice is the country s pivotal crop one of the world s key staple foods the rice farmers are constantly prone to poverty the paradox relates to the network of intermediate dealers who efficiently hamper the selling prices as shared by one of the farmer respondents this also explains why rice farmers mean net profit remains relatively constant over the five years based on our data analysis finally the farmers lack the power to negotiate over prices that could sustain their livelihoods many fall into cycles of indebtedness that may eventually force the farmers to sell their lands to major domestic and external investors which in turn triggers the migration from rural to urban areas dun 2011 huy 2009 creating serious issues for both communes while the latter will be forced to absorb additional laborers coming from the countryside the former gradually transform into neo colonies in which large scaled corporate ones gradually sabotage mid sized family farms our discussion with farmers on feasible practices and expansions of flood based crops shows that while such farming practices contribute to livelihood sustainability there are challenges regarding both financial and technical perspectives new farming practices require up front investments which can turn out to be unaffordable for farming households for instance many farmers indicated that they would need wooden boats for navigation and transportation of farming equipment during the flood season which they cannot afford these reasons are in line with our findings on the limited financial capacity based on the dfid assessment furthermore the spatial expansion of flood based farming is also challenging due to a short time floodwater duration of a couple of months during the rainy season our observation and mapping of flood based farming practices also point in the same direction where this particular farming system is only implemented along the main river fig 6 historically the region s soil and water management system is highly conditioned towards intensive rice farming tran and weger 2017 these past legacies make it difficult to shift to more flood based farming practices although transitioning towards more flood based farming practices in the rainy seasons could enhance the flood resilience nguyen and james 2013 limited motivation to transition into more flood based farming practices in the research area also relates to the farmers perspectives that the third rice crop has brought extra proﬁt with less risks tran et al 2019 farmers expressed their need for technical assistance to get ready to implement alternative crops such as water plants or fish farming during the flood season one of the vital constraints to flood based farming is the lack of stable markets for flood based crops such as lotus water lily and water mimosa it should also be noted that important challenges under triple rice production such as decreasing farming profits and higher demands for agro chemicals represent strong motives for transitioning towards flood based rice farming tran et al 2018b although a new scheme of water management of 3 2 could help to maximize field based floodwater storage this replacement for the scheme of 3 3 2 has not been fully supported by farmers farmers prefer triple rice production because this ensures their work and income are more equally spread over the year joep 2015 farmers also do not see floodwaters bringing similar benefits in terms of nutrient sediments and wild fish as before another reason for preferring a more intensive cropping calendar is that it keeps the farmers more occupied during the whole year and thus keeps them away from social problems like gambling and drinking associated with increased leisure time joep 2015 finally farmers have not yet developed the skills that the flood based crops require and are thus reluctant to shift to more flood based farming systems additionally the flood based crops require more labor sources than rice which are shrinking because young and skilled people have moved out of the region seeking better jobs therefore the government should carefully consider the pros and cons of the two schemes and ensure higher benefits for farmers if the new water management scheme of 3 2 cycle is applied 5 2 limitation and future outlook we have put considerable effort into assessing triple rice farmers livelihood sustainability and the feasibility of expanding flood based cropping alternatives however three limitations could be noted for future work first interviews might be carried out with local farmers who have been practicing flood based crops along the main roads to explicitly explain their social technical and financial difficulties and benefits in cultivation second focus group discussion meetings in other communes of phu tan district could consolidate our findings third the methodological framework of livelihood sustainability of dfid applied in this study possibly presents a theory based story under sustainability criteria assessment therefore it is recommended to transfer the method to the other vmd floodplain regions for dynamic adoption innovation however the study has presented an operational analytical framework for immediate findings to accommodate long term dynamics monitoring referring to past observations our findings could provide baseline information for future research to investigate a mechanism in developing a market sustainable for crop production in the vmd floodplains based on our research findings farmers showed their willingness to transform their triple rice crop to a new agricultural model i e flood based plants if their products are completely sold economic benefits are ensured hence a model which connects agricultural output complement with value chains would provide a stable market and help localities change their land use transition perspectives for instance flood based farming systems under a value chain model might offer high and durable profits for the triple rice farmers farmers might also change rice crop patterns by adaptation options such as maximizing flood based crops along the road in the flood season besides it helps create jobs that ensure additional income for rice farmers when their fields are flooded 6 conclusions this study has used the sustainable livelihood framework to assess triple rice farmers livelihood changes particularly concerning a changed water management strategy in the vmd floodplains rice farmers livelihoods seem to be relatively sustainable but the study has also identified several constraints that would need to be addressed to enhance the environmental and economic assets of the farmers the selected case study areas under the north vam nao scheme were considered to be particularly suitable for analyzing the potential for expanding the implementation of the more flood based cropping systems specifically the water management scheme following of 8 crop 3 year 3 3 2 scheme was evaluated to be replaced by the even more flood based systems of 5 crop 2 year system 3 2 scheme the findings of this study lead to the following conclusions the livelihood sustainability of farmers should be examined not only by overall indicators but also by specific indicators based on farmers perspectives for instance the of the overall indicators sustainability score are 0 508 and 0 562 for the two studied communes whereas the scores are lower in terms of social 0 291 and 0 324 and financial capitals 0 300 and 0 673 besides the perspectives of farmers could be explicitly understood if the observation discussion and data analysis are examined together our findings showed higher agreement levels by triple rice farmers 87 in the survey 2019 compared to those in 2015 8 on flooding their fields in the flood season positive outcomes from more flood based farming give a signal for developing more nature based adaptation measures instead of large scale dike based infrastructural schemes a more flood based and ecological friendly rice production is promising in terms of enhanced net profits and reduced land degradation since higher profits help to persuade farmers to cultivate two rice crops per year also many farmers might agree to flood their rice fields if they have other alternatives besides the flood based livelihoods the existing water management scheme has its prospects alongside challenges transitioning to a new system is challenging positive results from pilot projects could convince farmers to shift to the new system farmers are reluctant to shift from rice to other higher value crops unless there are clear market potentials for the new crops the new government policies have not immediately altered the existing water management scheme except for limited areas to make farmers motivated to shift to the new scheme the government could consider the following measures in the short term the following alternatives deserve more support crop rotation with new seeds two rice crops only but high quality varieties development of farmer friendly contracts between farmers and reliable traders innovative measures to enable pesticide and fertilizer reduction and creation of alternative of the farm work for farmers in the flood season in the long term the linkages between the state management agencies enterprises and farmers along the value chain in agricultural production should be strengthened and regulated by the government in ways that are supportive for farmers and the national food system whereas this study put a great effort into assessing rice farmers livelihood sustainability in the selected case study areas and the possible adoption of more flood based water management schemes two key points would benefit from further investigations we first believe that apart from looking for replicating our methods in investigating more interviews with rice farmers in other areas future research should then look for examining perspectives of local officials scientists and policy makers against farmers views regarding the research problems these will help develop an effective flood based water management strategy for the

10426,helleh river a southern vital agricultural ecosystem in iran has been suffering from both water shortage and quality degradation in recent decades to deal with the problems different stakeholders have been suggesting the central government some compartment development plans including construction of dams and irrigation districts installation of modern irrigation technologies and modification of crop patterns and irrigation leaching strategies accordingly this paper proposes a generic novel hydro economic methodology for basin scale optimal planning of an integrated development scheme for helleh river basin mentioned measures in different spatial scales from farm level to basin level as well as distinct time horizons of short term and long term are holistically evaluated and optimized based on technical hydrologic agronomic and economic aspects in this regard a water allocation simulation model i e weap software improved here by some extra modules for salt routing and economic evaluation in python programming environment is coupled with an optimization algorithm i e particle swarm optimization which results in a new holistic hydro economic simulation optimization tool results demonstrate the economic efficiency of constructing three new dams improvement and development of 19930 ha ha of irrigation area irrigation technology and strategy change and crop pattern modification furthermore results show that optimizing irrigation leaching schedule leads to significant improvement of the economic value of water compared to the status quo while construction and operation of structural projects result in a dramatic decrease in the economic value of water due to increase in both costs and leaching related water usage we discuss how irrigation technology improvement in salinity affected basin may lead to a decrease in the economic value of water moreover we advocate for the application of deficit irrigation strategy while respecting salt leaching requirements and cultivation of lower water consuming crops results demonstrate how reservoirs operation takes a minor role in the regulation of rivers salinity while we anticipate a

to examine the effects of using more water efficient irrigation systems and trade in water rights on the environmental performance of irrigation enterprises in the mooki catchment within the murray darling basin recently levers et al 2019 evaluated the impacts of water purchase and transfer strategies from colorado river s irrigation water rights holders to the salton sea a critical ecological resource through developing a hydro economic model that accounts for essential field level agro hydrologic processes related to crop production irrigation and salinity review of the existing literature discussed above demonstrated the efforts to investigate different aspects of farm of field level salinity management strategies the review showed that researches on the hydro economic evaluation of basin scale salinity related water management measures are more limited compared to farm of field level researches accordingly here in this paper we propose an integrated basin scale hydro economic model for evaluation of the impacts of constructing structural measures and implementing non structural strategies related to land and water management in the presence of irrigation induced salinity condition we develop a holistic simulation optimization methodology coupling weap water evaluation and planning software and particle swarm optimization pso which accounts for farm scale salt and water processes and strategies as well as basin scale river reservoir water salt routing and related management measures while in recent years researchers made successful efforts on the development of catchment level weap based hydro economic models in distinct compartment blanco gutierrez et al 2013 esteve et al 2015 forni et al 2016 and holistic fraga et al 2017 categories the model that we develop here has distinct novel features mostly related to the development of weap based salinity modeling modules for both farm and catchment scales integration of structural measures and salt water related management strategies as well as the new approach coupling pso and weap the developed methodology is applied to a real case study in iran i e helleh river basin hrb where we intend both short term and long term planning for the optimal capacity design of infrastructure measures i e dams and irrigation districts and technologies as well as optimal design of farm and basin level management strategies and policies i e crop patterns irrigation leaching strategies reservoir operation and water allocation based on technical hydrologic agronomic and economic aspects parameters of the model are estimated based on the river discharge and salinity records 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area management of rivers located in the southern part of iran with an arid or semi arid climate normally suffers from both water scarcity and quality degradation over recent decades the situation has been worsening due to human activities associated with water use as well as climate and land use change helleh river a vital ecosystem incorporating 13500 ha of date orchards as well as more than 45 000 ha of irrigated cultivation and emptying into helleh coastal wetland is among the aforementioned saline rivers where the river basin in spreads over neighboring fars and boushehr provinces respectively in upstream and downstream parts and consists of two main branches of shapour and dalaki and empties into the persian gulf fig 1 shows the schematic view of helleh river basin hrb system including the location of demand sites existing and developing infrastructures and hydrometric gauges while irrigation is the main secondary source of salinity in hrb there are many primary sources of salinity including salt domes diapirs saline geological formations of gachsaran and mishan and salinity structures in some parts of the river bed the main source of primary salinity of shapour river is a highly saline tributary river named shour river abgeer 2014 flowing into the stream after boushigan hydrometric gauge geological formations of shour river mainly include gachsaran mishan and aghajari formations which are all saline formations constitute near 90 of the geology of shour river and therefore they are the most important sources of natural salinity streams of shour river catchment rezaei et al 2019 fig 2 shows annual data series of river discharge and salinity in terms of electrical conductivity for three important sites including chorom dam located upstream of shapour river after the connection of boushigan and sour branches sarghanat hydrometric station located upstream of dalaki and kolal hydrometric station located downstream of helleh river while sites located upstream i e chorom and sarghanat characterize the natural flow the site located downstream i e kolal represents the effects of both natural regimes and management activities the figure clearly indicates the existence of decreasing trends in river discharge as well as increasing trends in river salinity for all sites which exhibits signs of water shortage and quality degradation to deal with hrb s recent worsening trends of both water shortage and quality degradation different stakeholders have been suggesting the government some compartment development plans including infrastructure measures of constructing dams table 1 and irrigation districts table 2 installation of modern irrigation technologies change of crop patterns and irrigation strategies and employing soil salinity control programs it is worth mentioning that the majority of water consumption in hrb as illustrated by fig 1 is related to agricultural water use and most of water demand is supplied by surface water resources regarding hrb system here in this paper we intend 1 determining optimal combination of structural measures and management strategies for a long term planning horizon 2 determining optimal operation policies for short term stages of implementing the optimal long term plan accordingly in section 4 2 a mathematical programming formulation is proposed for both long term and short term planning 2 1 1 development stages given that the long term scheme incorporates several time consuming infrastructure projects based on subjective judgment its implementation in this study was divided into 4 short term stages the zeroth stage of development abbreviated by zsd is a baseline for comparing other stages and represents a condition without implementation of any project the first stage of development abbreviated by fsd indicates a condition of constructing dalaki dam and improvement development of irrigation districts located downstream of both dalaki and rais ali delvari dams in the following of fsd the second stage of development abbreviated by ssd represents the construction of nargesi dam and improvement development of irrigation districts located downstream of the dam the third stage of development abbreviated by tsd incorporates the implementation of entire long term plan which in addition to ssd related measures includes construction of chorom dam as well as improvement development of its downstream irrigation districts 2 1 2 hydro meteorological conditions to analysis the effects of different hydro meteorological conditions we utilized 7 year moving average of long term annual time series of river discharge fig 2 to characterize and export two 5 year short term periods with dry and normal hydro meteorological conditions respectively named dhmc and nhmc therefore we selected 5 year short term periods of 1976 1980 as dhmc and 2006 2010 as nhmc under the status quo while during dhmc the long term average of river discharge ec for shapour river at chorom site and dalaki river at sarghanat site respectively equal 11 54 3 56 and 10 57 9 57 m3 s 1 ds m 1 during nhmc the long term average of river discharge ec for mentioned sites of shapour and dalaki rivers respectively equal 15 55 3 17 and 14 48 4 72 m3 s 1 ds m 1 2 1 3 hrb s main spatial divisions to better realize spatial effects we divide hrb system into 5 main regions the 1st region abbreviated by 1str is a reach of shapour river from chorom dam to rais ali delvari dam and incorporates khesht s agricultural area as well as khesht s date palm orchards the 2nd region abbreviated by 2ndr is related to a reach of dalaki

located downstream of dalaki dam the 5th region abbreviated by 5thr is on helleh river from shapour dalaki connection point to helleh lagoon coastal wetland and includes kolal helleh and mohammadieh irrigation districts 2 2 mathematical program 2 2 1 objective function 2 2 1 1 long term planning by the long term planning we aim for basin wide aggregate economic efficiency therefore the objective function represents maximization of long run net benefit from constructing and operating dam and irrigation district projects and is expressed by the below equation 1 m a x i m i z e n p v a p n b d c i d c p n l where n p v represents the net present value a p n b denotes the net benefit associated with the agricultural production d c stands for costs related to dams construction and operation i d c represents costs of irrigation districts construction and operation and p n l is a penalty term due to water deficit or insufficient water supply related to other demands domestic industrial etc in the following mentioned terms are defined in more detail based on functions of decision variables based on dividing each irrigation district into several smaller single crop irrigation units iu s each with its own agro economic properties irrigation technology and operation basin wide benefit of the agricultural production achieved by crops sale minus production costs is formulated as 2 a p n b i 1 i y 1 y γ y u 1 u i a i u y p e i u y y a i u y s i u s ˆ i u p c i u y where i y and u are indices associated with irrigation districts yearly time periods and iu s n i represents the total number of irrigation districts y is the total number of yearly time steps and u i stands for the total number of iu s that the i th irrigation district incorporates furthermore γ is a discounting factor that depends on the discount rate a denotes a vector of decision variables associated with iu s cultivation area p e stands for the unit price of the crop yield y a represents actual crop yield per unit area and p c denotes production cost per unit area also for each iu decision variables of irrigation leaching strategy incorporate two typical values of the relative soil moisture at the root zone of the unit i e 1 intervention point s and 2 target level s ˆ the term associated with irrigation districts costs include both construction and operation costs and is calculated in terms of decision variables associated with the total irrigated area of each irrigation district the term related to dams costs incorporate both construction and operation costs and is calculated in terms of decision variables associated with the active capacity of each reservoir supposing that water users excepting irrigation including ecosystem protection as well as municipal and industrial water consumption are taken into account through a priority based water allocation scheme here we consider a penalty term to account for shortage in supplying these water users demands as below 3 p n l α p e n a l t y p 1 c o v m i n p where c o v m i n p is the minimum coverage related to the demand sites associated with the p th priority level and α p is a penalty factor 2 2 1 2 short term planning in practice implementation of the long term development plan is divided into some short term planning stages where at each stage the planner may seek overall economic efficiency of basin scale water allocation crop pattern planning and irrigation scheduling taking into account different hydro meteorological conditions accordingly for short term planning we take an objective function which represents maximization of short run net benefit from the operation of dam and irrigation district projects and is expressed by the below equation 4 m a x i m i z e n p v a p n b p n l where a p n b denotes the net benefit associated with the agricultural production and is declared using eq 2 with only a small discrepancy that the total number of yearly time steps y equals the short term horizon the penalty term due to water deficit or insufficient water supply to domestic industrial demands is defined based on eq 3 2 2 2 crop yield constraint the actual crop yield is affected by both water and salinity stresses and is proposed as a function of some agronomic parameters and decision variables doorenbos and kassam 1979 ayers and westcot 1985 letey et al 1985 shalhevet 1994 as follows 5 y a i u y y m i u y 1 k y i u 1 v e t a i u y s i u s ˆ i u v e t p i u y 1 b i u 100 k y i u c i u y s s i u s ˆ i u c t i u y i u where y and u are indices associated with yearly time periods and iu s y m represents the maximum crop yield k y stands for a factor representing the crop sensitivity to water stress v e t a denotes the cumulative actual evapotranspiration integrated over the growing season as a function of irrigation leaching related decision variables v e t p represents the cumulative potential evapotranspiration integrated over the growing season b is a regression factor representing the crop sensitivity to salinity stress c s stands for over year average of the salt concentration of the saturation extract in the root zone as a function of irrigation leaching related decision variables c t is a threshold value of the salt concentration above which the crop yield is less than the potential yield it is worth noting that the crop yield model does not consider the effect of excessive water anoxic condition on reduction of evapotranspiration the supplementary material incorporates more detail on v e t a and v e t p 2 2 3 crop pattern constraints in an irrigation district the cultivation area of each iu as a share of the total area of the district is defined by the following set of equations 6 a i u y β i u y a t i i u y where i and u are indices associated with irrigation districts and iu s and y is an index related to yearly time periods furthermore β i u stands for each iu s area share in the total area of the irrigation district so we need to have 7 u u i β i u y 1 i y additionally the cultivation area of each crop ranges from a lower bound l b i u to an upper bound u b i u 8 l b i u β i u u b i u i u these bounds are estimated based on technical and socio economic studies based on our assumption that only one single crop is cultivated in each iu these lower and upper bounds will actually be set on the areas of ius the total area of the irrigation district a t i must be less than or equal to the maximum cultivable land a m a x i 9 a t i a m a x i i 2 2 4 water balance constraints 2 2 4 1 reservoirs constraints related to reservoirs include the water balance equation upper and lower bound limits on reservoir storage evaporation function operation policy and spillage consideration the supplementary material incorporates more detail on equations as well as constraints 2 2 4 2 irrigation districts water balance in irrigation districts is based on soil moisture dynamics for each iu at a seasonal time scale and is modeled by treating the active soil of crop root zone as a reservoir with an effective storage capacity that is filled by rainfall and demand based irrigation events and empties by evapotranspiration leakage and surface runoff the dynamic is expressed by 10 s i u y t 1 s i u y t 1 φ i u z r i u r i u y t i i u y t e t i u y t l i u y t q i u y t i u y t where i and u are indices associated with irrigation districts and iu s y and t are indices associated with yearly and seasonal time periods φ is the soil porosity z r is the active soil depth s is the relative soil moisture which varies between 0 at the wilting point and 1 at the soil saturation point the system inputs are rainfall r and infiltrated irrigation i the soil moisture losses or the system outputs are actual evapotranspiration e t leakage due to both rainfall and irrigation l and surface runoff caused by rainfall q the supplementary material incorporates more detail on how these terms are considered in mathematical programming framework it is worth mentioning that the actual evapotranspiration is expressed as a piece wise linear function of soil moisture hale and orcutt 1987 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 so that the actual evapotranspiration increases basically from zero at wilting point s 0 up to a maximum value e t p at the point of incipient stomatal closure s after which it remains constantly at e t p for higher soil moisture values the leakage is considered in a simplified manner as a piece wise linear function of the relative soil moisture alizadeh and mousavi 2013 which diminishes for soil moisture levels lower than field capacity given that the term associated with infiltrated irrigation at the right hand side of equation 21 represents the seasonal depth of irrigation water applied to crop root zone it must be less than irrigation requirement as below 11 i i u y t i r i u y t i u y t where i r stands for farm scale irrigation requirement that is formulated in the next section 2 2 4 3 irrigation requirement constraints farm scale net irrigation requirement is formulated regarding a demand based irrigation scheme which can distinguish between different irrigation technologies i e traditional and modern techniques as well as irrigation strategies i e from rainfed agriculture to stress avoidance irrigation covering different levels of deficit irrigation vico and porporato 2011 two irrigation related decision variables briefly introduced in section 4 2 1 1 are actually key parameters of the scheme and characterize both of the technology and the strategy in the demand based irrigation an application is triggered when the relative soil moisture reaches the intervention point s with aid of restoring the target level s ˆ the depth of water supplied by each irrigation application is proportional to the difference between the target level and the intervention point i e φ z r s ˆ s irrigation depth is a key factor characterizing the type of traditional irrigation technology and depends on properties of soil i e porosity and crop i e root depth e g irrigation depth usually exceeds 50 mm and often 100 mm for basin irrigation a type of surface irrigation systems and vary from 5 mm to 30 mm for center pivot a kind of sprinkler technology trout and kincaid 2007 accordingly a constraint on the minimum irrigation depth can be used as below 12 m i n d m i n i u φ i u z r i u 1 s w i u φ i u z r i u s ˆ i u s i u i u t i u i where t i u i represents a collection of iu s which belong to the i th irrigation district and where traditional technologies are applied in fact both irrigation technology as well as soil crop type restricts minimum applied depth accordingly the term at the right hand side of the above inequality i e d m i n i u represents technology implications for minimum irrigation depth while the term φ i u z r i u 1 s w i u shows effects of soil crop limitations on minimum irrigation depth where s w represents relative soil moisture at wilting point micro irrigation technology corresponds to the case in which 13 s ˆ i u s i u i u m i u i where m i u i represents a collection of iu s which belong to the i th irrigation district and where modern technologies are applied to characterize different irrigation strategies including rainfed agriculture deficit irrigation and stress avoidance irrigation the intervention point is supposed to take continuous values ranging from zero associated with rainfed strategy to relative soil moisture associated with incipient stomatal closure point s related to stress avoidance strategy as expressed by 14 0 s i u s i u i u accordingly the mathematical program s solution will result in the best optimal strategy for each iu s which is selected from a range of different possible strategies while the optimum value of the target level is essential in characterizing irrigation strategy it takes a key role in determining the salt leaching strategy by means of over irrigation which coincide with the condition of s f c i u s ˆ i u where s f c stands for relative soil moisture at the field capacity there is a logical constraint stating that as below the target level always must be set greater than and equal to the intervention point as below 15 s i u s ˆ i u i u according to the described irrigation scheme the supplementary material expresses how farm scale irrigation requirement i r i u y t can be considered in the framework of mathematical programming 2 2 4 4 water allocation constraints constraints related to priority based supplying water demands are expressed below 16 s d i y t d i y t i y t 17 c o v m i n p y t s d i y t d i y t p i d s p where i represents an index related to demand sites including municipal industrial and irrigation demand and y and t represent yearly and seasonal time periods p shows the priority level of a demand site d i y t represents the volume of water demand associated with the i th demand site in year y and season t and s d i y t is the volume of water allocated to the i th demand site in year y and season t d s p is the set of all demand sites whose priority level equals p inequality 16 guarantees that the volume of water allocated to a demand site is less than and equal to the water demand of the site the minimum coverage of water supply c o v m i n p related to all demand sites associated with the priority level p is met by inequality 17 it is worth mentioning that water demand of an agricultural demand site irrigation district in year y and season t equals u 1 u i a i u y i r i u y t μ i u where μ is an irrigation efficiency factor moreover water which is actually allocated to the site equals u 1 u i a i u y i i u y t μ i u 2 2 4 5 rivers nodes nodes on the river body from where water is withdrawn are classified into two categories of 1 nodes located exactly downstream of dams and 2 other nodes there are also nodes at which some incoming flow arrive river and these nodes are categorized into two classes of 1 nodes accepting tributary natural flows and 2 nodes accepting return flows from demand sites the supplementary material presents some equations for water balance at rivers nodes 2 2 5 salt balance constraints supposing that reservoirs are completely mixed we can express reservoirs salt balance by 18 c d y t 1 s s d y t 1 c d y t s s d y t c d y t q q d y t c d y t r r d y t d y t where d y and t are indices associated with dam s reservoir yearly time periods and seasonal time periods c s c q and c r respectively represent the salt concentration associated with the reservoir storage inflow and release the salt concentration of release is assumed to be equal to c d y t 1 s c d y t s 2 for all kinds of nodes on the river body where water is withdrawn from or arrived the supplementary material incorporates equations for salt balance the document describes how salt balance in irrigation districts based on salt accumulation dynamics for each iu at a seasonal time scale is modeled by treating the active soil of crop root zone as a reservoir that is filled by salt related to irrigation and empties by salt due to leakage 2 3 solution approach both the long term and short term planning problems are classified in the category of mixed integer non linear programs which are known as np hard problems without any generic approach to solving here we take a simulation optimization approach coupling a modular simulation model and an evolutionary algorithm based optimization model fig 3 illustrates a general view of the approach as seen the simulation model consists of four modules of 1 weap software sieber and purkey 2011 simulating basin scale water allocation as well as field scale soil moisture dynamics 2 salinity balance and routing 3 crop production and 4 economic evaluation furthermore particle swarm optimization pso algorithm clerc 2010 gao et al 2020 is utilized for the optimization part while all constraints proposed before in section 4 2 3 are considered in the framework pso algorithm during solution generation we take equations presented in section 4 2 1 for the economic evaluation module of the simulation model constraints proposed in sections 4 2 4 4 2 5 and 4 2 2 are respectively accounted for in the framework of weap the salinity routing and the crop production modules 2 4 sensitivity analysis and calibration as discussed in the preceding section the simulation optimization model applied to hrb includes two water allocation and salt routing modules whose parameters should be calibrated here we utilize the optimization module i e pso algorithm for calibration we employ a global sensitivity analysis procedure named vars developed by razavi and gupta 2016 to identify the most influential parameters prior to calibration here for hrb system both sensitivity analysis and calibration are based on minimizing a goodness of fit gof measure representing weighted sum of squared residuals between observation and simulation of both river discharge and salinity at three stream gauges of jareh bala saedabad and kolal the measure is expressed by 19 m i n i m i z e g 1 g t 1 t ω 1 g q g t s i m q g t o b s 2 ω 2 g c g t s i m c g t o b s 2 where g and t respectively represent indices for stream gauges and time periods s and t respectively stand for the total numbers of stream gauges and time periods ω 1 and ω 2 denote weights superscripts s i m and o b s respectively represent associated values of simulation and observation q is river discharge and c stands for the salinity concentration given that we run the model for a historical long time period of 41 years 1972 2012 we imported monthly time series of discharge related to natural head and tributary natural flows of hrb s system prepared by hydrological studies of tamavan 2014b application of the model to real hrb case requires monthly time series of river s salinity concentration which we prepared based on semi empirical discharge concentration model of o connor 1976 a function declaring river s salinity concentration c in terms of river discharge q as below 20 c c g q q 0 c g λ c g c s q 1 n q q 0 where the semi empirical function includes parameters of q 0 representing baseflow c s and c g denoting salinity concentrations respectively related to surface water and groundwater n an exponent parameter and λ which equals q 0 1 n however before utilization for each natural head and tributary flow parameters of the associated discharge concentration function needs to be tuned since discharge concentration records of most natural head and tributary streams of hrb system are not available here we have to do both sensitivity analysis and calibration for parameters of discharge concentration functions using vars and pso algorithms respectively given that hrb is a fully managed river system values of parameters related to land water management may have a significant influence on the value of the gof measure therefore crops cultivated area as well as irrigation related soil water levels are taken as parameters whose values are tuned using the sensitivity analysis and the calibration procedures to account for effects of field scale soil moisture dynamics on calibration results we considered some influential parameters of the weap model including runoff resistance factor r r f root zone s saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and root zone s water holding capacity r d accounting for all tributary streams and irrigation districts indicated by fig 2 115 parameters were first identified then a good parameterization scheme helped us to reduce the total number of influential parameters to 50 in the end based on the results of applying the vars algorithm parameters were ranked and 25 of the most effective parameters were identified fig 4 table 3 proposes results of calibration where values of different gof measures of nash sutcliff efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were presented moriasi et al 2015 conducted a thorough literature review on values reported for performance measures of water quantity quality modeling and concluded that for monthly temporal scale modeling values of nse absolute pbias greater less than 0 5 15 0 45 20 0 35 30 and 0 4 30 respectively for streamflow sediment nitrogen and phosphorous indicate acceptable model calibration accordingly based on the results indicated in table 3 we can state that the model was well fitted to discharge records as well as salinity records 3 results 3 1 hrb s optimal development scheme by means of implementing the long term optimization model we drew optimal water resource development scheme of hrb which is summarily proposed as below construction of chorom dalaki and nargesi dams with optimal normal water volumes of 43 5 305 5 and 76 8 million cubic meters respectively improvement and development of irrigation districts of dasht e gur siyah mansur agricultural area siyah mansur date palm orchards left bank gikh right bank gikh khesht and shabankareh with optimal areas of 1168 2700 179 1512 3604 1479 and 9289 ha respectively optimal usage of irrigation technologies 47 5 surface and 52 5 tape in siyah mansur date palm orchards 24 5 surface and 75 5 tape in siyah mansur agricultural area 48 surface and 52 sprinkler in left bank gikh and 50 surface and 50 sprinkler in right bank gikh 3 2 irrigation and leaching scheduling 3 2 1 long term fig 5 illustrates optimal irrigation strategies optimal values of the target level s ˆ and the intervention point s of each crop in each irrigation district it is worth mentioning that the upper triangular area in the figure where s ˆ s is actually the feasible space of irrigation strategies the feasible space is divided to 1 a light red colored area corresponding to deficit irrigation where s ˆ o r s s and 2 a light green colored area associated with stress avoidance irrigation where s ˆ s s the over irrigation strategy have been illustrated using the diagonally hatched area where s ˆ o r s s f c irrigation technologies can be distinguished using fig 5 while points on the bisector line i e s ˆ s represent micro irrigation points belong to other part of the feasible space i e s ˆ s illustrate traditional irrigation including furrow flood and sprinkler technologies according to fig 5 for 88 and 12 of hrb s irrigation units with micro irrigation technology mit we respectively recommend stress avoidance sa and deficit irrigation di strategies then the over irrigation s oi share is 38 of mit units we respectively recommend stress avoidance sa and deficit irrigation di strategies for 30 and 70 of hrb s irrigation units with traditional irrigation technology tit in which for 73 of tit units over irrigation oi strategy is suggested according to fig 5 only 3rdr includes mit units and we recommend sa di and oi for 80 20 and 30 of irrigation units of the region respectively for tit units the results suggest sa strategy for 1str and 4thr di strategy for 2ndr 3rdr and 5thr and oi strategy for whole iu s in3rdr 4thr and 5thr 75 of iu s in 1str and 50 of iu s in 2ndr to better characterize optimal irrigation strategies i e di di oi sa and sa oi fig 6 shows the long term basin scale average of annual water balance components as indicated by fig 6 we can see 95 and 113 increase in irrigation depth from di strategy to sa strategy for perennial and annual crops respectively according to fig 6 applying oi strategy for perennial and annual crops makes 31 and 40 increase in irrigation depth respectively fig 6 shows that evapotranspiration depth increases by 69 and 25 from di strategy to sa strategy for perennial and annual crops respectively finally we see that leakage depth increases by 11 and 84 when oi strategy is employed respectively for perennial and annual crops 3 2 2 short term comparing the left and right columns of fig 7 one can realize the effects of hydro meteorological conditions of the short term planning period on optimal irrigation strategies based on the comparison of fig 7a and b we can state that for zsd optimal sa di and oi strategies respectively recommended for 48 52 and 67 of tit irrigation units under dry condition change to 76 24 and 76 of units under the normal condition comparison of fig 7c and d for fsd indicates that there are similar percentages of optimal sa di and oi strategies in both types of irrigation technology i e mit and tit under the dry and normal conditions comparison of fig 7e and f shows that for ssd optimal sa di and oi strategies respectively recommended for 52 57 and 48 of tit irrigation units under dry condition change to 43 69 and 58 of units under the normal condition likewise comparing fig 7g and h we can see that for tsd optimal sa di and oi strategies respectively recommended for 56 44 and 33 of mit irrigation units under dry condition change to 100 0 and 78 of units under the normal condition these instances coincide with a reasonable expectation that the drier the hydro meteorological condition is the more units will be suggested to use di strategy comparing fig 7a and g we can state that optimal sa di and oi strategies respectively recommended for 50 50 and 54 of tit irrigation units at zsd change to 36 64 and 69 of units at tsd this has an important implication for hrb system s decision makers the more projects are constructing the more application of di oi strategies will be recommended 3 3 crop pattern planning fig 8 illustrates optimal crop patterns resulted from the short term model under different stages of development sod as well as two hydro meteorological conditions hmc and for various main regions of hrb system fig 8a shows that for 1str and under different cases of sod hmc optimal crop pattern fluctuates in ranges 40 42 26 40 7 20 and 5 12 for wheat tomato watermelon and sorghum respectively fig 8b indicates that for 2ndr and under different cases of sod hmc optimal crop pattern varies in ranges of 38 49 30 38 12 15 and 6 11 for tomato wheat sorghum and watermelon respectively fig 8c shows that for 3rdr and under different cases of sod hmc optimal crop pattern alters in ranges 62 70 10 21 6 20 and 0 18 for tomato wheat watermelon and sorghum respectively fig 8d shows that for 4thr and under different cases of sod hmc optimal crop pattern alters in ranges 57 61 7 30 5 19 and 4 12 for wheat tomato sorghum and water melon respectively under optimal development scheme it is clear that lower water consuming crops i e wheat and tomato have maximum shares of optimal crop pattern each for two regions of hrb and sorghum and water melon with higher water consumption have minimum shares for two regions of hrb using fig 8a we can compare zsd dhmc and zsd nmc cases for the 1str accordingly from the dry to the normal conditions crop pattern shares of watermelon and sorghum increase while tomato s share decreases and wheat s share does not significantly change based on fig 8b we can compare sod hmc cases of ssd dhmc and ssd nhmc for 2ndr hence from the dry to the normal conditions while crop pattern shares of wheat and watermelon increase sorghum s and tomato s shares decrease according to fig 8c one can compare zsd dhmc and zsd nhmc cases for 3rdr and see that from the dry to the normal conditions while crop pattern shares of wheat and sorghum increase watermelon s and tomato s shares decrease accordingly based on fig 8d we can compare sod hmc cases of zsd dhmc and zsd nhmc for the 4thr hence from the dry to the normal conditions while crop pattern shares of wheat increases while water melon s and sorghum s shares decrease and tomato s share remains almost constant finally for all 4 regions of hrb and from the dry to the normal conditions we can state that 1 wheat s share increases for three regions and remains constant in one 2 tomato s share decreases for three regions and remain constant in one and 3 both water melon s and sorghum s shares increase for two regions and decrease for two others using fig 8a we can compare zsd dhmc and tsd dhmc cases for the 1str to analyze the effects of construction and operation of chorom dam and khesht irrigation district on optimal crop pattern accordingly we can see that while wheat s and tomato s shares remain almost constant watermelon s share decreases and sorghum s share increases based on fig 8d one can compare sod hmc cases of zsd dhmc and fsd dhmc for the 4thr to assess the impact of construction and operation of dalaki dam and its downstream irrigation districts hence one can see that while crop pattern shares of wheat and tomato increase watermelon s share decrease and sorghum s share does not significantly change 3 4 salinity changes 3 4 1 dam operation impacts as indicated by fig 9 we expect that construction and operation of chorom and dalaki dams have no significant impacts on the river salinity while it is apparent that construction and operation of chorom lead to a slight regulation of the salinity concentration of shapour river construction and operation of dalaki dam results in a modest increase in the river salinity the impacts are associated with the reservoir s complete mixing and evaporation effects 3 4 2 root zone salinity change fig 10 illustrates short term over 5 year periods salinity of crop root zone where different sod hrb s main regions as well as crops are compared according to fig 10 we expect that the salt concentration in crop root zones to increase during the development of hrb from zsd to tsd this indicates the effect of more efficient water use during tsd compared to zsd and thus less salt leaching from crop root zones this is associated with a positive correlation between water and salt transports in basin scale graveline et al 2014 fig 10 shows how root zone salinity increases from hrb s upstream i e 1str and 2ndr to its downstream i e 5thr according to fig 10 in hrb system we expect higher levels of root zone s salinity concentration for perennial crops e g date palm compared to annual crops i e tomato and wheat 3 5 economic evaluation 3 5 1 long term according to the long term model s results we estimate hrb s aggregate net present value to be 19 514 billion irr iranian rial for the status quo while for the optimal development condition the model s results show that the value increases about 12 and reaches 21 858 billion irr under the optimal development condition the aggregate total benefit equals 35 529 billion irr where respectively 76 and 24 of the value corresponding to agricultural and municipal industrial benefits under the optimal development condition the sum of construction and operation costs is estimated to be 13 672 billion irr where 65 and 35 of the value relatively associates with dams and irrigation districts fig 11 illustrates the long term dynamics of the economic value of water evow under different conditions of status quo optimized irrigation and development by optimized irrigation we mean a condition when without any construction project only irrigation and leaching schedules are optimized according to fig 11 it is clear that optimizing irrigation leaching schedule leads to significant improvement of evow compared to the status quo due to the implementation of optimal deficit irrigation strategies and optimal leaching based salinity control programs on the contrary fig 11 shows that construction and operation of structural projects result in a dramatic decrease in evow due to an increase in construction and operation costs as well as the increase in water usage related to salinity control purposes as illustrated by fig 2 and stated in section 4 1 2 it is clear that 2006 2010 is a dry period and therefore a significant decline in the discharge of shapour and dalaki rivers in 2007 the 36th year and 2008 the 37th year is seen it is worth mentioning that we utilized the historic hydrologic condition time series of rivers discharge and salinity at hrb systems head flow for analyzing future development impacts therefore the hydro meteorological condition of the 37th year exactly coincides with the condition of historic year 2008 which lies in the dry period the decline in river discharge in 2008 is accompanied by salinity increase increase in over irrigation requirement for salinity control purposes and crop yield decline these are the main reasons for the markedly drop in water value in the 37th year 3 5 2 short term total irrigated agriculture s net benefit tianb of hrb system at zsd and under nhmc is estimated to be 9738 2 billion irr while it is decreased to 8159 5 under dhmc comparing the fsd compared to zsd tianb indicates an increase by 18 and 26 under nhmc and dhmc respectively likewise at ssd compared to zsd tianb increases by 29 and 40 under nhmc and dhmc respectively accordingly tianb at tsd compared to zsd increases by 37 and 46 relatively under nhmc and dhmc therefore we can obviously state that the development from zsd to tsd leads to an increase in tianb the trend from dhmc to nhmc reveals that hrb system experiences economic improvement so that 19 12 10 and 12 increases in tianb are estimated respectively for zsd fsd ssd and tsd fig 12 illustrates how structural projects and different hydro meteorological conditions affect evow usage in the cultivation of different crops according to fig 12 evow for the cultivation of most crops under both nhmc and dhmc is increasing from zsd to ssd due to the development and extending of irrigation areas while evow is decreasing from ssd to tsd under nhmc because of allocation of the extra volume of water for leaching and salinity control purposes fig 12 shows how evow increases even dramatically for some crops under dhmc compared to nhmc finally we can state that improvement in irrigation technology leads to an increase in the cultivation area of hrb as well as economic productivity enhancement while some demand sites with modern irrigation technology may have lower evow 4 discussion given that hrb s development faces challenges of water shortage and quality degradation we dealt with the optimal design of water resource development scheme of hrb which incorporates both infrastructural projects and management policies while accounting for soil salinity control programs moreover we took account of a long term planning horizon divided into some short term stages and assessed two dry and normal hydro meteorological conditions effects finally this paper proposes a generic novel hydro economic simulation optimization tool for basin scale optimal planning of an integrated development scheme including infrastructural measures as well as operational policies and strategies our research can be compared with some similar works where only simulation focused e g kirby et al 2013 farm level measures ignored e g qureshi et al 2013 or structural projects with long term effects were not dealt with e g rosegrant et al 2000 mainuddin et al 2007 mirchi et al 2018 briefly we advocated for the construction of three new dams i e chorom dalaki and nargesi dams with normal water volumes of 43 5 305 5 and 76 8 million cubic meters respectively improvement and development of seven irrigation districts with a total area of nearly 20 000 ha irrigation technology and strategy change and crop pattern modification while we mainly recommended sa irrigation strategy for mit units we chiefly advised di oi strategy for tit units due to both water scarcity limitations and salinity control requirements crop pattern modification was suggested so that crops with lower water consumption i e wheat and tomato should be cultivated more than sorghum and watermelon with higher water consumption under the optimal full development condition we expect a minor regulation in rivers salinity due to reservoirs operation which is mainly related to reservoirs complete mixing and evaporation effects on the contrary we anticipate an increase in the salt concentration of crop root zones due to more efficient water use indeed it is foreseen that the root zone salinity increases from hrb s upstream to its downstream and higher levels of root zone salinity take place for perennial crops compared to annual crops while hydro economic comparison of basin scale water resource infrastructural projects and management policies was not focused by similar studies e g rosegrant et al 2000 mainuddin et al 2007 qureshi et al 2013 kirby et al 2013 mirchi et al 2018 in this paper two different strategies of the optimized irrigation and the development were assessed and compared by optimized irrigation we meant a condition when only irrigation and leaching schedules are optimized while we assumed that development strategy also incorporated construction of structural projects results showed that while both strategies lead to dynamic economic improvement compared to the status quo the development is better than the optimized irrigation from an economic efficiency point of view it is worth mentioning that status of the development of hrb is comparable to some similar case studies e g graveline et al 2014 where costs of infrastructural projects were not compensated by the increase in regional agricultural income taking a closer look to derived results indicated that while construction and operation of structural projects result in a dramatic decrease in economic water value due to increase in construction and operation costs as well as the increase in water usage related to salinity control purposes optimizing only irrigation leaching schedule leads to significant improvement of evow compared to both of the status quo and the development strategy sensitivity analysis on the obtained results indicated that with 20 increase in project construction and agricultural production costs and 20 decrease in crops sale prices the optimal solution still remains economically feasible we took account of some short term stages of development and showed how hrb s system should be gradually changed in response to development measures from zsd coinciding with the status quo to tsd corresponding to the full development condition we recommend irrigation leaching strategies to chiefly change from sa to di oi we advise wheat s and tomato s cultivation area remain almost constant while we suggest watermelon s cultivation area to decrease and sorghum s cultivation area to increase we expect the salt concentration of crops root zones to increase during the development of hrb from zsd to tsd due to more efficient water use and therefore less salt leaching from crop root zones during tsd compared to zsd based on results we can state that the development from zsd to tsd leads to an increase in tianb while the development results in the decrease of evow due to the allocation of the extra volume of water for salinity control purposes effects of different hydro meteorological conditions on development of hrb were another subject that we assessed shifting from dhmc to nhmc we advocate for change in irrigation leaching strategies from di to sa oi in the same way for crop patterns while we suggest tomato s cultivation area to decrease and wheat s cultivation area to increase we advise watermelon s and sorghum s cultivation areas remain almost constant from dhmc to nhmc we can see that tianb moderately increases while evow increases even dramatically for some crops our results demonstrated that some demand sites with modern irrigation technology had lower evow compared to demand sites with traditional irrigation technology however these results are consistent with findings of medellín azuara et al 2010 which emphasized that technological improvement while unambiguously increasing farm revenues is not necessarily accompanied by an increase in evow because in some cases water is worthless for the farm as improved technology may demand less water for particular crop combinations on the other hand results of our study showed that modern technologies compared to traditional ones might lead to more root zone s salt accumulation which might have negative effects on crop yield and farm revenue this is in accordance with the findings of lecina et al 2010 and graveline et al 2014 accordingly we can state that irrigation technology improvement in salinity affected basins like hrb may lead to more decrease in evow 5 conclusion this paper aimed to determine optimal design of a development scheme for a salinity affected irrigated agricultural system while we considered different structural projects and non structural measures policies in the mentioned system there are some other important demand management e g water market and pricing and supply enhancement measures e g desalination which can be taken into account in future studies we only focused on some limited economic aspects such as economic efficiency and value of water and thus we recommend for developing the proposed methodology to account for social environmental and ecological viewpoints there are many sources of uncertainty whose analysis was left for future works while we studied salt transport and management of a river reservoir system some important water bodies such as groundwater and wetland can be focused in future declaration of competing

10426,helleh river a southern vital agricultural ecosystem in iran has been suffering from both water shortage and quality degradation in recent decades to deal with the problems different stakeholders have been suggesting the central government some compartment development plans including construction of dams and irrigation districts installation of modern irrigation technologies and modification of crop patterns and irrigation leaching strategies accordingly this paper proposes a generic novel hydro economic methodology for basin scale optimal planning of an integrated development scheme for helleh river basin mentioned measures in different spatial scales from farm level to basin level as well as distinct time horizons of short term and long term are holistically evaluated and optimized based on technical hydrologic agronomic and economic aspects in this regard a water allocation simulation model i e weap software improved here by some extra modules for salt routing and economic evaluation in python programming environment is coupled with an optimization algorithm i e particle swarm optimization which results in a new holistic hydro economic simulation optimization tool results demonstrate the economic efficiency of constructing three new dams improvement and development of 19930 ha ha of irrigation area irrigation technology and strategy change and crop pattern modification furthermore results show that optimizing irrigation leaching schedule leads to significant improvement of the economic value of water compared to the status quo while construction and operation of structural projects result in a dramatic decrease in the economic value of water due to increase in both costs and leaching related water usage we discuss how irrigation technology improvement in salinity affected basin may lead to a decrease in the economic value of water moreover we advocate for the application of deficit irrigation strategy while respecting salt leaching requirements and cultivation of lower water consuming crops results demonstrate how reservoirs operation takes a minor role in the regulation of rivers salinity while we anticipate a

to examine the effects of using more water efficient irrigation systems and trade in water rights on the environmental performance of irrigation enterprises in the mooki catchment within the murray darling basin recently levers et al 2019 evaluated the impacts of water purchase and transfer strategies from colorado river s irrigation water rights holders to the salton sea a critical ecological resource through developing a hydro economic model that accounts for essential field level agro hydrologic processes related to crop production irrigation and salinity review of the existing literature discussed above demonstrated the efforts to investigate different aspects of farm of field level salinity management strategies the review showed that researches on the hydro economic evaluation of basin scale salinity related water management measures are more limited compared to farm of field level researches accordingly here in this paper we propose an integrated basin scale hydro economic model for evaluation of the impacts of constructing structural measures and implementing non structural strategies related to land and water management in the presence of irrigation induced salinity condition we develop a holistic simulation optimization methodology coupling weap water evaluation and planning software and particle swarm optimization pso which accounts for farm scale salt and water processes and strategies as well as basin scale river reservoir water salt routing and related management measures while in recent years researchers made successful efforts on the development of catchment level weap based hydro economic models in distinct compartment blanco gutierrez et al 2013 esteve et al 2015 forni et al 2016 and holistic fraga et al 2017 categories the model that we develop here has distinct novel features mostly related to the development of weap based salinity modeling modules for both farm and catchment scales integration of structural measures and salt water related management strategies as well as the new approach coupling pso and weap the developed methodology is applied to a real case study in iran i e helleh river basin hrb where we intend both short term and long term planning for the optimal capacity design of infrastructure measures i e dams and irrigation districts and technologies as well as optimal design of farm and basin level management strategies and policies i e crop patterns irrigation leaching strategies reservoir operation and water allocation based on technical hydrologic agronomic and economic aspects parameters of the model are estimated based on the river discharge and salinity records 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area management of rivers located in the southern part of iran with an arid or semi arid climate normally suffers from both water scarcity and quality degradation over recent decades the situation has been worsening due to human activities associated with water use as well as climate and land use change helleh river a vital ecosystem incorporating 13500 ha of date orchards as well as more than 45 000 ha of irrigated cultivation and emptying into helleh coastal wetland is among the aforementioned saline rivers where the river basin in spreads over neighboring fars and boushehr provinces respectively in upstream and downstream parts and consists of two main branches of shapour and dalaki and empties into the persian gulf fig 1 shows the schematic view of helleh river basin hrb system including the location of demand sites existing and developing infrastructures and hydrometric gauges while irrigation is the main secondary source of salinity in hrb there are many primary sources of salinity including salt domes diapirs saline geological formations of gachsaran and mishan and salinity structures in some parts of the river bed the main source of primary salinity of shapour river is a highly saline tributary river named shour river abgeer 2014 flowing into the stream after boushigan hydrometric gauge geological formations of shour river mainly include gachsaran mishan and aghajari formations which are all saline formations constitute near 90 of the geology of shour river and therefore they are the most important sources of natural salinity streams of shour river catchment rezaei et al 2019 fig 2 shows annual data series of river discharge and salinity in terms of electrical conductivity for three important sites including chorom dam located upstream of shapour river after the connection of boushigan and sour branches sarghanat hydrometric station located upstream of dalaki and kolal hydrometric station located downstream of helleh river while sites located upstream i e chorom and sarghanat characterize the natural flow the site located downstream i e kolal represents the effects of both natural regimes and management activities the figure clearly indicates the existence of decreasing trends in river discharge as well as increasing trends in river salinity for all sites which exhibits signs of water shortage and quality degradation to deal with hrb s recent worsening trends of both water shortage and quality degradation different stakeholders have been suggesting the government some compartment development plans including infrastructure measures of constructing dams table 1 and irrigation districts table 2 installation of modern irrigation technologies change of crop patterns and irrigation strategies and employing soil salinity control programs it is worth mentioning that the majority of water consumption in hrb as illustrated by fig 1 is related to agricultural water use and most of water demand is supplied by surface water resources regarding hrb system here in this paper we intend 1 determining optimal combination of structural measures and management strategies for a long term planning horizon 2 determining optimal operation policies for short term stages of implementing the optimal long term plan accordingly in section 4 2 a mathematical programming formulation is proposed for both long term and short term planning 2 1 1 development stages given that the long term scheme incorporates several time consuming infrastructure projects based on subjective judgment its implementation in this study was divided into 4 short term stages the zeroth stage of development abbreviated by zsd is a baseline for comparing other stages and represents a condition without implementation of any project the first stage of development abbreviated by fsd indicates a condition of constructing dalaki dam and improvement development of irrigation districts located downstream of both dalaki and rais ali delvari dams in the following of fsd the second stage of development abbreviated by ssd represents the construction of nargesi dam and improvement development of irrigation districts located downstream of the dam the third stage of development abbreviated by tsd incorporates the implementation of entire long term plan which in addition to ssd related measures includes construction of chorom dam as well as improvement development of its downstream irrigation districts 2 1 2 hydro meteorological conditions to analysis the effects of different hydro meteorological conditions we utilized 7 year moving average of long term annual time series of river discharge fig 2 to characterize and export two 5 year short term periods with dry and normal hydro meteorological conditions respectively named dhmc and nhmc therefore we selected 5 year short term periods of 1976 1980 as dhmc and 2006 2010 as nhmc under the status quo while during dhmc the long term average of river discharge ec for shapour river at chorom site and dalaki river at sarghanat site respectively equal 11 54 3 56 and 10 57 9 57 m3 s 1 ds m 1 during nhmc the long term average of river discharge ec for mentioned sites of shapour and dalaki rivers respectively equal 15 55 3 17 and 14 48 4 72 m3 s 1 ds m 1 2 1 3 hrb s main spatial divisions to better realize spatial effects we divide hrb system into 5 main regions the 1st region abbreviated by 1str is a reach of shapour river from chorom dam to rais ali delvari dam and incorporates khesht s agricultural area as well as khesht s date palm orchards the 2nd region abbreviated by 2ndr is related to a reach of dalaki river from nargesi dam to dalaki dam and incorporates gikh irrigation districts left and right banks the 3rd region abbreviated by 3rdr is on shapour river incorporating dasht e gur siyah mansur shabankareh and ab pakhsh irrigation districts located downstream of raeiali dam the 4th region abbreviated by 4thr is on dalaki river incorporating dalaki deh qaed and vahdatieh irrigation districts located downstream of dalaki dam the 5th region abbreviated by 5thr is on helleh river from shapour dalaki connection point to helleh lagoon coastal wetland and includes kolal helleh and mohammadieh irrigation districts 2 2 mathematical program 2 2 1 objective function 2 2 1 1 long term planning by the long term planning we aim for basin wide aggregate economic efficiency therefore the objective function represents maximization of long run net benefit from constructing and operating dam and irrigation district projects and is expressed by the below equation 1 m a x i m i z e n p v a p n b d c i d c p n l where n p v represents the net present value a p n b denotes the net benefit associated with the agricultural production d c stands for costs related to dams construction and operation i d c represents costs of irrigation districts construction and operation and p n l is a penalty term due to water deficit or insufficient water supply related to other demands domestic industrial etc in the following mentioned terms are defined in more detail based on functions of decision variables based on dividing each irrigation district into several smaller single crop irrigation units iu s each with its own agro economic properties irrigation technology and operation basin wide benefit of the agricultural production achieved by crops sale minus production costs is formulated as 2 a p n b i 1 i y 1 y γ y u 1 u i a i u y p e i u y y a i u y s i u s ˆ i u p c i u y where i y and u are indices associated with irrigation districts yearly time periods and iu s n i represents the total number of irrigation districts y is the total number of yearly time steps and u i stands for the total number of iu s that the i th irrigation district incorporates furthermore γ is a discounting factor that depends on the discount rate a denotes a vector of decision variables associated with iu s cultivation area p e stands for the unit price of the crop yield y a represents actual crop yield per unit area and p c denotes production cost per unit area also for each iu decision variables of irrigation leaching strategy incorporate two typical values of the relative soil moisture at the root zone of the unit i e 1 intervention point s and 2 target level s ˆ the term associated with irrigation districts costs include both construction and operation costs and is calculated in terms of decision variables associated with the total irrigated area of each irrigation district the term related to dams costs incorporate both construction and operation costs and is calculated in terms of decision variables associated with the active capacity of each reservoir supposing that water users excepting irrigation including ecosystem protection as well as municipal and industrial water consumption are taken into account through a priority based water allocation scheme here we consider a penalty term to account for shortage in supplying these water users demands as below 3 p n l α p e n a l t y p 1 c o v m i n p where c o v m i n p is the minimum coverage related to the demand sites associated with the p th priority level and α p is a penalty factor 2 2 1 2 short term planning in practice implementation of the long term development plan is divided into some short term planning stages where at each stage the planner may seek overall economic efficiency of basin scale water allocation crop pattern planning and irrigation scheduling taking into account different hydro meteorological conditions accordingly for short term planning we take an objective function which represents maximization of short run net benefit from the operation of dam and irrigation district projects and is expressed by the below equation 4 m a x i m i z e n p v a p n b p n l where a p n b denotes the net benefit associated with the agricultural production and is declared using eq 2 with only a small discrepancy that the total number of yearly time steps y equals the short term horizon the penalty term due to water deficit or insufficient water supply to domestic industrial demands is defined based on eq 3 2 2 2 crop yield constraint the actual crop yield is affected by both water and salinity stresses and is proposed as a function of some agronomic parameters and decision variables doorenbos and kassam 1979 ayers and westcot 1985 letey et al 1985 shalhevet 1994 as follows 5 y a i u y y m i u y 1 k y i u 1 v e t a i u y s i u s ˆ i u v e t p i u y 1 b i u 100 k y i u c i u y s s i u s ˆ i u c t i u y i u where y and u are indices associated with yearly time periods and iu s y m represents the maximum crop yield k y stands for a factor representing the crop sensitivity to water stress v e t a denotes the cumulative actual evapotranspiration integrated over the growing season as a function of irrigation leaching related decision variables v e t p represents the cumulative potential evapotranspiration integrated over the growing season b is a regression factor representing the crop sensitivity to salinity stress c s stands for over year average of the salt concentration of the saturation extract in the root zone as a function of irrigation leaching related decision variables c t is a threshold value of the salt concentration above which the crop yield is less than the potential yield it is worth noting that the crop yield model does not consider the effect of excessive water anoxic condition on reduction of evapotranspiration the supplementary material incorporates more detail on v e t a and v e t p 2 2 3 crop pattern constraints in an irrigation district the cultivation area of each iu as a share of the total area of the district is defined by the following set of equations 6 a i u y β i u y a t i i u y where i and u are indices associated with irrigation districts and iu s and y is an index related to yearly time periods furthermore β i u stands for each iu s area share in the total area of the irrigation district so we need to have 7 u u i β i u y 1 i y additionally the cultivation area of each crop ranges from a lower bound l b i u to an upper bound u b i u 8 l b i u β i u u b i u i u these bounds are estimated based on technical and socio economic studies based on our assumption that only one single crop is cultivated in each iu these lower and upper bounds will actually be set on the areas of ius the total area of the irrigation district a t i must be less than or equal to the maximum cultivable land a m a x i 9 a t i a m a x i i 2 2 4 water balance constraints 2 2 4 1 reservoirs constraints related to reservoirs include the water balance equation upper and lower bound limits on reservoir storage evaporation function operation policy and spillage consideration the supplementary material incorporates more detail on equations as well as constraints 2 2 4 2 irrigation districts water balance in irrigation districts is based on soil moisture dynamics for each iu at a seasonal time scale and is modeled by treating the active soil of crop root zone as a reservoir with an effective storage capacity that is filled by rainfall and demand based irrigation events and empties by evapotranspiration leakage and surface runoff the dynamic is expressed by 10 s i u y t 1 s i u y t 1 φ i u z r i u r i u y t i i u y t e t i u y t l i u y t q i u y t i u y t where i and u are indices associated with irrigation districts and iu s y and t are indices associated with yearly and seasonal time periods φ is the soil porosity z r is the active soil depth s is the relative soil moisture which varies between 0 at the wilting point and 1 at the soil saturation point the system inputs are rainfall r and infiltrated irrigation i the soil moisture losses or the system outputs are actual evapotranspiration e t leakage due to both rainfall and irrigation l and surface runoff caused by rainfall q the supplementary material incorporates more detail on how these terms are considered in mathematical programming framework it is worth mentioning that the actual evapotranspiration is expressed as a piece wise linear function of soil moisture hale and orcutt 1987 rodriguez iturbe and porporato 2004 so that the actual evapotranspiration increases basically from zero at wilting point s 0 up to a maximum value e t p at the point of incipient stomatal closure s after which it remains constantly at e t p for higher soil moisture values the leakage is considered in a simplified manner as a piece wise linear function of the relative soil moisture alizadeh and mousavi 2013 which diminishes for soil moisture levels lower than field capacity given that the term associated with infiltrated irrigation at the right hand side of equation 21 represents the seasonal depth of irrigation water applied to crop root zone it must be less than irrigation requirement as below 11 i i u y t i r i u y t i u y t where i r stands for farm scale irrigation requirement that is formulated in the next section 2 2 4 3 irrigation requirement constraints farm scale net irrigation requirement is formulated regarding a demand based irrigation scheme which can distinguish between different irrigation technologies i e traditional and modern techniques as well as irrigation strategies i e from rainfed agriculture to stress avoidance irrigation covering different levels of deficit irrigation vico and porporato 2011 two irrigation related decision variables briefly introduced in section 4 2 1 1 are actually key parameters of the scheme and characterize both of the technology and the strategy in the demand based irrigation an application is triggered when the relative soil moisture reaches the intervention point s with aid of restoring the target level s ˆ the depth of water supplied by each irrigation application is proportional to the difference between the target level and the intervention point i e φ z r s ˆ s irrigation depth is a key factor characterizing the type of traditional irrigation technology and depends on properties of soil i e porosity and crop i e root depth e g irrigation depth usually exceeds 50 mm and often 100 mm for basin irrigation a type of surface irrigation systems and vary from 5 mm to 30 mm for center pivot a kind of sprinkler technology trout and kincaid 2007 accordingly a constraint on the minimum irrigation depth can be used as below 12 m i n d m i n i u φ i u z r i u 1 s w i u φ i u z r i u s ˆ i u s i u i u t i u i where t i u i represents a collection of iu s which belong to the i th irrigation district and where traditional technologies are applied in fact both irrigation technology as well as soil crop type restricts minimum applied depth accordingly the term at the right hand side of the above inequality i e d m i n i u represents technology implications for minimum irrigation depth while the term φ i u z r i u 1 s w i u shows effects of soil crop limitations on minimum irrigation depth where s w represents relative soil moisture at wilting point micro irrigation technology corresponds to the case in which 13 s ˆ i u s i u i u m i u i where m i u i represents a collection of iu s which belong to the i th irrigation district and where modern technologies are applied to characterize different irrigation strategies including rainfed agriculture deficit irrigation and stress avoidance irrigation the intervention point is supposed to take continuous values ranging from zero associated with rainfed strategy to relative soil moisture associated with incipient stomatal closure point s related to stress avoidance strategy as expressed by 14 0 s i u s i u i u accordingly the mathematical program s solution will result in the best optimal strategy for each iu s which is selected from a range of different possible strategies while the optimum value of the target level is essential in characterizing irrigation strategy it takes a key role in determining the salt leaching strategy by means of over irrigation which coincide with the condition of s f c i u s ˆ i u where s f c stands for relative soil moisture at the field capacity there is a logical constraint stating that as below the target level always must be set greater than and equal to the intervention point as below 15 s i u s ˆ i u i u according to the described irrigation scheme the supplementary material expresses how farm scale irrigation requirement i r i u y t can be considered in the framework of mathematical programming 2 2 4 4 water allocation constraints constraints related to priority based supplying water demands are expressed below 16 s d i y t d i y t i y t 17 c o v m i n p y t s d i y t d i y t p i d s p where i represents an index related to demand sites including municipal industrial and irrigation demand and y and t represent yearly and seasonal time periods p shows the priority level of a demand site d i y t represents the volume of water demand associated with the i th demand site in year y and season t and s d i y t is the volume of water allocated to the i th demand site in year y and season t d s p is the set of all demand sites whose priority level equals p inequality 16 guarantees that the volume of water allocated to a demand site is less than and equal to the water demand of the site the minimum coverage of water supply c o v m i n p related to all demand sites associated with the priority level p is met by inequality 17 it is worth mentioning that water demand of an agricultural demand site irrigation district in year y and season t equals u 1 u i a i u y i r i u y t μ i u where μ is an irrigation efficiency factor moreover water which is actually allocated to the site equals u 1 u i a i u y i i u y t μ i u 2 2 4 5 rivers nodes nodes on the river body from where water is withdrawn are classified into two categories of 1 nodes located exactly downstream of dams and 2 other nodes there are also nodes at which some incoming flow arrive river and these nodes are categorized into two classes of 1 nodes accepting tributary natural flows and 2 nodes accepting return flows from demand sites the supplementary material presents some equations for water balance at rivers nodes 2 2 5 salt balance constraints supposing that reservoirs are completely mixed we can express reservoirs salt balance by 18 c d y t 1 s s d y t 1 c d y t s s d y t c d y t q q d y t c d y t r r d y t d y t where d y and t are indices associated with dam s reservoir yearly time periods and seasonal time periods c s c q and c r respectively represent the salt concentration associated with the reservoir storage inflow and release the salt concentration of release is assumed to be equal to c d y t 1 s c d y t s 2 for all kinds of nodes on the river body where water is withdrawn from or arrived the supplementary material incorporates equations for salt balance the document describes how salt balance in irrigation districts based on salt accumulation dynamics for each iu at a seasonal time scale is modeled by treating the active soil of crop root zone as a reservoir that is filled by salt related to irrigation and empties by salt due to leakage 2 3 solution approach both the long term and short term planning problems are classified in the category of mixed integer non linear programs which are known as np hard problems without any generic approach to solving here we take a simulation optimization approach coupling a modular simulation model and an evolutionary algorithm based optimization model fig 3 illustrates a general view of the approach as seen the simulation model consists of four modules of 1 weap software sieber and purkey 2011 simulating basin scale water allocation as well as field scale soil moisture dynamics 2 salinity balance and routing 3 crop production and 4 economic evaluation furthermore particle swarm optimization pso algorithm clerc 2010 gao et al 2020 is utilized for the optimization part while all constraints proposed before in section 4 2 3 are considered in the framework pso algorithm during solution generation we take equations presented in section 4 2 1 for the economic evaluation module of the simulation model constraints proposed in sections 4 2 4 4 2 5 and 4 2 2 are respectively accounted for in the framework of weap the salinity routing and the crop production modules 2 4 sensitivity analysis and calibration as discussed in the preceding section the simulation optimization model applied to hrb includes two water allocation and salt routing modules whose parameters should be calibrated here we utilize the optimization module i e pso algorithm for calibration we employ a global sensitivity analysis procedure named vars developed by razavi and gupta 2016 to identify the most influential parameters prior to calibration here for hrb system both sensitivity analysis and calibration are based on minimizing a goodness of fit gof measure representing weighted sum of squared residuals between observation and simulation of both river discharge and salinity at three stream gauges of jareh bala saedabad and kolal the measure is expressed by 19 m i n i m i z e g 1 g t 1 t ω 1 g q g t s i m q g t o b s 2 ω 2 g c g t s i m c g t o b s 2 where g and t respectively represent indices for stream gauges and time periods s and t respectively stand for the total numbers of stream gauges and time periods ω 1 and ω 2 denote weights superscripts s i m and o b s respectively represent associated values of simulation and observation q is river discharge and c stands for the salinity concentration given that we run the model for a historical long time period of 41 years 1972 2012 we imported monthly time series of discharge related to natural head and tributary natural flows of hrb s system prepared by hydrological studies of tamavan 2014b application of the model to real hrb case requires monthly time series of river s salinity concentration which we prepared based on semi empirical discharge concentration model of o connor 1976 a function declaring river s salinity concentration c in terms of river discharge q as below 20 c c g q q 0 c g λ c g c s q 1 n q q 0 where the semi empirical function includes parameters of q 0 representing baseflow c s and c g denoting salinity concentrations respectively related to surface water and groundwater n an exponent parameter and λ which equals q 0 1 n however before utilization for each natural head and tributary flow parameters of the associated discharge concentration function needs to be tuned since discharge concentration records of most natural head and tributary streams of hrb system are not available here we have to do both sensitivity analysis and calibration for parameters of discharge concentration functions using vars and pso algorithms respectively given that hrb is a fully managed river system values of parameters related to land water management may have a significant influence on the value of the gof measure therefore crops cultivated area as well as irrigation related soil water levels are taken as parameters whose values are tuned using the sensitivity analysis and the calibration procedures to account for effects of field scale soil moisture dynamics on calibration results we considered some influential parameters of the weap model including runoff resistance factor r r f root zone s saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and root zone s water holding capacity r d accounting for all tributary streams and irrigation districts indicated by fig 2 115 parameters were first identified then a good parameterization scheme helped us to reduce the total number of influential parameters to 50 in the end based on the results of applying the vars algorithm parameters were ranked and 25 of the most effective parameters were identified fig 4 table 3 proposes results of calibration where values of different gof measures of nash sutcliff efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were presented moriasi et al 2015 conducted a thorough literature review on values reported for performance measures of water quantity quality modeling and concluded that for monthly temporal scale modeling values of nse absolute pbias greater less than 0 5 15 0 45 20 0 35 30 and 0 4 30 respectively for streamflow sediment nitrogen and phosphorous indicate acceptable model calibration accordingly based on the results indicated in table 3 we can state that the model was well fitted to discharge records as well as salinity records 3 results 3 1 hrb s optimal development scheme by means of implementing the long term optimization model we drew optimal water resource development scheme of hrb which is summarily proposed as below construction of chorom dalaki and nargesi dams with optimal normal water volumes of 43 5 305 5 and 76 8 million cubic meters respectively improvement and development of irrigation districts of dasht e gur siyah mansur agricultural area siyah mansur date palm orchards left bank gikh right bank gikh khesht and shabankareh with optimal areas of 1168 2700 179 1512 3604 1479 and 9289 ha respectively optimal usage of irrigation technologies 47 5 surface and 52 5 tape in siyah mansur date palm orchards 24 5 surface and 75 5 tape in siyah mansur agricultural area 48 surface and 52 sprinkler in left bank gikh and 50 surface and 50 sprinkler in right bank gikh 3 2 irrigation and leaching scheduling 3 2 1 long term fig 5 illustrates optimal irrigation strategies optimal values of the target level s ˆ and the intervention point s of each crop in each irrigation district it is worth mentioning that the upper triangular area in the figure where s ˆ s is actually the feasible space of irrigation strategies the feasible space is divided to 1 a light red colored area corresponding to deficit irrigation where s ˆ o r s s and 2 a light green colored area associated with stress avoidance irrigation where s ˆ s s the over irrigation strategy have been illustrated using the diagonally hatched area where s ˆ o r s s f c irrigation technologies can be distinguished using fig 5 while points on the bisector line i e s ˆ s represent micro irrigation points belong to other part of the feasible space i e s ˆ s illustrate traditional irrigation including furrow flood and sprinkler technologies according to fig 5 for 88 and 12 of hrb s irrigation units with micro irrigation technology mit we respectively recommend stress avoidance sa and deficit irrigation di strategies then the over irrigation s oi share is 38 of mit units we respectively recommend stress avoidance sa and deficit irrigation di strategies for 30 and 70 of hrb s irrigation units with traditional irrigation technology tit in which for 73 of tit units over irrigation oi strategy is suggested according to fig 5 only 3rdr includes mit units and we recommend sa di and oi for 80 20 and 30 of irrigation units of the region respectively for tit units the results suggest sa strategy for 1str and 4thr di strategy for 2ndr 3rdr and 5thr and oi strategy for whole iu s in3rdr 4thr and 5thr 75 of iu s in 1str and 50 of iu s in 2ndr to better characterize optimal irrigation strategies i e di di oi sa and sa oi fig 6 shows the long term basin scale average of annual water balance components as indicated by fig 6 we can see 95 and 113 increase in irrigation depth from di strategy to sa strategy for perennial and annual crops respectively according to fig 6 applying oi strategy for perennial and annual crops makes 31 and 40 increase in irrigation depth respectively fig 6 shows that evapotranspiration depth increases by 69 and 25 from di strategy to sa strategy for perennial and annual crops respectively finally we see that leakage depth increases by 11 and 84 when oi strategy is employed respectively for perennial and annual crops 3 2 2 short term comparing the left and right columns of fig 7 one can realize the effects of hydro meteorological conditions of the short term planning period on optimal irrigation strategies based on the comparison of fig 7a and b we can state that for zsd optimal sa di and oi strategies respectively recommended for 48 52 and 67 of tit irrigation units under dry condition change to 76 24 and 76 of units under the normal condition comparison of fig 7c and d for fsd indicates that there are similar percentages of optimal sa di and oi strategies in both types of irrigation technology i e mit and tit under the dry and normal conditions comparison of fig 7e and f shows that for ssd optimal sa di and oi strategies respectively recommended for 52 57 and 48 of tit irrigation units under dry condition change to 43 69 and 58 of units under the normal condition likewise comparing fig 7g and h we can see that for tsd optimal sa di and oi strategies respectively recommended for 56 44 and 33 of mit irrigation units under dry condition change to 100 0 and 78 of units under the normal condition these instances coincide with a reasonable expectation that the drier the hydro meteorological condition is the more units will be suggested to use di strategy comparing fig 7a and g we can state that optimal sa di and oi strategies respectively recommended for 50 50 and 54 of tit irrigation units at zsd change to 36 64 and 69 of units at tsd this has an important implication for hrb system s decision makers the more projects are constructing the more application of di oi strategies will be recommended 3 3 crop pattern planning fig 8 illustrates optimal crop patterns resulted from the short term model under different stages of development sod as well as two hydro meteorological conditions hmc and for various main regions of hrb system fig 8a shows that for 1str and under different cases of sod hmc optimal crop pattern fluctuates in ranges 40 42 26 40 7 20 and 5 12 for wheat tomato watermelon and sorghum respectively fig 8b indicates that for 2ndr and under different cases of sod hmc optimal crop pattern varies in ranges of 38 49 30 38 12 15 and 6 11 for tomato wheat sorghum and watermelon respectively fig 8c shows that for 3rdr and under different cases of sod hmc optimal crop pattern alters in ranges 62 70 10 21 6 20 and 0 18 for tomato wheat watermelon and sorghum respectively fig 8d shows that for 4thr and under different cases of sod hmc optimal crop pattern alters in ranges 57 61 7 30 5 19 and 4 12 for wheat tomato sorghum and water melon respectively under optimal development scheme it is clear that lower water consuming crops i e wheat and tomato have maximum shares of optimal crop pattern each for two regions of hrb and sorghum and water melon with higher water consumption have minimum shares for two regions of hrb using fig 8a we can compare zsd dhmc and zsd nmc cases for the 1str accordingly from the dry to the normal conditions crop pattern shares of watermelon and sorghum increase while tomato s share decreases and wheat s share does not significantly change based on fig 8b we can compare sod hmc cases of ssd dhmc and ssd nhmc for 2ndr hence from the dry to the normal conditions while crop pattern shares of wheat and watermelon increase sorghum s and tomato s shares decrease according to fig 8c one can compare zsd dhmc and zsd nhmc cases for 3rdr and see that from the dry to the normal conditions while crop pattern shares of wheat and sorghum increase watermelon s and tomato s shares decrease accordingly based on fig 8d we can compare sod hmc cases of zsd dhmc and zsd nhmc for the 4thr hence from the dry to the normal conditions while crop pattern shares of wheat increases while water melon s and sorghum s shares decrease and tomato s share remains almost constant finally for all 4 regions of hrb and from the dry to the normal conditions we can state that 1 wheat s share increases for three regions and remains constant in one 2 tomato s share decreases for three regions and remain constant in one and 3 both water melon s and sorghum s shares increase for two regions and decrease for two others using fig 8a we can compare zsd dhmc and tsd dhmc cases for the 1str to analyze the effects of construction and operation of chorom dam and khesht irrigation district on optimal crop pattern accordingly we can see that while wheat s and tomato s shares remain almost constant watermelon s share decreases and sorghum s share increases based on fig 8d one can compare sod hmc cases of zsd dhmc and fsd dhmc for the 4thr to assess the impact of construction and operation of dalaki dam and its downstream irrigation districts hence one can see that while crop pattern shares of wheat and tomato increase watermelon s share decrease and sorghum s share does not significantly change 3 4 salinity changes 3 4 1 dam operation impacts as indicated by fig 9 we expect that construction and operation of chorom and dalaki dams have no significant impacts on the river salinity while it is apparent that construction and operation of chorom lead to a slight regulation of the salinity concentration of shapour river construction and operation of dalaki dam results in a modest increase in the river salinity the impacts are associated with the reservoir s complete mixing and evaporation effects 3 4 2 root zone salinity change fig 10 illustrates short term over 5 year periods salinity of crop root zone where different sod hrb s main regions as well as crops are compared according to fig 10 we expect that the salt concentration in crop root zones to increase during the development of hrb from zsd to tsd this indicates the effect of more efficient water use during tsd compared to zsd and thus less salt leaching from crop root zones this is associated with a positive correlation between water and salt transports in basin scale graveline et al 2014 fig 10 shows how root zone salinity increases from hrb s upstream i e 1str and 2ndr to its downstream i e 5thr according to fig 10 in hrb system we expect higher levels of root zone s salinity concentration for perennial crops e g date palm compared to annual crops i e tomato and wheat 3 5 economic evaluation 3 5 1 long term according to the long term model s results we estimate hrb s aggregate net present value to be 19 514 billion irr iranian rial for the status quo while for the optimal development condition the model s results show that the value increases about 12 and reaches 21 858 billion irr under the optimal development condition the aggregate total benefit equals 35 529 billion irr where respectively 76 and 24 of the value corresponding to agricultural and municipal industrial benefits under the optimal development condition the sum of construction and operation costs is estimated to be 13 672 billion irr where 65 and 35 of the value relatively associates with dams and irrigation districts fig 11 illustrates the long term dynamics of the economic value of water evow under different conditions of status quo optimized irrigation and development by optimized irrigation we mean a condition when without any construction project only irrigation and leaching schedules are optimized according to fig 11 it is clear that optimizing irrigation leaching schedule leads to significant improvement of evow compared to the status quo due to the implementation of optimal deficit irrigation strategies and optimal leaching based salinity control programs on the contrary fig 11 shows that construction and operation of structural projects result in a dramatic decrease in evow due to an increase in construction and operation costs as well as the increase in water usage related to salinity control purposes as illustrated by fig 2 and stated in section 4 1 2 it is clear that 2006 2010 is a dry period and therefore a significant decline in the discharge of shapour and dalaki rivers in 2007 the 36th year and 2008 the 37th year is seen it is worth mentioning that we utilized the historic hydrologic condition time series of rivers discharge and salinity at hrb systems head flow for analyzing future development impacts therefore the hydro meteorological condition of the 37th year exactly coincides with the condition of historic year 2008 which lies in the dry period the decline in river discharge in 2008 is accompanied by salinity increase increase in over irrigation requirement for salinity control purposes and crop yield decline these are the main reasons for the markedly drop in water value in the 37th year 3 5 2 short term total irrigated agriculture s net benefit tianb of hrb system at zsd and under nhmc is estimated to be 9738 2 billion irr while it is decreased to 8159 5 under dhmc comparing the fsd compared to zsd tianb indicates an increase by 18 and 26 under nhmc and dhmc respectively likewise at ssd compared to zsd tianb increases by 29 and 40 under nhmc and dhmc respectively accordingly tianb at tsd compared to zsd increases by 37 and 46 relatively under nhmc and dhmc therefore we can obviously state that the development from zsd to tsd leads to an increase in tianb the trend from dhmc to nhmc reveals that hrb system experiences economic improvement so that 19 12 10 and 12 increases in tianb are estimated respectively for zsd fsd ssd and tsd fig 12 illustrates how structural projects and different hydro meteorological conditions affect evow usage in the cultivation of different crops according to fig 12 evow for the cultivation of most crops under both nhmc and dhmc is increasing from zsd to ssd due to the development and extending of irrigation areas while evow is decreasing from ssd to tsd under nhmc because of allocation of the extra volume of water for leaching and salinity control purposes fig 12 shows how evow increases even dramatically for some crops under dhmc compared to nhmc finally we can state that improvement in irrigation technology leads to an increase in the cultivation area of hrb as well as economic productivity enhancement while some demand sites with modern irrigation technology may have lower evow 4 discussion given that hrb s development faces challenges of water shortage and quality degradation we dealt with the optimal design of water resource development scheme of hrb which incorporates both infrastructural projects and management policies while accounting for soil salinity control programs moreover we took account of a long term planning horizon divided into some short term stages and assessed two dry and normal hydro meteorological conditions effects finally this paper proposes a generic novel hydro economic simulation optimization tool for basin scale optimal planning of an integrated development scheme including infrastructural measures as well as operational policies and strategies our research can be compared with some similar works where only simulation focused e g kirby et al 2013 farm level measures ignored e g qureshi et al 2013 or structural projects with long term effects were not dealt with e g rosegrant et al 2000 mainuddin et al 2007 mirchi et al 2018 briefly we advocated for the construction of three new dams i e chorom dalaki and nargesi dams with normal water volumes of 43 5 305 5 and 76 8 million cubic meters respectively improvement and development of seven irrigation districts with a total area of nearly 20 000 ha irrigation technology and strategy change and crop pattern modification while we mainly recommended sa irrigation strategy for mit units we chiefly advised di oi strategy for tit units due to both water scarcity limitations and salinity control requirements crop pattern modification was suggested so that crops with lower water consumption i e wheat and tomato should be cultivated more than sorghum and watermelon with higher water consumption under the optimal full development condition we expect a minor regulation in rivers salinity due to reservoirs operation which is mainly related to reservoirs complete mixing and evaporation effects on the contrary we anticipate an increase in the salt concentration of crop root zones due to more efficient water use indeed it is foreseen that the root zone salinity increases from hrb s upstream to its downstream and higher levels of root zone salinity take place for perennial crops compared to annual crops while hydro economic comparison of basin scale water resource infrastructural projects and management policies was not focused by similar studies e g rosegrant et al 2000 mainuddin et al 2007 qureshi et al 2013 kirby et al 2013 mirchi et al 2018 in this paper two different strategies of the optimized irrigation and the development were assessed and compared by optimized irrigation we meant a condition when only irrigation and leaching schedules are optimized while we assumed that development strategy also incorporated construction of structural projects results showed that while both strategies lead to dynamic economic improvement compared to the status quo the development is better than the optimized irrigation from an economic efficiency point of view it is worth mentioning that status of the development of hrb is comparable to some similar case studies e g graveline et al 2014 where costs of infrastructural projects were not compensated by the increase in regional agricultural income taking a closer look to derived results indicated that while construction and operation of structural projects result in a dramatic decrease in economic water value due to increase in construction and operation costs as well as the increase in water usage related to salinity control purposes optimizing only irrigation leaching schedule leads to significant improvement of evow compared to both of the status quo and the development strategy sensitivity analysis on the obtained results indicated that with 20 increase in project construction and agricultural production costs and 20 decrease in crops sale prices the optimal solution still remains economically feasible we took account of some short term stages of development and showed how hrb s system should be gradually changed in response to development measures from zsd coinciding with the status quo to tsd corresponding to the full development condition we recommend irrigation leaching strategies to chiefly change from sa to di oi we advise wheat s and tomato s cultivation area remain almost constant while we suggest watermelon s cultivation area to decrease and sorghum s cultivation area to increase we expect the salt concentration of crops root zones to increase during the development of hrb from zsd to tsd due to more efficient water use and therefore less salt leaching from crop root zones during tsd compared to zsd based on results we can state that the development from zsd to tsd leads to an increase in tianb while the development results in the decrease of evow due to the allocation of the extra volume of water for salinity control purposes effects of different hydro meteorological conditions on development of hrb were another subject that we assessed shifting from dhmc to nhmc we advocate for change in irrigation leaching strategies from di to sa oi in the same way for crop patterns while we suggest tomato s cultivation area to decrease and wheat s cultivation area to increase we advise watermelon s and sorghum s cultivation areas remain almost constant from dhmc to nhmc we can see that tianb moderately increases while evow increases even dramatically for some crops our results demonstrated that some demand sites with modern irrigation technology had lower evow compared to demand sites with traditional irrigation technology however these results are consistent with findings of medellín azuara et al 2010 which emphasized that technological improvement while unambiguously increasing farm revenues is not necessarily accompanied by an increase in evow because in some cases water is worthless for the farm as improved technology may demand less water for particular crop combinations on the other hand results of our study showed that modern technologies compared to traditional ones might lead to more root zone s salt accumulation which might have negative effects on crop yield and farm revenue this is in accordance with the findings of lecina et al 2010 and graveline et al 2014 accordingly we can state that irrigation technology improvement in salinity affected basins like hrb may lead to more decrease in evow 5 conclusion this paper aimed to determine optimal design of a development scheme for a salinity affected irrigated agricultural system while we considered different structural projects and non structural measures policies in the mentioned system there are some other important demand management e g water market and pricing and supply enhancement measures e g desalination which can be taken into account in future studies we only focused on some limited economic aspects such as economic efficiency and value of water and thus we recommend for developing the proposed methodology to account for social environmental and ecological viewpoints there are many sources of uncertainty whose analysis was left for future works while we studied salt transport and management of a river reservoir system some important water bodies such as groundwater and wetland can be focused in future declaration of competing

10427,improving both nitrogen utilization and peanut kernel quality after removing peanuts shell through water management is a growing concern for farmers to explore the role of supplemental irrigation in nitrogen transformation between source and sink a split plot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of water rain fed irrigation as iri supplemental irrigation as isi and nitrogen 0 kg ha 1 as n0 40 kg ha 1 as n1 60 kg ha 1 as n2 and 80 kg ha 1 as n3 coupling on soil nitrate nitrogen content nitrogen accumulation and kernel quality of peanuts we determined the dry matter weight per plant at peanut maturity as 64 66 74 92 g and 71 65 92 81 g for irin0 and isin3 respectively isin2 significantly increased nitrogen accumulation yield and water productivity furthermore the isi treatment prolonged the nitrogen uptake accumulation time of leaves thus enhancing the nitrogen transfer from the leaves to the pods thus the isi treatment significantly increased the nitrogen harvest index by 2 13 and the nitrogen agronomic efficiency by 78 57 compared to the iri treatment in addition the essential amino acid content in the fruits was within the range of 5 57 6 08 while the content of non essential amino acids was 16 43 to 17 46 n1 was able to significantly increase the content of non essential and essential amino acids while isi reduced the content of essential amino acids post harvest soil nitrate nitrogen was principally distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounting for 77 75 of the 0 60 cm soil layer although the supplemental irrigation is associated with an increased risk of the nitrogen moving deeper into the soil it greatly enhances nitrogen transfer from leaves to the pods at nitrogen application rates of 40 60 kg ha 1 keywords supplemental irrigation nitrogen transfer amino acid content nitrate nitrogen 1 introduction china is one of the world s largest edible oil consumers furthermore the increasing rate of consumption of edible oil in china is much higher than that of its supply chen et al 2011 in 2014 the self sufficiency rate of edible oil in china was only 36 8 wang and yin 2014 while limited planting area confines the development of edible oils in such areas with a limited planting area increasing the yield per unit is the principle method applied to increase the supply of oil crops ma 2016 peanuts arachis hypogaea l as an important oil crop in china are widely planted due to their high oil content and yield however the lower supply capacity of nitrogen in sandy loam or sandy soils is not sufficient for meeting the high nitrogen requirements of peanuts consequently the application of exogenous nitrogen is key for increasing peanut yields commonly used nitrogen management techniques in liaoning province of northeast china are often inefficient in 2015 the total amount of nitrogen and compound fertilizers applied was 1 217 million tons excessive nitrogen fertilizer can easily lead to imbalance of root cap growth and significantly decreases in yield harvest index peanut root nodules and nitrogen fertilizer utilization at the same time such inefficient nitrogen management techniques can result in agricultural non point source pollution di and cameron 2002 zhu and chen 2002 liu et al 2004 shi et al 2019 on the contrary appropriate application of nitrogen fertilizer can not only increase the yield of peanuts but also alleviate the pollution xia et al 2020 previous studies have shown that a balanced amount of nitrogen fertilizer can significantly increase photosynthesis and transpiration rates dry matter weight and the yield of tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill and can also enhance the nitrogen accumulation in plants kuscu et al 2014 scholars obtained similar conclusions on crops such as maize and wheat triticum aestivum l zotarelli et al 2009 wang et al 2010 peanuts are commonly planted in semi arid areas of western liaoning however given that irrigation is not widespread peanut crops often experience insufficient water supplies as a result irrigation water has become another important factor limiting the production of peanuts in this region although

constant weight was reached ding et al 2015 found that the root dry weight at 0 40 cm soil depth accounted for approximately 85 of the total dry weight therefore for each plot roots were randomly selected and a 0 20 width 0 16 length 0 40 active rooting depth metre clod sample was transferred into a mesh bag made from 100 mesh nylon mesh to reflect root dry weight and total n uptake after water panning the roots were separated and the dry weight was determined total n concentration in these samples was determined by the semi micro kjeldahl method bao 2000 soil water content was

between treatments 3 results 3 1 biomass weight fig 2 shows the effects of the irrigation regimes and nitrogen applications on dry matter accumulation in peanut roots and other parts of the plant the isi treatment promoted dry matter accumulation in stems and leaves across the two years the dry matter accumulation in 2017 was observed to be higher than that of 2016 this may be attributed to the greater amount of rainfall in 2017 meeting the water demand of the peanut crop the application of nitrogen was able to increase the dry matter accumulation of peanuts however for nitrogen application rates greater than 40 kg ha 1 dry matter remained unchanged furthermore there was an interaction effect between isi and nitrogen on the dry matter accumulation of roots for nitrogen application rates between 0 and 40 kg ha 1 the root dry matter of the isi treatment was higher than that of iri the opposite was observed for nitrogen application rates between 40 and 80 kg ha 1 indicating that isi promoted the development of the root system under low nitrogen application rates whereas under application rates between 40 and 80 kg ha 1 the isi was more conducive to the effective conversion of dry matter from roots to other plant components and limited the redundant growth of roots 3 2 nitrogen uptake in peanut components during the vegetative growth stage the nitrogen accumulation curve exhibited a single peak while the highest nitrogen accumulation rates were associated with the n2 treatment however nitrogen application rate at 80 kg ha 1 induced redundant growth resulting in the obvious inhabitation of root growth fig 2 which ultimately reduced the absorption of n regardless of the nitrogen application rates supplemental irrigation greatly promoted n absorption there was a significant difference between the effect of isi on total nitrogen accumulation and that on nitrogen accumulation in different organs as nitrogen application rates increased the nitrogen uptake of the roots stems and leaves initially increased and subsequently decreased compared with the stems and roots the effect of isi on nitrogen accumulation in leaves was more significant which promoted the nitrogen transformation from the stems into the leaves the effects of irrigation regimes and nitrogen managements on nitrogen accumulation were basically consistent within two years in the reproductive growth period the effect of nitrogen application on total nitrogen accumulation of peanuts weakened yet n2 was still able to obtain the highest nitrogen uptake in addition isi significantly increased the total amount of nitrogen accumulation and exerted a positive effect in the reproductive growth period more specifically isi promoted the nitrogen transformation in the leaves and was conducive to the formation of economic yield figs 4 5 3 3 yield and water nitrogen use efficiency since nitrogen application and isi effectively regulated the accumulation and distribution of nitrogen it would significantly affect the use efficiency of water and nitrogen table 3 shows that irrigation regimes and nitrogen application both significantly affected water productivity water consumption nitrogen agronomic efficiency and nitrogen recovery efficiency while nitrogen application exhibited significant effects on irrigation water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency isi during the two growing seasons significantly increased yield water consumption and nitrogen agronomic efficiency nae by 20 1 32 1 and 52 4 respectively but reduced water productivity and nae by 8 9 and 7 9 table 4 yield water consumption and water productivity values initially rose and subsequently decreased with increases in the nitrogen application rate the n2 treatment obtained the highest peanut yield and water productivity while the n1 treatment consumed the most water furthermore statistically the highest nitrogen use efficiency and recovery efficiency values were observed for the n2 treatment this indicates that an appropriate nitrogen application rate at 60 kg ha 1 increased nitrogen utilization while rates above this level may have resulted in low nitrogen use efficiency due to growth redundancy in 2017 the highest nae and iwue values were associated with the n2 treatment while in 2016 iwue peaked for the n3 treatment this indicates that the appropriate nitrogen application rate not only improved the utilization of nitrogen but also promoted the irrigation water use efficiency it also suggests that the exogenous nitrite nitrogen in soil required water to be used by peanuts plant the two factors of water and nitrogen had significant interactions on peanut yield water consumption water productivity agronomic use efficiency nitrogen use and recovery efficiency under iri nitrogen linearly decreased with water consumption whereas under isi water consumption initially increased and subsequently decreased with increases in nitrogen application rates furthermore isi significantly reduced water productivity indicating that although irrigation increased peanut yields the yield increasing effect of water consumption per unit gradually decreased particularly for higher nitrogen application rates under n1 and n2 isi was able to significantly promote the transformation of nitrogen and also increased nue however under n3 nue values of isi were significantly lower than those of rain fed irrigation 3 4 soil nitrate nitrogen distribution soil nitrate nitrogen accumulation values of isi treatment were lower than that of the rain fed irrigation across soil profiles fig 6 moreover the soil residual nitrate nitrogen in 2017 was lower than that in 2016 which may be due to the significant increase in nitrogen uptake by plants in 2017 the soil residual nitrate nitrogen observed for the n3 treatment was higher than that of the n0 treatment post harvest soil nitrate nitrogen was principally distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounting for 77 75 of the 0 60 cm soil layer in addition the accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen in the deep layer 40 60 cm in 2016 was higher than that of 2017 since the irrigation water was determined based on soil water content in the root zone the difference in rainfall between the two years had a key impact on the distribution of soil nitrate nitrogen 3 5 nitrogen transformation in peanut fruit figs 7 and 8 show the differences of essential and non essential amino acids content in different treatments respectively essential e g isoleucine leucine phenylalanine and non essential e g arginine aspartic acid glutamate amino acid content generally increased and subsequently decreased with increases in nitrogen the highest amino acid content was observed for n1 and n2 yet the effect of isi on amino acid content was difficult to induce the red marks in fig 9 demonstrate that the content of most amino acids was positively correlated with the total nitrogen content in particular the amino acid content seemed to be a function of the nitrogen content in the peanut kernel furthermore methionine and cysteine exhibited a weak correlation with total nitrogen content by looking at the blue marks tyrosine methionine and cysteine were less correlated with other amino acid content based on these results we performed variance analysis on the total content of essential and non essential amino acids table 5 indicated that the effects of water nitrogen interaction on the total content of essential and non essential amino acids were not significant irrigation regimes had a regulation effect on the essential amino acid content while nitrogen application had a significant effect on the total content of nitrogen and essential and non essential amino acids moreover the content of total nitrogen and amino acids observed for the n1 and n2 treatments were significantly higher than those of the n0 and n3 treatments however n1 and iri were both able to increase the total content of essential amino acids therefore for peanuts the application of a small amount of nitrogen fertilizer could achieve the highest amino acid content 4 discussion 4 1 effects of supplemental irrigation on water and nitrogen utilization and nitrogen transformation dry matter accumulation is the basis for crop yield formation and nitrogen nutrition is an important factor affecting the formation of dry matter in crops xing et al 2015 wu et al 2016 using pot experiments arruda et al 2015 detected a quadratic relationship between peanut yield and nitrogen application rates the accumulation of dry matter in plants is approximately equivalent to the accumulation of nitrogen however different forms of water and nitrogen management can significantly impact nitrogen accumulation results from the current study demonstrate that increasing nitrogen application rates significantly increased dry matter nitrogen accumulation and the pod yield of peanuts in particular the fitted quadratic curve equation in fig 3 indicates that under rainfed and isi conditions dry matter weight peaked with applications of nitrogen at 55 65 kg ha 1 and 60 100 kg ha 1 respectively this finding along with that shown in fig 2 shows that isi inhibited the growth of roots as nitrogen increased from 40 to 60 kg ha 1 but promoted the continuous improvement of dry matter quality however excessive nitrogen application rates not only failed to increase yields or dry matter quality but in fact significantly reduced yields and dry matter which has been confirmed by other studies qian et al 2006 gheysari et al 2009 our results demonstrate the presence of variations between treatments in nitrogen accumulation and the distribution of several organs during the peanut growing period during the peanut seedling and flower pegging stages the leaves rapidly developed while the pod yield accumulation rate was greater during the pod bearing and fruit filling stages as the growing period advances the number of peanut leaves increases and at the same time the nitrogen of the bottom leaves are transferred to the new top leaves resulting in a higher nitrogen content jiao et al 2006 in the current study as nitrogen application rates increased the nitrogen accumulation in the flowering and pod bearing stages of peanuts and the nitrogen proportion of pods to total plants increased more intensely this indicates that nitrogen application promoted the development of the reproductive organs moderate irrigation regimes can improve the water use efficiency of crops as verified in many studies however research has also demonstrated that water use efficiency is maximized under conditions of water shortage fabeiro et al 2002 ertek et al 2004 which affirms the productivity of unit water yet ignores the ability of water to regulate the use of biogenic elements the current study showed that the effective distribution of nitrogen attributed to isi subsequently significantly increased the pod yield of peanuts this suggests that supplemental irrigation was beneficial to peanuts in terms of drought resistance and ultimately for higher yields for nitrogen transfer in the fruits the effect of isi on total amino acid content was difficult to induce and primarily stemmed from the increased involvement of supplemental irrigation in inducing functional soluble proteins xia et al 2020 under the same nitrogen application rates the water use efficiency of the rainfed irrigation was significantly higher than that of the supplemental irrigation however at a nitrogen application rate of 60 kg ha 1 no significant difference between water use efficiency across irrigation treatments was observed therefore although supplemental irrigation was not conducive to the accumulation of essential amino acids it could significantly improve water use efficiency in addition to promoting the accumulation of dry matter and the conversion of nitrogen into the peanut fruits 4 2 effect of supplemental irrigation on the distribution of soil nitrate nitrogen under soil water stress crops have the ability to adapt to harsh environments to resist drought many studies have shown that when soil water or nutrient supply is insufficient the root system of crops could preferentially grow to enhance the absorption of water and nutrients in the soil anghinoni and barber 1980 robinson 1994 wu et al 2019 nitrate nitrogen is the main form of nitrogen absorbed and used by crops qian et al 2006 under film mulching and suitable irrigation regimes the soil water content at 0 60 cm soil depth can not only maintain more nitrate nitrogen but can also benefit the growth of peanuts ramakrishna et al 2006 htoon et al 2019 we found that supplemental irrigation at an appropriate water control threshold benefited the accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen and promoted the conversion of nitrogen into peanut pods thus an appropriate nitrate supply can promote crop growth however excessive application of nitrate nitrogen can cause redundant growth reduce the harvest index delay maturity and even reduce yield fritschi et al 2003 n3 significantly decreased peanuts yield water and nitrogen use efficiency table 4 furthermore the nitrate nitrogen accumulated in the soil under rainfall may also increase the risk of leaching zhang et al 2012 research has shown that if all nitrogen fertilizers are applied as base fertilizers the content of nitrate nitrogen at 0 60 cm soil depth in the early peanut growth stage is significantly higher than that observed when peanut plants are mature zhou et al 2002 this finding suggests that large amounts of nitrate nitrogen remain below the root zone under high precipitation and high quotas of irrigation increasing the risk of nitrate leaching to deep soil layers as well as the contamination of groundwater zotarelli et al 2008 wu et al 2020 when nitrogen was applied at 80 kg ha 1 we found that the content of nitrate nitrogen in the deep layer of the isi treatment was significantly higher than that of the rain fed treatment thus nitrate nitrogen participated in the leaching process and resulted in lower nitrogen recovery efficiency and water productivity table 4 absolutely nitrogen loss caused by supplemental irrigation under high nitrogen rates may also be a key factor in reducing the content of essential amino acids in peanut kernels table 5 therefore effective fertilization techniques and the determination of boundary conditions for nitrate nitrogen leaching are required in order to obtain maximum nitrogen fertilizer productivity levels for field crop production 5 conclusions the results above show that i supplementing 60 48 mm irrigation water significantly increased yield water consumption and nitrogen agronomic efficiency by 20 1 32 1 and 52 4 respectively but reduced water productivity and nitrogen recovery efficiency by 8 9 and 7 9 ii although the supplemental irrigation was associated with an increased risk of the nitrogen moving deeper into the soil it greatly enhanced nitrogen transfer from leaves to the pods at nitrogen application rates of 40 60 kg ha 1 iii nitrogen rate at 40 kg ha 1 was able to significantly increase the content of non essential and essential amino acids whereas supplemental irrigation reduced the content of essential amino acids

10427,improving both nitrogen utilization and peanut kernel quality after removing peanuts shell through water management is a growing concern for farmers to explore the role of supplemental

matter weight per plant at peanut maturity as 64 66 74 92 g and 71 65 92 81 g for irin0 and isin3 respectively isin2 significantly increased nitrogen accumulation yield and water productivity furthermore the isi treatment prolonged the nitrogen uptake accumulation time of leaves thus enhancing the nitrogen transfer from the leaves to the pods thus the isi treatment significantly increased the nitrogen harvest index by 2 13 and the nitrogen agronomic efficiency by 78 57 compared to the iri treatment in addition the essential amino acid content in the fruits was within the range of 5 57 6 08 while the content of non essential amino acids was 16 43 to 17 46 n1 was able to significantly increase the content of non essential and essential amino acids while isi reduced the content of essential amino acids post harvest soil nitrate nitrogen was principally distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounting for 77 75 of the 0 60 cm soil layer although the supplemental irrigation is

edible oil in china is much higher than that of its supply chen et al 2011 in 2014 the self sufficiency rate of edible oil in china was only 36 8 wang and yin 2014 while limited planting area confines the development of edible oils in such areas with a limited planting area increasing the yield per unit is the principle method applied to increase the supply of oil crops ma 2016 peanuts arachis hypogaea l as an important oil crop in china are widely planted due to their high oil content and yield however the lower supply capacity of nitrogen in sandy loam or sandy soils is not sufficient for meeting the high nitrogen requirements of peanuts consequently the application of exogenous nitrogen is key for increasing peanut yields commonly used nitrogen management techniques in liaoning province of northeast china are often inefficient in 2015 the total amount of nitrogen and compound fertilizers applied was 1 217 million tons excessive nitrogen fertilizer can easily lead to imbalance of root cap growth and significantly decreases in yield harvest index peanut root nodules and nitrogen fertilizer utilization at the same time such inefficient nitrogen management techniques can result in agricultural non point source pollution di and cameron 2002 zhu and chen 2002 liu et al 2004 shi et al 2019 on the contrary appropriate application of nitrogen fertilizer can not only increase the yield of peanuts but also alleviate the pollution xia et al 2020 previous studies have shown that a balanced amount of nitrogen fertilizer can significantly increase photosynthesis and transpiration rates dry matter weight and the yield of tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill and can also enhance the nitrogen accumulation in plants kuscu et al 2014 scholars obtained similar conclusions on crops such as maize and wheat triticum aestivum l zotarelli et al 2009 wang et al 2010 peanuts are commonly planted in semi arid areas of western liaoning however given that irrigation is not widespread peanut crops often experience insufficient water supplies as a result irrigation water has become another important factor limiting the production of peanuts in this region although drought resistant peanuts still require irrigation during their growth and development stages in particular water deficits hinder plant growth and development via several mechanisms including stomatal closure and a decline in photosynthesis hernandez santana et al 2017 li et al 2020 however appropriate water supply can not only enhance photosynthesis but also promote the conversion from source to

isi treatment promoted dry matter accumulation in stems and leaves across the two years the dry matter accumulation in 2017 was observed to be higher than that of 2016 this may be attributed to the greater amount of rainfall in 2017 meeting the water demand of the peanut crop the application of nitrogen was able to increase the dry matter accumulation of peanuts however for nitrogen application rates greater than 40 kg ha 1 dry matter remained unchanged furthermore there was an interaction effect between isi and nitrogen on the dry matter accumulation of roots for nitrogen application rates between 0 and 40 kg ha 1 the root dry matter of the isi treatment was higher than that of iri the opposite was observed for nitrogen application rates between 40 and 80 kg ha 1 indicating that isi promoted the development of the root system under low nitrogen application rates whereas under application rates between 40 and 80 kg ha 1 the isi was more conducive to the effective conversion of dry matter from roots to other plant components and limited the redundant growth of roots 3 2 nitrogen uptake in peanut components during the vegetative growth stage the nitrogen accumulation curve exhibited a single peak while the highest nitrogen accumulation rates were associated with the n2 treatment however nitrogen application rate at 80 kg ha 1 induced redundant growth resulting in the obvious inhabitation of root growth fig 2 which ultimately reduced the absorption of n regardless of the nitrogen application rates supplemental irrigation greatly promoted n absorption there was a significant difference between the effect of isi on total nitrogen accumulation and that on nitrogen accumulation in different organs as nitrogen application rates increased the nitrogen uptake of the roots stems and leaves initially increased and subsequently decreased compared with the stems and roots the effect of isi on nitrogen accumulation in leaves was more significant which promoted the nitrogen transformation from the stems into the leaves the effects of irrigation regimes and nitrogen managements on nitrogen accumulation were basically consistent within two years in the reproductive growth period the effect of nitrogen application on total nitrogen accumulation of peanuts weakened yet n2 was still able to obtain the highest nitrogen uptake in addition isi significantly increased the total amount of nitrogen accumulation and exerted a positive effect in the reproductive growth period more specifically isi promoted the nitrogen transformation in the leaves and was conducive to the formation of economic yield figs 4 5 3 3 yield and water nitrogen use efficiency since nitrogen application and isi effectively regulated the accumulation and distribution of nitrogen it would significantly affect the use efficiency of water and nitrogen table 3 shows that irrigation regimes and nitrogen application both significantly affected water productivity water consumption nitrogen agronomic efficiency and nitrogen recovery efficiency while nitrogen application exhibited significant effects on irrigation water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency isi during the two growing seasons significantly increased yield water consumption and nitrogen agronomic efficiency nae by 20 1 32 1 and 52 4 respectively but reduced water productivity and nae by 8 9 and 7 9 table 4 yield water consumption and water productivity values initially rose and subsequently decreased with increases in the nitrogen application rate the n2 treatment obtained the highest peanut yield and water productivity while the n1 treatment consumed the most water furthermore statistically the highest nitrogen use efficiency and recovery efficiency values were observed for the n2 treatment this indicates that an appropriate nitrogen application rate at 60 kg ha 1 increased nitrogen utilization while rates above this level may have resulted in low nitrogen use efficiency due to growth redundancy in 2017 the highest nae and iwue values were associated with the n2 treatment while in 2016 iwue peaked for the n3 treatment this indicates that the appropriate nitrogen application rate not only improved the utilization of nitrogen but also promoted the irrigation water use efficiency it also suggests that the exogenous nitrite nitrogen in soil required water to be used by peanuts plant the two factors of water and nitrogen had significant interactions on peanut yield water consumption water productivity agronomic use efficiency nitrogen use and recovery efficiency under iri nitrogen linearly decreased with water consumption whereas under isi water consumption initially increased and subsequently decreased with increases in nitrogen application rates furthermore isi significantly reduced water productivity indicating that although irrigation increased peanut yields the yield increasing effect of water consumption per unit gradually decreased particularly for higher nitrogen application rates under n1 and n2 isi was able to significantly promote the transformation of nitrogen and also increased nue however under n3 nue values of isi were significantly lower than those of rain fed irrigation 3 4 soil nitrate nitrogen distribution soil nitrate nitrogen accumulation values of isi treatment were lower than that of the rain fed irrigation across soil profiles fig 6 moreover the soil residual nitrate nitrogen in 2017 was lower than that in 2016 which may be due to the significant increase in nitrogen uptake by plants in 2017 the soil residual nitrate nitrogen observed for the n3 treatment was higher than that of the n0 treatment post harvest soil nitrate nitrogen was principally distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer accounting for 77 75 of the 0 60 cm soil layer in addition the accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen in the deep layer 40 60 cm in 2016 was higher than that of 2017 since the irrigation water was determined based on soil water content in the root zone the difference in rainfall between the two years had a key impact on the distribution of soil nitrate nitrogen 3 5 nitrogen transformation in peanut fruit figs 7 and 8 show the differences of essential and non essential amino acids content in different treatments respectively essential e g isoleucine leucine phenylalanine and non essential e g arginine aspartic acid glutamate amino acid content generally increased and subsequently decreased with increases in nitrogen the highest amino acid content was observed for n1 and n2 yet the effect of isi on amino acid content was difficult to induce the red marks in fig 9 demonstrate that the content of most amino acids was positively correlated with the total nitrogen content in particular the amino acid content seemed to be a function of the nitrogen content in the peanut kernel furthermore methionine and cysteine exhibited a weak correlation with total nitrogen content by looking at the blue marks tyrosine methionine and cysteine were less correlated with other amino acid content based on these results we performed variance analysis on the total content of essential and non essential amino acids table 5 indicated that the effects of water nitrogen interaction on the total content of essential and non essential amino acids were not significant irrigation regimes had a regulation effect on the essential amino acid content while nitrogen application had a significant effect on the total content of nitrogen and essential and non essential amino acids moreover the content of total nitrogen and amino acids observed for the n1 and n2 treatments were significantly higher than those of the n0 and n3 treatments however n1 and iri were both able to increase the total content of essential amino acids therefore for peanuts the application of a small amount of nitrogen fertilizer could achieve the highest amino acid content 4 discussion 4 1 effects of supplemental irrigation on water and nitrogen utilization and nitrogen transformation dry matter accumulation is the basis for crop yield formation and nitrogen nutrition is an important factor affecting the formation of dry matter in crops xing et al 2015 wu et al 2016 using pot experiments arruda et al 2015 detected a quadratic relationship between peanut yield and nitrogen application rates the accumulation of dry matter in plants is approximately equivalent to the accumulation of nitrogen however different forms of water and nitrogen management can significantly impact nitrogen accumulation results from the current study demonstrate that increasing nitrogen application rates significantly increased dry matter nitrogen accumulation and the pod yield of peanuts in particular the fitted quadratic curve equation in fig 3 indicates that under rainfed and isi conditions dry matter weight peaked with applications of nitrogen at 55 65 kg ha 1 and 60 100 kg ha 1 respectively this finding along with that shown in fig 2 shows that isi inhibited the growth of roots as nitrogen increased from 40 to 60 kg ha 1 but promoted the continuous improvement of dry matter quality however excessive nitrogen application rates not only failed to increase yields or dry matter quality but in fact significantly reduced yields and dry matter which has been confirmed by other studies qian et al 2006 gheysari et al 2009 our results demonstrate the presence of variations between treatments in nitrogen accumulation and the distribution of several organs during the peanut growing period during the peanut seedling and flower pegging stages the leaves rapidly developed while the pod yield accumulation rate was greater during the pod bearing and fruit filling stages as the growing period advances the number of peanut leaves increases and at the same time the nitrogen of the bottom leaves are transferred to the new top leaves resulting in a higher nitrogen content jiao et al 2006 in the current study as nitrogen application rates increased the nitrogen accumulation in the flowering and pod bearing stages of peanuts and the nitrogen proportion of pods to total plants increased more intensely this indicates that nitrogen application promoted the development of the reproductive organs moderate irrigation regimes can improve the water use efficiency of crops as verified in many studies however research has also demonstrated that water use efficiency is maximized under conditions of water shortage fabeiro et al 2002 ertek et al 2004 which affirms the productivity of unit water yet ignores the ability of water to regulate the use of biogenic elements the current study showed that the effective distribution of nitrogen attributed to isi subsequently significantly increased the pod yield of peanuts this suggests that supplemental irrigation was beneficial to peanuts in terms of drought resistance and ultimately for higher yields for nitrogen transfer in the fruits the effect of isi on total amino acid content was difficult to induce and primarily stemmed from the increased involvement of supplemental irrigation in inducing functional soluble proteins xia et al 2020 under the same nitrogen application rates the water use efficiency of the rainfed irrigation was significantly higher than that of the supplemental irrigation however at a nitrogen application rate of 60 kg ha 1 no significant difference between water use efficiency across irrigation treatments was observed therefore although supplemental irrigation was not conducive to the accumulation of essential amino acids it could significantly improve water use efficiency in addition to promoting the accumulation of dry matter and the conversion of nitrogen into the peanut fruits 4 2 effect of supplemental irrigation on the distribution of soil nitrate nitrogen under soil water stress crops have the ability to adapt to harsh environments to resist drought many studies have shown that when soil water or nutrient supply is insufficient the root system of crops could preferentially grow to enhance the absorption of water and nutrients in the soil anghinoni and barber 1980 robinson 1994 wu et al 2019 nitrate nitrogen is the main form of nitrogen absorbed and used by crops qian et al 2006 under film mulching and suitable irrigation regimes the soil water content at 0 60 cm soil depth can not only maintain more nitrate nitrogen but can also benefit the growth of peanuts ramakrishna et al 2006 htoon et al 2019 we found that supplemental irrigation at an appropriate water control threshold benefited the accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen and promoted the conversion of nitrogen into peanut pods thus an appropriate nitrate supply can promote crop growth however excessive application of nitrate nitrogen can cause redundant growth reduce the harvest index delay maturity and even reduce yield fritschi et al 2003 n3 significantly decreased peanuts yield water and nitrogen use efficiency table 4 furthermore the nitrate nitrogen accumulated in the soil under rainfall may also increase the risk of leaching zhang et al 2012 research has shown that if all nitrogen fertilizers are applied as base fertilizers the content of nitrate nitrogen at 0 60 cm soil depth in the early peanut growth stage is significantly higher than that observed when peanut plants are mature zhou et al 2002 this finding suggests that large amounts of nitrate nitrogen remain below the root zone under high precipitation and high quotas of irrigation increasing the risk of nitrate leaching to deep soil layers as well as the contamination of groundwater zotarelli et al 2008 wu et al 2020 when nitrogen was applied at 80 kg ha 1 we found that the content of nitrate nitrogen in the deep layer of the isi treatment was significantly higher than that of the rain fed treatment thus nitrate nitrogen participated in the leaching process and resulted in lower nitrogen recovery efficiency and water productivity table 4 absolutely nitrogen loss caused by supplemental irrigation under high nitrogen rates may also be a key factor in reducing the content of essential amino acids in peanut kernels table 5 therefore effective fertilization techniques and the determination of boundary conditions for nitrate nitrogen leaching are required in order to obtain maximum nitrogen fertilizer productivity levels for field crop production 5 conclusions the results above show that i supplementing 60 48 mm irrigation water significantly increased yield water consumption and nitrogen agronomic efficiency by 20 1 32 1 and 52 4 respectively but reduced water productivity and nitrogen recovery efficiency by 8 9 and 7 9 ii although the supplemental irrigation was associated with an increased risk of the nitrogen moving deeper into the soil it greatly enhanced nitrogen transfer from leaves to the pods at nitrogen application rates of 40 60 kg ha 1 iii nitrogen rate at 40 kg ha 1 was able to significantly increase the content of non essential and essential amino acids whereas supplemental irrigation reduced the content of essential amino acids

10428,agriculture in developing countries is a vulnerable sector and is subsidized environmental restrictions on agriculture sector are minimal the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused serious non point source water pollution although previous studies have focused on agricultural water pollution the cooperation between agricultural and industrial sectors in water pollution mitigation has not been thoroughly discussed in this context this paper introduces a cross sectoral water pollution dynamic model we studied the feedback subgame perfect equilibrium of the non cooperative game between two sectors to discern the impact of environmental policy we compared the equilibrium solutions of two scenarios that differ in terms of environmental policy for agricultural sector mitigation the results show that when agricultural and industrial sectors work together to mitigate water pollution the accumulated common pollutants level decreases when sectors consider mitigation measures in their objectives they tend to emit more pollutants the damage produced by both sectors is lower when both sectors participate in mitigation our policy recommendation is that cross sectoral water pollution control is essential and developing countries should include both agricultural and industrial sectors in environmental governance to maximize the coordination of cross sectoral environmental policies keywords agricultural water pollution cross sectoral water pollution joint governance strategy differential game 1 introduction the agricultural and industrial sectors are major sources of water pollution in developing countries however due to the conflict amongst economic development food security and environmental protection developing countries tend to focus on industrial water pollution mitigation but neglect agricultural water pollution mitigation previous studies have focused on the pollution of rivers and waters as well as the technical aspects of water pollution treatment tung and yaseen 2020 chau and jiang 2002 but have been less involved in policy research and cross sectoral joint governance the agricultural production in developing countries is still decentralized small scale and extensive parris 2011 evans et al 2019 agricultural water pollution is mostly produced from the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides resulting in serious non point source pollution of groundwater hession and shanholtz 1988 according to world bank statistics the total fertilizer consumption increased by 12 times in the 10 years from 2006 to 2016 mainly due to the increase in fertilizer application in developing countries for example in 2016 fertilizer consumption in china was 503 3 kg ha of arable land and 659 5 kg ha in colombia in contrast fertilizer use in developed countries has not increased much or has decreased in 2016 fertilizer consumption was 110 5 kg ha in the united states and 68 1 kg ha in australia obviously agricultural water pollution mitigation is particularly important in developing countries because economic development and environmental protection are more opposed creating obstacles to the implementation of environmental protection policies walter and ugelow 1979 ecological policy and politics in developing countries 1998 taking china as an example in the early days of industrialization china emphasized gross domestic product gdp growth rather than environmental protection kaneko and managi 2004 zuo et al 2017 with the rapid growth of china s economy and the improvement of people s living standards the whole society including government business and the public is increasingly paying attention to environmental problems wu et al 2014 diao et al 2009 thus china has implemented many measures to control water pollution but predominantly in the industrial sector water pollution in the agricultural sector has not been seriously considered sun et al 2012 one reason for this is that agriculture is a weak sector subsidies are still paid and strict environmental policies will restrict the development of this sector china has a large population to feed and the output of the agricultural sector is a priority the central government of china emphasized that the food self sufficiency rate should be over 95 in the national food security and long term planning framework 2008 2020 to increase grain output as much as possible many chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used the fertilizer is partly used and is partly turned into water pollution other developing countries are in a similar or worse position given the industrial sector produces considerable water pollution consensus has been reached on the need for mitigation investment in the industrial sector water pollution in the agricultural sector is subtler and thus it is not paid enough attention in developing countries and regions braden et al 1989 water pollution in the industrial and agricultural sectors should be considered as part of environmental governance berry et al 2015 there is precedent for cross sectoral collaboration on pollution control for example industrial power residential and transport sectors have been examined and measures to reduce air pollution hand in hand have been recommended peng et al 2017 however these studies only focused on air pollution and the cooperation between agricultural and industrial sectors has not been put forward in terms of governance strategies the difficulty of study cross sectoral water pollution is how to construct a model to depict the dynamic game process of the two sectors and get the equilibrium strategy of the two sides as well as the change trajectory of the main indicators such as pollutant stocks and emissions in order to achieve this goal we first need to make a good observation of the reality and abstract the key variable adaptation is a key component of climate policy in developing countries vardar and zaccour 2018 agriculture is vulnerable and more sensitive to changes in climate than industry ford et al 2015 farmers in developing countries are mostly smallholder farmers 90 of them have already perceived climate variability and 85 have made attempts to adapt using practices such as the adjustment of sowing dates crop diversification soil and water conservation changing their irrigation methods and planting density belay et al 2017 sultan and gaetani 2016 given environmental degradation the agricultural sector in developing countries is also focusing on adaptation such as building dams enhancing the drought resistance of crops creating stronger seeds and planting crops adapted to acid rain arslan et al 2015 long term mitigation measures are less likely to be considered because they focus on output hards et al 2016 therefore adaptation is crucial in the agricultural sector as it is a kind of spontaneous and internal response to climate change that does not need the promotion from external forces the agricultural sector does not focus on mitigation unless it is motivated by external forces such as environmental policy conversely the industrial sector is less directly affected by changes in the environment and therefore invests less in adaptation and is more focused on mitigation however the industrial sector is the main creator of water pollution so must to engage in mitigation for this and many other reasons such as corporate social responsibility government environmental regulation and consumer environmental preference fais et al 2016 thus the two key issues with pollution management the first is that effective pollution control requires cross sectoral cooperation halsnæs 1997 focusing on pollution in only one sector does not effectively mitigate the damage caused by pollution ingold and fischer 2014 because pollution can be diffused across different sectors agrawal et al 1999 so industrial water pollution affects agricultural production and agricultural water pollution affects industrial production in particular the environmental policies of different sectors are different which promote or weaken the effects of policies through mutual influence current research mainly discusses transboundary industrial water pollution problem yeung and petrosyan 2008 huang et al 2016 however cross sectoral water pollution control has not received widespread attention and research bravo 2019 yi et al 2017 the second issue is that agricultural water pollution in developing countries is becoming increasingly serious due to the focus on short term benefits while ignoring long term environmental costs subsidies to agriculture in developing countries may even exacerbate agricultural water pollution chen et al 2017 environmental policy or economic constraints impact the environmental behavior of different sectors yoeli et al 2017 different sectors have different development plans and attitudes toward environmental protection and mitigation which directly affect their environmental behaviors policies need to be coordinated and adjusted among sectors to maximize the overall policies efficiency as such cross sector water pollution control research is particularly important the research conclusions will have policy significance and practical application value to solve those problems first we need to consider the cross sectoral cooperation between agriculture and industry to control water pollution locatelli et al 2015 especially considering the dynamic change in the behavior of the two sectors according to the respective changes in strategies we adopt the theory of differential game to explore cross sectoral conflict and cooperation by building a differential game model in game theory differential games are a group of problems related to the modeling and analysis of conflict in the context of a dynamical system more specifically a state variable or variables evolve over time according to a differential equation this is very consistent with the research objectives of this paper secondly we must simulate how the policy incentives of long term mitigation in the agricultural sector affect the water pollution level and emission strategies of the two sectors and then provide policy recommendations to achieve these goals we considered a region that only has an industrial sector and an agricultural sector with a finite planning horizon most differential games are considered on the infinite horizon however for research of a policy cycle a finite game may be more realistic than an infinite game the planning horizon t can then be interpreted as a policy period every environmental policy has a period of execution and a different government may have different environmental policies the by product of having a finite horizon is that the strategies and the value functions are time dependent and harder to compute than in an infinite horizon model because the resulting ricatti equations form a differential equation system instead of an algebraic system as is the case in an infinite horizon model we characterized equilibrium mitigation adaptation emissions and outcomes in two scenarios where agriculture only focuses on adaptation and where it engages in mitigation the scenario 1 is a benchmark by contrasting the results of the two scenarios we aimed to answer the following research questions 1 how do water pollutant levels compared in the two scenarios 2 how do the emission and investment strategies of both sectors compared in the two scenarios 3 how do the length of the planning horizon and the value of the environmental utility affect the strategies of two scenarios 4 do policy incentives for agriculture mitigation contribute to long term environmental benefits 2 the model consider two sectors indexed by i 1 2 where 1 denotes the industrial sector and 2 denotes the agricultural sector time t runs continuously and the planning horizon is finite and denoted by t production activities by each sectoral have a utility u i and as a by product pollutant emissions e g nitrides are denoted by y i sector s production of goods and services and by e i the resulting emissions with e i h i y i where h i is an increasing function satisfying h i 0 0 assuming a monotonously increasing relationship between production and utility the utility can be directly expressed as a function of emissions that is u i t according to the law of diminishing marginal utility and the tradition the utility function is assumed to have a linear quadratic form given by 1 u i t α i β i 2 e i t e i t where α i and β i are strictly positive parameters this functional form was used in many studies jørgensen et al 2010 and it implies a diminishing marginal utility of emissions in the interior solution mitigation reduces water pollution levels m i denotes the mitigation effort of sector i the emissions generated in each sector accumulate in the level of common pollutants p t whose evolution is governed by the following differential equation 2 d p d t t e 1 t e 2 t φ 1 m 1 t φ 2 m 2 t k p t where φ i denotes the efficiency of each sector s mitigation effort at each moment of time each sector s emissions are added to the level of water pollution which decays at the natural sequestration rate denoted by k 0 1 the accumulated level of water pollution causes damage in each sector which can be reduced by investing in specific adaptation the adaptation capital of the agricultural sector is denoted by a 2 the industrial sector is not concerned with adaptation investment similar to benchekroun et al 2017 and masoudi and zaccour masoudi and zaccour 2018 2017 we assumed that the damage cost depends on the pollution level and adaptation capital and retains the following functional form 3 d 1 p δ 1 2 p 2 4 d 2 p a 2 δ 2 2 p 2 γ a 2 p where δ i i 1 2 and γ 0 are strictly positive parameters the first element of the damage function is now standard in the literature long 1992 van der ploeg and de zeeuw 1992 dockner and van long 1993 the second term includes the sector s level of adaptation capital as a variable that decreases the damage the assumption of this functional form implies that the marginal damage of water pollution decreases with adaptation capital adaptation also considers private property that can only reduce water pollution damage in its own sector berry et al 2015 both mitigation and adaptation require investment in capital technology and human resources and therefore incur costs following the literature chang et al 2018 li 2014 mitigation costs are assumed to be increasing and convex and are taken as quadratic for tractability with c i m denoting the mitigation cost of both sectors and c 2 a the adaptation cost of the agriculture sector which have the following functional forms 5 c i m i m 2 m i 2 t 6 c 2 a 2 a 2 a 2 2 t where i m 0 i 1 2 denotes the coefficient of the marginal cost of investment in mitigation capital in sector i and 2 a 0 denotes the coefficient of the marginal cost of investment in adaptation capital in the agricultural sector assuming profit maximization behavior the industrial sector and agricultural sector s objective function are given by 7 j 1 max m 1 e 1 0 t u 1 t c 1 m t d 1 p e ρ t d t s 1 p t 8 j 2 max m 2 e 2 a 2 0 t u 2 t c 2 m t c 2 a t d 2 p a 2 e ρ t d t s 2 p t which means that at each date t sector i obtains a benefit from its emissions receives damage that depends on the accumulated common water pollution level and on its own level mitigation adaptation capital and pays the cost of investment in mitigation and adaptation capital at that date s i p t is the salvage value of player i 1 2 we suppose that this value can be well approximated by the linear function 9 s i p t λ i q p t where λ i is a nonnegative parameter following the literature jiang et al 2019 we recognized that each sector has an upper limit on the total amount of pollutants q to recapitulate through eqs 2 and 7 8 we defined a two player finite horizon differential game with one state variable p and five control variables two for the industrial sector m 1 and e 1 and three for the agricultural sector m 2 e 2 and a 2 3 outcomes of the two scenarios next we investigated the cross sectoral water pollution problems between the industrial and agricultural sectors in the first scenario the industrial sector invests in mitigation and the agricultural sector only engages in adaptation this is the current environmental policy situation in most developing countries in the second scenario we introduced policy constraints that require the agricultural sector to invest in mitigation measures and the agricultural sector continues to invest in adaptation measures while industrial departments continue to focus on mitigation measures aiming to determine how the mitigation policies of the agricultural sector affect both sectors emission strategies and the level of common pollutants in both scenarios the two sectors play a noncooperative game using a feedback information structure emissions and investment in mitigation and adaptation strategies are state dependent with the state being defined as a two dimensional vector t p by comparing the solutions of the two stages we aimed to gain insights into the impact of environment policy in the agricultural sector on the equilibrium outcomes 3 1 first scenario agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation in first scenario we assume m 2 0 that is the agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation v i t p t denotes the value function of player i recall that the value function measures the gain that a player can obtain from any position of the game that is t p t in this stage the objectives

respect to the state variable were used to analyze the strategic emission and mitigation choices of both sectors responding to the increase in the level of water pollution 3 2 second scenario agricultural sector invest in mitigation in the second scenario the agricultural sector also invests in mitigation technically this scenario consists of two state variables t and p and five control variables e 1 e 2 m 1 m 2 a 2 in this stage the objective functions and the water pollution dynamics are the same as in eq s 2 and 7 8 respectively to obtain the solutions we used the same procedure

organize the simulations in a comprehensive way that is we start from a given parameter constellation and then vary the parameter values one at a time the calibration settings of these parameters are given as follows the marginal utility of both sectors α i β i 1 1 the effectiveness of mitigation in reducing water pollution and its marginal cost are φ i 1 and i m 1 3 and the marginal water pollution damage δ i 0 005 for i 1 2 similarly the marginal cost of investment in adaptation and its efficiency are 2 a 1 05 and γ 0 007 respectively moreover the natural decay rate of water pollution k 0 04 and the initial water pollution stock p 0 10 the planning horizon t 20 meanwhile the salvage value parameters λ i 0 6 q 200 and discount rate ρ 0 025 4 1 equilibrium strategies this subsection details the strategic response of each sector to the change in the level of water pollution in the feedback nash equilibrium considering the symmetric cases we ran various simulations by varying the calibrations of parameters and the simulation of the second scenario produced similar outcomes as the first scenario as shown in fig 2 consequently we only show the trajectories of the first scenario which indicates the strategic response of both sectors to water pollution and many other changing parameters the signs of the partial derivatives of the response functions with respect to the state variable p remain the same throughout the whole game and are independent of the changing calibrations of the different parameters so we summarize the following conjectures conjecture 1 fig 1 presents that for both scenarios the emission of each sector decreases with the increasing pollutant sock whereas the effort in investing in the mitigation of these sectors increases with increasing water pollution level formally e i p 0 m i p 0 f o r i 1 2 a n d i j due to the assumptions of the marginal damage function increasing in water pollution and the marginal utility function decreasing in emissions we formed conjecture 1 the increasing level of pollutants increases the marginal cost of damage meaning that both sectors will cut their emissions and invest in mitigation to reduce the damage caused by increasing water pollution another observation from the trajectories shown in fig 1 is that the emissions strategies of the two sectors responses to the increasing pollutant level appear to be more robust to variations in only certain parameters for instance by comparing the panels shown in fig 1 the strategic emission response to the variation in adaptation efficiency γ marginal cost of investment in adaptation 2 a and salvage value parameters λ i and q are more robust than the others the robustness of the mitigation strategy of each sector to each parameter is consistent with that of the emission strategy based on the above analysis and diagram we found how these strategic decisions are affected by parameter values taking the emission strategic response to pollutant level as an example and keeping other parameters the same both sectors cut more emissions accordingly when the marginal cost of invest in mitigation increases when the marginal damage cost of water pollution increases and when the natural decay decreases the findings were similar when using the same approach for the cases in which a sector intensifies its mitigation effort as a response to an increase in common pollutant level especially when the marginal damage cost of water pollution increases the effectiveness of mitigation of water pollution decreases and the natural decay decreases 4 2 equilibrium trajectories in this subsection we compare the equilibrium control and state trajectories and the damage cost functions obtained in both scenarios by simulating different values of those parameters to save space we only provide the representative results as shown in each figure two trajectories satisfying the benchmark here denotes where both players invest in mitigation and 0 denotes its counterpart when only the industry mitigates our conjectures are as follows conjecture 2 fig 2 a indicates that for all varying parameters the level of pollutants is lower when the agricultural sector also invests in mitigation i e p t p 0 t t 0 t from the comparison in conjectures 2 for any given initial level p 0 the pollutant level is lowest when both sectors undertake mitigation actions as mitigation allows the sectors to emit less per unit output by intensifying the mitigation effort conjecture 3 fig 2b and c show that for all varying parameters the strategic emission decision of both players is lower when the agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation i e e 1 t e 1 0 t t 0 t e 2 t e 2 0 t t 0 t the statement for conjecture 3 illustrates how the different mitigation strategies affect emission levels when both sectors participate in mitigation the estimate pollutant level will be lower consequently they tend to emit more to receive more productive utility conjecture 4 fig 2d illustrates that for all varying parameters the industrial sector invests more in mitigation when the agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation formally m 1 0 t m 1 t t 0 t conjecture 5 fig 2e illustrates that for all varying parameters instead of investing in mitigation the agricultural sector will invest more in adaptation when only the industrial sector mitigates for a different interpretation in the second scenario as the policy requires the agricultural sector to invest in mitigation investment in adaptation will decrease in the absence of additional subsidies that is a 2 0 t a 2 t t 0 t the comparison of conjecture 3 and 5 is due to the anticipation of increased pollutant level when the agricultural sector neglects mitigation in response the industrial sector invests more in mitigation the agricultural sector strengthens its adaptation effort to reduce the adverse effect of water pollution conjecture 6 fig 3 a and b illustrate that for all parameters the damage that both sectors suffer is higher when only one sector participates in mitigation formally we obtain d 1 0 t d 1 t t 0 t d 2 0 t d 2 t t 0 t to interpret this conjecture although the agricultural sector intensifies the investment in mitigation in the second scenario it is still unable to reverse the rising trend of pollutant levels thus resulting in an increase in the water pollution damage cost however the comparison of the solutions in fig 3 also illustrates that when the agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation but the other does the damage the both sectors receive will increase and compared with that of the agricultural sector the damage of the industrial sector will take the highest path in the whole duration of the game combining these comparative results with the previous conjectures we see that the agricultural sector only adapting without mitigating makes the industrial sector emit less and face higher damage cost over time compared to the scenario in which it mitigates thus in a feedback nash equilibrium without mitigation investment in the agricultural sector results in higher welfare losses in the industrial sector by reducing emissions and increasing its own damage cost we also focused on the effect of the length of time horizon on the pollutants level to use a of consistent horizon we only simulated the trajectories of the state variable fig 4 presents the different equilibrium trajectories of the water pollution levels due to the changing time horizon in the first scenario we obtain the following conjecture indicates the case in which the time horizon is longer conjecture 7 for all parameters the sectors tend to pollute more when the planning time horizon is extended i e p ˆ t p t fig 4 reveals that the pollutants level increases with the extending planning horizon the reason for this phenomenon is that both sectors have a tendency to solve the water pollution problem backward in the feedback equilibrium due to the extended planning time horizon the sectors pay a higher damage cost for the increasing accumulated pollutants they will also benefit from the increasing emissions for a longer planning time thus both of these sectors have more incentive to exchange economic benefits for the accumulated water pollution finally we studied how the salvage value parameters affect the state and control variables examining the differences in the equilibrium trajectories fig 5 depicts some phenomena as expected a lower salvage value of environmental quality leads to higher common accumulated pollutant levels and emissions a greater adaptation effort of the agriculture sector and a lower mitigation effort by the industrial sector a decrease in the salvage value of the upper threshold of pollutant stock from q 200 to q 175 has no effect on these equilibrium trajectories but it causes the value loss of both sectors which can be observed from fig 6 apparently this phenomenon shows that although the decrease of the upper limit of pollutants will lead to a decline in the overall revenue of each sector the motivation of behaving myopically causes the industrial and agricultural sectors only care about the current economic production benefits and ignore the impact of the limit value on their respective investment and production strategies resulting in the loss of environmental and ecological benefits in the duration of the entire game 5 discussion different sectors such as the agricultural sector the industrial sector and the service sector have different environmental policies that lead to different environmental behaviors the agricultural and industrial sectors are the main sectors in developing countries and also the main sources of water pollution when sectors consider mitigation and adaptation measures in their decision making processes the policies have various consequences on their strategies and the outcomes of the feedback nash equilibrium of the cross sectoral water pollution dynamic game we incorporated a mitigation policy as the sector s ability to invest in mitigation capital level which reduces the accumulated common pollutant levels we also incorporated an adaptation policy as the agricultural sector s ability to invest in private adaptation capital level which reduces the damage the sector receives from the accumulated common pollutant levels we conducted a numerical analysis of the equilibrium strategies and the trajectories of the sectors decisions we suggest that when dealing with water pollution the government and relevant departments should consider the following three elements first developing countries should introduce policies to strengthen the mitigation of agricultural water pollution on the one hand specific quantitative standards for the use of pesticides fertilizers and plastic films in crop production should be put forward on the other hand treatment of solid waste in poultry breeding and prevent groundwater pollution should be strengthened second water pollution control is a long term process and it is urgent to guide the agricultural sector to transform its focus of pollution control from short term adaptation to long term mitigation environmental protection and economic output should be put in the same important position third the treatment of water pollution requires multi sectoral cooperation and policy coordination in addition the two sectors should jointly tackle key problems in agricultural waste water treatment technology 6 conclusions first when agricultural and industrial sectors work together to mitigate emissions accumulated common pollutant levels are reduced this verifies the importance of cross sectoral joint water pollution control proposed in this paper when only the industrial sector mitigates the agricultural sector displays a free riding behavior the agricultural sector continues to pollute the soil groundwater and air not considering long term damage to the environment but only current and short term benefits the public community and government focus on mitigation in the industrial sector which places considerable pressure on the development of the industrial sector as a result the agricultural sector can benefit from mitigation investment in the industrial sector at no cost this is an inefficient policy regulation therefore we investigates what would occur if the government issues relevant policies and implements relatively strict environmental constraints for the agricultural sector and asks the agricultural sector to mitigate second when sectors consider mitigation measures in their objectives they tend to emit more over time because investing in mitigation capital reduces the emission per unit of output of both sectors which means more product with the same emissions to pursue higher utility both departments have the incentive to increase production which leads to increased emissions for investment strategies when the agriculture sector invests in mitigation the industrial sector reduces its mitigation investment simultaneously the agriculture sector reduces its investment in adaptation therefore from the perspective of the joint mitigation of agricultural and industrial sectors the mitigation action of the agricultural department reduces the pressure on the industrial sector as a result mitigation investment decreases in the industrial sector from the perspective of investment decision making within the agricultural sector the agricultural sector needs to invest in mitigation meaning that it uses the capital originally invested in adaptation as a result adaptation investment decreases in the agricultural sector third the damage that both sectors suffer is lower when both sectors participate in mitigation which demonstrates that policy constraints for agriculture mitigation contribute to long term environmental benefits our policy recommendation is that developing countries should address agricultural non point source water pollution considering both sectors development and the environmental carrying capacity we should not allow the agricultural sector to continue to use chemical fertilizers and pesticides without limit asymmetric sectoral mitigation policies can result in a loss of benefit to the other sector which needs to invest more in mitigation and results in higher water pollution damage costs for both sectors the limitation of this study is that it only demonstrates the necessity of joint water pollution control by agricultural and industrial sectors but it does not clarify to what extent the environmental regulation of agricultural sector should be at present some developed countries such as france have implemented strict environmental regulations on the agricultural sector leading to farmers dissatisfaction and difficulties in agricultural production and operation in order to ensure that environmental regulations of agricultural sectors in developing countries do not bring much negative impact on agricultural production and food supply the next step of the research is to establish the specific mechanism of cross sectoral joint water pollution control however different countries have different realities and some case studies are needed funding this research was funded by six talent

10428,agriculture in developing countries is a vulnerable sector and is subsidized environmental restrictions on agriculture sector are minimal the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused serious non point source water pollution although previous studies have focused on agricultural water pollution the cooperation between agricultural and industrial sectors in water pollution mitigation has not been thoroughly discussed in this context this paper introduces a cross sectoral water pollution dynamic model we studied the feedback subgame perfect equilibrium of the non cooperative game between two sectors to discern the impact of environmental policy we compared the equilibrium solutions of two scenarios that differ in terms of environmental policy for agricultural sector mitigation the results show that when agricultural and industrial sectors work together to mitigate water pollution the accumulated common pollutants level decreases when sectors consider mitigation measures in their objectives they tend to emit more pollutants the damage produced by both sectors is lower when both sectors participate in mitigation our policy recommendation is that cross sectoral water pollution control is essential and developing countries should include both agricultural and industrial sectors in environmental governance to maximize the coordination of cross sectoral environmental policies keywords agricultural water pollution cross sectoral water pollution joint governance strategy differential game 1 introduction the agricultural and industrial sectors are major sources of water pollution in developing countries however due to the conflict amongst economic development food security and environmental protection developing countries tend to focus on industrial water pollution mitigation but neglect agricultural water pollution mitigation previous studies have focused on the pollution of rivers and waters as well as the technical aspects of water pollution treatment tung and yaseen 2020 chau and jiang 2002 but have been less involved in policy research and cross sectoral joint governance the agricultural production in developing countries is still decentralized small scale and extensive parris 2011 evans et al 2019 agricultural water pollution is mostly produced from the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides resulting in serious non point source pollution of groundwater hession and shanholtz 1988 according to world bank statistics the total fertilizer consumption increased by 12 times in the 10 years from 2006 to 2016 mainly due to the increase in fertilizer application in developing countries for example in 2016 fertilizer consumption in china was 503 3 kg ha of arable land and 659 5 kg ha in colombia in contrast fertilizer use in developed countries has not increased much or has decreased in 2016 fertilizer consumption was 110 5 kg ha in the united states and 68 1 kg ha in australia obviously agricultural water pollution mitigation is particularly important in developing countries because economic development and environmental protection are more opposed creating obstacles to the implementation of environmental protection policies walter and ugelow 1979 ecological policy and politics in developing countries 1998 taking china as an example in the early days of industrialization china emphasized gross domestic product gdp growth rather than environmental protection kaneko and managi 2004 zuo et al 2017 with the rapid growth of china s economy and the improvement of people s living standards the whole society including government business and the public is increasingly paying attention to environmental problems wu et al 2014 diao et al 2009 thus china has implemented many measures to control water pollution but predominantly in the industrial sector water pollution in the agricultural sector has not been seriously considered sun et al 2012 one reason for this is that agriculture is a weak sector subsidies are still paid and strict environmental policies will restrict the development of this sector china has a large population to feed and the output of the agricultural sector is a priority the central government of china emphasized that the food self sufficiency rate should be over 95 in the national food security and long term planning framework 2008 2020 to increase grain output as much as possible many chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used the fertilizer is partly used and is partly turned into water pollution other developing countries are in a similar or worse position given the industrial sector produces considerable water pollution consensus has been reached on the need for mitigation investment in the industrial sector water pollution in the agricultural sector is subtler and thus it is not paid enough attention in developing countries and regions braden et al 1989 water pollution in the industrial and agricultural sectors should be considered as part of environmental governance berry et al 2015 there is precedent for cross sectoral collaboration on pollution control for example industrial power residential and transport sectors have been examined and measures to reduce air pollution hand in hand have been recommended peng et al 2017 however these studies only focused on air pollution and the cooperation between agricultural and industrial sectors has not been put forward in terms of governance strategies the difficulty of study cross sectoral water pollution is how to construct a model to depict the dynamic game process of the two sectors and get the equilibrium strategy of the two sides as well as the change trajectory of the main indicators such as pollutant stocks and emissions in order to achieve this goal we first need to make a good observation of the reality and abstract the key variable adaptation is a key component of climate policy in developing countries vardar and zaccour 2018 agriculture is vulnerable and more sensitive to changes in climate than industry ford et al 2015 farmers in developing countries are mostly smallholder farmers 90 of them have already perceived climate variability and 85 have made attempts to adapt using practices such as the adjustment of sowing dates crop diversification soil and water conservation changing their irrigation methods and planting density belay et al 2017 sultan and gaetani 2016 given environmental degradation the agricultural sector in developing countries is also focusing on adaptation such as building dams enhancing the drought resistance of crops creating stronger seeds and planting crops adapted to acid rain arslan et al 2015 long term mitigation measures are less likely to be considered because they focus on output hards et al 2016 therefore adaptation is crucial in the agricultural sector as it is a kind of spontaneous and internal response to climate change that does not need the promotion from external forces the agricultural sector does not focus on mitigation unless it is motivated by external forces such as environmental policy conversely the industrial sector is less directly affected by changes in the environment and therefore invests less in adaptation and is more focused on mitigation however the industrial sector is the main creator of water pollution so must to engage in mitigation for this and many other reasons such as corporate social responsibility government environmental regulation and consumer environmental preference fais et al 2016 thus the two key issues with pollution management the first is that effective pollution control requires cross sectoral cooperation halsnæs 1997 focusing on pollution in only one sector does not effectively mitigate the damage caused by pollution ingold and fischer 2014 because pollution can be diffused across different sectors agrawal et al 1999 so industrial water pollution affects agricultural production and agricultural water pollution affects industrial production in particular the environmental policies of different sectors are different which promote or weaken the effects of policies through mutual influence current research mainly discusses transboundary industrial water pollution problem yeung and petrosyan 2008 huang et al 2016 however cross sectoral water pollution control has not received widespread attention and research bravo 2019 yi et al 2017 the second issue is that agricultural water pollution in developing countries is becoming increasingly serious due to the focus on short term benefits while ignoring long term environmental costs subsidies to agriculture in developing countries may even exacerbate agricultural water pollution chen et al 2017 environmental policy or economic constraints impact the environmental behavior of different sectors yoeli et al 2017 different sectors have different development plans and attitudes toward environmental protection and mitigation which directly affect their environmental behaviors policies need to be coordinated and adjusted among sectors to maximize the overall policies efficiency as such cross sector water pollution control research is particularly important the research conclusions will have policy significance and practical application value to solve those problems first we need to consider the cross sectoral cooperation between agriculture and industry to control water pollution locatelli et al 2015 especially considering the dynamic change in the behavior of the two sectors according to the respective changes in strategies we adopt the theory of differential game to explore cross sectoral conflict and cooperation by building a differential game model in game theory differential games are a group of problems related to the modeling and analysis of conflict in the context of a dynamical system more specifically a state variable or variables evolve over time according to a differential equation this is very consistent with the research objectives of this paper secondly we must simulate how the policy incentives of long term mitigation in the agricultural sector affect the water pollution level and emission strategies of the two sectors and then provide policy recommendations to achieve these goals we considered a region that only has an industrial sector and an agricultural sector with a finite planning horizon most differential games are considered on the infinite horizon however for research of a policy cycle a finite game may be more realistic than an infinite game the planning horizon t can then be interpreted as a policy period every environmental policy has a period of execution and a different government may have different environmental policies the by product of having a finite horizon is that the strategies and the value functions are time dependent and harder to compute than in an infinite horizon model because the resulting ricatti equations form a differential equation system instead of an algebraic system as is the case in an infinite horizon model we characterized equilibrium mitigation adaptation emissions and outcomes in two scenarios where agriculture only focuses on adaptation and where it engages in mitigation the scenario 1 is a benchmark by contrasting the results of the two scenarios we aimed to answer the following research questions 1 how do water pollutant levels compared in the two scenarios 2 how do the emission and investment strategies of both sectors compared in the two scenarios 3 how do the length of the planning horizon and the value of the environmental utility affect the strategies of two scenarios 4 do policy incentives for agriculture mitigation contribute to long term environmental benefits 2 the model consider two sectors indexed by i 1 2 where 1 denotes the industrial sector and 2 denotes the agricultural sector time t runs continuously and the planning horizon is finite and denoted by t production activities by each sectoral have a utility u i and as a by product pollutant emissions e g nitrides are denoted by y i sector s production of goods and services and by e i the resulting emissions with e i h i y i where h i is an increasing function satisfying h i 0 0 assuming a monotonously increasing relationship between production and utility the utility can be directly expressed as a function of emissions that is u i t according to the law of diminishing marginal utility and the tradition the utility function is assumed to have a linear quadratic form given by 1 u i t α i β i 2 e i t e i t where α i and β i are strictly positive parameters this functional form was used in many studies jørgensen et al 2010 and it implies a diminishing marginal utility of emissions in the interior solution mitigation reduces water pollution levels m i denotes the mitigation effort of sector i the emissions generated in each sector accumulate in the level of common pollutants p t whose evolution is governed by the following differential equation 2 d p d t t e 1 t e 2 t φ 1 m 1 t φ 2 m 2 t k p t where φ i denotes the efficiency of each sector s mitigation effort at each moment of time each sector s emissions are added to the level of water pollution which decays at the natural sequestration rate denoted by k 0 1 the accumulated level of water pollution causes damage in each sector which can be reduced by investing in specific adaptation the adaptation capital of the agricultural sector is denoted by a 2 the industrial sector is not concerned with adaptation investment similar to benchekroun et al 2017 and masoudi and zaccour masoudi and zaccour 2018 2017 we assumed that the damage cost depends on the pollution level and adaptation capital and retains the following functional form 3 d 1 p δ 1 2 p 2 4 d 2 p a 2 δ 2 2 p 2 γ a 2 p where δ i i 1 2 and γ 0 are strictly positive parameters the first element of the damage function is now standard in the literature long 1992 van der ploeg and de zeeuw 1992 dockner and van long 1993 the second term includes the sector s level of adaptation capital as a variable that decreases the damage the assumption of this functional form implies that the marginal damage of water pollution decreases with adaptation capital adaptation also considers private property that can only reduce water pollution damage in its own sector berry et al 2015 both mitigation and adaptation require investment in capital technology and human resources and therefore incur costs following the literature chang et al 2018 li 2014 mitigation costs are assumed to be increasing and convex and are taken as quadratic for tractability with c i m denoting the mitigation cost of both sectors and c 2 a the adaptation cost of the agriculture sector which have the following functional forms 5 c i m i m 2 m i 2 t 6 c 2 a 2 a 2 a 2 2 t where i m 0 i 1 2 denotes the coefficient of the marginal cost of investment in mitigation capital in sector i and 2 a 0 denotes the coefficient of the marginal cost of investment in adaptation capital in the agricultural sector assuming profit maximization behavior the industrial sector and agricultural sector s objective function are given by 7 j 1 max m 1 e 1 0 t u 1 t c 1 m t d 1 p e ρ t d t s 1 p t 8 j 2 max m 2 e 2 a 2 0 t u 2 t c 2 m t c 2 a t d 2 p a 2 e ρ t d t s 2 p t which means that at each date t sector i obtains a benefit from its emissions receives damage that depends on the accumulated common water pollution level and on its own level mitigation adaptation capital and pays the cost of investment in mitigation and adaptation capital at that date s i p t is the salvage value of player i 1 2 we suppose that this value can be well approximated by the linear function 9 s i p t λ i q p t where λ i is a nonnegative parameter following the literature jiang et al 2019 we recognized that each sector has an upper limit on the total amount of pollutants q to recapitulate through eqs 2 and 7 8 we defined a two player finite horizon differential game with one state variable p and five control variables two for the industrial sector m 1 and e 1 and three for the agricultural sector m 2 e 2 and a 2 3 outcomes of the two scenarios next we investigated the cross sectoral water pollution problems between the industrial and agricultural sectors in the first scenario the industrial sector invests in mitigation and the agricultural sector only engages in adaptation this is the current environmental policy situation in most developing countries in the second scenario we introduced policy constraints that require the agricultural sector to invest in mitigation measures and the agricultural sector continues to invest in adaptation measures while industrial departments continue to focus on mitigation measures aiming to determine how the mitigation policies of the agricultural sector affect both sectors emission strategies and the level of common pollutants in both scenarios the two sectors play a noncooperative game using a feedback information structure emissions and investment in mitigation and adaptation strategies are state dependent with the state being defined as a two dimensional vector t p by comparing the solutions of the two stages we aimed to gain insights into the impact of environment policy in the agricultural sector on the equilibrium outcomes 3 1 first scenario agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation in first scenario we assume m 2 0 that is the agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation v i t p t denotes the value function of player i recall that the value function measures the gain that a player can obtain from any position of the game that is t p t in this stage the objectives become 10 j 1 0 max m 1 e 1 0 t u 1 t c 1 m t d 1 p e ρ t d t s 1 p t 11 j 2 0 max m 2 e 2 a 2 0 t u 2 t c 2 a t d 2 p a 2 e ρ t d t s 2 p t and the water pollution dynamics are 12 d p d t t e 1 t e 2

side of eqs 13 and 14 with respect to m i e i and a 2 and equating to zero we then obtain the following feedback strategies of these two sectors 16 e i 0 t p 1 β i α i v i p t p 17 m 1 0 t p φ 1 1 m v

respect to the state variable were used to analyze the strategic emission and mitigation choices of both sectors responding to the increase in the level of water pollution 3 2 second scenario agricultural sector invest in mitigation in the second scenario the agricultural sector also invests in mitigation technically this scenario consists of two state variables t and p and five control variables e 1 e 2 m 1 m 2 a 2 in this stage the objective functions and the water pollution dynamics are the same as in eq s 2 and 7 8 respectively to obtain the solutions we used the same procedure as in the previous scenario then we obtained the following hjb equations 24 r v 1 t p v 1 t max m 1 e 1 u 1 t c 1 m t d 1 p v 1 p e 1 t e 2 t φ 1 m 1 t φ 2 m 2 t k p t 25 r v 2 t p v 2 t max m 2 e 2 a

equating to zero yields the following functions 26 e i t p 1 β i α i v i p t p 27 m 1 t p φ i i m v i p t p 28 a 2 t p γ p 2 a as shown in the previous section by substituting for eqs 26 28 into hjb eqs 24 and 25 and rearranging produces the ricatti equation system the rde form remains the same as eq 22 whereas the coefficients change 29 c 11 δ 1 2 c 21 γ 2 2 2 a δ 2 2 c i 2 k c i 3 1 2 β i φ i 2

organize the simulations in a comprehensive way that is we start from a given parameter constellation and then vary the parameter values one at a time the calibration settings of these parameters are given as follows the marginal utility of both sectors α i β i 1 1 the effectiveness of mitigation in reducing water pollution and its marginal cost are φ i 1 and i m 1 3 and the marginal water pollution damage δ i 0 005 for i 1 2 similarly the marginal cost of investment in adaptation and its efficiency are 2 a 1 05 and γ 0 007 respectively moreover the natural decay rate of water pollution k 0 04 and the initial water pollution stock p 0 10 the planning horizon t 20 meanwhile the salvage value parameters λ i 0 6 q 200 and discount rate ρ 0 025 4 1 equilibrium strategies this subsection details the strategic response of each sector to the change in the level of water pollution in the feedback nash equilibrium considering the symmetric cases we ran various simulations by varying the calibrations of parameters and the simulation of the second scenario produced similar outcomes as the first scenario as shown in fig 2 consequently we only show the trajectories of the first scenario which indicates the strategic response of both sectors to water pollution and many other changing parameters the signs of the partial derivatives of the response functions with respect to the state variable p remain the same throughout the whole game and are independent of the changing calibrations of the different parameters so we summarize the following conjectures conjecture 1 fig 1 presents that for both scenarios the emission of each sector decreases with the increasing pollutant sock whereas the effort in investing in the mitigation of these sectors increases with increasing water pollution level formally e i p 0 m i p 0 f o r i 1 2 a n d i j due to the assumptions of the marginal damage function increasing in water pollution and the marginal utility function decreasing in emissions we formed conjecture 1 the increasing level of pollutants increases the marginal cost of damage meaning that both sectors will cut their emissions and invest in mitigation to reduce the damage caused by increasing water pollution another observation from the trajectories shown in fig 1 is that the emissions strategies of the two sectors responses to the increasing pollutant level appear to be more robust to variations in only certain parameters for instance by comparing the panels shown in fig 1 the strategic emission response to the variation in adaptation efficiency γ marginal cost of investment in adaptation 2 a and salvage value parameters λ i and q are more robust than the others the robustness of the mitigation strategy of each sector to each parameter is consistent with that of the emission strategy based on the above analysis and diagram we found how these strategic decisions are affected by parameter values taking the emission strategic response to pollutant level as an example and keeping other parameters the same both sectors cut more emissions accordingly when the marginal cost of invest in mitigation increases when the marginal damage cost of water pollution increases and when the natural decay decreases the findings were similar when using the same approach for the cases in which a sector intensifies its mitigation effort as a response to an increase in common pollutant level especially when the marginal damage cost of water pollution increases the effectiveness of mitigation of water pollution decreases and the natural decay decreases 4 2 equilibrium trajectories in this subsection we compare the equilibrium control and state trajectories and the damage cost functions obtained in both scenarios by simulating different values of those parameters to save space we only provide the representative results as shown in each figure two trajectories satisfying the benchmark here denotes where both players invest in mitigation and 0 denotes its counterpart when only the industry mitigates our conjectures are as follows conjecture 2 fig 2 a indicates that for all varying parameters the level of pollutants is lower when the agricultural sector also invests in mitigation i e p t p 0 t t 0 t from the comparison in conjectures 2 for any given initial level p 0 the pollutant level is lowest when both sectors undertake mitigation actions as mitigation allows the sectors to emit less per unit output by intensifying the mitigation effort conjecture 3 fig 2b and c show that for all varying parameters the strategic emission decision of both players is lower when the agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation i e e 1 t e 1 0 t t 0 t e 2 t e 2 0 t t 0 t the statement for conjecture 3 illustrates how the different mitigation strategies affect emission levels when both sectors participate in mitigation the estimate pollutant level will be lower consequently they tend to emit more to receive more productive utility conjecture 4 fig 2d illustrates that for all varying parameters the industrial sector invests more in mitigation when the agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation formally m 1 0 t m 1 t t 0 t conjecture 5 fig 2e illustrates that for all varying parameters instead of investing in mitigation the agricultural sector will invest more in adaptation when only the industrial sector mitigates for a different interpretation in the second scenario as the policy requires the agricultural sector to invest in mitigation investment in adaptation will decrease in the absence of additional subsidies that is a 2 0 t a 2 t t 0 t the comparison of conjecture 3 and 5 is due to the anticipation of increased pollutant level when the agricultural sector neglects mitigation in response the industrial sector invests more in mitigation the agricultural sector strengthens its adaptation effort to reduce the adverse effect of water pollution conjecture 6 fig 3 a and b illustrate that for all parameters the damage that both sectors suffer is higher when only one sector participates in mitigation formally we obtain d 1 0 t d 1 t t 0 t d 2 0 t d 2 t t 0 t to interpret this conjecture although the agricultural sector intensifies the investment in mitigation in the second scenario it is still unable to reverse the rising trend of pollutant levels thus resulting in an increase in the water pollution damage cost however the comparison of the solutions in fig 3 also illustrates that when the agricultural sector does not invest in mitigation but the other does the damage the both sectors receive will increase and compared with that of the agricultural sector the damage of the industrial sector will take the highest path in the whole duration of the game combining these comparative results with the previous conjectures we see that the agricultural sector only adapting without mitigating makes the industrial sector emit less and face higher damage cost over time compared to the scenario in which it mitigates thus in a feedback nash equilibrium without mitigation investment in the agricultural sector results in higher welfare losses in the industrial sector by reducing emissions and increasing its own damage cost we also focused on the effect of the length of time horizon on the pollutants level to use a of consistent horizon we only simulated the trajectories of the state variable fig 4 presents the different equilibrium trajectories of the water pollution levels due to the changing time horizon in the first scenario we obtain the following conjecture indicates the case in which the time horizon is longer conjecture 7 for all parameters the sectors tend to pollute more when the planning time horizon is extended i e p ˆ t p t fig 4 reveals that the pollutants level increases with the extending planning horizon the reason for this phenomenon is that both sectors have a tendency to solve the water pollution problem backward in the feedback equilibrium due to the extended planning time horizon the sectors pay a higher damage cost for the increasing accumulated pollutants they will also benefit from the increasing emissions for a longer planning time thus both of these sectors have more incentive to exchange economic benefits for the accumulated water pollution finally we studied how the salvage value parameters affect the state and control variables examining the differences in the equilibrium trajectories fig 5 depicts some phenomena as expected a lower salvage value of environmental quality leads to higher common accumulated pollutant levels and emissions a greater adaptation effort of the agriculture sector and a lower mitigation effort by the industrial sector a decrease in the salvage value of the upper threshold of pollutant stock from q 200 to q 175 has no effect on these equilibrium trajectories but it causes the value loss of both sectors which can be observed from fig 6 apparently this phenomenon shows that although the decrease of the upper limit of pollutants will lead to a decline in the overall revenue of each sector the motivation of behaving myopically causes the industrial and agricultural sectors only care about the current economic production benefits and ignore the impact of the limit value on their respective investment and production strategies resulting in the loss of environmental and ecological benefits in the duration of the entire game 5 discussion different sectors such as the agricultural sector the industrial sector and the service sector have different environmental policies that lead to different environmental behaviors the agricultural and industrial sectors are the main sectors in developing countries and also the main sources of water pollution when sectors consider mitigation and adaptation measures in their decision making processes the policies have various consequences on their strategies and the outcomes of the feedback nash equilibrium of the cross sectoral water pollution dynamic game we incorporated a mitigation policy as the sector s ability to invest in mitigation capital level which reduces the accumulated common pollutant levels we also incorporated an adaptation policy as the agricultural sector s ability to invest in private adaptation capital level which reduces the damage the sector receives from the accumulated common pollutant levels we conducted a numerical analysis of the equilibrium strategies and the trajectories of the sectors decisions we suggest that when dealing with water pollution the government and relevant departments should consider the following three elements first developing countries should introduce policies to strengthen the mitigation of agricultural water pollution on the one hand specific quantitative standards for the use of pesticides fertilizers and plastic films in crop production should be put forward on the other hand treatment of solid waste in poultry breeding and prevent groundwater pollution should be strengthened second water pollution control is a long term process and it is urgent to guide the agricultural sector to transform its focus of pollution control from short term adaptation to long term mitigation environmental protection and economic output should be put in the same important position third the treatment of water pollution requires multi sectoral cooperation and policy coordination in addition the two sectors should jointly tackle key problems in agricultural waste water treatment technology 6 conclusions first when agricultural and industrial sectors work together to mitigate emissions accumulated common pollutant levels are reduced this verifies the importance of cross sectoral joint water pollution control proposed in this paper when only the industrial sector mitigates the agricultural sector displays a free riding behavior the agricultural sector continues to pollute the soil groundwater and air not considering long term damage to the environment but only current and short term benefits the public community and government focus on mitigation in the industrial sector which places considerable pressure on the development of the industrial sector as a result the agricultural sector can benefit from mitigation investment in the industrial sector at no cost this is an inefficient policy regulation therefore we investigates what would occur if the government issues relevant policies and implements relatively strict environmental constraints for the agricultural sector and asks the agricultural sector to mitigate second when sectors consider mitigation measures in their objectives they tend to emit more over time because investing in mitigation capital reduces the emission per unit of output of both sectors which means more product with the same emissions to pursue higher utility both departments have the incentive to increase production which leads to increased emissions for investment strategies when the agriculture sector invests in mitigation the industrial sector reduces its mitigation investment simultaneously the agriculture sector reduces its investment in adaptation therefore from the perspective of the joint mitigation of agricultural and industrial sectors the mitigation action of the agricultural department reduces the pressure on the industrial sector as a result mitigation investment decreases in the industrial sector from the perspective of investment decision making within the agricultural sector the agricultural sector needs to invest in mitigation meaning that it uses the capital originally invested in adaptation as a result adaptation investment decreases in the agricultural sector third the damage that both sectors suffer is lower when both sectors participate in mitigation which demonstrates that policy constraints for agriculture mitigation contribute to long term environmental benefits our policy recommendation is that developing countries should address agricultural non point source water pollution considering both sectors development and the environmental carrying capacity we should not allow the agricultural sector to continue to use chemical fertilizers and pesticides without limit asymmetric sectoral mitigation policies can result in a loss of benefit to the other sector which needs to invest more in mitigation and results in higher water pollution damage costs for both sectors the limitation of this study is that it only demonstrates the necessity of joint water pollution control by agricultural and industrial sectors but it does not clarify to what extent the environmental regulation of agricultural sector should be at present some developed countries such as france have implemented strict environmental regulations on the agricultural sector leading to farmers dissatisfaction and difficulties in agricultural production and operation in order to ensure that environmental regulations of agricultural sectors in developing countries do not bring much negative impact on agricultural production and food supply the next step of the research is to establish the specific mechanism of cross sectoral joint water pollution control however different countries have different realities and some case studies are needed funding this research was funded by six talent

understanding and knowledge gaps we planned this study with the hypothesis that use of gypsum and or pressmud in combination with salt tolerant varieties may ameliorate the deleterious effects of irrigation water residual alkalinity on buildup of soil sodicity and improve performance of rice wheat system our objectives of carrying out this farmer s participatory study were i to quantify the

response to salt tolerant varieties and rsciw neutralization amendments however the response varied according to the variable rsciw induced soil sodicity conditions the test varieties in both crops had more or less similar response to applied amendments at both the locations therefore the data was pooled to explain the treatment effects 3 4 1 plant water relations and stress injury stress conditions induced by continued irrigation using high rsciw significantly p 0 05 influenced the leaf rwc and mii in rice table 2 between varieties the leaf rwc decreased from 89 to 81 for csr 30 basmati and 84 to 76 for pb 1121 with the increase in rsciw levels from 5 me l 1 site 1 to 7 me l 1 site 2 although the relative decline in leaf rwc of both varieties of wheat was almost similar in response to increasing rsciw but traditional wheat cv hd 2967 exhibited much lower leaf rwc compared to salt tolerant krl 210 at either level of rsciw increasing rsciw from 5 to 7 me l 1 induced sodicity stress caused 25 increase in mii in csr 30 basmati as compared to 30 in pb 1121 variety of rice while in wheat the corresponding hike in mii remained 16 in krl 210 and 29 in hd 2967 table 2 increasing rsciw induced sodicity stress averaged across test varieties decreased leaf rwc by 9 and 7 in rice and wheat grown in succession while the corresponding increase of 27 and 23 was observed in case of mii fig 3 rsciw neutralization ameliorants applied either individually gyp or pm or in combination gyp pm improved leaf rwc by 4 8 in rice and 8 12 in wheat this improvement in leaf rwc was associated with corresponding reduction in mii by 21 25 and 14 19 in rice and wheat respectively however the magnitude of change was relatively more with higher rsciw of 7 me l 1 fig 3 3 4 2 gas

with increasing rsciw from 5 me l 1 site 1 to 7 me l 1 site 2 caused significant reduction in na k ratio in shoot 59 and 53 and root 29 and 40 portion of rice and wheat table 2 between varieties averaged across rsciw levels lower na k ratio was observed in both shoot 0 75 and 0 22 and root 1 69 and 0 52 of salt tolerant csr 30 basmati rice and krl 210 wheat compared to the normal check varieties of respective crops neutralization of rsciw through amendments lowered na k ratio in shoot of rice and wheat by 42 52 and 34 40 respectively compared to irrigation using unamended rsciw fig

wheat respectively was recorded in unamended rsciw irrigation treatment whereas lowest na k ratio values for shoot 0 58 and 0 18 and root 1 31 and 0 39 in rice and wheat respectively were observed in gyp pm followed by pm and gyp when applied separately 3 5 biometric observations continuous irrigation using unamended rsciw though caused collateral reduction in yield attributing characters of both rice and wheat but the adverse impact was relatively lesser in salt tolerant varieties csr 30 basmati and krl 210 of the two crops compared to their respective counterparts pb 1121 and hd 2967 fig 4 in rice increasing rsciw induced soil sodification reduced effective tillers and 1000 grain weight by 15 and 19 for csr 30 basmati and 3 8 and 4 2 for pb 1121 respectively increasing rsciw increased tiller sterility by 6 7 in csr 30 basmati and 11 14 in pb 1121 corresponding increase in number of unfilled grains panicle 1 remained 9 14 for csr 30 basmati and 12 18 for pb 1121 the amendments applied either alone gyp or pm or in combination gyp pm significantly improved the effective tillers 19 26 grains panicle 1 14 22 earhead filling ratio 13 15 and 1000 grain weight 7 8 in rice compared to the treatment which received unamended rsciw table 3 the maximum tiller sterility 9 and unfilled grains panicle 1 14 were observed in rice where no amendment was applied for wheat increasing rsciw stress negatively affected the production of effective tillers causing 5 reduction in krl 210 and 11 in hd 2967 fig 4 the number of spikelets spike 1 decreased from 17 3 15 8 for krl 210 and 20 4 17 2 for hd 2967 indicating reduction of more than 10 in both the varieties marked reduction in grains earhead 1 6 9 and 1000 grain weight 6 8 was also observed with increasing rsciw neutralization treatments increased the number of effective tillers from 63 in gyp to 68 in gyp pm table 3 the number of spikelet spike 1 in plots irrigated with high rsc waters was 16 2 which further improved to 17

waters 3 6 grain yields year wise variation p 0 05 was observed in grain yield of both rice and wheat harvested over 4 years 2014 18 at both the locations table 4 highest grain yield 2 92 t ha 1 of rice was recorded during kharif 2016 while it remained lowest during kharif 2014 2 61 t ha 1 between locations increasing rsciw induced soil sodification reduced rice yield by 12 2017 to 18 2016 though non significant differences were observed for mean wheat yield in different years but the reduction remained 6 2014 15 to 22 2015 16 with increasing rsciw the yield data fig 5 for crops irrigated with unamended rsciw revealed that the grain yield of rice cv csr 30 basmati decreased from 2 73 t ha 1 rsciw 5 me l 1 to 2 39 t ha 1 rsciw 7 me l 1 indicating a loss of 13 with the increase in rsciw salt stress whereas pb 1121 recorded higher yield loss of 18 with the corresponding increase in rsciw in wheat salt tolerant cv krl 210 exhibited superiority at both the locations it realized 0 31 and 0 44 t ha 1 yield gain over the traditional cv hd 2967 at rsciw 5 and 7 me l 1 respectively overall the yield reduction of 11 0 44 t ha 1 in krl 210 and 16 0 57 t ha 1 in hd 2967 was recorded in response to increasing rsciw levels the highest yield 3 42 t ha 1 of rice was obtained with gyp pm ameliorated rsciw elucidating 3 and 7 yield superiority compared to alone application of gyp and pm respectively fig 6 in wheat gyp and pm amelioration of rsciw gave 16 and 21 yield gain respectively over the unamended rsc waters when both gypsum and pressmud were applied together gyp pm yield increment to the tune of 24 was observed in comparison to unamended control 3 46 t ha 1 rsciw neutralization amendments used either individually gyp or pm or in combination gyp pm resulted in 21 0 55 t ha 1 yield gain with csr 30 basmati and 20 0 58 t ha 1 with pb 1121 table 5 however the application of rsciw neutralization ameliorants increased wheat yield by 20 in both krl 210 and hd 2967 varietal differences indicated that at the same level of rsciw the stvs csr 30 basmati in rice and krl 210 in wheat responded better to neutralization ameliorants in comparison to traditional ones pb 1121 and hd 2967 table 5 relative yield gain due to rsciw neutralization treatments increased sharply from 0 28 t ha 1 2014 to 0 72 t ha 1 2017 for rice and 0 28 t ha 1 2014 15 to 0 80 t ha 1 2017 18 for wheat in comparison to umamended rsc waters fig 7 yield penalty in both the crops due to irrigation with unamended rsciw was relatively lower in the initial years and increased with each passing year 3 7 correlation and regression analysis strong positive correlation r 0 87 was observed between soil ph and esp developed in response to amendments applied for neutralizing the adverse effects of

irrigation water initial na saturation of soils presence of native caco3 crops grown in succession irrigation water quality and total demand rainfall received and the prevalent weather conditions etc decide the establishment of quasi stable equilibrium and magnitude of soil sodicity in rsc water irrigated areas minhas et al 2019 in the present study a positive r 2 0 63 p 0 001 relationship was observed between soil ph1 2 and esp fig 9 as a result of na saturation of soil colloids due to continued irrigation with high rsc waters soil ph1 2 and esp increased at both the sites in response to application of unamended rsciw fig 2 though the relative hike was more at site 2 the rise in rsciw induced soil sodification could be due to long history of irrigating rice wheat system with bicarbonate hco3 dominated groundwater and precipitation of soil native ca2 to calcite for maintaining equilibrium between release of bivalent cations both from the clay minerals and dissolution of caco3 sposito 2008 minhas et al 2019 between locations continuously using higher rsc 7 me l 1 and sar 10 mmol1 2 l 1 2 irrigation water at site 2 resulted in precipitation of larger amount of soluble ca and more caco3 concretion 3 14 compared to site 1 grain yield of rice and wheat harvested over the four successive 2014 18 years strongly p 0 05 reflected the influence of variable rsciw fig 5 year wise variations in crop yield between two sites was mainly due to differential soil and rsc water induced soil sodification table 1 and their associated cause effect relationships between soil fig 2 crop physiological table 2 and yield parameters table 3 though the crop irrigation water requirement remained almost similar at both the locations considering spatio temporal distribution of precipitation received table s1 overall yield reduction to the tune of 16 in rice and 14 in wheat observed with the increase in residual alkalinity from 5 me l 1 site 1 to 7 me l 1 site 2 fig 5 was mainly due to the presence of higher concentration of na and hco3 in soil solution higher contents of these ions result in dispersion of clay minerals poor aeration and permeability problems as reported earlier by choudhary et al 2011b and minhas et al 2019 consequently poor soil conditions adversely affected the plant adaptation reduced photosynthetic and photochemical efficiency stomatal and transpiration limitations increased stress injury and ionic concentration to stress environments yield attributing traits effective tillers 1000 grain weight table 2 and ultimately the crop yields zhu 2001 munns 2002 hajiboland et al 2014 4 2 effect of salt tolerant varieties understanding the mechanism of salt tolerance within a plant species is the key to sustainable crop production under sodic environments observations of the present study suggested that with increasing rsciw induced soil sodification salt tolerant csr 30 basmati rice and krl 210 wheat attainted relatively higher rwc photosynthetic efficiency stomatal conductance and maintenance of transpiration with lower stress injury and better control on accumulation of na ions compared to traditional varieties pb 1121 and hd 2967 table 2 under stress conditions the reactive oxygen species ros and salt accumulation in the chloroplasts of leaf cells affects the integrity of cellular membranes photosynthesis and metabolic enzyme activities gill and tuteja 2010 läuchli and grattan 2012 such structural and functional changes in the membrane proteins increase plasma membrane permeability and ion leakage leading to improper uptake of water and nutrients by growing plants better physiological adaptation of stvs under stress conditions could be ascribed to the accumulation of osmolytes maintenance of ultra structure of chloroplasts of the leaves and plants capability to exclude na ions and their affinity to accumulate k ions which helped in maintaining the water balance equilibrium and osmoticum higher rwc protected the cells from oxidative damage lower mii sustained gas exchange higher pn gs e and lower na k ratio in shoot and root with increasing rsciw induced salt stress rhodes et al 2002 perez lopez et al 2009 atiq ur rahman et al 2014 el hendawy et al 2017 mann et al 2019 in contrast higher accumulation of na in guard cells of stomata and subsequently higher na k ratio in traditional rice pb 1121 and wheat hd 2967 varieties table 2 resulted in disturbed stomatal conductance photosynthetic metabolism and consequently lower photochemical efficiency vysotskaya et al 2010 saqib et al 2013 lesser reduction in tillers sterility unfilled grains panicle 1 and 1000 grain weight in rice cv csr 30 basmati under continued irrigation of high rsciw fig 4 imparted lower 13 yield reduction as against 18 in pb 1121 fig 5 similarly in wheat better adaptation of krl 210 was associated with relatively lower reduction in effective tillers spikelets spike 1 and 1000 grain weight elucidating 11 yield reduction compared to 16 in hd 2967 figs 4 and 5 similar results on better association of agro physiological adaptation of stvs under stress environments with improved yield attributing traits and consequently higher crop yields have been reported by centritto et al 2009 and monneveux et al 2006 4 3 effect of rsciw neutralization amendments complementary effects of applying neutralization ameliorants at each rsciw level were visualized by significant reduction in soil ph1 2 and esp fig 2a and c across locations irrigation using ameliorated rsciw decreased soil ph1 2 and esp depth wise 0 15 15 30 and 30 60 cm by 1 02 0 74 and 0 34 units and 31 27 and 24 respectively compared to without amelioration unamended control our study suggests that external application of gypsum supplied ca2 ions in required amount to neutralize the soluble hco3 replaced exchangeable na from the clay complexes and consequently reduced the soil ph1 2 sundha et al 2018 in contrast the decomposition of added pressmud increased the ionic concentration and developed p co2 which mobilized native caco3 and consequently released ca2 robbins 1986 choudhary et al 2011a prapagar et al 2012 leading to reduction in soil alkalinity soil ph1 2 sodicity esp and improved soil properties the relative effects were more pronounced at site 2 in response to applied ameliorants either individually or in combination neutralizing larger amount of hco3 in irrigation water and subsequent dissolution of caco3 supply more soluble ca thereby reducing esp and soil alkalinity in comparison to site 1 significant p 0 05 changes in plant water relations stress injury gas exchange parameters and ionic concentration na k ratio were noticed in both rice and wheat in response to neutralization amendments applied either individually gyp or pm or in combination gyp pm these reflected the effectiveness of used amendments in improving the plant physiological capacity and alleviating the adverse effects of rsciw induced soil sodification neutralization amendments improved leaf rwc 6 and 10 pn 40 and 36 gs 46 and 52 e 72 and 46 fv fm 13 and 12 and yii 12 and 6 and reduced mii 23 and 17 and lower na k concentration in shoot 48 and 33 and root 45 and 37 portion in rice and wheat respectively fig 3 this could be due to desired ca2 availability in the soil solution replacing exchangeable na from the clay lattice and supplementation of calcium sulphur and potassium in response to added gypsum and or pressmud improvement in soil properties owing to better aeration healthier root activity nutrient absorption and sugar translocation improved the availability of water rwc reduced injury to membranes mii and imparted better photosynthetic efficiency and stomatal conductance under stress environments compared to the control where no ameliorants were used to neutralize the residual alkalinity in irrigation waters porra 2002 soni et al 2016 venkata rao et al 2014 improvement in plant physiological adaptation further helped in better control on the accumulation of na ions and maintained lower ionic concentration kumar et al 2019 in rice use of neutralization amendments compensated the adverse effect of rsciw witnessing significant reduction in tiller sterility 3 4 and unfilled grains panicle 1 13 16 table 3 the main cause of reduction in infertility in response to added ameliorants can be attributed to the improved availability of ca2 and stronger capacity to exclude na and affinity for k ions zhang et al 2014 under stress conditions further improvement in yield attributing parameters grains panicle 1 15 and grain test weight 7 may be ascribed to their beneficial effect on prolonged maturity duration 3 8 days and the grain filling period 2 4 days in wheat increased duration of spikelet differentiation and better source to sink ratio with ameliorated rsciw treatments led to production of more number of effective tillers mrl 1 18 grains earhead 1 26 spikelets spike 1 9 and healthy

elucidating 24 yield superiority over the unamended control table 5 the displacement of exchangeable na from the clay complexes by supply of ca2 through dissolution of applied gypsum and mobilization of soil ca from native caco3 through pressmud application improved soil conditions clay flocculation and structural stability better adaptation to stress conditions fig 3 and associated improvement in yield attributing parameters table 3 in turn led to an increased biomass accumulation and crop yields realization koo et al 1990 gharaibeh et al 2011 dotaniya et al 2016 5 conclusions continued irrigation with high rsc waters in rws resulted in build up of exchangeable na and increased soil sodification ph and esp application of gypsum or pressmud either individually or in combination helped in mobilizing native calcium reduced soluble salt load in rsc irrigated areas improved agro physiological adaptation and consequently higher crop yields the better agro physiological response of stvs further improved yield of rice and wheat by countering adverse effect of rsciw induced soil sodification effective neutralization of rsciw with combined use of gypsum and pressmud and growing salt tolerant varieties csr 30 basmati krl 210 in succession can mitigate adverse effects of rsciw induced soil sodicity and improved rice wheat productivity field application of pressmud a waste byproduct from sugar industries will not only help in its productive utilization but also reduce the total dependence on mineral gypsum for sodic soil reclamation and high rsciw neutralization the results of

complementary effects of farmyard manure fym and gypsum application under alkali water irrigated sodic soils have been suggested earlier by murtaza et al 2009 choudhary et al 2011a and yaduvanshi and sharma 2008 however checking soil sodicity and neutralizing rsc in irrigation water with combined use of organic and or chemical amendments and salt tolerant varieties has not been adequately addressed earlier further the reclamation potential of pm in soils undergoing sodification needs to be evaluated to supplement the decreasing availability of mined gypsum considering the existing understanding and knowledge gaps we planned this study with the hypothesis that use of gypsum and or pressmud in combination with salt tolerant varieties may ameliorate the deleterious effects of irrigation water residual alkalinity on buildup of soil sodicity and improve performance of rice wheat system our objectives of carrying out this farmer s participatory study were i to quantify the adverse effect of continuous irrigations of unamended high rsciw on salt buildup and crop yields ii assess ameliorating effect of gypsum and or pressmud in combination with salt tolerant varieties in mitigating rsciw induced soil sodification and iii improving agro physiological response of plant salt tolerance and sustaining the rice wheat productivity under sodic agro ecosytsems 2 materials and methods 2 1 field survey site selection and description a stratified diagnostic survey was conducted in may 2014 collecting 133 water samples from 12 villages in karnal and kaithal districts of haryana india fig 1 a irrigation water quality parameters indicated that 77 and 6 of tested samples had more than permissible residual alkalinity rsciw 2 5 me l 1 and salinity eciw 2 ds m 1 respectively only 10 water samples in kaithal and 28 in karnal district were of good quality eciw 2 ds m 1 rsciw 2 5 me l 1 overall the rsc problem was more pronounced in kaithal 89 as compared to

good quality irrigation water at both the experimental sites therefore need based irrigations were applied with available rsc alkali groundwater containing high concentrations of nahco3 the number of irrigations varied from 8 to 17 in rice and 2 3 in wheat crop in different years of experimentation depending on the spatio temporal distribution of rainfall occurrence in between two successive irrigations within a particular season a maximum of 17 irrigations were applied to rice in 2016 and the minimum of 8 during 2014 depending on the receipt of rainfall and crop requirement 2 4 sampling

conditions induced by continued irrigation using high rsciw significantly p 0 05 influenced the leaf rwc and mii in rice table 2 between varieties the leaf rwc decreased from 89 to 81 for csr 30 basmati and 84 to 76 for pb 1121 with the increase in rsciw levels from 5 me l 1 site 1 to 7 me l 1 site 2 although the relative decline in leaf rwc of both varieties of wheat was almost similar in response to increasing rsciw but traditional wheat cv hd 2967 exhibited much lower leaf rwc compared to salt tolerant krl 210 at either level of rsciw increasing rsciw from 5 to 7 me l 1 induced sodicity stress caused 25 increase in mii in csr 30 basmati as compared to 30 in pb 1121 variety of rice while in wheat the corresponding hike in mii remained 16 in krl 210 and 29 in hd 2967 table 2 increasing rsciw induced sodicity stress averaged across test varieties decreased leaf rwc by 9 and 7 in rice and wheat grown in succession while the corresponding increase of 27 and 23 was observed in case of mii fig 3 rsciw neutralization ameliorants applied either individually gyp or pm or in combination gyp pm improved leaf rwc by 4 8 in rice and 8 12 in wheat this improvement in leaf rwc was associated with corresponding reduction in mii by 21 25 and 14 19 in rice and wheat respectively however the magnitude of change was relatively more with higher rsciw of 7 me l 1 fig 3 3 4 2 gas

with increasing rsciw from 5 me l 1 site 1 to 7 me l 1 site 2 caused significant reduction in na k ratio in shoot 59 and 53 and root 29 and 40 portion of rice and wheat table 2 between varieties averaged across rsciw levels lower na k ratio was observed in both shoot 0 75 and 0 22 and root 1 69 and 0 52 of salt tolerant csr 30 basmati rice and krl 210 wheat compared to the normal check varieties of respective crops neutralization of rsciw through amendments lowered na k ratio in shoot of rice and wheat by 42 52 and 34 40 respectively compared to irrigation using unamended rsciw fig

wheat respectively was recorded in unamended rsciw irrigation treatment whereas lowest na k ratio values for shoot 0 58 and 0 18 and root 1 31 and 0 39 in rice and wheat respectively were observed in gyp pm followed by pm and gyp when applied separately 3 5 biometric observations continuous irrigation using unamended rsciw though caused collateral reduction in yield attributing characters of both rice and wheat but the adverse impact was relatively lesser in salt tolerant varieties csr 30 basmati and krl 210 of the two crops compared to their respective counterparts pb 1121 and hd 2967 fig 4 in rice increasing rsciw induced soil sodification reduced effective tillers and 1000 grain weight by 15 and 19 for csr 30 basmati and 3 8 and 4 2 for pb 1121 respectively increasing rsciw increased tiller sterility by 6 7 in csr 30 basmati and 11 14 in pb 1121 corresponding increase in number of unfilled grains panicle 1 remained 9 14 for csr 30 basmati and 12 18 for pb 1121 the amendments

to the treatment which received unamended rsciw table 3 the maximum tiller sterility 9 and unfilled grains panicle 1 14 were observed in rice where no amendment was applied for wheat increasing rsciw stress negatively affected the production of effective tillers causing 5 reduction in krl 210 and 11 in hd 2967 fig 4 the number of spikelets spike 1 decreased from 17 3 15 8 for krl 210 and 20 4 17 2 for hd 2967 indicating reduction of more than 10 in both the varieties marked reduction in grains earhead 1 6 9 and 1000 grain weight 6 8 was also observed with increasing rsciw neutralization treatments increased the number of effective tillers from 63 in gyp to 68 in gyp pm table 3 the number of spikelet spike 1 in plots irrigated with high rsc waters was 16 2 which further improved to 17

though non significant differences were observed for mean wheat yield in different years but the reduction remained 6 2014 15 to 22 2015 16 with increasing rsciw the yield data fig 5 for crops irrigated with unamended rsciw revealed that the grain yield of rice cv csr 30 basmati decreased from 2 73 t ha 1 rsciw 5 me l 1 to 2 39 t ha 1 rsciw 7 me l 1 indicating a loss of 13 with the increase in rsciw salt stress whereas pb 1121 recorded higher yield loss of 18 with the corresponding increase in rsciw in wheat salt tolerant cv krl 210 exhibited superiority at both the locations it realized 0 31 and 0 44 t ha 1 yield gain over the traditional cv hd 2967 at rsciw 5 and 7 me l 1 respectively overall the yield reduction of 11 0 44 t ha 1 in krl 210 and 16 0 57 t ha 1 in hd 2967 was recorded in response to increasing rsciw levels the highest yield 3 42 t ha 1 of rice was obtained with gyp pm ameliorated rsciw elucidating 3 and 7 yield superiority compared to alone application of gyp and pm respectively fig 6 in wheat gyp and pm amelioration of rsciw gave 16 and 21 yield gain respectively over the unamended rsc waters when both gypsum and pressmud were applied together gyp pm yield increment to the tune of 24 was observed in comparison to unamended control 3 46 t ha 1 rsciw neutralization amendments used either individually gyp or pm or in combination gyp pm resulted in 21 0 55 t ha 1 yield gain with csr 30 basmati and 20 0 58 t ha 1 with pb 1121 table 5 however the application of rsciw neutralization ameliorants increased wheat yield by 20 in both krl 210 and hd 2967 varietal differences indicated that at the same level of rsciw the stvs csr 30 basmati in rice and krl 210 in wheat responded better to neutralization ameliorants in comparison to traditional ones pb 1121 and hd 2967 table 5 relative yield gain due to rsciw neutralization treatments increased sharply from 0 28 t ha 1 2014 to 0 72 t ha 1 2017 for rice and 0 28 t ha 1 2014 15 to 0 80 t ha 1 2017 18

irrigation water initial na saturation of soils presence of native caco3 crops grown in succession irrigation water quality and total demand rainfall received and the prevalent weather conditions etc decide the establishment of quasi stable equilibrium and magnitude of soil sodicity in rsc water irrigated areas minhas et al 2019 in the present study a positive r 2 0 63 p 0 001 relationship was observed between soil ph1 2 and esp fig 9 as a result of na saturation of soil colloids due to continued irrigation with high rsc waters soil ph1 2 and esp increased at both the sites in response to application of unamended rsciw fig 2 though the relative hike was more at site 2 the rise in rsciw induced soil sodification could be due to long history of irrigating rice wheat system with bicarbonate hco3 dominated groundwater and precipitation of soil native ca2 to calcite for maintaining equilibrium between release of bivalent cations both from the clay minerals and dissolution of caco3 sposito 2008 minhas et al 2019 between locations continuously using higher rsc 7 me l 1 and sar 10 mmol1 2 l 1 2 irrigation water at site 2 resulted in precipitation of larger amount of soluble

wise variations in crop yield between two sites was mainly due to differential soil and rsc water induced soil sodification table 1 and their associated cause effect relationships between soil fig 2 crop physiological table 2 and yield parameters table 3 though the crop irrigation water requirement remained almost similar at both the locations considering spatio temporal distribution of precipitation received table s1 overall yield reduction to the tune of 16 in rice and 14 in wheat observed with the increase in residual alkalinity from 5 me l 1 site 1 to 7 me l 1 site 2 fig 5 was mainly due to the presence of higher concentration of na and hco3 in soil solution higher contents of these ions result in dispersion of clay minerals poor aeration and permeability problems as reported earlier by choudhary et al 2011b and minhas et al 2019 consequently poor soil conditions adversely affected the plant adaptation reduced photosynthetic and photochemical efficiency stomatal

zhu 2001 munns 2002 hajiboland et al 2014 4 2 effect of salt tolerant varieties understanding the mechanism of salt tolerance within a plant species is the key to sustainable crop production under sodic environments observations of the present study suggested that with increasing rsciw induced soil sodification salt tolerant csr 30 basmati rice and krl 210 wheat attainted relatively higher rwc photosynthetic efficiency stomatal conductance and maintenance of transpiration with lower stress injury and better control on accumulation of na ions compared to traditional varieties pb 1121 and hd 2967 table 2 under stress conditions the reactive oxygen species ros and salt accumulation in the chloroplasts of leaf cells affects the integrity of cellular membranes photosynthesis and metabolic enzyme activities gill and tuteja 2010 läuchli and grattan 2012 such structural and functional changes in the membrane proteins increase plasma membrane permeability and ion leakage leading to improper uptake of water and nutrients by growing plants better physiological adaptation of stvs under stress conditions could be ascribed to the accumulation of osmolytes maintenance of ultra structure of chloroplasts of the leaves and plants capability to exclude na ions and their affinity to accumulate k ions which helped in maintaining the water balance equilibrium and osmoticum higher

pb 1121 and wheat hd 2967 varieties table 2 resulted in disturbed stomatal conductance photosynthetic metabolism and consequently lower photochemical efficiency vysotskaya et al 2010 saqib et al 2013 lesser reduction in tillers sterility unfilled grains panicle 1 and 1000 grain weight in rice cv csr 30 basmati under continued irrigation of high rsciw fig 4 imparted lower 13 yield reduction as against 18 in pb 1121 fig 5 similarly in wheat better adaptation of krl 210 was associated with relatively lower reduction in effective tillers spikelets spike 1 and 1000 grain weight elucidating 11 yield reduction compared to 16 in hd 2967 figs 4 and 5 similar results on better association of agro physiological adaptation of stvs under stress environments with improved yield attributing traits and consequently higher crop yields have been reported by centritto et al 2009 and monneveux et al 2006 4 3 effect of rsciw neutralization amendments complementary effects of applying neutralization ameliorants at each rsciw level were visualized by significant reduction in soil ph1 2 and esp fig 2a and c across locations irrigation using ameliorated rsciw decreased soil ph1 2 and esp depth wise 0 15 15 30 and 30 60 cm by 1 02 0 74 and 0 34 units and 31 27 and 24 respectively compared to without amelioration unamended control our study suggests that external application of gypsum supplied ca2 ions in required amount to neutralize the soluble hco3 replaced exchangeable na from the clay complexes and consequently reduced the soil ph1 2 sundha et al 2018 in contrast the decomposition of added pressmud increased the ionic concentration and developed p co2 which mobilized native caco3 and consequently released ca2 robbins 1986 choudhary et al 2011a prapagar et al 2012 leading to reduction in soil alkalinity soil ph1 2 sodicity esp and improved soil properties the relative effects were more pronounced at site 2 in response to applied ameliorants either individually or in combination neutralizing larger amount of hco3 in irrigation water and subsequent dissolution of caco3 supply more soluble ca thereby reducing esp and soil alkalinity in comparison to site 1 significant p 0 05 changes in plant water relations stress injury gas exchange parameters and ionic concentration na k ratio were noticed in both rice and wheat in response to neutralization amendments applied either individually gyp or pm or in combination gyp pm these reflected the effectiveness of used amendments in improving the plant physiological capacity and alleviating the adverse effects of rsciw induced soil sodification neutralization amendments improved leaf rwc 6 and 10 pn 40 and 36 gs 46 and 52 e 72 and 46 fv fm 13 and 12 and yii 12 and 6 and reduced mii 23 and 17 and lower na k concentration in shoot 48 and 33 and root 45 and 37 portion in rice and wheat respectively fig 3 this could be due to desired ca2 availability in the soil solution replacing exchangeable na from the clay lattice and supplementation of calcium sulphur and potassium in response to added gypsum and or pressmud improvement in soil properties owing to better aeration healthier root activity nutrient absorption and sugar translocation improved the availability of water rwc reduced injury to membranes mii and imparted better photosynthetic efficiency and stomatal conductance under stress environments compared to the control where no ameliorants were used to neutralize the residual alkalinity in irrigation waters porra 2002 soni et al 2016 venkata rao et al 2014 improvement in plant physiological adaptation further helped in better control on the accumulation of na ions and maintained lower ionic concentration kumar et al 2019 in rice use of neutralization amendments compensated the adverse effect of rsciw witnessing significant reduction in tiller sterility 3 4 and unfilled grains panicle 1 13 16 table 3 the main cause of reduction in infertility in response to added ameliorants can be attributed to the improved availability of ca2 and stronger capacity to exclude na and affinity for k ions zhang et al 2014 under stress conditions further improvement in yield attributing parameters grains panicle 1 15 and grain test weight 7 may be ascribed to their beneficial effect on prolonged maturity duration 3 8 days and the grain filling period 2 4 days in wheat increased duration of spikelet differentiation and better source to sink ratio with ameliorated rsciw treatments led to production of more number of effective tillers mrl 1 18 grains earhead 1 26 spikelets spike 1 9 and healthy grain formation 7 higher grain weight table 3 in contrast to the treatment receiving unamended rsc waters maas and grieve 1990 positive association of physiological parameters rwc pn gs of crop growth with yield attributing traits fig 8 under stress conditions complemented in higher rice and wheat yields application of neutralization ameliorants significantly p 0 05 improved the crop yields compared to irrigation using unamended rsciw the positive effect of different amendments on yield of both crops followed the sequence of gyp pm pm gyp the quantum of response varied between 16 2 24 6 in rice and 15 9 24 1 in wheat in accordance with the variable rsciw levels table 5 and fig 6 highest rice 3 42 t ha 1 and wheat 4 30 t ha 1 yield was realized with combined application of gyp pm elucidating 24 yield superiority over the unamended control table 5 the displacement of exchangeable na from the clay complexes by supply of ca2 through dissolution of applied gypsum and mobilization of soil ca from native caco3 through pressmud application improved soil conditions clay flocculation and structural stability better adaptation to stress conditions fig 3 and associated improvement in yield attributing parameters table 3 in turn led to an increased biomass accumulation and crop yields realization koo et al 1990 gharaibeh et al 2011 dotaniya et al 2016 5 conclusions continued irrigation with high rsc waters in rws resulted in build up of exchangeable na and increased soil sodification ph and esp application of gypsum or pressmud either individually or in combination helped in mobilizing native calcium reduced soluble salt load in rsc irrigated areas improved agro physiological adaptation and consequently higher crop yields the better agro physiological response of stvs further improved yield of rice and wheat by countering adverse effect of rsciw induced soil sodification effective neutralization of rsciw with combined use of gypsum and pressmud and growing salt tolerant varieties csr 30 basmati krl 210 in succession can mitigate adverse effects of rsciw induced soil sodicity and improved rice wheat productivity field application of pressmud a waste byproduct from sugar industries will not only help in its productive utilization but also reduce the total dependence on mineral gypsum for sodic soil reclamation and high rsciw neutralization the results of this study can be extended to larger areas undergoing soil sodification owing to continued irrigation with high rsc waters targeting sustainability of the natural resources environment implications
