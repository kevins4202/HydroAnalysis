5890,understanding the climate change impacts on water and carbon cycles is of great importance for comprehensive watershed management although many studies have been conducted on the future climate change impacts on either water cycle or carbon cycle the potential impacts on water carbon coupling cycles are still poorly understood this study used an integrated hydro biochemical model swat daycent to quantitatively investigate the climate change impacts on water carbon coupling cycles with a case study of typical loess hilly gully watershed the jinghe river basin jrb on the loess plateau we used climate scenarios data derived under the three representative concentration pathways rcps2 6 4 5 and 8 5 by five downscaled global circulation models gcms and set two future periods of 2020 2049 near future nf and 2070 2099 far future ff it was projected that the annual precipitation would generally decrease slightly during the nf period but increase by 4 11 during the ff period while the maximum minimum air temperatures would increase significantly the average annual streamflow would decrease with up to 20 1 under rcp8 5 and evapotranspiration et would remain almost unchanged during the nf period however both of them would increase during the ff period the net primary production npp would be generally higher due to the co2 fertilization whereas the soil organic carbon would decrease across all scenarios due to the warmer climate the npp et was projected to be closely coupled across all scenarios and this coupling was mainly controlled by the inter annual variability iav of precipitation moreover the precipitation iav combined with npp et coupling could also jointly control the npp variability in the jrb these projections in water carbon coupling cycles can be useful to make better informed decisions for future water resources and ecosystem management of the loess hilly gully regions keywords climate change soc streamflow swat daycent water carbon coupling 1 introduction climate change which is primarily driven by anthropogenic greenhouse emissions has been emerged as one of the most important environmental issues of the 21st century holden et al 2018 lin et al 2018 duan et al 2019b as mentioned in intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report the globally averaged air temperature has increased by 0 85 c from 1880 to 2012 and will increase approximately by 1 5 c by the end of this century ipcc 2013 associated with global warming the precipitation has also changed significantly during the past several decades and its variability will increase in the future ipcc 2013 xing et al 2018 these changes will affect the terrestrial ecosystems especially the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles which are among the most sensitive terms towards climate change in a specific ecosystem for example the rising temperature and changing precipitation can alter the water and carbon cycles through shifting the evapotranspiration et and regulating plant physiological processes duan et al 2017 fu et al 2017b duan et al 2019a exerting positive or negative impacts on the ecosystems therefore an in depth understanding of the future climate change impacts on hydrological and biogeochemical cycles is hence of great significance for the ecosystem management and associated policy formulation luo et al 2019 which has also been an important concern in the field of global change studies a common approach for assessing future hydrological or biogeochemical conditions is to use general circulation model gcm projections in combination with hydrological or biogeochemical models through this approach growing evidences indicated that the future climate change would strongly affect the terrestrial water and carbon cycles at both regional and global scales meaurio et al 2017 luo et al 2018 sun et al 2019b for example xu et al 2009 found the streamflow in the headwater catchment of the yellow river basin would generally decrease in the future by combing four gcms and the swat soil and water assessment tool model neupane et al 2018 found the mean annual streamflow in the suwannee river watershed would decrease substantially under the representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 during the 2080s by combining budyko type formula and gcms outputs xing et al 2018 indicated that the future climate change would have negative influences on the runoff in china s major river basins in the mid 21st century using the atmospheric vegetation interaction model wu et al 2009 found the vegetation net primary production npp over china would decrease due to the significant increase in air temperature using the rothc model wiesmeier et al 2016 found the soil organic carbon soc over europe would suffer substantial decreases of 11 16 by the end of the century under an expected mean temperature increase of 3 3 c these studies assessed the impacts of climate change on either hydrological or biogeochemical cycles however the environmental issues we are facing are complicated and understanding from a single facet may skew the eco environmental management plans it is essential to investigate the climate change impacts on hydro biogeochemical cycles instead of one of them in fact the climate change particularly the increase in temperature and precipitation changes would simultaneously influence the hydro biogeochemical dynamics and their interactions at global and regional scales currently to our knowledge few studies have examined the impacts of climate change on water carbon coupling cycles because of distinct disciplinary focuses between hydrology and biogeochemistry and the lack of simulation tools coupling water and carbon dynamics to address this issue wu et al 2016 developed the swat daycent model to enable integrated hydro biogeochemical simulations by linking swat arnold et al 1998 and daycent daily step version of the century biogeochemical model parton et al 1998 del grosso et al 2006 although the coupling model has shown its ability in simulating water and carbon cycles simultaneously zhao et al 2018a zhao et al 2019 it has not yet been used to project the impacts of future climate change china s loess plateau is well known for the severe soil and water erosion and its eco environment is vulnerable and sensitive to the changing climate fu et al 2017a previous studies have shown that the air temperature has significantly increased and the precipitation was relatively stable during the past several decades representing a warmer and drier climate trend in the plateau zhang et al 2019 this tendency has yielded various spatiotemporal impacts on the regional water resources and carbon sequestration zhang et al 2016a feng et al 2017 the future climate in the plateau may also trigger uncertain change causing unintended impacts on both the water and carbon cycles peng and li 2018 and this has not been well documented therefore it is critical to investigate the climate change impacts on water carbon coupling cycles in this ecologically vulnerable region the overall goal of this study was to present a comprehensive analysis of water carbon coupling streamflow et npp and soc responses to projected climate change in the jinghe river basin jrb a large typical loess hilly gully watershed on the loess plateau to this end we combined the swat daycent model with projections from five downscaled gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noeresm1 m under three rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the objectives of this study include 1 investigating the changes of future precipitation and air temperature as projected from five downscaled gcms under three rcps 2 analyzing the changes in hydro biogeochemical cycles under projected climate and 3 evaluating impacts of future climate change on the water carbon coupling processes the outcomes of our study may provide scientific support for the comprehensive ecosystem management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jrb is a typical loess hilly gully watershed located in the southern part of the loess plateau fig 1 the watershed covers an area of 45 421 km2 and lies in the semi humid and semi arid transitional zone with a typical continental climate zhao et al 2018a the mean annual precipitation is about 514 mm and approximately 80 occurs in the flood season between july and september there are about six million people mainly inhabiting the middle and downstream regions the major land use types of the basin is dominated by three vegetation types grassland cropland and forest accounting for 90 of area because of the dry climate and severe soil and water loss the basin is often subject to severe water shortage li and jin 2017 sun et al 2019 to address these problems the chinese government has implemented large scale restoration projects e g the grain for green program to restore remedy degraded ecosystems primarily by returning sloping cropland to forest or grassland since the 1999 although many studies showed that the ecosystem conditions had improved a lot the eco environment problems are still major concerns especially in the context of climate change therefore it is significant to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on both water and carbon variabilities and their interactions in the basin 2 2 model input and setup to address the comprehensive evaluation of environmental changes including both water and carbon dynamics wu et al 2016 developed the swat daycent model by coupling the hydrological model swat arnold et al 1998 and biogeochemical model daycent parton et al 1998 in the coupling of swat daycent the swat model was set as the basic framework and daycent was embedded into swat with some new functions the functions are used to transform swat input variables into daycent required input files at the hru hydrologic response unit level and drive the daycent automatically the hrus are generated during the swat running process and each of them consists the unique soil and land cove types and can be used as a specific site in daycent daycent then obtains the specific variables of the hrus to simulate the carbon cycle across all hrus through a loop clearly the hydrological process was simulated by swat and the carbon cycle was depicted by the daycent model the major watershed scale outputs of swat daycent include hydrological components e g streamflow soil water et yielded by swat and biogeochemical components e g npp soc soil respiration biomass yielded by daycent enabling us to analyze both water and carbon dynamics and their interactions at the watershed scale the detailed running process of the coupled swat daycent was illustrated in fig s1 in supplementary file the required spatial inputs for swat include topography land use soil type and meteorological information the digital elevation model dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a 90 m resolution to delineate sub basins and define stream networks the land use and soil property data were obtained from the ecological and environmental science data center for west china with a 1 km by 1 km resolution the daily meteorological data were obtained from the data center of china meteorological administration cma covering the study period from 1976 to 2005 the arcswat version 2012 was used to delineate the watershed resulting in 105 sub basins and 2 558 hrus the monthly streamflow from 1973 to 1990 data of zhangjiashan station fig 1 and the remotely sensed npp from 2000 to 2010 were used to calibrate validate the swat daycent model the streamflow data were obtained from the hydrological yearbooks of the yellow river and the annual npp were collected from both modis modis17a3 and resources and environment science data center of the chinese academy of sciences resdc based on our previous study zhao et al 2018a the cropland npp produced by modis and grassland npp and forest npp produced by resdc were applied for the daycent verification 2 3 model calibration and validation there are some parameters in both swat and daycent that need to be determined for a specific basin through comparison with the observed data the swat daycent run at the daily time step this is determined by the model structure and we calibrated validated the model at monthly time scale in calibration validation of swat daycent we firstly calibrated the swat model using the observed monthly streamflow data and evaluated the model performance in terms of multiple criteria once the swat was verified we then calibrated validated the daycent using the regional remotely sensed npp by adjusting the key parameter in daycent till the daycent was also acceptable for the swat model the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm was adopted for the parameter optimization and six key parameters were identified based on the sensitivity analysis wu and liu 2014 zhao et al 2018b table 1 the 9 year 1973 1981 monthly streamflow was used to calibrate the model and the subsequent 9 year 1982 1990 records were used for validation for daycent based on our own experience and previous studies necpálová et al 2015 rafiqu et al 2015 wu et al 2015 qiu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the most sensitive parameter prdx was selected it is noted that only 11 year from 2000 to 2010 remotely sensed npp data were available due to the late launch time of the satellite and we used the model r coupler wu et al 2014 with npp data to derive the optimal parameter value in the operation of model r coupler we firstly provided the parameter that need to be optimized and then the model runs through a sleep run loop to get the best simulations through comparison with the observations the optimized values for forest crop and grass ecosystems are 8 8 0 4 and 0 2 g c m 2 month 1 langley 1 respectively the model performed well in the 9 year calibration period 1973 1981 with nse r2 and pb values of 0 74 0 80 and 8 68 respectively fig s2a in the 9 year validation period the model performance was satisfactory though the criteria with nse r2 and pb values of 0 56 0 70 and 14 35 were not as good as those in calibration fig s2b according to the commonly used evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2007 the model performance can be rated as good for calibration and satisfactory for validation indicating that the model was acceptable for representing the hydrological processes in the jrb for the daycent simulation the comparison showed that the simulated npp matched well with the remotely sensed ones fig s3 the statistical evaluation measures showed that the pb values were less than 5 r2 ranged from 0 23 to 0 69 and rmse varied from 21 09 to 34 78 g c m 2 yr 1 overall the bias is small and thus daycent can also be applicable in the jrb 2 4 future climate scenarios for future climate forcing data we used the downscaled daily data sets precipitation and maximum minimum temperature of five gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc and noeresm1 m by inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project isi mip under representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 low emission pathway rcp4 5 low to moderate emission pathway and rcp8 5 high emission pathway hempel et al 2013 ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 table 2 different from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 the data sets from isi mip were bias corrected and downscaled to 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution warszawski et al 2014 we used the projected climate data for two future periods near future nf 2020 2049 far future ff 2070 2099 while the cma climate datasets from 1976 to 2005 were used as the baseline period considering the representativeness of the study period the impacts of climate change on water carbon coupling cycles were investigated by comparing the difference between baseline conditions and future projections from the model outputs that are driven by five gcms because the atmospheric co2 concentration plays a significant role in the carbon cycle and its concentration is projected to increase in the future see fig s4 we activated the fertilization effects of co2 in model simulations during the hydro biogeochemical simulation for both history and future periods the land surface conditions were assumed invariant before conducting the future simulation we firstly evaluated the gcms data through comparison with the cma during the historical period 1976 2005 fig 2 although the gcms derived precipitation underestimated some peak values the ensemble kept consistent with the cma based observation with r2 being 0 64 fig 2a compared with the monthly precipitation both the maximum and minimum temperature derived from gcms were more closely consistent with cma observations as shown in fig 2b and c the r2 between ensemble gcms monthly temperature maximum and minimum and cma derived monthly temperature exceeded 0 95 0 96 and 0 98 for maximum and minimum respectively as shown in the scatter plots fig 2b and c the r2 between cma and gcms daily minimum maximum temperature were 0 81 and 0 90 respectively overall the downscaled climate data by isi mip can largely reflect the real climate conditions for the jrb therefore the five gcms outputs can be used to investigate the climate change impacts in this study 3 results 3 1 projected climate change the historical and projected ensemble annual precipitation minimum and maximum temperature changes during the nf and ff periods under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were shown in fig 3 during the nf period the annual precipitation was projected to nearly no change only an increase by 0 3 under rcp2 6 fig 3a but it would decrease by 2 0 and 2 2 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively the precipitation was projected to increase during the ff period under all rcps with an increase from 4 7 rcp2 6 to 10 7 rcp8 5 the future gcm ensemble annual mean minimum and maximum temperature were projected to be rising across all scenarios compared to the baseline period fig 3 especially the largest increases in minimum and maximum temperature were 4 71 c and 5 26 c respectively under rcp8 5 during the ff period overall the climate in the jrb showed a warmer and drier trend during the nf period and a warmer and wetter trend during the ff period the differences in monthly mean climate between future periods nf and ff and baseline period 1976 2005 were shown in fig 4 the precipitation would generally decrease in january and from july to august but it would increase in other months across all scenarios and periods fig 4a the largest increase in precipitation was projected in december under rcp8 5 during the ff period with a relative change of 58 9 and the largest decrease was projected in january under rcp8 5 during the nf period with a decrease of 31 6 the largest increases in temperature average minimum maximum temperature were projected in august the summer season and relatively small increases were during the winter season especially the average and minimum temperature increased substantially in all months across all scenarios overall during the two future periods a drier climate might occur during the flood season the summer season whereas a wetter climate would be expected for the winter and spring 3 2 impacts on water cycle fig 5 showed the monthly and annual differences in average streamflow and et between the two future periods nf and ff and the baseline conditions under all rcps during the nf period the monthly mean streamflow generally decreased relative to the baseline except april june and november in contrast during the ff period the streamflow tended to increase in almost all months and rcps except february july and august in which the streamflow decreased substantially for all rcps the largest increase in streamflow was projected in june under rcp8 5 during the ff period with an increasing rate of 71 4 the largest decrease was projected in august under rcp4 5 during the nf period with a decreasing rate of 44 1 fig 5a overall the ensemble average annual streamflow was projected to decrease by 8 1 under rcp2 6 to 20 1 under rcp8 5 during the nf period however it would remain nearly unchanged for rcp4 5 and increase by 3 7 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 during the ff period respectively fig 5c fig 5b and d showed the changes of monthly and annual mean et under all scenarios generally the et during the ff period showed a relatively large increase compared to those during the nf period which was similar to the changing patterns of precipitation the et generally decreased from july through to september but increased during other months under all rcps and periods the largest increase 64 2 in et was projected in january under rcp8 5 during the ff period due to higher temperature and precipitation fig 5b the largest decrease of et was projected in august under rcp2 6 during the nf period with a decreasing rate of 15 7 in summary the ensemble average annual et would remain almost unchanged during the nf period with a rate changing form 0 8 to 0 8 and increase by 4 9 11 0 during the ff period fig 5d 3 3 impacts on carbon cycles the npp and soc in the jrb were simulated by swat daycent under three rcps during the future period nf and ff without and with future co2 effects fig 6 respectively under rcp2 6 the npp was projected to increase during the future period and the increasing magnitude would be larger when considering the co2 enrichment under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the npp was projected to be lower than that in the baseline without considering co2 enrichment nevertheless the density distribution shifted to the positive when considering the co2 enrichment during the future period under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 6a the largest decrease of annual npp was projected under rcp8 5 during the ff period with a decreasing rate of 15 55 and the largest increase of npp was projected under rcp2 6 during the ff period with an increasing magnitude of 2 57 without considering co2 effects as shown in table 3 however considering the co2 increase in the rcp scenarios the annual average npp was only projected to decrease slightly under rcp8 5 during the ff period table 3 as shown in fig 6 the soc across all scenarios tended to decrease during the future period across all scenarios under the three rcps the soc would generally deplete during the ff period compared to that in the nf period however taking into account the future co2 enrichment the density distribution slightly shifted to the positive during the future period under all rcps fig 6b as shown in table 3 although the future co2 enrichment could help slightly alleviate the soc depletion the annual average soc was still projected to decrease under the all rcps during the whole future period in particular the largest decrease of soc was projected under rcp8 5 during the ff period with a depletion rate of 6 29 and 6 00 without and with enriched co2 effects respectively table 3 3 4 impacts on the water carbon coupling the water carbon coupling represented by the correlation between npp and et and the controlling factors were shown in fig 7 the npp and et were generally tightly coupled across all scenarios with correlation coefficients being larger than 0 5 fig 7a the highest correlation coefficient was found in the historical period and it tended to be lower during the future period under all rcps for example the correlation coefficients under rcp8 5 were generally lower than those under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 the correlation coefficients during the ff periods were generally lower than those during the nf period we further attributed the variation of the npp et coupling to climatic factors fig 7b and c as shown in fig 7b the anomaly of precipitation inter annual variability significantly correlated with the npp et relationship indicating that the precipitation variability largely controlled the npp et coupling in the jrb however there was no obvious relationship between temperature variability and npp et coupling fig 7c in addition when plotting the correlation coefficient between npp and et against npp variability the degree of npp et coupling would become higher with the npp variability fig 7d indicating that the changes in npp in these high variability climate scenarios regions was closely linked with the changes in et 4 discussion 4 1 future hydrologic changes under climate change quantifying the impacts of climate change on hydrologic processes is critical for water resources management especially in the water deficient regions the jrb is located in the semi humid and semi arid transitional zone and the water shortage is a significant concern in the basin li and jin 2017 zhao et al 2018a our study found that the climate in the jrb would become warmer and drier between 2020 and 2049 in terms of the changes of precipitation and air temperature especially under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios our results keep consistent with li and jin 2017 who found that the precipitation in the jrb would decrease by 1 7 and 3 4 and the temperature were anticipated to increase significantly from 2011 to 2040 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in comparison with their baseline period 1961 2005 we found that the annual streamflow was projected to decrease by 8 1 20 1 and the et remain nearly unchanged 1 during the nf period respectively this decreasing magnitude in streamflow was a little higher than that from yang et al 2018 who reported a decrease of about 10 across the yellow river basin from 2021 to 2050 this may imply that the jrb would be under a more severe water stress during the mid century period in the end of this century that is the ff period in our study both the precipitation and temperature were expected to increase indicating a wetter and warmer climate driven by the increased precipitation the mean annual streamflow and et were projected to increase during the ff period which was also confirmed by others zhang et al 2016c zhang et al 2017 more importantly the monthly dynamics indicated a significant lower streamflow during the summer season due to the less summer precipitation and higher summer temperature which may further elevate the water stress in summer in the jrb therefore an efficient water use saving measure would be needed in the future 4 2 co2 and climate warming effects on carbon sequestration the npp and soc are two important indicators in reflecting the plant community characteristics and potential production of an ecosystem our study found that the combination of elevated co2 and climate change could help improve the vegetation production and alleviate the soc depletion in the jrb without considering the future co2 enrichment the projected npp would be lower than the baseline across almost all scenarios which can be attributable to the higher temperature warmer climate in the future the reason can be found in our previous study zhao et al 2019 where the temperature played a negative role in vegetation production in such water limited basin in fact the npp simulation in daycent is a function of nutrient availability soil water and temperature vegetation type and plant phenology del grosso et al 2009 a drier climate may influence the nutrient availability through accelerating the volatilization e g ammonia nitrogen volatilization and soil dry layer that is the soil water availability additionally in daycent the npp was divided among leafy woody and root compartments on the basis of plant type and phenology higher temperature may negatively affect the stomatal conductance and thus directly reduce the npp allocation in plant leaves therefore the increased temperature combined with relatively stable precipitation would lead to lower npp wu et al 2009 a higher npp is possible when considering co2 fertilization effects kergoat 2002 because elevated co2 can stimulate plant growth and productivity directly by enhancing mesophyll co2 diffusion and photosynthesis sun et al 2014 song et al 2019 the findings were also supported by the globe scale experimental results for example norby et al 2005 found that the forest npp could be stimulated medially by 23 under elevated co2 evans et al 2014 reported that the net ecosystem productivity would be significantly enhanced because of the co2 enrichment in the arid ecosystem even under a heat and drought extreme the elevated co2 could maintain the net carbon uptake of the grassland ecosystems roy et al 2016 although the elevated co2 could help slightly alleviate the soc reductions through the fertilization effects the soc in the jrb was projected to decrease across all scenarios the little difference between scenarios with and without co2 fertilization can be attributed to the short simulated periods in our study actually the elevated co2 could largely stimulate the soil carbon accumulation in kinds of ecosystems which was confirmed by previous experimental and modeling results farrior et al 2015 tfaily et al 2018 the significant reduction in soc can be attributed to the warmer climate in the future mahecha et al 2010 arora et al 2013 crowther et al 2016 warming induced increases in air and soil temperature might activate the microbial growth and thus accelerate the soc decomposition rate lu et al 2013 moreover in daycent the maximum soc decomposition rate was largely determined by an abiotic soil decomposition factor that is controlled by soil temperature and soil moisture parton et al 1998 the soil temperature function increases exponentially with increasing air temperature that is the effects of soil temperature on soc decomposition would increase with the air temperature increasing while the soil moisture function increases as the ratio of stored water plus current rainfall to potential evapotranspiration pet increases higher temperature could thus result in soc reduction through increasing the soil temperature and altering the soil moisture and pet some quantitative studies also showed that an expected increase in surface temperature of 3 3 c would cause a net soc loss of 11 16 over europe and the warming from 2000 to 2014 would result in 14 loss of soc from the global terrestrial ecosystem cox et al 2000 wiesmeier et al 2016 however the negative effects of warming on soc were contingent on the level of the initial soil carbon stock in the jrb for example the soc would have a smaller decrease or even an increasing trend in areas with low initial soc stocks while the soc tended to decrease largely in areas with high initial soc stocks fig 8 the phenomenon was also confirmed by the site scale and globe scale studies for example wu et al 2015 reported that the further the soc content is from the soc equilibrium value the higher the carbon sink source potential and the quicker the carbon change rate through analyzing the globe scale experimental results crowther et al 2016 found that the negative effects of warming on global soc stock can be negligible in areas with small initial soc levels but losses occurred beyond a threshold of 2 5 kg c m2 and were considerable in soils with 7 kg c m2 in this sense areas with a higher or lower soc content may demonstrate a potential carbon source or sink respectively under the warming climate in the future therefore the watershed managers should pay much attention to areas with a relatively higher level of soc and formulate appropriate management practices for enhancing the carbon sequestration towards a warming world 4 3 precipitation regulation on the water carbon coupling many studies have shown the carbon and water are highly coupled and the precipitation plays an important role in regulating the coupling strength xiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016b for example zhang et al 2016b found that the precipitation variability significantly controlled the coupling between gross primary production and et especially in the semi arid and semi humid regions our study further documented a high npp et coupling and significant role of precipitation variability in regulating this coupling strength in the jrb the water and carbon cycles are coupled mainly due to the stomatal control on both water and carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere through photosynthesis and transpiration niu et al 2011 the relatively weak coupling relationship in the ff period could be attributed to the low nutrient availability for plant growth because of nutrient depletion caused by relatively higher streamflow taking into account the climatic variation in each scenario we revealed that the precipitation variability played a major role in regulating the npp et coupling strength this phenomenon further demonstrated that the precipitation change was still the dominant factor in vegetation growth as well as the energy balance regardless of temperature change in such a semi arid region the significant correlation between npp et coupling and npp variability implied that the iav of npp was closely linked with the npp et coupling in this area in this sense the variability in precipitation and npp et coupling could jointly control the npp variability in such a semi arid region which was also predicted by zhang et al 2016b furthermore the increasing trend of regression slope between npp and et increased with the drought index and this further demonstrated the significant role of precipitation in regulating the water carbon coupling in the jrb fig s5 this phenomenon was also consistent with the fact that water use efficiency would increase with the precipitation gradients especially in the semi arid regions sun et al 2016 4 4 uncertainties and limitations uncertainties involved in simulating future hydro biogeochemical cycles can be primarily attributed to the gcms and the hydro geochemical model many studies reported that over reliance on a single gcm could lead to inappropriate climate predictions and thus inappropriate projections in simulation terms li and jin 2017 yang et al 2019 towards addressing this uncertainty the study adopted the arithmetic ensemble averages from the hydro biogeochemical model outputs that are driven by the five gcms although the ensemble average precipitation and temperature from gcms showed good consistence with the cma based observations and the results were close to previous studies it is indeed difficult to predict climate change accurately in the future because the sophisticated climate system knutti and sedláček 2012 zhang et al 2016c in addition future land use change and potential anthropogenic activities were not taken into account in this study 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the effects of future climate change on water carbon coupling cycles in the jrb by combining the commonly used gcms and the newly developed swat daycent model the climate projections showed that the precipitation would change slightly during the nf period and increase by 5 11 during the ff period while the temperature was projected to appreciably increase across all scenarios indicating a warmer and drier in the nf period but a warmer and wetter climate in the ff period under the projected climate change streamflow would decrease by 8 1 20 1 during the nf period and increase by 0 1 3 7 during the ff period while the et could remain almost unchanged during the nf period but would increase by 4 9 11 0 during the ff period the npp was projected to increase with considering the co2 enrichment and the soc was projected to decrease across all scenarios though the change of soc may be positive or negative depending on the initial soc stock spatially the carbon water was projected to be closely coupled across all scenarios in terms of the npp et correlation but this coupling strength was controlled by the precipitation variability moreover the npp variability can be co controlled by the precipitation variability and npp et coupling in the jrb our study predicted the spatiotemporal carbon water dynamics under the future climate and this can be informative and valuable for the watershed managers in

5890,understanding the climate change impacts on water and carbon cycles is of great importance for comprehensive watershed management although many studies have been conducted on the future climate change impacts on either water cycle or carbon cycle the potential impacts on water carbon coupling cycles are still poorly understood this study used an integrated hydro biochemical model swat daycent to quantitatively investigate the climate change impacts on water carbon coupling cycles with a case study of typical loess hilly gully watershed the jinghe river basin jrb on the loess plateau we used climate scenarios data derived under the three representative concentration pathways rcps2 6 4 5 and 8 5 by five downscaled global circulation models gcms and set two future periods of 2020 2049 near future nf and 2070 2099 far future ff it was projected that the annual precipitation would generally decrease slightly during the nf period but increase by 4 11 during the ff period while the maximum minimum air temperatures would increase significantly the average annual streamflow would decrease with up to 20 1 under rcp8 5 and evapotranspiration et would remain almost unchanged during the nf period however both of them would increase during the ff period the net primary production npp would be generally higher due to the co2 fertilization whereas the soil organic carbon would decrease across all scenarios due to the warmer climate the npp et was projected to be closely coupled across all scenarios and this coupling was mainly controlled by the inter annual variability iav of precipitation moreover the precipitation iav combined with npp et coupling could also jointly control the npp variability in the jrb these projections in water carbon coupling cycles can be useful to make better informed decisions for future water resources and ecosystem management of the loess hilly gully regions keywords climate change soc streamflow swat daycent water carbon coupling 1 introduction climate change which is primarily driven by anthropogenic greenhouse emissions has been emerged as one of the most important environmental issues of the 21st century holden et al 2018 lin et al 2018 duan et al 2019b as mentioned in intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report the globally averaged air temperature has increased by 0 85 c from 1880 to 2012 and will increase approximately by 1 5 c by the end of this century ipcc 2013 associated with global warming the precipitation has also changed significantly during the past several decades and its variability will increase in the future ipcc 2013 xing et al 2018 these changes will affect the terrestrial ecosystems especially the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles which are among the most sensitive terms towards climate change in a specific ecosystem for example the rising temperature and changing precipitation can alter the water and carbon cycles through shifting the evapotranspiration et and regulating plant physiological processes duan et al 2017 fu et al 2017b duan et al 2019a exerting positive or negative impacts on the ecosystems therefore an in depth understanding of the future climate change impacts on hydrological and biogeochemical cycles is hence of great significance for the ecosystem management and associated policy formulation luo et al 2019 which has also been an important concern in the field of global change studies a common approach for assessing future hydrological or biogeochemical conditions is to use general circulation model gcm projections in combination with hydrological or biogeochemical models through this approach growing evidences indicated that the future climate change would strongly affect the terrestrial water and carbon cycles at both regional and global scales meaurio et al 2017 luo et al 2018 sun et al 2019b for example xu et al 2009 found the streamflow in the headwater catchment of the yellow river basin would generally decrease in the future by combing four gcms and the swat soil and water assessment tool model neupane et al 2018 found the mean annual streamflow in the suwannee river watershed would decrease substantially under the representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 during the 2080s by combining budyko type formula and gcms outputs xing et al 2018 indicated that the future climate change would have negative influences on the runoff in china s major river basins in the mid 21st century using the atmospheric vegetation interaction model wu et al 2009 found the vegetation net primary production npp over china would decrease due to the significant increase in air temperature using the rothc model wiesmeier et al 2016 found the soil organic carbon soc over europe would suffer substantial decreases of 11 16 by the end of the century under an expected mean temperature increase of 3 3 c these studies assessed the impacts of climate change on either hydrological or biogeochemical cycles however the environmental issues we are facing are complicated and understanding from a single facet may skew the eco environmental management plans it is essential to investigate the climate change impacts on hydro biogeochemical cycles instead of one of them in fact the climate change particularly the increase in temperature and precipitation changes would simultaneously influence the hydro biogeochemical dynamics and their interactions at global and regional scales currently to our knowledge few studies have examined the impacts of climate change on water carbon coupling cycles because of distinct disciplinary focuses between hydrology and biogeochemistry and the lack of simulation tools coupling water and carbon dynamics to address this issue wu et al 2016 developed the swat daycent model to enable integrated hydro biogeochemical simulations by linking swat arnold et al 1998 and daycent daily step version of the century biogeochemical model parton et al 1998 del grosso et al 2006 although the coupling model has shown its ability in simulating water and carbon cycles simultaneously zhao et al 2018a zhao et al 2019 it has not yet been used to project the impacts of future climate change china s loess plateau is well known for the severe soil and water erosion and its eco environment is vulnerable and sensitive to the changing climate fu et al 2017a previous studies have shown that the air temperature has significantly increased and the precipitation was relatively stable during the past several decades representing a warmer and drier climate trend in the plateau zhang et al 2019 this tendency has yielded various spatiotemporal impacts on the regional water resources and carbon sequestration zhang et al 2016a feng et al 2017 the future climate in the plateau may also trigger uncertain change causing unintended impacts on both the water and carbon cycles peng and li 2018 and this has not been well documented therefore it is critical to investigate the climate change impacts on water carbon coupling cycles in this ecologically vulnerable region the overall goal of this study was to present a comprehensive analysis of water carbon coupling streamflow et npp and soc responses to projected climate change in the jinghe river basin jrb a large typical loess hilly gully watershed on the loess plateau to this end we combined the swat daycent model with projections from five downscaled gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noeresm1 m under three rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the objectives of this study include 1 investigating the changes of future precipitation and air temperature as projected from five downscaled gcms under three rcps 2 analyzing the changes in hydro biogeochemical cycles under projected climate and 3 evaluating impacts of future climate change on the water carbon coupling processes the outcomes of our study may provide scientific support for the comprehensive ecosystem management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jrb is a typical loess hilly gully watershed located in the southern part of the loess plateau fig 1 the watershed covers an area of 45 421 km2 and lies in the semi humid and semi arid transitional zone with a typical continental climate zhao et al 2018a the mean annual precipitation is about 514 mm and approximately 80 occurs in the flood season between july and september there are about six million people mainly inhabiting the middle and downstream regions the major land use types of the basin is dominated by three vegetation types grassland cropland and forest accounting for 90 of area because of the dry climate and severe soil and water loss the basin is often subject to severe water shortage li and jin 2017 sun et al 2019 to address these problems the chinese government has implemented large scale restoration projects e g the grain for green program to restore remedy degraded ecosystems primarily by returning sloping cropland to forest or grassland since the 1999 although many studies showed that the ecosystem conditions had improved a lot the eco environment problems are still major concerns especially in the context of climate change therefore it is significant to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on both water and carbon variabilities and their interactions in the basin 2 2 model input and setup to address the comprehensive evaluation of environmental changes including both water and carbon dynamics wu et al 2016 developed the swat daycent model by coupling the hydrological model swat arnold et al 1998 and biogeochemical model daycent parton et al 1998 in the coupling of swat daycent the swat model was set as the basic framework and daycent was embedded into swat with some new functions the functions are used to transform swat input variables into daycent required input files at the hru hydrologic response unit level and drive the daycent automatically the hrus are generated during the swat running process and each of them consists the unique soil and land cove types and can be used as a specific site in daycent daycent then obtains the specific variables of the hrus to simulate the carbon cycle across all hrus through a loop clearly the hydrological process was simulated by swat and the carbon cycle was depicted by the daycent model the major watershed scale outputs of swat daycent include hydrological components e g streamflow soil water et yielded by swat and biogeochemical components e g npp soc soil respiration biomass yielded by daycent enabling us to analyze both water and carbon dynamics and their interactions at the watershed scale the detailed running process of the coupled swat daycent was illustrated in fig s1 in supplementary file the required spatial inputs for swat include topography land use soil type and meteorological information the digital elevation model dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a 90 m resolution to delineate sub basins and define stream networks the land use and soil property data were obtained from the ecological and environmental science data center for west china with a 1 km by 1 km resolution the daily meteorological data were obtained from the data center of china meteorological administration cma covering the study period from 1976 to 2005 the arcswat version 2012 was used to delineate the watershed resulting in 105 sub basins and 2 558 hrus the monthly streamflow from 1973 to 1990 data of zhangjiashan station fig 1 and the remotely sensed npp from 2000 to 2010 were used to calibrate validate the swat daycent model the streamflow data were obtained from the hydrological yearbooks of the yellow river and the annual npp were collected from both modis modis17a3 and resources and environment science data center of the chinese academy of sciences resdc based on our previous study zhao et al 2018a the cropland npp produced by modis and grassland npp and forest npp produced by resdc were applied for the daycent verification 2 3 model calibration and validation there are some parameters in both swat and daycent that need to be determined for a specific basin through comparison with the observed data the swat daycent run at the daily time step this is determined by the model structure and we calibrated validated the model at monthly time scale in calibration validation of swat daycent we firstly calibrated the swat model using the observed monthly streamflow data and evaluated the model performance in terms of multiple criteria once the swat was verified we then calibrated validated the daycent using the regional remotely sensed npp by adjusting the key parameter in daycent till the daycent was also acceptable for the swat model the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm was adopted for the parameter optimization and six key parameters were identified based on the sensitivity analysis wu and liu 2014 zhao et al 2018b table 1 the 9 year 1973 1981 monthly streamflow was used to calibrate the model and the subsequent 9 year 1982 1990 records were used for validation for daycent based on our own experience and previous studies necpálová et al 2015 rafiqu et al 2015 wu et al 2015 qiu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the most sensitive parameter prdx was selected it is noted that only 11 year from 2000 to 2010 remotely sensed npp data were available due to the late launch time of the satellite and we used the model r coupler wu et al 2014 with npp data to derive the optimal parameter value in the operation of model r coupler we firstly provided the parameter that need to be optimized and then the model runs through a sleep run loop to get the best simulations through comparison with the observations the optimized values for forest crop and grass ecosystems are 8 8 0 4 and 0 2 g c m 2 month 1 langley 1 respectively the model performed well in the 9 year calibration period 1973 1981 with nse r2 and pb values of 0 74 0 80 and 8 68 respectively fig s2a in the 9 year validation period the model performance was satisfactory though the criteria with nse r2 and pb values of 0 56 0 70 and 14 35 were not as good as those in calibration fig s2b according to the commonly used evaluation criteria moriasi et al 2007 the model performance can be rated as good for calibration and satisfactory for validation indicating that the model was acceptable for representing the hydrological processes in the jrb for the daycent simulation the comparison showed that the simulated npp matched well with the remotely sensed ones fig s3 the statistical evaluation measures showed that the pb values were less than 5 r2 ranged from 0 23 to 0 69 and rmse varied from 21 09 to 34 78 g c m 2 yr 1 overall the bias is small and thus daycent can also be applicable in the jrb 2 4 future climate scenarios for future climate forcing data we used the downscaled daily data sets precipitation and maximum minimum temperature of five gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc and noeresm1 m by inter sectoral impact model inter comparison project isi mip under representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 low emission pathway rcp4 5 low to moderate emission pathway and rcp8 5 high emission pathway hempel et al 2013 ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 table 2 different from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 the data sets from isi mip were bias corrected and downscaled to 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution warszawski et al 2014 we used the projected climate data for two future periods near future nf 2020 2049 far future ff 2070 2099 while the cma climate datasets from 1976 to 2005 were used as the baseline period considering the representativeness of the study period the impacts of climate change on water carbon coupling cycles were investigated by comparing the difference between baseline conditions and future projections from the model outputs that are driven by five gcms because the atmospheric co2 concentration plays a significant role in the carbon cycle and its concentration is projected to increase in the future see fig s4 we activated the fertilization effects of co2 in model simulations during the hydro biogeochemical simulation for both history and future periods the land surface conditions were assumed invariant before conducting the future simulation we firstly evaluated the gcms data through comparison with the cma during the historical period 1976 2005 fig 2 although the gcms derived precipitation underestimated some peak values the ensemble kept consistent with the cma based observation with r2 being 0 64 fig 2a compared with the monthly precipitation both the maximum and minimum temperature derived from gcms were more closely consistent with cma observations as shown in fig 2b and c the r2 between ensemble gcms monthly temperature maximum and minimum and cma derived monthly temperature exceeded 0 95 0 96 and 0 98 for maximum and minimum respectively as shown in the scatter plots fig 2b and c the r2 between cma and gcms daily minimum maximum temperature were 0 81 and 0 90 respectively overall the downscaled climate data by isi mip can largely reflect the real climate conditions for the jrb therefore the five gcms outputs can be used to investigate the climate change impacts in this study 3 results 3 1 projected climate change the historical and projected ensemble annual precipitation minimum and maximum temperature changes during the nf and ff periods under rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were shown in fig 3 during the nf period the annual precipitation was projected to nearly no change only an increase by 0 3 under rcp2 6 fig 3a but it would decrease by 2 0 and 2 2 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively the precipitation was projected to increase during the ff period under all rcps with an increase from 4 7 rcp2 6 to 10 7 rcp8 5 the future gcm ensemble annual mean minimum and maximum temperature were projected to be rising across all scenarios compared to the baseline period fig 3 especially the largest increases in minimum and maximum temperature were 4 71 c and 5 26 c respectively under rcp8 5 during the ff period overall the climate in the jrb showed a warmer and drier trend during the nf period and a warmer and wetter trend during the ff period the differences in monthly mean climate between future periods nf and ff and baseline period 1976 2005 were shown in fig 4 the precipitation would generally decrease in january and from july to august but it would increase in other months across all scenarios and periods fig 4a the largest increase in precipitation was projected in december under rcp8 5 during the ff period with a relative change of 58 9 and the largest decrease was projected in january under rcp8 5 during the nf period with a decrease of 31 6 the largest increases in temperature average minimum maximum temperature were projected in august the summer season and relatively small increases were during the winter season especially the average and minimum temperature increased substantially in all months across all scenarios overall during the two future periods a drier climate might occur during the flood season the summer season whereas a wetter climate would be expected for the winter and spring 3 2 impacts on water cycle fig 5 showed the monthly and annual differences in average streamflow and et between the two future periods nf and ff and the baseline conditions under all rcps during the nf period the monthly mean streamflow generally decreased relative to the baseline except april june and november in contrast during the ff period the streamflow tended to increase in almost all months and rcps except february july and august in which the streamflow decreased substantially for all rcps the largest increase in streamflow was projected in june under rcp8 5 during the ff period with an increasing rate of 71 4 the largest decrease was projected in august under rcp4 5 during the nf period with a decreasing rate of 44 1 fig 5a overall the ensemble average annual streamflow was projected to decrease by 8 1 under rcp2 6 to 20 1 under rcp8 5 during the nf period however it would remain nearly unchanged for rcp4 5 and increase by 3 7 under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 during the ff period respectively fig 5c fig 5b and d showed the changes of monthly and annual mean et under all scenarios generally the et during the ff period showed a relatively large increase compared to those during the nf period which was similar to the changing patterns of precipitation the et generally decreased from july through to september but increased during other months under all rcps and periods the largest increase 64 2 in et was projected in january under rcp8 5 during the ff period due to higher temperature and precipitation fig 5b the largest decrease of et was projected in august under rcp2 6 during the nf period with a decreasing rate of 15 7 in summary the ensemble average annual et would remain almost unchanged during the nf period with a rate changing form 0 8 to 0 8 and increase by 4 9 11 0 during the ff period fig 5d 3 3 impacts on carbon cycles the npp and soc in the jrb were simulated by swat daycent under three rcps during the future period nf and ff without and with future co2 effects fig 6 respectively under rcp2 6 the npp was projected to increase during the future period and the increasing magnitude would be larger when considering the co2 enrichment under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the npp was projected to be lower than that in the baseline without considering co2 enrichment nevertheless the density distribution shifted to the positive when considering the co2 enrichment during the future period under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 6a the largest decrease of annual npp was projected under rcp8 5 during the ff period with a decreasing rate of 15 55 and the largest increase of npp was projected under rcp2 6 during the ff period with an increasing magnitude of 2 57 without considering co2 effects as shown in table 3 however considering the co2 increase in the rcp scenarios the annual average npp was only projected to decrease slightly under rcp8 5 during the ff period table 3 as shown in fig 6 the soc across all scenarios tended to decrease during the future period across all scenarios under the three rcps the soc would generally deplete during the ff period compared to that in the nf period however taking into account the future co2 enrichment the density distribution slightly shifted to the positive during the future period under all rcps fig 6b as shown in table 3 although the future co2 enrichment could help slightly alleviate the soc depletion the annual average soc was still projected to decrease under the all rcps during the whole future period in particular the largest decrease of soc was projected under rcp8 5 during the ff period with a depletion rate of 6 29 and 6 00 without and with enriched co2 effects respectively table 3 3 4 impacts on the water carbon coupling the water carbon coupling represented by the correlation between npp and et and the controlling factors were shown in fig 7 the npp and et were generally tightly coupled across all scenarios with correlation coefficients being larger than 0 5 fig 7a the highest correlation coefficient was found in the historical period and it tended to be lower during the future period under all rcps for example the correlation coefficients under rcp8 5 were generally lower than those under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 the correlation coefficients during the ff periods were generally lower than those during the nf period we further attributed the variation of the npp et coupling to climatic factors fig 7b and c as shown in fig 7b the anomaly of precipitation inter annual variability significantly correlated with the npp et relationship indicating that the precipitation variability largely controlled the npp et coupling in the jrb however there was no obvious relationship between temperature variability and npp et coupling fig 7c in addition when plotting the correlation coefficient between npp and et against npp variability the degree of npp et coupling would become higher with the npp variability fig 7d indicating that the changes in npp in these high variability climate scenarios regions was closely linked with the changes in et 4 discussion 4 1 future hydrologic changes under climate change quantifying the impacts of climate change on hydrologic processes is critical for water resources management especially in the water deficient regions the jrb is located in the semi humid and semi arid transitional zone and the water shortage is a significant concern in the basin li and jin 2017 zhao et al 2018a our study found that the climate in the jrb would become warmer and drier between 2020 and 2049 in terms of the changes of precipitation and air temperature especially under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios our results keep consistent with li and jin 2017 who found that the precipitation in the jrb would decrease by 1 7 and 3 4 and the temperature were anticipated to increase significantly from 2011 to 2040 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in comparison with their baseline period 1961 2005 we found that the annual streamflow was projected to decrease by 8 1 20 1 and the et remain nearly unchanged 1 during the nf period respectively this decreasing magnitude in streamflow was a little higher than that from yang et al 2018 who reported a decrease of about 10 across the yellow river basin from 2021 to 2050 this may imply that the jrb would be under a more severe water stress during the mid century period in the end of this century that is the ff period in our study both the precipitation and temperature were expected to increase indicating a wetter and warmer climate driven by the increased precipitation the mean annual streamflow and et were projected to increase during the ff period which was also confirmed by others zhang et al 2016c zhang et al 2017 more importantly the monthly dynamics indicated a significant lower streamflow during the summer season due to the less summer precipitation and higher summer temperature which may further elevate the water stress in summer in the jrb therefore an efficient water use saving measure would be needed in the future 4 2 co2 and climate warming effects on carbon sequestration the npp and soc are two important indicators in reflecting the plant community characteristics and potential production of an ecosystem our study found that the combination of elevated co2 and climate change could help improve the vegetation production and alleviate the soc depletion in the jrb without considering the future co2 enrichment the projected npp would be lower than the baseline across almost all scenarios which can be attributable to the higher temperature warmer climate in the future the reason can be found in our previous study zhao et al 2019 where the temperature played a negative role in vegetation production in such water limited basin in fact the npp simulation in daycent is a function of nutrient availability soil water and temperature vegetation type and plant phenology del grosso et al 2009 a drier climate may influence the nutrient availability through accelerating the volatilization e g ammonia nitrogen volatilization and soil dry layer that is the soil water availability additionally in daycent the npp was divided among leafy woody and root compartments on the basis of plant type and phenology higher temperature may negatively affect the stomatal conductance and thus directly reduce the npp allocation in plant leaves therefore the increased temperature combined with relatively stable precipitation would lead to lower npp wu et al 2009 a higher npp is possible when considering co2 fertilization effects kergoat 2002 because elevated co2 can stimulate plant growth and productivity directly by enhancing mesophyll co2 diffusion and photosynthesis sun et al 2014 song et al 2019 the findings were also supported by the globe scale experimental results for example norby et al 2005 found that the forest npp could be stimulated medially by 23 under elevated co2 evans et al 2014 reported that the net ecosystem productivity would be significantly enhanced because of the co2 enrichment in the arid ecosystem even under a heat and drought extreme the elevated co2 could maintain the net carbon uptake of the grassland ecosystems roy et al 2016 although the elevated co2 could help slightly alleviate the soc reductions through the fertilization effects the soc in the jrb was projected to decrease across all scenarios the little difference between scenarios with and without co2 fertilization can be attributed to the short simulated periods in our study actually the elevated co2 could largely stimulate the soil carbon accumulation in kinds of ecosystems which was confirmed by previous experimental and modeling results farrior et al 2015 tfaily et al 2018 the significant reduction in soc can be attributed to the warmer climate in the future mahecha et al 2010 arora et al 2013 crowther et al 2016 warming induced increases in air and soil temperature might activate the microbial growth and thus accelerate the soc decomposition rate lu et al 2013 moreover in daycent the maximum soc decomposition rate was largely determined by an abiotic soil decomposition factor that is controlled by soil temperature and soil moisture parton et al 1998 the soil temperature function increases exponentially with increasing air temperature that is the effects of soil temperature on soc decomposition would increase with the air temperature increasing while the soil moisture function increases as the ratio of stored water plus current rainfall to potential evapotranspiration pet increases higher temperature could thus result in soc reduction through increasing the soil temperature and altering the soil moisture and pet some quantitative studies also showed that an expected increase in surface temperature of 3 3 c would cause a net soc loss of 11 16 over europe and the warming from 2000 to 2014 would result in 14 loss of soc from the global terrestrial ecosystem cox et al 2000 wiesmeier et al 2016 however the negative effects of warming on soc were contingent on the level of the initial soil carbon stock in the jrb for example the soc would have a smaller decrease or even an increasing trend in areas with low initial soc stocks while the soc tended to decrease largely in areas with high initial soc stocks fig 8 the phenomenon was also confirmed by the site scale and globe scale studies for example wu et al 2015 reported that the further the soc content is from the soc equilibrium value the higher the carbon sink source potential and the quicker the carbon change rate through analyzing the globe scale experimental results crowther et al 2016 found that the negative effects of warming on global soc stock can be negligible in areas with small initial soc levels but losses occurred beyond a threshold of 2 5 kg c m2 and were considerable in soils with 7 kg c m2 in this sense areas with a higher or lower soc content may demonstrate a potential carbon source or sink respectively under the warming climate in the future therefore the watershed managers should pay much attention to areas with a relatively higher level of soc and formulate appropriate management practices for enhancing the carbon sequestration towards a warming world 4 3 precipitation regulation on the water carbon coupling many studies have shown the carbon and water are highly coupled and the precipitation plays an important role in regulating the coupling strength xiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016b for example zhang et al 2016b found that the precipitation variability significantly controlled the coupling between gross primary production and et especially in the semi arid and semi humid regions our study further documented a high npp et coupling and significant role of precipitation variability in regulating this coupling strength in the jrb the water and carbon cycles are coupled mainly due to the stomatal control on both water and carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere through photosynthesis and transpiration niu et al 2011 the relatively weak coupling relationship in the ff period could be attributed to the low nutrient availability for plant growth because of nutrient depletion caused by relatively higher streamflow taking into account the climatic variation in each scenario we revealed that the precipitation variability played a major role in regulating the npp et coupling strength this phenomenon further demonstrated that the precipitation change was still the dominant factor in vegetation growth as well as the energy balance regardless of temperature change in such a semi arid region the significant correlation between npp et coupling and npp variability implied that the iav of npp was closely linked with the npp et coupling in this area in this sense the variability in precipitation and npp et coupling could jointly control the npp variability in such a semi arid region which was also predicted by zhang et al 2016b furthermore the increasing trend of regression slope between npp and et increased with the drought index and this further demonstrated the significant role of precipitation in regulating the water carbon coupling in the jrb fig s5 this phenomenon was also consistent with the fact that water use efficiency would increase with the precipitation gradients especially in the semi arid regions sun et al 2016 4 4 uncertainties and limitations uncertainties involved in simulating future hydro biogeochemical cycles can be primarily attributed to the gcms and the hydro geochemical model many studies reported that over reliance on a single gcm could lead to inappropriate climate predictions and thus inappropriate projections in simulation terms li and jin 2017 yang et al 2019 towards addressing this uncertainty the study adopted the arithmetic ensemble averages from the hydro biogeochemical model outputs that are driven by the five gcms although the ensemble average precipitation and temperature from gcms showed good consistence with the cma based observations and the results were close to previous studies it is indeed difficult to predict climate change accurately in the future because the sophisticated climate system knutti and sedláček 2012 zhang et al 2016c in addition future land use change and potential anthropogenic activities were not taken into account in this study 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the effects of future climate change on water carbon coupling cycles in the jrb by combining the commonly used gcms and the newly developed swat daycent model the climate projections showed that the precipitation would change slightly during the nf period and increase by 5 11 during the ff period while the temperature was projected to appreciably increase across all scenarios indicating a warmer and drier in the nf period but a warmer and wetter climate in the ff period under the projected climate change streamflow would decrease by 8 1 20 1 during the nf period and increase by 0 1 3 7 during the ff period while the et could remain almost unchanged during the nf period but would increase by 4 9 11 0 during the ff period the npp was projected to increase with considering the co2 enrichment and the soc was projected to decrease across all scenarios though the change of soc may be positive or negative depending on the initial soc stock spatially the carbon water was projected to be closely coupled across all scenarios in terms of the npp et correlation but this coupling strength was controlled by the precipitation variability moreover the npp variability can be co controlled by the precipitation variability and npp et coupling in the jrb our study predicted the spatiotemporal carbon water dynamics under the future climate and this can be informative and valuable for the watershed managers in

5891,the widespread uncertainty regarding future changes in climate socioeconomic conditions and population growth have increased interest in water energy food ecology nexus based frameworks in relation to the analysis of water resources a challenge for modeling the water energy food ecology nexus is how to reduce the multidimensional and codependent uncertainties and measure the complicated casual relationships effectively we propose a methodological solution to the problem and this solution is demonstrated in this case as an extension to the previous water resource optimization framework we coupled the water energy food ecology nexus into the bayesian network which provides a formal representation of the joint probabilistic behavior of the system and the method was applied to water resource use analysis and management in the syr darya river basin a transboundary and endorheic basin that has contributed to the aral sea ecological crisis as a result of unreasonable water use the annual scale data of four periods 1970 1980 1980 1991 1991 2005 and 2005 2015 were introduced into the bayesian network before the disintegration of the soviet union the amount of water inflow into the aral sea was sensitive to increases in irrigation for agricultural development increases in water storage of the upstream reservoirs and stochastic runoff after the disintegration of the soviet union the amount of water inflow into the aral sea was sensitive to the inefficient irrigation water use in the downstream areas of uzbekistan and kazakhstan and the water storage of the reservoir located upstream of kyrgyzstan the change resulted from unresolvable disputes between water use for power generation in the upstream area and irrigation in the downstream area comprehensive scenario analysis shows that in the short term it would be useful to improve the proportion of food crops improve the efficiency of water use in relation to salt leaching and irrigation and prevent drought damage in the long term based on the increased use of advanced drip irrigation technology from 50 to 80 the annual inflow into the aral sea will increase significantly reaching 6 4 km3 and 9 6 km3 respectively and this technology is capable of ameliorating the ecological crisis within the basin keywords bayesian network water energy food ecology nexus syr darya river aral sea 1 introduction the syr darya river is one of two major rivers in the aral sea basin and the other is the amu darya river the syr darya river basin mainly includes upstream kyrgyzstan and downstream uzbekistan and kazakhstan since the 1960s the soviet union has implemented the large scale development of water resources and land resources in the syr darya river basin the construction of water conservancy projects such as reservoirs diversion canals and sizeable agricultural irrigation systems has led to a sharp increase in water diversion and a sharp decrease in the amount of water inflow to the aral sea until the end of the 1980s the area of the aral sea declined by approximately 50 this change caused a tremendous ecological crisis and received international attention before the disintegration of the soviet union the government uniformly allocated and managed water use in the syr darya river basin the upstream water supply guaranteed downstream agricultural water use and the downstream abundant fossil energy compensated for the energy shortage in the upstream area after the disintegration of the soviet union the unified water management mechanism collapsed the new downstream countries no longer freely compensate for the shortage of energy in the upstream countries the new upstream countries must increase the water storage of the reservoir to ensure power generation in winter and reduce the downstream water supply in summer which affects the downstream agricultural production the release of water from the upstream countries in the non growing season often leads to flooding in the downstream countries at the same time population growth and the development of social and economic factors have led to a further increase in the demand for water and competition for water resources has intensified currently the area of the aral sea has decreased by approximately 90 the water quality has deteriorated and soil salinization has led to high levels of farmland abandonment the exposed lakebed has led to an increased frequency of sand and salt storms decreased biodiversity and decreased fishery resources micklin 1988 micklin 2007 to govern the ecological crisis in the syr darya river basin we must follow the concept of sustainable development and establish a harmonious water energy food ecology wefe nexus the socioeconomic development of the syr darya river basin is highly dependent on the water resources the optimal allocation of social and economic water and ecological water is the key to establishing a harmonious nexus after the transformation of the soviet union upstream hydropower development downstream large scale agricultural development and fossil energy mining greatly improved the utilization of resources causing the socioeconomic water use in the basin to be highly correlated with the energy relations and food demand and its structure current research has started to focus on the relationships in the water energy food wef nexus from different perspectives endo et al 2017 smajgl et al 2016 tian et al 2018 however these studies typically neglect the differences between arid and wet regions the ecological adaptation ability of the arid regions is weak and the sensitivity to the change in the wef nexus is much higher than that of the wet regions conway et al 2015 siddiqi and anadon 2011 when applied in arid regions the optimal allocation of water resources lacks a systematic understanding of constraints in the wef nexus for example two stage stochastic programming is a method commonly used in water resource allocation optimization to reduce the risk of uncertainty in decision making huang and loucks 2000 huang et al 2012 in the first stage it is necessary to determine the upper and lower boundaries of the water use departments in the second stage the water resources are allocated under randomly available water intakes according to objective functions that consider benefits and risks however in reality the benefits of water use are limited by complex causal relationships in the wef nexus and such methods loosen the constraints in planning when applied in wet or developed regions the sensitivity of water use to the wef nexus is low and the adverse effects of loosening constraints are often not significant when applied in arid and underdeveloped regions the water sensitivity to the wef nexus is high and looser constraints may result in optimized but impractical solutions to balance the ecological vulnerability of arid regions with the wef nexus this paper analyzed and optimized the water resource use in the basin based on the defined wefe nexus with ecology included as an essential component currently most studies on the interaction and evolution processes of society water and ecosystems use an integrated modeling method bazilian et al 2011 this method directly integrates water system models socioeconomic models and ecological models such integrated models include the clew model howells et al 2013 the wef tool 2 0 daher and mohtar 2015 and the welf model ringler et al 2013 when integrating models containing knowledge from different fields there is often a problem in that the model structure and the spatiotemporal scale do not match additionally integrated models require many observations for calibration in addition the wefe nexus is greatly affected by the stability of social development but we have often ignored the differences in the social development of different study areas when studying the wefe nexus in developed countries the relationships of variables are often stable due to stable social and economic conditions a low level of dependence on natural resources and a strong ability to acquire natural resources when studying the wefe nexus in developed countries there are many contradictions due to unstable social development such as a scarcity of or weak access to natural resources high level of dependence on natural resources weak sustainable development concepts and prominent ecological and environmental problems these conditions lead to dramatic changes poor stability and high uncertainty of the nexus in addition these conditions may explain why these areas often become hotspots for the study of the wef nexus bazilian et al 2011 kahrl and roland holst 2008 siddiqi and anadon 2011 monitoring and observational data of the hydrological systems ecological processes energy and food production in the syr darya river basin are incomplete because the disintegration of the soviet union made the original unified observations unsustainable additionally the water use system and the wefe nexus in this basin rely heavily on highly stochastic river runoff missing data and high system uncertainty imposes great difficulties regarding the application of integrated modeling methods in addition the development of water and land resources in the basin were affected by the prosperity and disintegration of the soviet union this situation differs from the slow growth of other developed countries and the rapid growth of developing countries in terms of social development trends the power of the government has changed from being concentrated to dispersed representing a situation that is unique among major economies in the past 50 years which differs from other studies of water systems there is a consensus that the water use patterns and the wefe nexus in the syr darya river basin have varied greatly in different historical periods bayesian network bn is a method used in uncertainty knowledge representation and reasoning bn is based on graph theory and the bayesian probability formula the weight of the probability measure is used to describe the causal relationship between variables and the conditional probability is used to diagnose and predict the bn method can combine prior knowledge to analyze causal relationships and reduce the demand of measured data moreover the probability distribution of variables can be used instead of the determined value to reduce the uncertainty of causality in the system analysis therefore in the wefe nexus analysis bn may have advantages in characterizing causality simulation uncertainty and reducing data requirements compared to the integrated model method and solving the problem of loosening the constraints found in traditional water resources optimization caused by a lack of consideration of causality restrictions current studies have used bn as a support tool for water resource management and decision making these studies have focused on the management of water quality aguilera et al 2013 death et al 2015 hines and landis 2014 nash and hannah 2011 groundwater fienen et al 2013 giordano et al 2013 irrigation water mamitimin et al 2015 quinn et al 2013 water system design taner et al 2019 and water supply hunter et al 2011 pagano et al 2014 and they have achieved good results reflecting their ability to express knowledge of systematic uncertainties the bn method provides a useful new solution for water resource management and it has a good development prospect when combined with other models planning methods and scenario analysis phan et al 2016 in addition studies have begun to combine bns with geographic information johnson et al 2012 therefore coupling the wefe nexus into a bn may be feasible by combining the bn with the geographic information and directed graph structures that coexist in each component of the nexus by coupling the wefe nexus into the bn this paper analyzes the water use status of the syr darya river basin in the past 50 years and provides knowledge support for water resource management and decision making the aims of this paper are as follows 1 to determine the structure of the bn based on the cognition of causal relations in the weef nexus in the basin based on the characteristics of water use and the principal contradictions 2 to construct the bn to analyze the water use status and evaluate the performance and applicability of the bn 3 to analyze the impacts of water use patterns on the amount of water inflow to the aral sea in different historical periods of the past 50 years and 4 to propose a water use optimization plan 2 study area and data 2 1 study area according to national boundaries and significant regional differences in the production and consumption of water energy and food the toktogul hydropower station is used as the dividing point between the upstream and downstream regions in this paper fig 1 in this paper the upstream region includes kyrgyzstan and the downstream region includes uzbekistan s jizzakh tashkent namangan andijan ferghana and syrdarya and kazakhstan s kyzylorda and chimkent 2 2 data this research used data collected on the state scale regarding the water resources energy industry agriculture and ecology of the syr darya river basin from 1970 to 2015 table 1 although the aral sea split into the south aral sea and the north aral sea in the 1980s and the syr darya river flows into the north aral sea the south and north aral sea designations are still relevant the volume and ecology of the south aral sea are potentially affected by the water supply of the syr darya river sand and salt storms in the south aral sea also affect the downstream areas of the syr darya river basin therefore in this paper the ecological data of the aral sea cover the entire aral sea data of the downstream area are processed by summing those for the six states of uzbekistan and two states of kazakhstan or by weighted averages based on the population proportion some of the socioeconomic data of 1987 1992 and 2010 2015 are missing the water quality and soil salinity sampling included in the ecological data are at time points and linear interpolation is used to fill the missing data ultimately the spatial and temporal scales of all data are processed uniformly at the scale of the upstream area and downstream area and at the annual scale as the spatiotemporal scale used in this paper is large the influence of the difference in one year and the local spatial heterogeneity are small thus the collected data meet the accuracy requirement 3 concept and method 3 1 wefe nexus in the syr darya river basin according to the management methods in different social backgrounds we divided the wefe nexus of the syr darya river basin into four stages fig 2 1 rapid agricultural development 1960 1980 during this period the former soviet union carried out large scale land reclamation in the syr darya river basin due to the massive demand in the entire soviet union cotton which has a high water consumption was planted in large quantities and the primary irrigation type was flood irrigation water conservancy projects such as reservoirs and main canals were constructed but the leakage of these projects was high these projects consumed a large amount of water during the diversion process and resulted in lower agricultural water use efficiency the amount of water inflow to the aral sea decreased and the ecological crisis appeared in the aral sea cai et al 2003 2 the development of water and land resources reached a peak and then became relatively stable 1980 1991 during this period the scale of agricultural development in the syr darya river basin reached a peak and then became relatively stable the volume of the aral sea further decreased the demand for downstream agricultural water was prioritized and the free downstream fossil energy compensated for the shortage in the upstream power generation a large amount of agricultural irrigation water flowed to salty depressions at the outer edge of the oasis the water inflow to the aral sea from the syr darya river was extremely low cai et al 2003 3 economic development stagnation 1991 2005 after the disintegration of the former soviet union the political situation was unstable and the social economies of the newly independent central asian countries stagnated or even decreased due to the declining demand for agricultural products the amount of cotton production was much larger than the actual demand after the disintegration and a large amount of cultivated land was abandoned reducing the area of agricultural land due to the pressure on food security caused by population growth the proportion of the area planted with food crops gradually increased at the same time the downstream region no longer provided fossil energy freely to the upstream region this scenario has resulted in an energy crisis in upstream kyrgyzstan and a large part of the population s electricity demand cannot be met especially in its cold winters to increase winter power generation the water storage of the upstream reservoir has increased in summer thus the amount of water supplied to the downstream countries during summer has decreased accordingly which led to a shortage in the downstream agricultural water in summer and a higher risk of flooding in winter in addition long term flood irrigation and poor drainage capacity has caused decreased fertility and severe soil salinization in the downstream farmlands a large amount of pesticides organic matter and salt has entered the syr darya river resulting in the deterioration of the downstream water quality in 1993 the area of the aral sea had decreased by 50 compared with that in the 1960s by 2004 the area of the aral sea was only 25 that of the original micklin 2007 the former aral sea area was exposed the frequency of sand and salt storm events increased and the health of residents was threatened by the storms thus the aral sea crisis worsened 4 the stage of economic recovery 2005 2015 in the newly independent century the economic development of kazakhstan which is rich in fossil energy and has a relatively good industrial base has increased due to the privatization of agricultural land and the improvement of agricultural product export prospects the enthusiasm for downstream agricultural production has increased in addition advances in farming techniques have increased agricultural productivity to protect the ecology of the aral sea in its territory downstream kazakhstan built a dam in the north aral sea and the dam was completed in 2005 the dam keeps the aral sea split into two parts the water surface of the north aral sea began to expand and the water level began to rise however this situation indirectly caused accelerated drying in the south aral sea micklin 2007 in the middle stream area large reservoirs were built for flood control and irrigation adjustment and kazakhstan s disadvantages in terms of water competition were alleviated however with the increase in population and the potential pressure from climate change water use conflicts have tended to escalate in approximately 2010 the area of the aral sea decreased to 10 of that in the 1960s and the ecological crisis worsened 3 2 structure of bn based on the wefe nexus the bn is a directed acyclic graph model the nodes of the bn represent the probability distribution of variables the directed edges between the nodes represent the causal relationship based on the conditional probability table and the bayesian conditional probability formula is used to connect the nodes into a network pearl 1988 by combining prior knowledge and observational data we obtain the conditional probability distribution of the network nodes when adjusting the probability distribution of some nodes the bn calculates the posterior conditional probability distribution of the other nodes to implement a prediction or diagnostic analysis the em expectation maximization algorithm is used to iteratively calculate the expectation and maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters and implement the optimization process for the missing data neal and hinton 1998 in this paper we use netica software to construct a bn and this software is powerful easy to use and widely used in bn modeling research uusitalo 2007 we couple the wefe nexus to the bn because both are often represented with directed graphs as a relatively mature tool the bn presents less modifiable and adjustable instructions than the nexus as an abstract concept therefore we attempt to construct a joint distribution between the nexus variables states to match the bn this paper coupled the wefe nexus into a bn for water use analysis and management in the syr darya river basin and it included the relevant geographic information we proposed a general model for combining the nexus and geographic information to generate variables that are suitable at the scale of the bn fig 3 obviously the use of geographic information cannot be at a grid scale of several kilometers and developing such a small scale bn is difficult because the causal relationship in the wefe nexus between such small scale grids can hardly be determined based on expert knowledge independently however deterministic causal relationships at regional scales are often known such as upstream reservoir operations that affect downstream farmland irrigation another reason is that the results and conclusions at country or regional scales are often the item of interest and are required for transboundary water resources management the coupled model consists of the following four modules 1 water resources module this module reflects climate change and its impact on water resource changes including temperature precipitation glaciers and permanent snow changes and their impacts on runoff and is used to represent the changes in incoming water volume from mountains and the water retention capacity in downstream areas 2 upstream area module this module reflects the local water energy nexus including the upstream hydropower generation energy imports and winter and summer water releases from reservoirs to explain the contradiction in seasonal water use between upstream power generation and downstream agriculture 3 downstream area module this module reflects the local water food nexus the downstream economic scale and water use scale account for a relatively high proportion in the basin thus refining the changes in water use in different industries such as downstream planting animal husbandry and industry 4 ecology of the aral sea this module reflects the ecological impact of the local wef nexus and measures the impacts of unreasonable water use and food production on soil salinization water shrinkage in the aral sea dust weather biodiversity and resident health effects next we refined the model structure at the variable scale fig 4 and the specific variables are included 3 3 parameterization and evaluation method of the constructed bn 3 3 1 parameterization method of the bn to reduce the computational complexity of the joint probability distribution we discretized the dataset table 2 the different numbers of intervals and segmentation points in the discretization process may have an impact on the performance of the model and the prior knowledge obtained from expert knowledge therefore in this paper the discretization of data is synchronized with the setting of prior knowledge and expert knowledge and the actual data distribution guided the discretization procedure we used the collected information at two time scales first the annual scale reflects the annual variation in the variables such as the uncertainty of the annual runoff through nexus propagation affecting the water use of the basin the second scale is the stage scale of the social and economic background divided into approximately 10 15 years and the specific sections are 1970 1980 1980 1991 1991 2005 and 2005 2015 this paper used four periods to distinguish different socioeconomic backgrounds and input annual scale data in each period to implement parameterization 3 3 2 evaluation method of the bn we mainly evaluate the bn performance from two perspectives first we evaluate how well the constructed model matches the actual knowledge based on a sensitivity analysis second we evaluate the accuracy of the bn predictions and inferences by calculating a confusion matrix sensitivity analysis is widely considered to be more effective in assessing model performance cain et al 2001 kragt et al 2009 marcot 2012 marcot et al 2006 pollino and henderson 2010 poppenborg and koellner 2014 therefore this paper uses sensitivity analysis to test the sensitivity of the output variables in the bn to the input variables mutual information mi based on entropy reduction and variance of belief vb based on variance reduction are often used as sensitivity analysis indicators for bn evaluation barton et al 2008 pearl 1988 mi and vb are calculated as follows 1 mi h q h q f q f p q f log 2 p q f p q p f 2 v b v q v q f q p q x q q p q x q 2 q p q f x q q p q f x q 2 where h is the entropy v is the variance q is the target variable f is some other variable and q and f represent the state of q and f respectively xq is the actual value corresponding to state q for the convenience of comparison the mi and vb are normalized to 0 100 respectively in this paper we choose downstream water use as the target node for the accuracy assessment and calculate its confusion matrix the calculation of the confusion matrix is based on the original data set that has been divided by the k fold method k fold cross validation was often used to calculate the confusion matrix evaluation accuracy and compare the state of the maximum posterior probability with the actual state value marcot 2012 k fold cross validation divided the training set into k sample subsets we retained a single subsample as the test model data and used the other k 1 subsets for training the cross validation was repeated k times and we recorded the confusion matrix calculated by k times then the obtained k confusion matrices were averaged to evaluate the performance of the prediction 3 4 scenario analysis optimization and multi criteria assessment based on a constructed bn using the evaluated bn it is convenient to analyze the relative likelihood of status changes in the target variables under different levels of runoff and management scenarios by specifying the state of the input variable or adjusting its probability distribution the change in the state probability of the output variable can be predicted this paper aims to optimize the wefe nexus ensure the living standards of residents and enhance the degree of cooperation in the region and analyze the level of benefit of the target variables in different scenarios although a scenario variable may be related to other scenario variables the sum of the effects of all scenario variables cain et al 2001 can be used to characterize the combined effect therefore this paper analyzed each scenario variable as a change in the target variable at the time of the scenario in addition to directly using interactive and constructed bn applications for management and decision making the sampling of the bn can be combined with further dynamic optimization objectives and help assess uncertainty and decision making traditional constraint optimization methods often use adjustable weights to integrate multiple targets or use multi objective optimization to obtain pareto solutions in this paper we do not set the weight between the criteria and the optimization process can be considered a multi objective problem a pareto surface can be obtained and could be considered a collection of solutions of multi objective optimization however little attention has been paid to the robustness of the solutions under high uncertainty therefore we focus on the uncertainty in optimization and decision making rather than solving a multi objective optimization problem netica can be used to generate a series of random cases whose probability distribution matches that of a particular bn which is known as sampling this series of cases sampled based on the joint probability distribution can reflect the causality between variables and can be considered restrictive and realistic constraints in water resources optimization and these constraints are different from the constraints usually represented by inequality equations in traditional optimization programs under the different water availability conditions three comprehensive criteria were used to evaluate the feasibility of optimization reliability rel total net benefit tb and degree of cooperation dc rel is defined as the weighted sum of the averages of the sustainable use of cultivated land and ecological water calculated as 3 rel β ha a 1 β weco tweco where ha is the total planted area a is the total available area weco is the actual ecological water use tweco is the target ecological water use and 0 β 1 is a weight assigned to balance these two aspects tb is defined as the sum of different types of benefits including agricultural production hydropower profit and ecological benefit dc is defined as the level of cooperation reflecting the balance of the main benefits obtained by the upstream and downstream regions they are calculated as follows 4 tb p a a p p h h p p e e b 5 dc h p a p where hp is the upstream hydropower profit eb is the ecological net benefit and ap is the downstream agricultural production p a p h and p e are the unit prices that are used to adjust the weight in the total benefit and can be determined by stakeholders and decision makers for the convenience of comparison the values of the three criteria were linearly normalized to 0 1 based on the maximum and minimum values in this paper 4 results 4 1 model parameterization and evaluation 4 1 1 model parameterization combined with expert knowledge and observational data we parameterized the bn fig 5 in this paper we selected six nodes that reflected the importance of each part of the wefe nexus as target variables for sensitivity analysis the results show that mi and vb have a consistent trend the larger the mi is the larger the vb is the higher the sensitivity of the target variable is and the greater the intermediate variable between the node and the target node is and the lower the impact on the target node is 4 1 2 model evaluation the sensitivity analysis results based on this evaluation method were consistent with the factual evidence fig 6 which verified the applicability of the model using the node inflow to the aral sea as an example the downstream agricultural water use the upstream reservoir water storage and the downstream inflow to depression were consistent with the main types of actual water resource utilization in particular downstream agricultural water consumption had a significant impact on the amount of water inflow to the aral sea which was consistent with existing knowledge micklin 2007 however due to the low representativeness of the data and the significant influence of unconsidered factors some nodes were not sensitive to other nodes reflecting weak causality for example the node downstream life expectancy was affected by negative ecological feedback but it was more affected by factors such as medical conditions not considered to assess the predictive power of the model for water use netica was used to calculate the confusion matrix for the node downstream water use using five cross validations for the 2005 2015 data set table 3 the network had an overall accuracy of 70 when predicting downstream water consumption showing high accuracy and absolute reliability in predicting future downstream water use 4 2 characteristics of water use patterns in the syr darya river basin in the past 50 years and contributions of major influencing factors the water use patterns in the syr darya river basin were significantly different in different historical stages quantitative knowledge can help us deepen our understanding of changes in water use patterns however expert knowledge about historical water use patterns is often qualitative a quantitative sensitivity analysis can be used to evaluate the bn and it can also help us generate quantitative insights into the contributions of major factors that influence historical water use patterns when reliable expert knowledge is lacking we analyzed the sensitivity of the node water inflow to the aral sea at different historical stages fig 7 by focusing on quantifying the sensitivity change of this node to other variables in each historical stage because this node is highly correlated with water use nodes because their child node and can be linked to ecological indicators before the disintegration of the former soviet union the amount of water inflow to the aral sea was more sensitive to runoff upstream reservoir storage downstream irrigation quotas and downstream agricultural water use after the disintegration of the former soviet union the amount of water flowing into the aral sea was more sensitive to factors such as runoff inflowing water summer upstream reservoir water releases upstream reservoir water storage and downstream agricultural water use and showed an increasing trend in general the sensitivity of the amount of water inflow to the aral sea to the amount of water inflow to the depression and the amount of water released from the upstream reservoir increased during the whole period the sensitivity to runoff decreased and the sensitivity to downstream agricultural water first decreased and then increased the above characteristics indicate that the newly built reservoir enhances the ability to adapt to changes in runoff after the disintegration of the former soviet union the competition for water rights in central asian countries intensified increasing the amount of water flowing into the depression which seriously affected the amount of water inflow to the aral sea these results also show that downstream countries have unreasonable uses of return water for irrigation and surplus water due to the competition for water resources the consideration of ecological water use in the aral sea has been ignored although the new wetlands and lakes formed by the water flowing into the depression have specific ecological service value this process is not conducive to alleviating the ecological crisis in the aral sea the upstream winter fossil energy gap causes the impact of the upstream water release of the reservoir on the amount of water inflow to the aral sea more significant and is higher than the increase in the amount of natural gas imported from the downstream region this pattern is related to the upstream region s attempt to increase hydropower to compensate for the more significant energy gap caused by the increase in population upstream hydropower no longer attempts to rely on downstream fossil energy rather the upstream area has increased hydropower generation to ensure its energy security and has even become an energy exporter micklin 2007 4 3 scenario analysis and optimization of water resources use compared with the current situation reducing the amount of water inflow to the depression is the most effective 23 5 method table 4 for increasing the amount of water in the aral sea and there is much room for improvement in the management of salt leaching returned irrigation water and surplus water therefore it is necessary to improve the efficiency of salt leaching and irrigation such as increasing the laying of salt drainage pipes and reforming the aging and leaking water diversion canals while enhancing the degree of regional cooperation and the rational use of surplus water increasing the area of downstream food crops and improving the planting structure will help increase grain production 13 6 ensure food security and reduce the proportion of cotton that consumes high amounts of water the aggravation of drought has had a significant negative impact on the aral sea and downstream ecosystems affecting desertification 9 6 soil salinization 5 5 sand dust storms 3 7 and water quality 1 3 therefore it is necessary to enhance the storage and utilization of surplus water to prevent drought damage in summary this paper proposes an optimized water use plan for the syr darya river basin and this plan includes improving salt leaching and irrigation water use efficiency improving planting structure increasing the proportion of food crops and preventing drought hazards 4 4 multi criteria assessment in decision making under changes in the uncertainty of dynamic responses to the bn operations to explore the scalability of a bn in management decision making based on comprehensive indicators and to understand the effects on water use management of constraints in bn a multi criteria assessment was applied based on the constructed bn and scenario analysis results under various runoff conditions based on the monte carlo simulation of the bn 100 cases were generated and these cases can also be considered as 100 samples based on the joint probability of a bn the high dimensional joint probability represented by the distribution of cases generated by the bn helps decision makers understand the uncertainty of the system quickly fig 8 compared with the constraint of the not compiled bn as not considering the joint probabilistic behavior in the system the set of decision cases with constraints of the compiled bn is more realistic and the uncertainty is reduced with a decrease in chaos after the decision nodes were determined the distribution of cases changed under medium and high runoff conditions the dispersion of cases was reduced and the uncertainty in decision making was reduced to a manageable range however under low runoff conditions the effect of optimized decision making was weak as the dispersion of cases changed insignificantly this result means that reducing water inflow to depressions and increasing downstream grain crop areas may be significantly effective under only medium and high runoff conditions 5 discussion compared with previous studies on the relationship between components of the wef nexus this paper distinguishes between arid and humid regions and focuses more on the fragile ecology of arid regions through the use of the wefe nexus compared with the integrated modeling method which is focused on uncertainty in the water use system and its propagation characteristics in the causal link network the bn reduced the model complexity and the modeling cost with joint probability compared with the traditional optimization method of water resource use coupling the wefe nexus into the bn strengthened the causal relational constraint of the water resources system additionally the analysis of the differences in water use patterns in different historical periods reflected the large impact of social background changes on water use and enhanced the understanding of causality in the evolution of complex human water systems at the same time this paper discussed the deficiencies and improvements in this study from the following two aspects 5 1 capability of bayesian network modeling the bn can effectively simulate the complex causal relationships in the water resources system in the syr darya river basin the form of a probability distribution can effectively express the uncertainty of the variables sensitivity analysis can distinguish the differences in different social historical backgrounds the bn analysis in this paper achieved good results which were related to the more accurate prior knowledge and the sufficient amount of data for key nodes due to the international community s concern for the aral sea ecological disaster a large number of researchers are interested and the knowledge and data support generated from this concern improved the construction and parameterization of this paper because of the differences in the modeling process the type of data used and the characterization of the relationship in the wefe nexus it was difficult to directly compare the integrated modeling method and the bn modeling based on quantitative indicators with the further increase and refinement of network nodes the bn may gradually approach the fine scale structure of the process based integrated models and face the problem of how to combine multi domain expert knowledge to support the network and data limits therefore studying the optimal scale of the bn in water resources management may be the next step and it is necessary to balance the modeling effect and the cost of the model which depends on its complexity 5 2 prospects for water resource utilization optimization the climate population and socioeconomic development of the future basin may show new and significant changes and the lack of predictive ability of new changes in the bond will limit the network s predictive ability at the same time bns have difficulty assessing factors that have not occurred such as the promotion of advanced drip irrigation systems the results of the scenario analysis indicate that reducing the amount of downstream inflow water is an effective measure to increase the amount of water in the aral sea while the amount of water inflow into the depression comes from surplus water and irrigation return water the almaty agreement which was formed after the disintegration of the soviet union was mainly determined according to the proportion of water used before the disintegration of the soviet union however the amount of water inflow to the aral sea was meager at this time so this program lacked consideration of the ecological water use in the aral sea an important basis for the maintenance of the downstream high load agricultural production is sufficient central agricultural subsidies and high demand for agricultural products under the planned economic system of the soviet union after the disintegration of the soviet union the scale of agricultural production decreased in the downstream countries and the water demand decreased however the surplus water flowed into the depression and not into the aral sea however reducing water inflow to depressions may not be significantly effective under low runoff according to the results of the multi criteria assessment and it is a short term plan when considering long term climate change and population growth we should try to propose a long term optimization plan such as the use of water saving irrigation technology which is not considered in the bn gradually promoting the use of drip irrigation systems can reduce the level of dependence on irrigation improve the irrigation efficiency and reduce a large amount of irrigation return water that inflows into the depression at present the average irrigation quota in the syr darya river basin is approximately 10 000 m3 ha in xinjiang province of china which is also in the arid region of central asia and has similar potential evaporation the average irrigation quota for drip irrigation is less than 5000 m3 ha based on the simple prediction of different drip irrigation promotion scenarios if the future penetration rate of drip irrigation in the syr darya river basin reaches 50 it would save approximately 8 km3 of ecological water for the aral sea every year if 80 of the saved agricultural water flowed into the aral sea the amount of water added to the aral sea would reach 6 4 km3 if the penetration rate increased to 80 each year approximately 12 km3 of agricultural water would be saved for the aral sea basin if 80 of the saved agricultural water flowed into the aral sea the annual increase of the aral sea into the lake would reach 9 6 km3 or more which would alleviate the ecological crisis in the aral sea in the syr darya river basin regional cooperation is crucial central asian countries had a high level of coordinated resource allocation and development under the unified jurisdiction of the soviet union after the disintegration of the soviet union there were shortcomings in the social and economic development of central asian countries the change in regional geography and the degree of separation of political power had a considerable impact on the spatial pattern of water use due to the pressure caused by population growth in the basin it is not realistic that the aral sea crisis will be solved only by the countries in the basin in terms of the overall sustainable development of the basin in addition to the internal coordination and optimization such as the promotion of water saving irrigation and regional cooperation external cooperation is essential and should be focused on the contradictions in the wefe nexus for example strengthening cooperation with russia an external energy country and china an industrial country is expected to gradually achieve a more stable and harmonious nexus by enhancing hydropower utilization improving irrigation system efficiency and promoting industrial structure upgrades the premise is that these countries must form effective cooperation mechanisms through specific organizations 6 conclusions because of the unreasonable loosening of the constraints of traditional water resource planning in arid areas and the disadvantages of integrated modeling methods this paper analyzed the water use of the syr river and coupled the wefe nexus into the bn the main conclusions are as follows 1 compared with the integrated water resource optimization model which couples various models such as hydrological models ecological models and economic models the bn model coupled with the wefe nexus is relatively simple and low cost and it can address probabilistic uncertainties of causality in the nexus improve the understanding of changes in the nexus during the evolution of complex water resources systems and help decision making based on scenario analysis and a multi criteria assessment under uncertainty 2 during the period of the former soviet union the amount of water inflow to the aral sea was sensitive to the irrigation water used for agricultural development the water storage process of the upstream reservoir construction and the runoff after the collapse of the former soviet union disputes between the two water resource utilization purposes of power generation and irrigation increased the sensitivity of the amount of water inflow to the aral sea to irrigation water which was unreasonably used by downstream countries and the water storage capacity of the upstream reservoir 3 a water optimization plan was proposed in the short term it is necessary to improve the efficiency of salt leaching and irrigation improve the planting structure increase the proportion of food crops and prevent drought hazards in the long term based on the simple prediction in different drip irrigation promotion scenarios if the popularity of advanced drip irrigation technology reaches 50 and the amount of water inflow to the depression is reduced the annual increase in the amount of water flowing into the aral sea will reach 6 4 km3 if this value reaches 80 the annual increase will reach 9 6 km3 at the same time countries in the basin must form effective cooperative mechanisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

5891,the widespread uncertainty regarding future changes in climate socioeconomic conditions and population growth have increased interest in water energy food ecology nexus based frameworks in relation to the analysis of water resources a challenge for modeling the water energy food ecology nexus is how to reduce the multidimensional and codependent uncertainties and measure the complicated casual relationships effectively we propose a methodological solution to the problem and this solution is demonstrated in this case as an extension to the previous water resource optimization framework we coupled the water energy food ecology nexus into the bayesian network which provides a formal representation of the joint probabilistic behavior of the system and the method was applied to water resource use analysis and management in the syr darya river basin a transboundary and endorheic basin that has contributed to the aral sea ecological crisis as a result of unreasonable water use the annual scale data of four periods 1970 1980 1980 1991 1991 2005 and 2005 2015 were introduced into the bayesian network before the disintegration of the soviet union the amount of water inflow into the aral sea was sensitive to increases in irrigation for agricultural development increases in water storage of the upstream reservoirs and stochastic runoff after the disintegration of the soviet union the amount of water inflow into the aral sea was sensitive to the inefficient irrigation water use in the downstream areas of uzbekistan and kazakhstan and the water storage of the reservoir located upstream of kyrgyzstan the change resulted from unresolvable disputes between water use for power generation in the upstream area and irrigation in the downstream area comprehensive scenario analysis shows that in the short term it would be useful to improve the proportion of food crops improve the efficiency of water use in relation to salt leaching and irrigation and prevent drought damage in the long term based on the increased use of advanced drip irrigation technology from 50 to 80 the annual inflow into the aral sea will increase significantly reaching 6 4 km3 and 9 6 km3 respectively and this technology is capable of ameliorating the ecological crisis within the basin keywords bayesian network water energy food ecology nexus syr darya river aral sea 1 introduction the syr darya river is one of two major rivers in the aral sea basin and the other is the amu darya river the syr darya river basin mainly includes upstream kyrgyzstan and downstream uzbekistan and kazakhstan since the 1960s the soviet union has implemented the large scale development of water resources and land resources in the syr darya river basin the construction of water conservancy projects such as reservoirs diversion canals and sizeable agricultural irrigation systems has led to a sharp increase in water diversion and a sharp decrease in the amount of water inflow to the aral sea until the end of the 1980s the area of the aral sea declined by approximately 50 this change caused a tremendous ecological crisis and received international attention before the disintegration of the soviet union the government uniformly allocated and managed water use in the syr darya river basin the upstream water supply guaranteed downstream agricultural water use and the downstream abundant fossil energy compensated for the energy shortage in the upstream area after the disintegration of the soviet union the unified water management mechanism collapsed the new downstream countries no longer freely compensate for the shortage of energy in the upstream countries the new upstream countries must increase the water storage of the reservoir to ensure power generation in winter and reduce the downstream water supply in summer which affects the downstream agricultural production the release of water from the upstream countries in the non growing season often leads to flooding in the downstream countries at the same time population growth and the development of social and economic factors have led to a further increase in the demand for water and competition for water resources has intensified currently the area of the aral sea has decreased by approximately 90 the water quality has deteriorated and soil salinization has led to high levels of farmland abandonment the exposed lakebed has led to an increased frequency of sand and salt storms decreased biodiversity and decreased fishery resources micklin 1988 micklin 2007 to govern the ecological crisis in the syr darya river basin we must follow the concept of sustainable development and establish a harmonious water energy food ecology wefe nexus the socioeconomic development of the syr darya river basin is highly dependent on the water resources the optimal allocation of social and economic water and ecological water is the key to establishing a harmonious nexus after the transformation of the soviet union upstream hydropower development downstream large scale agricultural development and fossil energy mining greatly improved the utilization of resources causing the socioeconomic water use in the basin to be highly correlated with the energy relations and food demand and its structure current research has started to focus on the relationships in the water energy food wef nexus from different perspectives endo et al 2017 smajgl et al 2016 tian et al 2018 however these studies typically neglect the differences between arid and wet regions the ecological adaptation ability of the arid regions is weak and the sensitivity to the change in the wef nexus is much higher than that of the wet regions conway et al 2015 siddiqi and anadon 2011 when applied in arid regions the optimal allocation of water resources lacks a systematic understanding of constraints in the wef nexus for example two stage stochastic programming is a method commonly used in water resource allocation optimization to reduce the risk of uncertainty in decision making huang and loucks 2000 huang et al 2012 in the first stage it is necessary to determine the upper and lower boundaries of the water use departments in the second stage the water resources are allocated under randomly available water intakes according to objective functions that consider benefits and risks however in reality the benefits of water use are limited by complex causal relationships in the wef nexus and such methods loosen the constraints in planning when applied in wet or developed regions the sensitivity of water use to the wef nexus is low and the adverse effects of loosening constraints are often not significant when applied in arid and underdeveloped regions the water sensitivity to the wef nexus is high and looser constraints may result in optimized but impractical solutions to balance the ecological vulnerability of arid regions with the wef nexus this paper analyzed and optimized the water resource use in the basin based on the defined wefe nexus with ecology included as an essential component currently most studies on the interaction and evolution processes of society water and ecosystems use an integrated modeling method bazilian et al 2011 this method directly integrates water system models socioeconomic models and ecological models such integrated models include the clew model howells et al 2013 the wef tool 2 0 daher and mohtar 2015 and the welf model ringler et al 2013 when integrating models containing knowledge from different fields there is often a problem in that the model structure and the spatiotemporal scale do not match additionally integrated models require many observations for calibration in addition the wefe nexus is greatly affected by the stability of social development but we have often ignored the differences in the social development of different study areas when studying the wefe nexus in developed countries the relationships of variables are often stable due to stable social and economic conditions a low level of dependence on natural resources and a strong ability to acquire natural resources when studying the wefe nexus in developed countries there are many contradictions due to unstable social development such as a scarcity of or weak access to natural resources high level of dependence on natural resources weak sustainable development concepts and prominent ecological and environmental problems these conditions lead to dramatic changes poor stability and high uncertainty of the nexus in addition these conditions may explain why these areas often become hotspots for the study of the wef nexus bazilian et al 2011 kahrl and roland holst 2008 siddiqi and anadon 2011 monitoring and observational data of the hydrological systems ecological processes energy and food production in the syr darya river basin are incomplete because the disintegration of the soviet union made the original unified observations unsustainable additionally the water use system and the wefe nexus in this basin rely heavily on highly stochastic river runoff missing data and high system uncertainty imposes great difficulties regarding the application of integrated modeling methods in addition the development of water and land resources in the basin were affected by the prosperity and disintegration of the soviet union this situation differs from the slow growth of other developed countries and the rapid growth of developing countries in terms of social development trends the power of the government has changed from being concentrated to dispersed representing a situation that is unique among major economies in the past 50 years which differs from other studies of water systems there is a consensus that the water use patterns and the wefe nexus in the syr darya river basin have varied greatly in different historical periods bayesian network bn is a method used in uncertainty knowledge representation and reasoning bn is based on graph theory and the bayesian probability formula the weight of the probability measure is used to describe the causal relationship between variables and the conditional probability is used to diagnose and predict the bn method can combine prior knowledge to analyze causal relationships and reduce the demand of measured data moreover the probability distribution of variables can be used instead of the determined value to reduce the uncertainty of causality in the system analysis therefore in the wefe nexus analysis bn may have advantages in characterizing causality simulation uncertainty and reducing data requirements compared to the integrated model method and solving the problem of loosening the constraints found in traditional water resources optimization caused by a lack of consideration of causality restrictions current studies have used bn as a support tool for water resource management and decision making these studies have focused on the management of water quality aguilera et al 2013 death et al 2015 hines and landis 2014 nash and hannah 2011 groundwater fienen et al 2013 giordano et al 2013 irrigation water mamitimin et al 2015 quinn et al 2013 water system design taner et al 2019 and water supply hunter et al 2011 pagano et al 2014 and they have achieved good results reflecting their ability to express knowledge of systematic uncertainties the bn method provides a useful new solution for water resource management and it has a good development prospect when combined with other models planning methods and scenario analysis phan et al 2016 in addition studies have begun to combine bns with geographic information johnson et al 2012 therefore coupling the wefe nexus into a bn may be feasible by combining the bn with the geographic information and directed graph structures that coexist in each component of the nexus by coupling the wefe nexus into the bn this paper analyzes the water use status of the syr darya river basin in the past 50 years and provides knowledge support for water resource management and decision making the aims of this paper are as follows 1 to determine the structure of the bn based on the cognition of causal relations in the weef nexus in the basin based on the characteristics of water use and the principal contradictions 2 to construct the bn to analyze the water use status and evaluate the performance and applicability of the bn 3 to analyze the impacts of water use patterns on the amount of water inflow to the aral sea in different historical periods of the past 50 years and 4 to propose a water use optimization plan 2 study area and data 2 1 study area according to national boundaries and significant regional differences in the production and consumption of water energy and food the toktogul hydropower station is used as the dividing point between the upstream and downstream regions in this paper fig 1 in this paper the upstream region includes kyrgyzstan and the downstream region includes uzbekistan s jizzakh tashkent namangan andijan ferghana and syrdarya and kazakhstan s kyzylorda and chimkent 2 2 data this research used data collected on the state scale regarding the water resources energy industry agriculture and ecology of the syr darya river basin from 1970 to 2015 table 1 although the aral sea split into the south aral sea and the north aral sea in the 1980s and the syr darya river flows into the north aral sea the south and north aral sea designations are still relevant the volume and ecology of the south aral sea are potentially affected by the water supply of the syr darya river sand and salt storms in the south aral sea also affect the downstream areas of the syr darya river basin therefore in this paper the ecological data of the aral sea cover the entire aral sea data of the downstream area are processed by summing those for the six states of uzbekistan and two states of kazakhstan or by weighted averages based on the population proportion some of the socioeconomic data of 1987 1992 and 2010 2015 are missing the water quality and soil salinity sampling included in the ecological data are at time points and linear interpolation is used to fill the missing data ultimately the spatial and temporal scales of all data are processed uniformly at the scale of the upstream area and downstream area and at the annual scale as the spatiotemporal scale used in this paper is large the influence of the difference in one year and the local spatial heterogeneity are small thus the collected data meet the accuracy requirement 3 concept and method 3 1 wefe nexus in the syr darya river basin according to the management methods in different social backgrounds we divided the wefe nexus of the syr darya river basin into four stages fig 2 1 rapid agricultural development 1960 1980 during this period the former soviet union carried out large scale land reclamation in the syr darya river basin due to the massive demand in the entire soviet union cotton which has a high water consumption was planted in large quantities and the primary irrigation type was flood irrigation water conservancy projects such as reservoirs and main canals were constructed but the leakage of these projects was high these projects consumed a large amount of water during the diversion process and resulted in lower agricultural water use efficiency the amount of water inflow to the aral sea decreased and the ecological crisis appeared in the aral sea cai et al 2003 2 the development of water and land resources reached a peak and then became relatively stable 1980 1991 during this period the scale of agricultural development in the syr darya river basin reached a peak and then became relatively stable the volume of the aral sea further decreased the demand for downstream agricultural water was prioritized and the free downstream fossil energy compensated for the shortage in the upstream power generation a large amount of agricultural irrigation water flowed to salty depressions at the outer edge of the oasis the water inflow to the aral sea from the syr darya river was extremely low cai et al 2003 3 economic development stagnation 1991 2005 after the disintegration of the former soviet union the political situation was unstable and the social economies of the newly independent central asian countries stagnated or even decreased due to the declining demand for agricultural products the amount of cotton production was much larger than the actual demand after the disintegration and a large amount of cultivated land was abandoned reducing the area of agricultural land due to the pressure on food security caused by population growth the proportion of the area planted with food crops gradually increased at the same time the downstream region no longer provided fossil energy freely to the upstream region this scenario has resulted in an energy crisis in upstream kyrgyzstan and a large part of the population s electricity demand cannot be met especially in its cold winters to increase winter power generation the water storage of the upstream reservoir has increased in summer thus the amount of water supplied to the downstream countries during summer has decreased accordingly which led to a shortage in the downstream agricultural water in summer and a higher risk of flooding in winter in addition long term flood irrigation and poor drainage capacity has caused decreased fertility and severe soil salinization in the downstream farmlands a large amount of pesticides organic matter and salt has entered the syr darya river resulting in the deterioration of the downstream water quality in 1993 the area of the aral sea had decreased by 50 compared with that in the 1960s by 2004 the area of the aral sea was only 25 that of the original micklin 2007 the former aral sea area was exposed the frequency of sand and salt storm events increased and the health of residents was threatened by the storms thus the aral sea crisis worsened 4 the stage of economic recovery 2005 2015 in the newly independent century the economic development of kazakhstan which is rich in fossil energy and has a relatively good industrial base has increased due to the privatization of agricultural land and the improvement of agricultural product export prospects the enthusiasm for downstream agricultural production has increased in addition advances in farming techniques have increased agricultural productivity to protect the ecology of the aral sea in its territory downstream kazakhstan built a dam in the north aral sea and the dam was completed in 2005 the dam keeps the aral sea split into two parts the water surface of the north aral sea began to expand and the water level began to rise however this situation indirectly caused accelerated drying in the south aral sea micklin 2007 in the middle stream area large reservoirs were built for flood control and irrigation adjustment and kazakhstan s disadvantages in terms of water competition were alleviated however with the increase in population and the potential pressure from climate change water use conflicts have tended to escalate in approximately 2010 the area of the aral sea decreased to 10 of that in the 1960s and the ecological crisis worsened 3 2 structure of bn based on the wefe nexus the bn is a directed acyclic graph model the nodes of the bn represent the probability distribution of variables the directed edges between the nodes represent the causal relationship based on the conditional probability table and the bayesian conditional probability formula is used to connect the nodes into a network pearl 1988 by combining prior knowledge and observational data we obtain the conditional probability distribution of the network nodes when adjusting the probability distribution of some nodes the bn calculates the posterior conditional probability distribution of the other nodes to implement a prediction or diagnostic analysis the em expectation maximization algorithm is used to iteratively calculate the expectation and maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters and implement the optimization process for the missing data neal and hinton 1998 in this paper we use netica software to construct a bn and this software is powerful easy to use and widely used in bn modeling research uusitalo 2007 we couple the wefe nexus to the bn because both are often represented with directed graphs as a relatively mature tool the bn presents less modifiable and adjustable instructions than the nexus as an abstract concept therefore we attempt to construct a joint distribution between the nexus variables states to match the bn this paper coupled the wefe nexus into a bn for water use analysis and management in the syr darya river basin and it included the relevant geographic information we proposed a general model for combining the nexus and geographic information to generate variables that are suitable at the scale of the bn fig 3 obviously the use of geographic information cannot be at a grid scale of several kilometers and developing such a small scale bn is difficult because the causal relationship in the wefe nexus between such small scale grids can hardly be determined based on expert knowledge independently however deterministic causal relationships at regional scales are often known such as upstream reservoir operations that affect downstream farmland irrigation another reason is that the results and conclusions at country or regional scales are often the item of interest and are required for transboundary water resources management the coupled model consists of the following four modules 1 water resources module this module reflects climate change and its impact on water resource changes including temperature precipitation glaciers and permanent snow changes and their impacts on runoff and is used to represent the changes in incoming water volume from mountains and the water retention capacity in downstream areas 2 upstream area module this module reflects the local water energy nexus including the upstream hydropower generation energy imports and winter and summer water releases from reservoirs to explain the contradiction in seasonal water use between upstream power generation and downstream agriculture 3 downstream area module this module reflects the local water food nexus the downstream economic scale and water use scale account for a relatively high proportion in the basin thus refining the changes in water use in different industries such as downstream planting animal husbandry and industry 4 ecology of the aral sea this module reflects the ecological impact of the local wef nexus and measures the impacts of unreasonable water use and food production on soil salinization water shrinkage in the aral sea dust weather biodiversity and resident health effects next we refined the model structure at the variable scale fig 4 and the specific variables are included 3 3 parameterization and evaluation method of the constructed bn 3 3 1 parameterization method of the bn to reduce the computational complexity of the joint probability distribution we discretized the dataset table 2 the different numbers of intervals and segmentation points in the discretization process may have an impact on the performance of the model and the prior knowledge obtained from expert knowledge therefore in this paper the discretization of data is synchronized with the setting of prior knowledge and expert knowledge and the actual data distribution guided the discretization procedure we used the collected information at two time scales first the annual scale reflects the annual variation in the variables such as the uncertainty of the annual runoff through nexus propagation affecting the water use of the basin the second scale is the stage scale of the social and economic background divided into approximately 10 15 years and the specific sections are 1970 1980 1980 1991 1991 2005 and 2005 2015 this paper used four periods to distinguish different socioeconomic backgrounds and input annual scale data in each period to implement parameterization 3 3 2 evaluation method of the bn we mainly evaluate the bn performance from two perspectives first we evaluate how well the constructed model matches the actual knowledge based on a sensitivity analysis second we evaluate the accuracy of the bn predictions and inferences by calculating a confusion matrix sensitivity analysis is widely considered to be more effective in assessing model performance cain et al 2001 kragt et al 2009 marcot 2012 marcot et al 2006 pollino and henderson 2010 poppenborg and koellner 2014 therefore this paper uses sensitivity analysis to test the sensitivity of the output variables in the bn to the input variables mutual information mi based on entropy reduction and variance of belief vb based on variance reduction are often used as sensitivity analysis indicators for bn evaluation barton et al 2008 pearl 1988 mi and vb are calculated as follows 1 mi h q h q f q f p q f log 2 p q f p q p f 2 v b v q v q f q p q x q q p q x q 2 q p q f x q q p q f x q 2 where h is the entropy v is the variance q is the target variable f is some other variable and q and f represent the state of q and f respectively xq is the actual value corresponding to state q for the convenience of comparison the mi and vb are normalized to 0 100 respectively in this paper we choose downstream water use as the target node for the accuracy assessment and calculate its confusion matrix the calculation of the confusion matrix is based on the original data set that has been divided by the k fold method k fold cross validation was often used to calculate the confusion matrix evaluation accuracy and compare the state of the maximum posterior probability with the actual state value marcot 2012 k fold cross validation divided the training set into k sample subsets we retained a single subsample as the test model data and used the other k 1 subsets for training the cross validation was repeated k times and we recorded the confusion matrix calculated by k times then the obtained k confusion matrices were averaged to evaluate the performance of the prediction 3 4 scenario analysis optimization and multi criteria assessment based on a constructed bn using the evaluated bn it is convenient to analyze the relative likelihood of status changes in the target variables under different levels of runoff and management scenarios by specifying the state of the input variable or adjusting its probability distribution the change in the state probability of the output variable can be predicted this paper aims to optimize the wefe nexus ensure the living standards of residents and enhance the degree of cooperation in the region and analyze the level of benefit of the target variables in different scenarios although a scenario variable may be related to other scenario variables the sum of the effects of all scenario variables cain et al 2001 can be used to characterize the combined effect therefore this paper analyzed each scenario variable as a change in the target variable at the time of the scenario in addition to directly using interactive and constructed bn applications for management and decision making the sampling of the bn can be combined with further dynamic optimization objectives and help assess uncertainty and decision making traditional constraint optimization methods often use adjustable weights to integrate multiple targets or use multi objective optimization to obtain pareto solutions in this paper we do not set the weight between the criteria and the optimization process can be considered a multi objective problem a pareto surface can be obtained and could be considered a collection of solutions of multi objective optimization however little attention has been paid to the robustness of the solutions under high uncertainty therefore we focus on the uncertainty in optimization and decision making rather than solving a multi objective optimization problem netica can be used to generate a series of random cases whose probability distribution matches that of a particular bn which is known as sampling this series of cases sampled based on the joint probability distribution can reflect the causality between variables and can be considered restrictive and realistic constraints in water resources optimization and these constraints are different from the constraints usually represented by inequality equations in traditional optimization programs under the different water availability conditions three comprehensive criteria were used to evaluate the feasibility of optimization reliability rel total net benefit tb and degree of cooperation dc rel is defined as the weighted sum of the averages of the sustainable use of cultivated land and ecological water calculated as 3 rel β ha a 1 β weco tweco where ha is the total planted area a is the total available area weco is the actual ecological water use tweco is the target ecological water use and 0 β 1 is a weight assigned to balance these two aspects tb is defined as the sum of different types of benefits including agricultural production hydropower profit and ecological benefit dc is defined as the level of cooperation reflecting the balance of the main benefits obtained by the upstream and downstream regions they are calculated as follows 4 tb p a a p p h h p p e e b 5 dc h p a p where hp is the upstream hydropower profit eb is the ecological net benefit and ap is the downstream agricultural production p a p h and p e are the unit prices that are used to adjust the weight in the total benefit and can be determined by stakeholders and decision makers for the convenience of comparison the values of the three criteria were linearly normalized to 0 1 based on the maximum and minimum values in this paper 4 results 4 1 model parameterization and evaluation 4 1 1 model parameterization combined with expert knowledge and observational data we parameterized the bn fig 5 in this paper we selected six nodes that reflected the importance of each part of the wefe nexus as target variables for sensitivity analysis the results show that mi and vb have a consistent trend the larger the mi is the larger the vb is the higher the sensitivity of the target variable is and the greater the intermediate variable between the node and the target node is and the lower the impact on the target node is 4 1 2 model evaluation the sensitivity analysis results based on this evaluation method were consistent with the factual evidence fig 6 which verified the applicability of the model using the node inflow to the aral sea as an example the downstream agricultural water use the upstream reservoir water storage and the downstream inflow to depression were consistent with the main types of actual water resource utilization in particular downstream agricultural water consumption had a significant impact on the amount of water inflow to the aral sea which was consistent with existing knowledge micklin 2007 however due to the low representativeness of the data and the significant influence of unconsidered factors some nodes were not sensitive to other nodes reflecting weak causality for example the node downstream life expectancy was affected by negative ecological feedback but it was more affected by factors such as medical conditions not considered to assess the predictive power of the model for water use netica was used to calculate the confusion matrix for the node downstream water use using five cross validations for the 2005 2015 data set table 3 the network had an overall accuracy of 70 when predicting downstream water consumption showing high accuracy and absolute reliability in predicting future downstream water use 4 2 characteristics of water use patterns in the syr darya river basin in the past 50 years and contributions of major influencing factors the water use patterns in the syr darya river basin were significantly different in different historical stages quantitative knowledge can help us deepen our understanding of changes in water use patterns however expert knowledge about historical water use patterns is often qualitative a quantitative sensitivity analysis can be used to evaluate the bn and it can also help us generate quantitative insights into the contributions of major factors that influence historical water use patterns when reliable expert knowledge is lacking we analyzed the sensitivity of the node water inflow to the aral sea at different historical stages fig 7 by focusing on quantifying the sensitivity change of this node to other variables in each historical stage because this node is highly correlated with water use nodes because their child node and can be linked to ecological indicators before the disintegration of the former soviet union the amount of water inflow to the aral sea was more sensitive to runoff upstream reservoir storage downstream irrigation quotas and downstream agricultural water use after the disintegration of the former soviet union the amount of water flowing into the aral sea was more sensitive to factors such as runoff inflowing water summer upstream reservoir water releases upstream reservoir water storage and downstream agricultural water use and showed an increasing trend in general the sensitivity of the amount of water inflow to the aral sea to the amount of water inflow to the depression and the amount of water released from the upstream reservoir increased during the whole period the sensitivity to runoff decreased and the sensitivity to downstream agricultural water first decreased and then increased the above characteristics indicate that the newly built reservoir enhances the ability to adapt to changes in runoff after the disintegration of the former soviet union the competition for water rights in central asian countries intensified increasing the amount of water flowing into the depression which seriously affected the amount of water inflow to the aral sea these results also show that downstream countries have unreasonable uses of return water for irrigation and surplus water due to the competition for water resources the consideration of ecological water use in the aral sea has been ignored although the new wetlands and lakes formed by the water flowing into the depression have specific ecological service value this process is not conducive to alleviating the ecological crisis in the aral sea the upstream winter fossil energy gap causes the impact of the upstream water release of the reservoir on the amount of water inflow to the aral sea more significant and is higher than the increase in the amount of natural gas imported from the downstream region this pattern is related to the upstream region s attempt to increase hydropower to compensate for the more significant energy gap caused by the increase in population upstream hydropower no longer attempts to rely on downstream fossil energy rather the upstream area has increased hydropower generation to ensure its energy security and has even become an energy exporter micklin 2007 4 3 scenario analysis and optimization of water resources use compared with the current situation reducing the amount of water inflow to the depression is the most effective 23 5 method table 4 for increasing the amount of water in the aral sea and there is much room for improvement in the management of salt leaching returned irrigation water and surplus water therefore it is necessary to improve the efficiency of salt leaching and irrigation such as increasing the laying of salt drainage pipes and reforming the aging and leaking water diversion canals while enhancing the degree of regional cooperation and the rational use of surplus water increasing the area of downstream food crops and improving the planting structure will help increase grain production 13 6 ensure food security and reduce the proportion of cotton that consumes high amounts of water the aggravation of drought has had a significant negative impact on the aral sea and downstream ecosystems affecting desertification 9 6 soil salinization 5 5 sand dust storms 3 7 and water quality 1 3 therefore it is necessary to enhance the storage and utilization of surplus water to prevent drought damage in summary this paper proposes an optimized water use plan for the syr darya river basin and this plan includes improving salt leaching and irrigation water use efficiency improving planting structure increasing the proportion of food crops and preventing drought hazards 4 4 multi criteria assessment in decision making under changes in the uncertainty of dynamic responses to the bn operations to explore the scalability of a bn in management decision making based on comprehensive indicators and to understand the effects on water use management of constraints in bn a multi criteria assessment was applied based on the constructed bn and scenario analysis results under various runoff conditions based on the monte carlo simulation of the bn 100 cases were generated and these cases can also be considered as 100 samples based on the joint probability of a bn the high dimensional joint probability represented by the distribution of cases generated by the bn helps decision makers understand the uncertainty of the system quickly fig 8 compared with the constraint of the not compiled bn as not considering the joint probabilistic behavior in the system the set of decision cases with constraints of the compiled bn is more realistic and the uncertainty is reduced with a decrease in chaos after the decision nodes were determined the distribution of cases changed under medium and high runoff conditions the dispersion of cases was reduced and the uncertainty in decision making was reduced to a manageable range however under low runoff conditions the effect of optimized decision making was weak as the dispersion of cases changed insignificantly this result means that reducing water inflow to depressions and increasing downstream grain crop areas may be significantly effective under only medium and high runoff conditions 5 discussion compared with previous studies on the relationship between components of the wef nexus this paper distinguishes between arid and humid regions and focuses more on the fragile ecology of arid regions through the use of the wefe nexus compared with the integrated modeling method which is focused on uncertainty in the water use system and its propagation characteristics in the causal link network the bn reduced the model complexity and the modeling cost with joint probability compared with the traditional optimization method of water resource use coupling the wefe nexus into the bn strengthened the causal relational constraint of the water resources system additionally the analysis of the differences in water use patterns in different historical periods reflected the large impact of social background changes on water use and enhanced the understanding of causality in the evolution of complex human water systems at the same time this paper discussed the deficiencies and improvements in this study from the following two aspects 5 1 capability of bayesian network modeling the bn can effectively simulate the complex causal relationships in the water resources system in the syr darya river basin the form of a probability distribution can effectively express the uncertainty of the variables sensitivity analysis can distinguish the differences in different social historical backgrounds the bn analysis in this paper achieved good results which were related to the more accurate prior knowledge and the sufficient amount of data for key nodes due to the international community s concern for the aral sea ecological disaster a large number of researchers are interested and the knowledge and data support generated from this concern improved the construction and parameterization of this paper because of the differences in the modeling process the type of data used and the characterization of the relationship in the wefe nexus it was difficult to directly compare the integrated modeling method and the bn modeling based on quantitative indicators with the further increase and refinement of network nodes the bn may gradually approach the fine scale structure of the process based integrated models and face the problem of how to combine multi domain expert knowledge to support the network and data limits therefore studying the optimal scale of the bn in water resources management may be the next step and it is necessary to balance the modeling effect and the cost of the model which depends on its complexity 5 2 prospects for water resource utilization optimization the climate population and socioeconomic development of the future basin may show new and significant changes and the lack of predictive ability of new changes in the bond will limit the network s predictive ability at the same time bns have difficulty assessing factors that have not occurred such as the promotion of advanced drip irrigation systems the results of the scenario analysis indicate that reducing the amount of downstream inflow water is an effective measure to increase the amount of water in the aral sea while the amount of water inflow into the depression comes from surplus water and irrigation return water the almaty agreement which was formed after the disintegration of the soviet union was mainly determined according to the proportion of water used before the disintegration of the soviet union however the amount of water inflow to the aral sea was meager at this time so this program lacked consideration of the ecological water use in the aral sea an important basis for the maintenance of the downstream high load agricultural production is sufficient central agricultural subsidies and high demand for agricultural products under the planned economic system of the soviet union after the disintegration of the soviet union the scale of agricultural production decreased in the downstream countries and the water demand decreased however the surplus water flowed into the depression and not into the aral sea however reducing water inflow to depressions may not be significantly effective under low runoff according to the results of the multi criteria assessment and it is a short term plan when considering long term climate change and population growth we should try to propose a long term optimization plan such as the use of water saving irrigation technology which is not considered in the bn gradually promoting the use of drip irrigation systems can reduce the level of dependence on irrigation improve the irrigation efficiency and reduce a large amount of irrigation return water that inflows into the depression at present the average irrigation quota in the syr darya river basin is approximately 10 000 m3 ha in xinjiang province of china which is also in the arid region of central asia and has similar potential evaporation the average irrigation quota for drip irrigation is less than 5000 m3 ha based on the simple prediction of different drip irrigation promotion scenarios if the future penetration rate of drip irrigation in the syr darya river basin reaches 50 it would save approximately 8 km3 of ecological water for the aral sea every year if 80 of the saved agricultural water flowed into the aral sea the amount of water added to the aral sea would reach 6 4 km3 if the penetration rate increased to 80 each year approximately 12 km3 of agricultural water would be saved for the aral sea basin if 80 of the saved agricultural water flowed into the aral sea the annual increase of the aral sea into the lake would reach 9 6 km3 or more which would alleviate the ecological crisis in the aral sea in the syr darya river basin regional cooperation is crucial central asian countries had a high level of coordinated resource allocation and development under the unified jurisdiction of the soviet union after the disintegration of the soviet union there were shortcomings in the social and economic development of central asian countries the change in regional geography and the degree of separation of political power had a considerable impact on the spatial pattern of water use due to the pressure caused by population growth in the basin it is not realistic that the aral sea crisis will be solved only by the countries in the basin in terms of the overall sustainable development of the basin in addition to the internal coordination and optimization such as the promotion of water saving irrigation and regional cooperation external cooperation is essential and should be focused on the contradictions in the wefe nexus for example strengthening cooperation with russia an external energy country and china an industrial country is expected to gradually achieve a more stable and harmonious nexus by enhancing hydropower utilization improving irrigation system efficiency and promoting industrial structure upgrades the premise is that these countries must form effective cooperation mechanisms through specific organizations 6 conclusions because of the unreasonable loosening of the constraints of traditional water resource planning in arid areas and the disadvantages of integrated modeling methods this paper analyzed the water use of the syr river and coupled the wefe nexus into the bn the main conclusions are as follows 1 compared with the integrated water resource optimization model which couples various models such as hydrological models ecological models and economic models the bn model coupled with the wefe nexus is relatively simple and low cost and it can address probabilistic uncertainties of causality in the nexus improve the understanding of changes in the nexus during the evolution of complex water resources systems and help decision making based on scenario analysis and a multi criteria assessment under uncertainty 2 during the period of the former soviet union the amount of water inflow to the aral sea was sensitive to the irrigation water used for agricultural development the water storage process of the upstream reservoir construction and the runoff after the collapse of the former soviet union disputes between the two water resource utilization purposes of power generation and irrigation increased the sensitivity of the amount of water inflow to the aral sea to irrigation water which was unreasonably used by downstream countries and the water storage capacity of the upstream reservoir 3 a water optimization plan was proposed in the short term it is necessary to improve the efficiency of salt leaching and irrigation improve the planting structure increase the proportion of food crops and prevent drought hazards in the long term based on the simple prediction in different drip irrigation promotion scenarios if the popularity of advanced drip irrigation technology reaches 50 and the amount of water inflow to the depression is reduced the annual increase in the amount of water flowing into the aral sea will reach 6 4 km3 if this value reaches 80 the annual increase will reach 9 6 km3 at the same time countries in the basin

5892,lakes in arid regions are ecologically valuable yet highly fragile due to intense evaporation to provide an extra water supply for maintaining water balance in lakes the ecological replenishment water program erwp in northwest china has significantly changed the hydrological and hydrochemical conditions for these lakes descriptive statistics and water and mass balances together with hydrogeochemical modeling were used in this study to gain an understanding of the impacts of water replenishment irrigation and drainage water on evolution for shahu lake a virtual sample was introduced in netpath hydrogeochemical modeling to compute the net chemical reactions in the lake water variations in tds indicated that the lake evolved to be saline during 2004 2012 stage i and then tended to be fresh during 2013 2014 stage ii results highlighted that groundwater outflow and chemical reactions were the overriding factors controlling chemical evolution in the lake system which greatly depend on the replenishment activities the salinity reduction from the virtual samples to the final samples were attributed to the precipitation of calcite and dolomite dissolution of gypsum na k and na ca exchange and the co2 degassing in the lake system at an annual scale of 0 11 g l in stage i and 0 15 g l in stage ii the quality of replenishment water was as important as quantity for rehabilitating lakes as it significantly determines the occurrence of chemical reactions in lake water findings from this paper can provide insight into the evolution of arid lakes in response to replenishment activities and can help contribute to better management of a valuable and fragile resource keywords lake salinity replenishment activities groundwater lake interaction chemical reactions virtual sample 1 introduction climate change and human activities pose great threats to global lake systems in which people rely on the natural environment for their livelihoods ballatore and muhandiki 2002 taking the fragile environment into consideration the situation is particularly acute in arid regions chen et al 2019 chen et al 2018 huo and li 2013 micklin 2007 su et al 2016 williams 2000 many lakes of great ecological historical and cultural values in arid northwest china are under threat of vanishing where surface inflow to the lakes has decreased significantly fang et al 2018 qian et al 2013 desiccation of lop nor lake is one of the most conspicuous examples guo et al 2015 ma et al 2010 in this regard the authorities intervened to prevent the situation from worsening by altering the natural hydrology of lakes the ecological replenishment water program erwp has been created to increase the flow of water into lakes for rehabilitation chen and qian 2017 jiang et al 2018 pang et al 2017 qiao et al 2007 tang 2009 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 table 1 however there are no generally accepted management practices for the replenishment of lakes in different hydrogeological settings changes in lake hydrology and water chemistry in response to water replenishment both quantity and quality have not been well understood shahu lake the largest lake in ningxia northwest china holds the highest level of tourism attraction 5a class owing to its unique desert oasis scenery li et al 2017 wu et al 2017 nearly 21 million visitors traveled to the lake in 2016 ningxia statistical bureau 2017 the lake provides economic tangible and intangible benefits to the quality of life for three million people who live in the surrounding towns and cities as a terminal lake in an arid environment it is typically sensitive to the local evaporation effects and replenishment activities since 2000 the addition of water diverted from drainage ditches before 2013 and the yellow river till now have helped to maintain a relatively constant lake water level however salinity shown here as total dissolved solids tds in the lake water unexpectedly increased at an alarming rate 0 23 g l per year which varied from 2 1 g l in 2004 to 4 4 g l in 2013 the precise cause of these changes is still unknown shahu lake evolved into a saline lake 3g l by hammer 1986 unfortunately a high rate of evaporation in these arid regions causes significant salt accumulation in lakes the growing level of salinity is compounded by mass loading from dissolved salts in the additional inflow and may have detrimental effects on the survival of a large range of aquatic organisms and plants in and around the lakes gutierrez et al 2018 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 for terminal lakes with no surface outlet like shahu lake a combination of processes involving evaporation groundwater lake exchange various types of chemical reactions and even water replenishment are inextricably intertwined in the systems gill et al 2013 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 zlotnik et al 2009 these processes result in nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the chemical components in the lake water scientific knowledge concerning the variability of groundwater exchange fluxes to and from lakes and the associated effects of mass transfer has grown rapidly this has been studied using stable isotopes and or conservative chemical tracers such as chloride montalván et al 2017 négrel et al 2003 sacks et al 2014 villegas et al 2018 unfortunately effective management policies have lagged in most cases lake groundwater interactions the importance of mineral dissolution weathering redox reactions and cation exchange in lakes have not been fully considered by lake management policy makers ali and khairy 2016 ballatore and muhandiki 2002 brkić et al 2016 burns et al 2001 huo et al 2016 rosenberry et al 2015 although simulations can be helpful to quantify intertwined processes a lack of observed data in most regions can greatly hinder model development as a result it remains uncertain how hydrological and hydrochemical processes should be quantified during the replenishment periods even though the replenishment water on lake evolution has been widely reported faced with impending severe water crises there is an urgent need to guide lake managers as they attempt to achieve sustainable development by providing them with a deep understanding of the causes and effects of replenishing activities on the hydrochemical behaviors of lake water in this study we carried out hydrochemical analyses of water samples from the shahu lake region we examined the groundwater and replenishment water by using correlation analysis calculation of water and mass balances and hydrogeochemical modeling this study aimed to determine water chemistry changes in response to different replenishing activities and ascertain the contributions of lake groundwater interactions and chemical reactions on lake chemical evolution this is the first systematic study to evaluate the effects of water replenishment on lake rehabilitation in an arid region and the results can be valuable in guiding future lake sustainable management 2 study area quaternary deposits have been extensively studied on the yinchuan plain of ningxia chen et al 2018 qian et al 2012 qian et al 2013 the multi layer aquifer system is composed of in order of depth a phreatic aquifer an upper confined aquifer and a lower confined aquifer these are primarily composed of fine sand silty fine sand and clayed sand quartz and plagioclase are the major minerals in the quaternary strata in the middle reaches of the yellow river the plain was provided with rich water resources fed by the river for agriculture the irrigation systems date back more than 2000 years and are still benefiting people in the plain it is praised as south china beyond the great wall as hundreds of lakes scattered across the plain chen et al 2016 qian et al 2013 shahu lake 38 39 29 97 n 104 04 58 66 e is the largest lake in ningxia with a water surface area of 13 96 km2 and is located in the low lying northern part of the plain at an elevation of 1096 1100 m above the sea level fig 1 it is shallow with a mean water depth of about 2 2 m the lake has no natural surface runoff and outflow in this area groundwater in the phreatic aquifer 15 25 m thickness generally flows from southwest to northeast fig 1 highly permeable sediments and shallow water depths usually less than 3 m promote a direct relationship between the lake and the groundwater system chen and qian 2017 this is the main cause for the existence of the lake in an arid region for several hundred years meteorological data 2001 2016 from the huinong meteorological station near shahu lake showed that the annual average temperature was 9 6 c with a maximum temperature of 30 8 c recorded in july the annual average precipitation in the study area was 175 mm fig 2 a with 75 of the rainfall falling from june to august evaporation observed during the same time period has an average of 1446 mm that is eight times greater than precipitation fig 2b with the maximum rates observed during the summer months may to september the nature of the arid environment combined with lake shahu s status as a terminal lake makes the added replenishment water and evaporation from lake surface dominate the gains and losses in the water budgets chen and qian 2017 the issue of how limited water is allocated among users is rising on policy agendas especially in arid environments bui et al 2019 gejl et al 2019 nethononda et al 2019 reynolds et al 2007 shaad and burlando 2018 and shahu lake is no exception the water replenishment history of shahu lake can be divided into two stages due to the different water sources the lake has received irrigation water from the yellow river through the dongganqu channel since 2000 to promote sustainability fig 1 drainage water a compound mixture of irrigation return flow groundwater and domestic and industrial sewage qian et al 2013 was also discharged into the lake via the no 3 drain and aiyihe in the absence of sufficient supply from irrigation water fig 1 both irrigation water and drainage water were the main water sources in the first stage which ended in early 2013 after 2013 the lake was recharged solely by irrigation water as lake managers concentrated on the ecological benefits of water transfer 3 material and methods 3 1 sample collection in this study a total of 57 lake water samples were collected from three different sampling sites during 2012 2014 fig 1 in order to describe the water quality conditions 23 groundwater samples and three surface water samples from the channel and drains were collected the groundwater samples were taken from domestic use wells ranging in depth from 5 to 20 m before sampling the wells were pumped for 3 5 min to remove any groundwater stored in the well itself in order to ensure that all samples represent groundwater and not water from the well bore water temperature ec and ph were continuously monitored during the purging using a portable water testing kit ddb 350 leici company of china and sample collection did not start until these parameters were stable the 1000 ml polyethylene collection bottles were thoroughly rinsed 2 3 times with water to be sampled and samples were separated into two aliquots one aliquot was taken for cation analysis and was acidified so that the ph 2 using 6 m ultrapure hno3 due to the problems of absorption or precipitation the other aliquot was stored as collected in the polyethylene bottles for anion determination all the samples were sealed and stored in the laboratory at 4 c prior to analysis water samples were analyzed for k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 concentrations at the environmental monitoring station lab in shizuishan city ningxia china na and k were analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry ca2 and mg2 were measured using edta titration cl and so4 2 were measured by ion chromatography and hco3 and co3 2 were analyzed using the potentiometric titrimetric method tds values of water samples were obtained based on the analysis data in the lab proper quality control procedures were followed to ascertain the quality of the results the calculated ionic error balance did not exceed 5 in previous research conducted by qian et al 2013 the isotopic and chemical characteristics of 17 lakes in yinchuan plain were determined from the previous work the data from 2004 relevant to shahu lake were referenced for the present study additional hydrochemical data collected from the irrigation water 12 samples collected monthly during 2013 and drainage water 9 samples collected in 2004 and 2010 by the ningxia environmental protection agency were also used for better understanding water quality variation in the lake system furthermore two soil samples were collected near the lake remove the roots of plants with a trowel and take the samples from 20 to 25 cm below the surface ground the samples were thoroughly mixed and preserved by freeze drying for further x ray diffraction xrd analysis the xrd working condition included tube voltage of 40 kv tube current of 20 ma and scans a range of 2 70 with a rate of 10 min in accordance with national bureau of standards nbs of the united states the obtained curves were retrieved in the joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds of x ray diffraction xrd to get the corresponding standard atlas jin et al 2019 3 2 water budget calculations the water balance equation for shahu lake was represented as 1 δ v r i r d p g w i e g w o where v represents the change in water storage for the lake ri represents the replenishment inflow from irrigation water yellow river water rd represents the replenishment inflow from drainage water p is the precipitation e is the evaporation from the lake surface gwi represents the groundwater inflow into the lake and gwo represents the groundwater outflow from the lake into the aquifer human intervention and natural factors maintained lake levels with nominal change over time because of this the model can be simplified to a steady state situation in this study terms such as precipitation evaporation and replenishment water recharge are measurable quantities while groundwater seepage from and into the lake are unknown values the direct precipitation input to the lake p and evaporation from the lake surface e were obtained for each water year using data from the huinong meteorological station located 5 km from the lake data detailing the volume of replenishment water was collected from the local water conservancy bureau ningxia water conservancy bureau 2010 2017 villegas et al 2018 noted that chemical balances are helpful to determine unknown components when the concentration of a chemical of interest is not the same for inputs and outputs the general equation for the chemical budget of shahu lake can be represented mathematically donovan 1994 2 δ v c l r i c ri r d c rd p c p g w i c gwi g w o c gwo r where c represents a concentration of a chemical in the water the subscript for each concentration term refers to the water balance components as defined above while r represents chemical reactions within the lake the chemical composition of the water discharging from shahu lake to groundwater was assumed to be the same as that of the lake water c gwo c l conservative chemicals which are defined as nonreactive during the water cycle are set as r 0 using this assumption the unknown groundwater lake exchange quality and quantity fluxes can be solved 3 3 hydrogeochemical modeling hydrogeochemical modeling is a useful tool for clarifying evolutionary process in groundwater system we performed inverse modeling between two samples the initial and final solution along the flow paths that revealed the occurrence of physiochemical processes ahmed and clark 2016 morán ramírez and ramos leal 2014 rademacher et al 2001 unlike previous studies extensive evaporation can result in salt accumulation in lakes to compute the net chemical reactions in the lake water a virtual sample was introduced in this study fig 3 given the calculated gwi and gwo from eq 2 the volume of water from each endmember ri rd p e gwi gwo and initial water is multiplied by each chemical parameter of that endmember with their sum representing the virtual chemical composition of the m th parameter this demonstrates that the values of conservative parameter between virtual and real samples are the same the ionic delta for nonconservative compositions depends mainly on the hydrochemical reactions that occurred in the lake system the impacts of reactions in lake can be quantified using netpath code el kadi et al 2011 which analyzed differences between the virtual and real samples final sample at the same time 4 results 4 1 chemical composition basic statistics of the physicochemical data of water samples for the lake wells river and discharge drains sampled within the study area are summarized in table 2 a kruskal wallis nonparametric test showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the variances of the measured parameters for the three monitoring sites in the lake p 0 024 this is consistent with the generally well mixed water in shallow lakes cui et al 2016 as shown in table 3 the mineral composition of the soil samples was dominated mainly by quartz 40 70 plagioclase 15 25 na feldspars 5 illite 2 5 6 chlorite 3 5 5 calcite and dolomite 2 2 15 5 small levels of 0 2 gypsum and 0 3 amphibole were also reported 4 1 1 lake water shahu lake is a typical of shallow lake as it does not have thermal stratification water quality data indicated that the water was mildly alkaline with ph values ranging from 8 3 to 9 2 the relative abundance of major dissolved ionic species was na k mg2 ca2 for cations and cl so4 2 hco3 co3 2 for anions to reveal similarities and differences among water samples a piper trilinear diagram was created piper 1944 as shown in fig 4 all the lake water fell into cl so4 na mg facies even though there were significant changes in water salinity among them the lake experienced a rapid increase in salinity with a mean annual ratio of 0 23 g l in 2004 2013 and then tended to decline in 2013 2014 table 2 minimum and maximum tds values of the lake water were 2 1 g l in sep 2004 and 4 4 g l in dec 2013 4 1 2 replenishment water the replenishment water diverted from the yellow river irrigation water was fresh hco3 ca na and hco3 na ca types with a mean tds value of 0 39 g l it showed little temporal variation in the chemistry fig 4 the poor quality drainage water that recharged the lake fell into cl so4 hco3 na mg facies the mean tds values detected from the drainage ditches was 1 66 g l the mean values of the dominant ions na 0 46 g l cl 0 48 g l and so4 2 0 35 g l in mean drainage water were higher than those in the irrigation water 4 1 3 groundwater groundwater in the region was also characterized by weakly alkaline conditions with a mean ph of 7 6 molar ion concentrations in the groundwater decreased from na k ca2 mg2 for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 for anions beneath agricultural lands the general zonation of groundwater type was indicative of both natural factors and human activities qian et al 2013 the mean groundwater sample in table 2 describes the origin of the chemical compositions for recharging the lake the tds level of mean groundwater was 0 65 g l as natural discharge from groundwater forms lakes in the yinchuan plain one can speculate that shahu lake contained fresh water during the early stages of its formation 4 2 processes regulating lake water chemistry 4 2 1 evaporation precipitation and dissolution a gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 was created to reveal the mechanism controlling the dissolved salts composition in the water the ratios of na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 relative to tds commonly illustrate three natural mechanisms in water atmospheric precipitation rock weathering and evaporation process cui et al 2016 elumalai et al 2019 ntanganedzeni et al 2018 prasanna et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 as is evident from fig 5 the majority of the groundwater samples coincided with the rock dominated endmembers but lake water samples were mainly driven by evaporation as water evaporates ca2 mg2 and hco3 that were removed through carbonate precipitation is believed to be the principal reaction responsible for the lake s chemical change guo et al 2015 resulting in the increased ratios of na na ca and cl hco3 compared with the major inflow sources mean groundwater and irrigation water lower concentrations of ca2 in the lake water revealed the dominant deposition of calcium in the lake system according to the calculation of the saturation index si the values in all the lake water samples for calcite and dolomite were greater than zero indicating that they remained over saturated the positive correlation between hco3 and ca2 r s 0 56 p 0 05 and hco3 and mg2 r s 0 47 p 0 05 fig 6 further highlighted the precipitation of the ca carbonate and mg carbonate in the lake similar results were presented by wahed et al 2014 for lake qarun in egypt however the molar ratios of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 in most of lake water were above the 1 2 lines fig 7 a this provides strong evidence for the additional contribution of ca2 and or mg2 from other sources and or the deposition of carbon reaction 1 co 3 2 c a 2 caco 3 calcite reaction 2 2co 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 camg c o 3 2 dolomite 4 2 2 cation exchange the ionic ratios in water can provide useful information that help identify water with lithogenic origins and from anthropogenic effects chen et al 2017 lake water displayed an excess of na over cl fig 7b implicating the contribution of silicate weathering and cation exchange mcneil et al 2005 as reported by stallard and edmond 1983 feldspars are more susceptible to dissolution than quartz despite the detected silicate mineral in the study area which implies possibility of na feldspar weathering table 3 it is unlikely sodium ions will increase under alkaline conditions in addition griffioen 2001 and thorslund et al 2014 documented that the transport of k in water was mainly controlled by cation exchange these findings suggest that the additional sodium in lake water may be governed by possible na ca na k and na mg exchanges the exchange between ca and or mg and other cations may occur in the lake to balance against the lost carbonate precipitation 4 2 3 effects on lake water salinity change shahu lake receives inflow exclusively from irrigation water and drainage water previous study has estimated the groundwater lake water exchange in the lake system and noted that the optimal volume of replenishment water 1380 104 m3 a could sustain the lake level at a normal state chen and qian 2017 data showed that before 2013 the annual volumes of irrigation and drainage water were in the ranges of 460 1274 104 m3 and 0 791 104m3 after 2013 it increased to 1142 2852 104 m3 with an annual mean value of 2080 104 m3 fig 8 this shows an acceleration of the water cycle it is noteworthy that variations in tds in the lake water were markedly coincident with the replenishment activities an appreciable increase in tds occurred going from 2 1 g l in 2004 to 3 6 g l in 2012 the long term electric conductivity ec trend obtained from the ningxia water conservancy bureau 2010 2017 further demonstrated the rapid water salinization during this period fig 8 as the replenishment water was changed to irrigation water in 2013 lake water salinity tended to decrease the slowed decline in tds in 2013 indicate a time lag effect fig 7c as mentioned earlier the drainage water inflow into the lake involved a large quantity of domestic and industrial sewage given the high contents of cl and so4 2 in drainage water it profoundly affected the higher salinity in the lake before 2013 consequently strong positive correlations of tds with cl and so4 2 r s 0 80 p 0 01 r s 0 65 p 0 01 were observed in the lake water fig 6 as a nonconservative element chemical reactions may alter the so4 2 concentrations in the lake water even though it has similar variations with tds gypsum was likely to dissolve in lake water to increase so4 2 levels because of the related negative si values table 2 the dissolution of gypsum may also provide more ca2 for carbonate precipitation and or cation exchange 4 3 hydrological and hydrochemical processes in response to water replenishment 4 3 1 lake groundwater interaction the lake has an effluent influent behavior with the aquifer and groundwater flows through the lake along the southwest northeast direction chen and qian 2017 hydrologic alterations of the lake however complicate groundwater movement the fluctuations in lake groundwater exchange have further effect on the characteristics of water and dissolved ions within and from the lake two stages of hydrochemical variation in combination with replenishment activities were considered 1 water salinization during 2004 2012 nine hydrological years stage i and 2 water freshening during 2013 2014 two hydrological years stage ii chloride is considered a conservative component in the lake assuming no chemical mass was lost in the evaporation processes and the density of lake water was constant groundwater that flows in and out of lake during each stage could be calculated based on the combination of water budget and chloride mass balance equations eq 1 2 c l denotes the mean value of chloride in a specific period in the lake water the hydrochemical data for different water bodies were presented in table 2 specifically water sample l1 was the initial solution in stage i the final solution in stage i and the initial solution in stage ii had the same sample of l3 the mean lake water in 2013 2014 was regarded as the final solutions in stage ii table 4 shows the significant difference during the hydrogeochemical evolution of the lake system groundwater represented as a major component of recharge to balance the water budget in stage i the annual groundwater inflow reached 855 104 m3 and the outflow was 82 104 m3 in the shahu lake as a result the lake water accumulated solutes from replenishment water and groundwater recharge under the arid environment and there was a relative amount of salinity discharge from the lake to the groundwater in stage ii sufficient replenishment water reduced groundwater recharge 345 104 m3 a and accelerated the groundwater discharge 235 104 m3 chen and qian 2017 explained the lake groundwater interactions in shahu lake using numerical modeling when the lake water levels declined due to a shortage of replenishment water increased recharge from groundwater occurred on the contrary the large volume of replenishment water accompanied by the lake water level enhanced water discharge into the aquifer system this suggests that groundwater lake water exchanges are highly sensitive to changes in the volume of water replenished into the lake which is consistent with the quantification in this study in addition groundwater outflow needs to be a prominent focus for understanding salinity balance in lake management assuming there was no flow from the lake to groundwater gwo 0 in eq 1 2 the effect on lake water level variation could have been negligible due to their small percentages 3 and 8 of the total lake water volume in stage i in stage ii using mass balances analysis the magnitude of the relative impact on salinity decline by groundwater discharge in the lake system was quantified at this time the salinity of the lake water was 5 8 g l and 4 6 g l at the end of stage i and stage ii respectively these are greater than the values in the virtual samples 5 0 g l and 3 9 g l this indicated that the groundwater seepage helped to reduce the salinity of the lake water at a mean annual rate of 0 09 g l during stage i and 0 35 g l during stage ii therefore a holistic water replenishment scheme considering groundwater lake interaction can be necessary for recognizing the water and mass balance in the lake 4 3 2 contribution of chemical reactions to investigate the hydrochemical evolution of shahu lake during the two stages two inverse modelling scenarios were performed considering the conservative behavior of chloride in the lake the selected chemical constraints chemical elements were k ca c mg na and s in the netpath models the phases included in the modeling were selected based on the analysis of the chemical trends calculated si values and the mineralogy because this does not preclude the possibility of reactions producing or consuming co2 within the lake co2 was included among the plausible phases a set of mineral and gas phases involving calcite dolomite gypsum cation exchange and co2 were hypothesized to be the reactive phases in the system and then the mass transfers for possible combinations of the selected phases were simulated in each stage positive values refer to mass entering dissolution while negative values represented mass releasing precipitation into the aqueous phase the salinity changes between the virtual samples and the final samples for each stage described the corresponding contribution of chemical reactions for the water chemistry evolution in the lake system only one mass balance reaction model was consistent with the observed chemical characteristics for each stage as shown in table 5 the salinity reduction from the virtual samples to the final samples were attributed to the precipitation of calcite and dolomite dissolution of gypsum na k and na ca exchange and the co2 degassing in the lake system at an annual scale of 0 11 g l in stage i and 0 15 g l in stage ii the lake water samples with a deficit of ca2 as compared to so4 2 can be explained by the prevalent precipitation of calcite calcite precipitation was the most abundant in the system which occurred at mean annual ratios of 0 74 mmol l in stage i and 1 2 mmol l in stage ii comparatively the mean annual ratios of dolomite precipitation were 0 21 mmol l in stage i and 0 46 mmol l in stage ii carbonate mineral precipitation and co2 degassing were coupled in the two stages which is in agreement of other researches clark and lauriol 1992 cosmo et al 2019 papadimitriou et al 2004 under the conditions 0 04 mmol l dissolution of gypsum occurred annually in stage i and 0 03 mmol l in stage ii to release more ca2 into the lake water to balance the deficit cation exchange represents the interchange between an ion in solution and another ion in the boundary layer between the solution and a charged surface such as clay minerals organic matter or amorphous minerals chen et al 2019 edmunds et al 2003 mcneil et al 2005 sposito 2000 helfferich 1962 noted the following selectivity sequence of ca2 mg2 k na for the common cations in this study only na k and na ca exchange were identified in controlling the chemical evolution of shahu lake in the study area the fine grained sediments in the lakebed and the abundant reeds and phytoplankton chen and qian 2017 provided favorable conditions for the occurrence of cation exchange the k na exchange explained relative excess of sodium content in the lake with 0 02 mmol l both in stage i and stage ii interestingly the reversibility of na ca exchange result in the na concentration in the lake water was demonstrated with an increase 0 07 mmol l in stage i and a deficit 0 57 mmol l in stage ii although na was enriched in the lake and drainage water the na concentration in the virtual sample was smaller than that in the final sample during stage i except for the carbonate precipitation and co2 degassing the remaining ca2 was the primary cause for the na increase in stage i to balance the solution one ca2 ion would replace two na ions on soil particle surfaces to supplement the depletion of na in stage i however the cation exchange led to the elimination of na and the release of ca2 when large quantity of irrigation water that was enriched with ca2 recharged into the lake during stage ii this was similar with the observed processes of seawater intrusion mountadar et al 2018 the release of ca2 from the surface of clay minerals into the lake water at a mean annual rate of 0 57 mmol l was dominant in stage ii simultaneously the carbonate precipitation increased this highlights the importance in the quality of replenishment water on the mineral precipitation and cation exchange processes in the lake system reaction 3 1 2 ca x 2 n a nax 1 2 c a 2 reaction 4 nax k kx n a 5 discussion understanding the underlying causes of water level and water salinity variation in lakes can help guide sustainable decision making a lake system can be compared to an iceberg which has both visible and hidden parts to explain it more clearly a conceptual model was developed and shown in fig 9 precipitation surface runoff replenishment water and evaporation which decision makers or managers can observe are represented by the upper portion of the iceberg the lakes in arid regions receive low and inconstant annual rainfall and are characterized by potential evaporation that is far greater than the precipitation the effect of replenishment water was highlighted in lake water budgets as rainfall cannot ensure a sufficient water supply without supplementation from the other water sources groundwater lake interaction and chemical reactions were represented by the much large portion of the iceberg underwater which significantly impacts the hydrological and hydrochemical processes respectively importantly both quality and quantity of replenishment water which relied on the available water resources in the catchment can trigger or change the water exchange between lake and groundwater as well as the corresponding chemical behaviors the study we conducted at shahu lake can be considered an in situ test for modeling the effects of water replenishment on lake rehabilitation understanding the invisible elements is vital for measuring effectiveness in lake management and should not be simplified despite the difficulties in their determination understanding the hydrochemical behaviors of lake water was beneficial in recognizing this lake s evolution which can be applied to other lakes possibly bridging the knowledge gap between science and policy for shahu lake despite possible errors that might be introduced from the inter monthly variation in water hydrochemistry integrating the hydrochemical data with the water budget is the best available option to extract information for further management as this study demonstrated results from this study show that for complex systems lake management practices can be improved using the limited data available importantly when a high rate of evaporation accumulates salt in shahu lake groundwater outflow and chemical reactions contributed to 44 and 56 of salinity reduction 2 7 and 3 4 million tons each year during the water salinization stage i and 70 and 30 10 8 and 4 6 million tons each year during the water freshening stage ii respectively the large quantity of saline discharge revealed possible causes for the massive ecological impacts on the lake system the results also suggest that it is not sufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of management practices only based on changes in lake water levels water quantity is as important as water quality in a lake for sustaining ecological balance even though it is indeed difficult to balance water demands among different stakeholders in arid regions stress on water resources due to rising freshwater supplementation and climate change have already led to water scarcity in many places aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 mohanty 2003 even the yellow river the longest river in the north china is facing the problems of significant reductions in streamflow and intensified competition for water resources miao et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 this may have a significant impact on the availability of replenishment water resource for shahu lake and other lakes in northwest china therefore to fill the gap between lake management and water resources allocation the invisible elements in hydrological and hydrochemical cycles should be emphasized in further research and management helping to prioritize lake management and remediation practices in lakes that are experiencing water quality deterioration additional replenishment water resources are urgently required to serve the unmet needs for maintaining the ecological balance of these lakes managers should understand that by adding replenishment supplies they may induce adverse impacts on groundwater chemistry in the lake vicinity as reported by yechieli and wood 2002 the increased lake inflows were the main divers of increased salinity to which the quality of the groundwater is highly attributed to better understand the complexities and uncertainties associated with lake systems long term monitoring will provide valuable data which can be useful for describing examining and documenting changes in lake regions 6 conclusions this work represents the first comprehensive analysis of the hydrological and hydrochemical changes in shahu lake which was impacted by replenishment water results showed that the lake water can be categorized as a cl so4 na mg type even though the lake experienced a rapid increase and decline in salinity the variation in tds indicated that the lake evolved to be saline during 2004 2012 stage i and become increasingly fresh during 2013 2014 stage ii which was consistent with the replenishment activities these changes in lake water chemistry are controlled by replenishment activities lake groundwater interactions and chemical reactions that involved calcite and dolomite precipitation gypsum dissolution ion exchange and co2 degassing as evaporation increased water salinity groundwater outflow and chemical reactions were responsible for approximately 44 and 56 of reduction in salinity during stage i 70 and 30 during stage ii evaporative concentration was shown to be the major force responsible for calcium and carbon removal in lake water under arid environmental conditions the quality of replenishment water was demonstrated to be as important as quantity for rehabilitating lakes in arid regions as it was one of the main factors controlling the variation in chemical reactions this study demonstrates that water chemistry is an indicator that reflects the hydrologic and hydrochemical processes of lake evolution but the invisible effects of groundwater lake interactions and chemical reactions should be addressed with more research and management practices declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

5892,lakes in arid regions are ecologically valuable yet highly fragile due to intense evaporation to provide an extra water supply for maintaining water balance in lakes the ecological replenishment water program erwp in northwest china has significantly changed the hydrological and hydrochemical conditions for these lakes descriptive statistics and water and mass balances together with hydrogeochemical modeling were used in this study to gain an understanding of the impacts of water replenishment irrigation and drainage water on evolution for shahu lake a virtual sample was introduced in netpath hydrogeochemical modeling to compute the net chemical reactions in the lake water variations in tds indicated that the lake evolved to be saline during 2004 2012 stage i and then tended to be fresh during 2013 2014 stage ii results highlighted that groundwater outflow and chemical reactions were the overriding factors controlling chemical evolution in the lake system which greatly depend on the replenishment activities the salinity reduction from the virtual samples to the final samples were attributed to the precipitation of calcite and dolomite dissolution of gypsum na k and na ca exchange and the co2 degassing in the lake system at an annual scale of 0 11 g l in stage i and 0 15 g l in stage ii the quality of replenishment water was as important as quantity for rehabilitating lakes as it significantly determines the occurrence of chemical reactions in lake water findings from this paper can provide insight into the evolution of arid lakes in response to replenishment activities and can help contribute to better management of a valuable and fragile resource keywords lake salinity replenishment activities groundwater lake interaction chemical reactions virtual sample 1 introduction climate change and human activities pose great threats to global lake systems in which people rely on the natural environment for their livelihoods ballatore and muhandiki 2002 taking the fragile environment into consideration the situation is particularly acute in arid regions chen et al 2019 chen et al 2018 huo and li 2013 micklin 2007 su et al 2016 williams 2000 many lakes of great ecological historical and cultural values in arid northwest china are under threat of vanishing where surface inflow to the lakes has decreased significantly fang et al 2018 qian et al 2013 desiccation of lop nor lake is one of the most conspicuous examples guo et al 2015 ma et al 2010 in this regard the authorities intervened to prevent the situation from worsening by altering the natural hydrology of lakes the ecological replenishment water program erwp has been created to increase the flow of water into lakes for rehabilitation chen and qian 2017 jiang et al 2018 pang et al 2017 qiao et al 2007 tang 2009 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 table 1 however there are no generally accepted management practices for the replenishment of lakes in different hydrogeological settings changes in lake hydrology and water chemistry in response to water replenishment both quantity and quality have not been well understood shahu lake the largest lake in ningxia northwest china holds the highest level of tourism attraction 5a class owing to its unique desert oasis scenery li et al 2017 wu et al 2017 nearly 21 million visitors traveled to the lake in 2016 ningxia statistical bureau 2017 the lake provides economic tangible and intangible benefits to the quality of life for three million people who live in the surrounding towns and cities as a terminal lake in an arid environment it is typically sensitive to the local evaporation effects and replenishment activities since 2000 the addition of water diverted from drainage ditches before 2013 and the yellow river till now have helped to maintain a relatively constant lake water level however salinity shown here as total dissolved solids tds in the lake water unexpectedly increased at an alarming rate 0 23 g l per year which varied from 2 1 g l in 2004 to 4 4 g l in 2013 the precise cause of these changes is still unknown shahu lake evolved into a saline lake 3g l by hammer 1986 unfortunately a high rate of evaporation in these arid regions causes significant salt accumulation in lakes the growing level of salinity is compounded by mass loading from dissolved salts in the additional inflow and may have detrimental effects on the survival of a large range of aquatic organisms and plants in and around the lakes gutierrez et al 2018 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 for terminal lakes with no surface outlet like shahu lake a combination of processes involving evaporation groundwater lake exchange various types of chemical reactions and even water replenishment are inextricably intertwined in the systems gill et al 2013 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 zlotnik et al 2009 these processes result in nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the chemical components in the lake water scientific knowledge concerning the variability of groundwater exchange fluxes to and from lakes and the associated effects of mass transfer has grown rapidly this has been studied using stable isotopes and or conservative chemical tracers such as chloride montalván et al 2017 négrel et al 2003 sacks et al 2014 villegas et al 2018 unfortunately effective management policies have lagged in most cases lake groundwater interactions the importance of mineral dissolution weathering redox reactions and cation exchange in lakes have not been fully considered by lake management policy makers ali and khairy 2016 ballatore and muhandiki 2002 brkić et al 2016 burns et al 2001 huo et al 2016 rosenberry et al 2015 although simulations can be helpful to quantify intertwined processes a lack of observed data in most regions can greatly hinder model development as a result it remains uncertain how hydrological and hydrochemical processes should be quantified during the replenishment periods even though the replenishment water on lake evolution has been widely reported faced with impending severe water crises there is an urgent need to guide lake managers as they attempt to achieve sustainable development by providing them with a deep understanding of the causes and effects of replenishing activities on the hydrochemical behaviors of lake water in this study we carried out hydrochemical analyses of water samples from the shahu lake region we examined the groundwater and replenishment water by using correlation analysis calculation of water and mass balances and hydrogeochemical modeling this study aimed to determine water chemistry changes in response to different replenishing activities and ascertain the contributions of lake groundwater interactions and chemical reactions on lake chemical evolution this is the first systematic study to evaluate the effects of water replenishment on lake rehabilitation in an arid region and the results can be valuable in guiding future lake sustainable management 2 study area quaternary deposits have been extensively studied on the yinchuan plain of ningxia chen et al 2018 qian et al 2012 qian et al 2013 the multi layer aquifer system is composed of in order of depth a phreatic aquifer an upper confined aquifer and a lower confined aquifer these are primarily composed of fine sand silty fine sand and clayed sand quartz and plagioclase are the major minerals in the quaternary strata in the middle reaches of the yellow river the plain was provided with rich water resources fed by the river for agriculture the irrigation systems date back more than 2000 years and are still benefiting people in the plain it is praised as south china beyond the great wall as hundreds of lakes scattered across the plain chen et al 2016 qian et al 2013 shahu lake 38 39 29 97 n 104 04 58 66 e is the largest lake in ningxia with a water surface area of 13 96 km2 and is located in the low lying northern part of the plain at an elevation of 1096 1100 m above the sea level fig 1 it is shallow with a mean water depth of about 2 2 m the lake has no natural surface runoff and outflow in this area groundwater in the phreatic aquifer 15 25 m thickness generally flows from southwest to northeast fig 1 highly permeable sediments and shallow water depths usually less than 3 m promote a direct relationship between the lake and the groundwater system chen and qian 2017 this is the main cause for the existence of the lake in an arid region for several hundred years meteorological data 2001 2016 from the huinong meteorological station near shahu lake showed that the annual average temperature was 9 6 c with a maximum temperature of 30 8 c recorded in july the annual average precipitation in the study area was 175 mm fig 2 a with 75 of the rainfall falling from june to august evaporation observed during the same time period has an average of 1446 mm that is eight times greater than precipitation fig 2b with the maximum rates observed during the summer months may to september the nature of the arid environment combined with lake shahu s status as a terminal lake makes the added replenishment water and evaporation from lake surface dominate the gains and losses in the water budgets chen and qian 2017 the issue of how limited water is allocated among users is rising on policy agendas especially in arid environments bui et al 2019 gejl et al 2019 nethononda et al 2019 reynolds et al 2007 shaad and burlando 2018 and shahu lake is no exception the water replenishment history of shahu lake can be divided into two stages due to the different water sources the lake has received irrigation water from the yellow river through the dongganqu channel since 2000 to promote sustainability fig 1 drainage water a compound mixture of irrigation return flow groundwater and domestic and industrial sewage qian et al 2013 was also discharged into the lake via the no 3 drain and aiyihe in the absence of sufficient supply from irrigation water fig 1 both irrigation water and drainage water were the main water sources in the first stage which ended in early 2013 after 2013 the lake was recharged solely by irrigation water as lake managers concentrated on the ecological benefits of water transfer 3 material and methods 3 1 sample collection in this study a total of 57 lake water samples were collected from three different sampling sites during 2012 2014 fig 1 in order to describe the water quality conditions 23 groundwater samples and three surface water samples from the channel and drains were collected the groundwater samples were taken from domestic use wells ranging in depth from 5 to 20 m before sampling the wells were pumped for 3 5 min to remove any groundwater stored in the well itself in order to ensure that all samples represent groundwater and not water from the well bore water temperature ec and ph were continuously monitored during the purging using a portable water testing kit ddb 350 leici company of china and sample collection did not start until these parameters were stable the 1000 ml polyethylene collection bottles were thoroughly rinsed 2 3 times with water to be sampled and samples were separated into two aliquots one aliquot was taken for cation analysis and was acidified so that the ph 2 using 6 m ultrapure hno3 due to the problems of absorption or precipitation the other aliquot was stored as collected in the polyethylene bottles for anion determination all the samples were sealed and stored in the laboratory at 4 c prior to analysis water samples were analyzed for k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and co3 2 concentrations at the environmental monitoring station lab in shizuishan city ningxia china na and k were analyzed using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry ca2 and mg2 were measured using edta titration cl and so4 2 were measured by ion chromatography and hco3 and co3 2 were analyzed using the potentiometric titrimetric method tds values of water samples were obtained based on the analysis data in the lab proper quality control procedures were followed to ascertain the quality of the results the calculated ionic error balance did not exceed 5 in previous research conducted by qian et al 2013 the isotopic and chemical characteristics of 17 lakes in yinchuan plain were determined from the previous work the data from 2004 relevant to shahu lake were referenced for the present study additional hydrochemical data collected from the irrigation water 12 samples collected monthly during 2013 and drainage water 9 samples collected in 2004 and 2010 by the ningxia environmental protection agency were also used for better understanding water quality variation in the lake system furthermore two soil samples were collected near the lake remove the roots of plants with a trowel and take the samples from 20 to 25 cm below the surface ground the samples were thoroughly mixed and preserved by freeze drying for further x ray diffraction xrd analysis the xrd working condition included tube voltage of 40 kv tube current of 20 ma and scans a range of 2 70 with a rate of 10 min in accordance with national bureau of standards nbs of the united states the obtained curves were retrieved in the joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds of x ray diffraction xrd to get the corresponding standard atlas jin et al 2019 3 2 water budget calculations the water balance equation for shahu lake was represented as 1 δ v r i r d p g w i e g w o where v represents the change in water storage for the lake ri represents the replenishment inflow from irrigation water yellow river water rd represents the replenishment inflow from drainage water p is the precipitation e is the evaporation from the lake surface gwi represents the groundwater inflow into the lake and gwo represents the groundwater outflow from the lake into the aquifer human intervention and natural factors maintained lake levels with nominal change over time because of this the model can be simplified to a steady state situation in this study terms such as precipitation evaporation and replenishment water recharge are measurable quantities while groundwater seepage from and into the lake are unknown values the direct precipitation input to the lake p and evaporation from the lake surface e were obtained for each water year using data from the huinong meteorological station located 5 km from the lake data detailing the volume of replenishment water was collected from the local water conservancy bureau ningxia water conservancy bureau 2010 2017 villegas et al 2018 noted that chemical balances are helpful to determine unknown components when the concentration of a chemical of interest is not the same for inputs and outputs the general equation for the chemical budget of shahu lake can be represented mathematically donovan 1994 2 δ v c l r i c ri r d c rd p c p g w i c gwi g w o c gwo r where c represents a concentration of a chemical in the water the subscript for each concentration term refers to the water balance components as defined above while r represents chemical reactions within the lake the chemical composition of the water discharging from shahu lake to groundwater was assumed to be the same as that of the lake water c gwo c l conservative chemicals which are defined as nonreactive during the water cycle are set as r 0 using this assumption the unknown groundwater lake exchange quality and quantity fluxes can be solved 3 3 hydrogeochemical modeling hydrogeochemical modeling is a useful tool for clarifying evolutionary process in groundwater system we performed inverse modeling between two samples the initial and final solution along the flow paths that revealed the occurrence of physiochemical processes ahmed and clark 2016 morán ramírez and ramos leal 2014 rademacher et al 2001 unlike previous studies extensive evaporation can result in salt accumulation in lakes to compute the net chemical reactions in the lake water a virtual sample was introduced in this study fig 3 given the calculated gwi and gwo from eq 2 the volume of water from each endmember ri rd p e gwi gwo and initial water is multiplied by each chemical parameter of that endmember with their sum representing the virtual chemical composition of the m th parameter this demonstrates that the values of conservative parameter between virtual and real samples are the same the ionic delta for nonconservative compositions depends mainly on the hydrochemical reactions that occurred in the lake system the impacts of reactions in lake can be quantified using netpath code el kadi et al 2011 which analyzed differences between the virtual and real samples final sample at the same time 4 results 4 1 chemical composition basic statistics of the physicochemical data of water samples for the lake wells river and discharge drains sampled within the study area are summarized in table 2 a kruskal wallis nonparametric test showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the variances of the measured parameters for the three monitoring sites in the lake p 0 024 this is consistent with the generally well mixed water in shallow lakes cui et al 2016 as shown in table 3 the mineral composition of the soil samples was dominated mainly by quartz 40 70 plagioclase 15 25 na feldspars 5 illite 2 5 6 chlorite 3 5 5 calcite and dolomite 2 2 15 5 small levels of 0 2 gypsum and 0 3 amphibole were also reported 4 1 1 lake water shahu lake is a typical of shallow lake as it does not have thermal stratification water quality data indicated that the water was mildly alkaline with ph values ranging from 8 3 to 9 2 the relative abundance of major dissolved ionic species was na k mg2 ca2 for cations and cl so4 2 hco3 co3 2 for anions to reveal similarities and differences among water samples a piper trilinear diagram was created piper 1944 as shown in fig 4 all the lake water fell into cl so4 na mg facies even though there were significant changes in water salinity among them the lake experienced a rapid increase in salinity with a mean annual ratio of 0 23 g l in 2004 2013 and then tended to decline in 2013 2014 table 2 minimum and maximum tds values of the lake water were 2 1 g l in sep 2004 and 4 4 g l in dec 2013 4 1 2 replenishment water the replenishment water diverted from the yellow river irrigation water was fresh hco3 ca na and hco3 na ca types with a mean tds value of 0 39 g l it showed little temporal variation in the chemistry fig 4 the poor quality drainage water that recharged the lake fell into cl so4 hco3 na mg facies the mean tds values detected from the drainage ditches was 1 66 g l the mean values of the dominant ions na 0 46 g l cl 0 48 g l and so4 2 0 35 g l in mean drainage water were higher than those in the irrigation water 4 1 3 groundwater groundwater in the region was also characterized by weakly alkaline conditions with a mean ph of 7 6 molar ion concentrations in the groundwater decreased from na k ca2 mg2 for cations and hco3 cl so4 2 for anions beneath agricultural lands the general zonation of groundwater type was indicative of both natural factors and human activities qian et al 2013 the mean groundwater sample in table 2 describes the origin of the chemical compositions for recharging the lake the tds level of mean groundwater was 0 65 g l as natural discharge from groundwater forms lakes in the yinchuan plain one can speculate that shahu lake contained fresh water during the early stages of its formation 4 2 processes regulating lake water chemistry 4 2 1 evaporation precipitation and dissolution a gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 was created to reveal the mechanism controlling the dissolved salts composition in the water the ratios of na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 relative to tds commonly illustrate three natural mechanisms in water atmospheric precipitation rock weathering and evaporation process cui et al 2016 elumalai et al 2019 ntanganedzeni et al 2018 prasanna et al 2011 xiao et al 2015 as is evident from fig 5 the majority of the groundwater samples coincided with the rock dominated endmembers but lake water samples were mainly driven by evaporation as water evaporates ca2 mg2 and hco3 that were removed through carbonate precipitation is believed to be the principal reaction responsible for the lake s chemical change guo et al 2015 resulting in the increased ratios of na na ca and cl hco3 compared with the major inflow sources mean groundwater and irrigation water lower concentrations of ca2 in the lake water revealed the dominant deposition of calcium in the lake system according to the calculation of the saturation index si the values in all the lake water samples for calcite and dolomite were greater than zero indicating that they remained over saturated the positive correlation between hco3 and ca2 r s 0 56 p 0 05 and hco3 and mg2 r s 0 47 p 0 05 fig 6 further highlighted the precipitation of the ca carbonate and mg carbonate in the lake similar results were presented by wahed et al 2014 for lake qarun in egypt however the molar ratios of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 in most of lake water were above the 1 2 lines fig 7 a this provides strong evidence for the additional contribution of ca2 and or mg2 from other sources and or the deposition of carbon reaction 1 co 3 2 c a 2 caco 3 calcite reaction 2 2co 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 camg c o 3 2 dolomite 4 2 2 cation exchange the ionic ratios in water can provide useful information that help identify water with lithogenic origins and from anthropogenic effects chen et al 2017 lake water displayed an excess of na over cl fig 7b implicating the contribution of silicate weathering and cation exchange mcneil et al 2005 as reported by stallard and edmond 1983 feldspars are more susceptible to dissolution than quartz despite the detected silicate mineral in the study area which implies possibility of na feldspar weathering table 3 it is unlikely sodium ions will increase under alkaline conditions in addition griffioen 2001 and thorslund et al 2014 documented that the transport of k in water was mainly controlled by cation exchange these findings suggest that the additional sodium in lake water may be governed by possible na ca na k and na mg exchanges the exchange between ca and or mg and other cations may occur in the lake to balance against the lost carbonate precipitation 4 2 3 effects on lake water salinity change shahu lake receives inflow exclusively from irrigation water and drainage water previous study has estimated the groundwater lake water exchange in the lake system and noted that the optimal volume of replenishment water 1380 104 m3 a could sustain the lake level at a normal state chen and qian 2017 data showed that before 2013 the annual volumes of irrigation and drainage water were in the ranges of 460 1274 104 m3 and 0 791 104m3 after 2013 it increased to 1142 2852 104 m3 with an annual mean value of 2080 104 m3 fig 8 this shows an acceleration of the water cycle it is noteworthy that variations in tds in the lake water were markedly coincident with the replenishment activities an appreciable increase in tds occurred going from 2 1 g l in 2004 to 3 6 g l in 2012 the long term electric conductivity ec trend obtained from the ningxia water conservancy bureau 2010 2017 further demonstrated the rapid water salinization during this period fig 8 as the replenishment water was changed to irrigation water in 2013 lake water salinity tended to decrease the slowed decline in tds in 2013 indicate a time lag effect fig 7c as mentioned earlier the drainage water inflow into the lake involved a large quantity of domestic and industrial sewage given the high contents of cl and so4 2 in drainage water it profoundly affected the higher salinity in the lake before 2013 consequently strong positive correlations of tds with cl and so4 2 r s 0 80 p 0 01 r s 0 65 p 0 01 were observed in the lake water fig 6 as a nonconservative element chemical reactions may alter the so4 2 concentrations in the lake water even though it has similar variations with tds gypsum was likely to dissolve in lake water to increase so4 2 levels because of the related negative si values table 2 the dissolution of gypsum may also provide more ca2 for carbonate precipitation and or cation exchange 4 3 hydrological and hydrochemical processes in response to water replenishment 4 3 1 lake groundwater interaction the lake has an effluent influent behavior with the aquifer and groundwater flows through the lake along the southwest northeast direction chen and qian 2017 hydrologic alterations of the lake however complicate groundwater movement the fluctuations in lake groundwater exchange have further effect on the characteristics of water and dissolved ions within and from the lake two stages of hydrochemical variation in combination with replenishment activities were considered 1 water salinization during 2004 2012 nine hydrological years stage i and 2 water freshening during 2013 2014 two hydrological years stage ii chloride is considered a conservative component in the lake assuming no chemical mass was lost in the evaporation processes and the density of lake water was constant groundwater that flows in and out of lake during each stage could be calculated based on the combination of water budget and chloride mass balance equations eq 1 2 c l denotes the mean value of chloride in a specific period in the lake water the hydrochemical data for different water bodies were presented in table 2 specifically water sample l1 was the initial solution in stage i the final solution in stage i and the initial solution in stage ii had the same sample of l3 the mean lake water in 2013 2014 was regarded as the final solutions in stage ii table 4 shows the significant difference during the hydrogeochemical evolution of the lake system groundwater represented as a major component of recharge to balance the water budget in stage i the annual groundwater inflow reached 855 104 m3 and the outflow was 82 104 m3 in the shahu lake as a result the lake water accumulated solutes from replenishment water and groundwater recharge under the arid environment and there was a relative amount of salinity discharge from the lake to the groundwater in stage ii sufficient replenishment water reduced groundwater recharge 345 104 m3 a and accelerated the groundwater discharge 235 104 m3 chen and qian 2017 explained the lake groundwater interactions in shahu lake using numerical modeling when the lake water levels declined due to a shortage of replenishment water increased recharge from groundwater occurred on the contrary the large volume of replenishment water accompanied by the lake water level enhanced water discharge into the aquifer system this suggests that groundwater lake water exchanges are highly sensitive to changes in the volume of water replenished into the lake which is consistent with the quantification in this study in addition groundwater outflow needs to be a prominent focus for understanding salinity balance in lake management assuming there was no flow from the lake to groundwater gwo 0 in eq 1 2 the effect on lake water level variation could have been negligible due to their small percentages 3 and 8 of the total lake water volume in stage i in stage ii using mass balances analysis the magnitude of the relative impact on salinity decline by groundwater discharge in the lake system was quantified at this time the salinity of the lake water was 5 8 g l and 4 6 g l at the end of stage i and stage ii respectively these are greater than the values in the virtual samples 5 0 g l and 3 9 g l this indicated that the groundwater seepage helped to reduce the salinity of the lake water at a mean annual rate of 0 09 g l during stage i and 0 35 g l during stage ii therefore a holistic water replenishment scheme considering groundwater lake interaction can be necessary for recognizing the water and mass balance in the lake 4 3 2 contribution of chemical reactions to investigate the hydrochemical evolution of shahu lake during the two stages two inverse modelling scenarios were performed considering the conservative behavior of chloride in the lake the selected chemical constraints chemical elements were k ca c mg na and s in the netpath models the phases included in the modeling were selected based on the analysis of the chemical trends calculated si values and the mineralogy because this does not preclude the possibility of reactions producing or consuming co2 within the lake co2 was included among the plausible phases a set of mineral and gas phases involving calcite dolomite gypsum cation exchange and co2 were hypothesized to be the reactive phases in the system and then the mass transfers for possible combinations of the selected phases were simulated in each stage positive values refer to mass entering dissolution while negative values represented mass releasing precipitation into the aqueous phase the salinity changes between the virtual samples and the final samples for each stage described the corresponding contribution of chemical reactions for the water chemistry evolution in the lake system only one mass balance reaction model was consistent with the observed chemical characteristics for each stage as shown in table 5 the salinity reduction from the virtual samples to the final samples were attributed to the precipitation of calcite and dolomite dissolution of gypsum na k and na ca exchange and the co2 degassing in the lake system at an annual scale of 0 11 g l in stage i and 0 15 g l in stage ii the lake water samples with a deficit of ca2 as compared to so4 2 can be explained by the prevalent precipitation of calcite calcite precipitation was the most abundant in the system which occurred at mean annual ratios of 0 74 mmol l in stage i and 1 2 mmol l in stage ii comparatively the mean annual ratios of dolomite precipitation were 0 21 mmol l in stage i and 0 46 mmol l in stage ii carbonate mineral precipitation and co2 degassing were coupled in the two stages which is in agreement of other researches clark and lauriol 1992 cosmo et al 2019 papadimitriou et al 2004 under the conditions 0 04 mmol l dissolution of gypsum occurred annually in stage i and 0 03 mmol l in stage ii to release more ca2 into the lake water to balance the deficit cation exchange represents the interchange between an ion in solution and another ion in the boundary layer between the solution and a charged surface such as clay minerals organic matter or amorphous minerals chen et al 2019 edmunds et al 2003 mcneil et al 2005 sposito 2000 helfferich 1962 noted the following selectivity sequence of ca2 mg2 k na for the common cations in this study only na k and na ca exchange were identified in controlling the chemical evolution of shahu lake in the study area the fine grained sediments in the lakebed and the abundant reeds and phytoplankton chen and qian 2017 provided favorable conditions for the occurrence of cation exchange the k na exchange explained relative excess of sodium content in the lake with 0 02 mmol l both in stage i and stage ii interestingly the reversibility of na ca exchange result in the na concentration in the lake water was demonstrated with an increase 0 07 mmol l in stage i and a deficit 0 57 mmol l in stage ii although na was enriched in the lake and drainage water the na concentration in the virtual sample was smaller than that in the final sample during stage i except for the carbonate precipitation and co2 degassing the remaining ca2 was the primary cause for the na increase in stage i to balance the solution one ca2 ion would replace two na ions on soil particle surfaces to supplement the depletion of na in stage i however the cation exchange led to the elimination of na and the release of ca2 when large quantity of irrigation water that was enriched with ca2 recharged into the lake during stage ii this was similar with the observed processes of seawater intrusion mountadar et al 2018 the release of ca2 from the surface of clay minerals into the lake water at a mean annual rate of 0 57 mmol l was dominant in stage ii simultaneously the carbonate precipitation increased this highlights the importance in the quality of replenishment water on the mineral precipitation and cation exchange processes in the lake system reaction 3 1 2 ca x 2 n a nax 1 2 c a 2 reaction 4 nax k kx n a 5 discussion understanding the underlying causes of water level and water salinity variation in lakes can help guide sustainable decision making a lake system can be compared to an iceberg which has both visible and hidden parts to explain it more clearly a conceptual model was developed and shown in fig 9 precipitation surface runoff replenishment water and evaporation which decision makers or managers can observe are represented by the upper portion of the iceberg the lakes in arid regions receive low and inconstant annual rainfall and are characterized by potential evaporation that is far greater than the precipitation the effect of replenishment water was highlighted in lake water budgets as rainfall cannot ensure a sufficient water supply without supplementation from the other water sources groundwater lake interaction and chemical reactions were represented by the much large portion of the iceberg underwater which significantly impacts the hydrological and hydrochemical processes respectively importantly both quality and quantity of replenishment water which relied on the available water resources in the catchment can trigger or change the water exchange between lake and groundwater as well as the corresponding chemical behaviors the study we conducted at shahu lake can be considered an in situ test for modeling the effects of water replenishment on lake rehabilitation understanding the invisible elements is vital for measuring effectiveness in lake management and should not be simplified despite the difficulties in their determination understanding the hydrochemical behaviors of lake water was beneficial in recognizing this lake s evolution which can be applied to other lakes possibly bridging the knowledge gap between science and policy for shahu lake despite possible errors that might be introduced from the inter monthly variation in water hydrochemistry integrating the hydrochemical data with the water budget is the best available option to extract information for further management as this study demonstrated results from this study show that for complex systems lake management practices can be improved using the limited data available importantly when a high rate of evaporation accumulates salt in shahu lake groundwater outflow and chemical reactions contributed to 44 and 56 of salinity reduction 2 7 and 3 4 million tons each year during the water salinization stage i and 70 and 30 10 8 and 4 6 million tons each year during the water freshening stage ii respectively the large quantity of saline discharge revealed possible causes for the massive ecological impacts on the lake system the results also suggest that it is not sufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of management practices only based on changes in lake water levels water quantity is as important as water quality in a lake for sustaining ecological balance even though it is indeed difficult to balance water demands among different stakeholders in arid regions stress on water resources due to rising freshwater supplementation and climate change have already led to water scarcity in many places aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 mohanty 2003 even the yellow river the longest river in the north china is facing the problems of significant reductions in streamflow and intensified competition for water resources miao et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 this may have a significant impact on the availability of replenishment water resource for shahu lake and other lakes in northwest china therefore to fill the gap between lake management and water resources allocation the invisible elements in hydrological and hydrochemical cycles should be emphasized in further research and management helping to prioritize lake management and remediation practices in lakes that are experiencing water quality deterioration additional replenishment water resources are urgently required to serve the unmet needs for maintaining the ecological balance of these lakes managers should understand that by adding replenishment supplies they may induce adverse impacts on groundwater chemistry in the lake vicinity as reported by yechieli and wood 2002 the increased lake inflows were the main divers of increased salinity to which the quality of the groundwater is highly attributed to better understand the complexities and uncertainties associated with lake systems long term monitoring will provide valuable data which can be useful for describing examining and documenting changes in lake regions 6 conclusions this work represents the first comprehensive analysis of the hydrological and hydrochemical changes in shahu lake which was impacted by replenishment water results showed that the lake water can be categorized as a cl so4 na mg type even though the lake experienced a rapid increase and decline in salinity the variation in tds indicated that the lake evolved to be saline during 2004 2012 stage i and become increasingly fresh during 2013 2014 stage ii which was consistent with the replenishment activities these changes in lake water chemistry are controlled by replenishment activities lake groundwater interactions and chemical reactions that involved calcite and dolomite precipitation gypsum dissolution ion exchange and co2 degassing as evaporation increased water salinity groundwater outflow and chemical reactions were responsible for approximately 44 and 56 of reduction in salinity during stage i 70 and 30 during stage ii evaporative concentration was shown to be the major force responsible for calcium and carbon removal in lake water under arid environmental conditions the quality of replenishment water was demonstrated to be as important as quantity for rehabilitating lakes in arid regions as it was one of the main factors controlling the variation in chemical reactions this study demonstrates that water chemistry is an indicator that reflects the hydrologic and hydrochemical processes of lake evolution but the invisible effects of groundwater lake interactions and chemical reactions should be

5893,this paper examines the applicability of independent component analysis ica in regional flood frequency analysis rffa data from 88 catchments in new south wales australia are adopted in this study the ica is integrated with both quantile regression technique qrt and parameter regression technique prt a total of eight climatic and catchment characteristics is used as potential predictor variables in the study for ica independent components ic are used as the predictor variables and a cumulative percent relevance criterion is adopted to select the best predictors a leave one out validation is adopted to assess the performances of the competing models using a suit of statistical evaluation measures it is found that the qrt model with four catchment characteristics and the pr model with all the ics as predictors outperform the other candidate models these models provide a absolute median relative error in the range of 33 to 44 for the qrt model with catchment characteristics as predictors and 48 to 59 for the prt model with the ics as predictors for design flood estimation this is comparable to the relative error values 57 to 64 reported for the rffa technique recommended in the australian rainfall and runoff keywords regional flood frequency analysis design flood independent component regression cumulative percent relevance floods 1 introduction design flood estimation is an essential task in planning and designing of hydraulic structures and floodplain analysis srinivas et al 2008 stedinger and griffis 2008 garmdareh et al 2018 flood frequency analysis ffa is the most direct method to estimate frequency and magnitude of design floods ffa can be carried out based on annual maximum am or peaks over threshold pot flood data for reliable flood estimation record length of am flows at the site of interest should be long enough to identify the parent distribution confidently however in case of poorly gauged sites or ungauged sites ffa cannot be carried out confidently in these circumstances regional flood frequency analysis rffa can be used for design flood estimation ouarda et al 2008a b blöschl et al 2013 rffa attempts to transfer flood characteristics information from gauged catchments to an ungauged one within a homogeneous region blöschl and sivapalan 1997 chebana and ouarda 2008 pallard et al 2009 rahman et al 2014 garmdareh et al 2018 haddad and rahman 2019 the identification of homogeneous regions is a principal step in many rffa methods the rffa essentially involves three steps i identification of a hydrologically homogeneous region ii development of a suitable regional flood estimation model for the identified homogeneous region and iii validation of the developed rffa model ouarda 2013 haddad et al 2015 traditionally a region is often formed based on its geographical proximity and or political boundaries eng et al 2005 pilgrim 1987 tasker et al 1996 however regions formed by geographical and political considerations are often found to be hydrologically dissimilar burn 1990a b hosking and wallis 1993 merz and blöschl 2005 chebana and ouarda 2008 application of l moments based discordancy and homogeneity measures proposed by hosking and wallis 1993 can be adopted to identify homogeneous regions advantages of l moments based methods are that l moments are linear combinations of data based on probability weighted moments pwm and analogous to conventional moments with measures of location mean scale standard deviation and shape skewness and kurtosis this makes l moments less sensitive to outliers and data extremes numerous studies have been carried out using l moments based homogeneity tests for example in turkey an investigation carried out by saf 2009 using l moments based heterogeneity measure resulted into identification of three homogeneous subregions in pakistan application of l moments based heterogeneity measure on 30 gauged sites identified the region to be homogeneous ahmad et al 2017 application of this method on 51 stream gauging sites in sicily resulted into gross heterogeneity of the regions noto and la loggia 2009 l moments based homogeneity test for 18 catchments in zayandehrood iran showed that these form a homogeneous region eslamian and hussein 2007 lilienthal et al 2018 introduced a more generalised version of hosking and wallis procedure with better detection of heterogenous groups using data from saxony germany attempts by bates et al 1998 rahman et al 1999b and micevski et al 2015 to form homogeneous regions in australia based on hosking and wallis 1993 criteria were largely unsuccessful there is a vast literature available for development of a suitable rffa techniques cunnane 1988 hosking and wallis 1988

2019 regression based rffa models generally assume that relationship between dependent variable flood quantile and predictor variables catchment and climatic characteristics is linear and the predictor variables are uncorrelated among themselves however these linearity assumptions are not satisfied in many practical situations chebana et al 2014 independent component analysis ica is a statistical technique that can yield statistically independent and uncorrelated components based on predictor variables comon 1994 hyvärinen and oja 2000 de lathauwer et al 2000 hyvärinen et al 2004 ica can potentially extract the independent components ic from the observed mixture of signals by adopting higher order statistical characteristics of the source the higher order statistics is usually taken as the fourth order central moment of the observed data and does not require any prior knowledge of the source signals ica has widely been adopted in signal processing arenas such as image processing financial analysis electrophysiological signal and biomedical signals vigário 1997 hyvärinen 1999 wessel 2018 wang et al 2017 artoni et al 2018 thye et al 2018 several researchers have explored the efficiency of ica in speech recognition telecommunication spectroscopy neurology and process monitoring westad and kermit 2003 yoo et al 2004 deslauriers et al 2017 hsu et al 2018 huang et al 2018 to produce robust and reliable estimates from regression based rffa models ics can be used instead of the usual raw predictor variables chen and wang 2001 proposed a regression model where ics are used as predictor variables in multiple linear regression mlr model and called it independent component regression icr technique numerous researchers have explored icr in various fields of engineering for example zhang et al 2018 applied icr for virtual sensing application kaneko et al 2008 applied it to model aqueous solubility and lu et al 2009 and chowdhury et al 2018 adopted it in financial forecasting the applications of icr are found mainly in signal processing and medical sciences however its application to hydrology is limited in one application haque et al 2017 adopted icr for their water demand modelling using data from city of aquidauana brazil to the authors knowledge icr has not been applied in rffa hence the motivation of this study is to explore the applicability of the icr in rffa a total of 88 catchments are selected from new south wales nsw australia for this study at the beginning the hosking and wallis 1993 homogeneity tests are applied to assess the homogeneity of the hypothesised regions thereafter catchment and climatic characteristics variables are transformed into ics and mlr models are developed in qrt and prt modelling frameworks using the ics as the predictor variables two alternative models using the raw catchment characteristics as predictor variables in qrt framework are also developed for comparison with the icr models all the models are validated using leave one out loo technique and a comparison of results are presented and discussed the conclusions drawn from the paper are then presented at the end 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area the flood frequency behaviour of very large catchments can significantly vary from that of smaller catchments therefore it is preferable to select small to medium sized ungauged catchments to develop the rffa models as these models are primarily intended for smaller to medium catchments australian rainfall and runoff arr rahman et al 2019 suggests an upper limit of 1000 km2 for small to medium sized catchments which seems to be reasonable to select potential catchments for this study a total of 88 catchments are selected from nsw australia having catchment areas varying from 8 to 1010 km2 with a mean of 352 km2 and median of 260 km2 it is required to have a balance between obtaining an adequate number of catchments because it provides greater spatial information and a reasonably long record length to improve the precision of rffa models rahman et al 2015 recommends selecting catchments having at least 20 years of records to develop the rffa models in australia ball et al 2019 for this study record length of am flow data for the selected catchments range from 25 to 82 years with a mean of 41 5 years and median of 37 years the physiography of the selected catchments varies from mountainous region to coastal area with the mean annual rainfall ranging from 625 to 1 955 mm mean 1 000 mm and median 910 mm the location of the selected 88 catchments is presented in fig 1 2 2 selection of catchment characteristics in this study the following guidelines are adopted in selecting the climatic and catchment characteristics catchment characteristics based on the approach by rahman 1997 the selected characteristic should conceivably affect flood generation characteristics should be explicitly defined characteristics should be easily accessible the simpler characteristic should be chosen in case that simpler characteristic and a complex one are correlated and may cause similar effects if a combined characteristic is chosen it should have a simple physical explanation there should be no high correlation between the characteristics because this presents unstable parameters in mlr analysis the prediction performance of a particular characteristic in other regionalisation studies should be examined as this might provide some information regarding the importance of a characteristic 2 3 description of selected catchment characteristics the following eight catchment characteristics are selected for this study on the basis of criteria mentioned in section 2 2 they are also described in detail in the next section the candidate catchment characteristics are catchment area a km2 design rainfall intensity with time of concentration tc i tc 2 mm h shape factor sf stream density sden forest forest mean annual rainfall mar mm mean annual evapo transpiration mae mm and slope of central 75 of mainstream s1085 m km 2 3 1 catchment area anderson 1957 characterised catchment area as the devil s own variable because almost every catchment characteristic can be linked with it since area can directly impact the probable flood magnitude from a given storm incident it is the most frequently adopted morphometric characteristic and the main scaling factor in ffa catchment area is found to be very significant by almost all of the reported rffa studies the association of catchment area with the other significant morphometric characteristics like slope stream length and stream order is the most important reason of this variable being so useful in statistical hydrology catchment areas of the selected catchments are measured by planimeter from 1 100 000 topographic maps the derived areas are also compared to the values provided in the catchment database that contained the streamflow data provided by the stream gauging authority the mean annual flood is directly proportional to other morphometric characteristics i e stream order stream length which are again directly proportional to the catchment area rahman 1997 the total volume of runoff q is proportional to the catchment a and of the general form of this equation is 1 q c a m where the exponent m varies from 0 5 to 1 00 2 3 2 rainfall intensity in previous rffa studies rainfall intensity is found to be the most influential climatic characteristic with some appropriate duration and average recurrence interval ari it is easily obtainable and it has substantial effect on flood generation process rahman 1997 an appropriate duration and aris are required to select the suitable rainfall intensity to use it as a catchment characteristic it seems to be logical to use rainfall intensity with duration equal to tc as applied in the rational method however due to variability in catchment size and shape in the study area the tc may vary from site to site it is virtually impossible to select a storm having equal time of concentration which is representative of every catchment selected in this study it is therefore decided to include the tc as duration and 2 years ari i tc 2 mm h in this study for uniformity and ease of application the formula recommended in pilgrim 1987 for victoria and eastern nsw given by eq 2 is adopted in this study to estimate tc hours from catchment area a km2 2 t c 0 76 a 0 38 however after initial investigation it is found that the rainfall intensity based on a fixed duration i e 6 hours and 2 years ari i 62 is more appropriate as suggested by rahman et al 2015 and hence this is adopted in this study 2 3 3 shape factor shape factor sf can be calculated by dividing the shortest distance between the catchment outlet and catchment centroid by the square root of the catchment area rahman et al 2015 the variable sf can have direct impact on flood generation as it is a measure of how the catchment is shaped and how fast the runoff can be generated this is why sf is selected as a catchment characteristic for this study 2 3 4 stream density stream density or drainage density can be obtained by dividing the total length of all the streams and rivers in a catchment by the total area of that catchment it provides a measurement of how efficient the drainage mechanism is in a catchment both climatic and physical characteristics are responsible for a catchment s drainage density runoff generation can be affected by soil permeability and underlying rock type in a catchment impermeable ground or exposed bedrock leads to an increase in surface runoff and therefore can cause floods during a storm the shape of a streamflow hydrograph can be affected by stream density this is why stream density is chosen as a catchment characteristic for this study 2 3 5 forest forest cover is expressed as a fraction of catchment area forrested increase in forest area can slow down the flood generation process by infiltration recent increase in deforestation all over the world might have increased global flood risk it can have a notable effect on both physical and climatic condition of a catchment therefore forest is selected in this study the fraction of catchment covered by forest is estimated on 1 100 000 topographic maps by using a planimeter 2 3 6 mean annual rainfall mar although mar may not have a direct impact or a connection with flood peaks mar can still have a secondary effect by acting as surrogate for other catchment characteristics i e vegetation it is also quite easy to obtain therefore it is included in many studies thus in this study mar is included as a candidate predictor variable the mar data is obtained from australian bureau of meteorology bom provided cd 2 3 7 mean annual evapo transpiration mae the third influential climatic characteristic in flood generation process is considered to be mae similar to mar mae does not affect the flood peak directly but can produce a secondary effect by posing as a substitute for other catchment characteristics evapo transpiration can be defined as the amount of water lost from a water body through the combined effects of evaporation and transpiration from catchment vegetation to use mae as one of the selected characteristics data is obtained from the bom cd for a catchment the mae value at the centroid of the catchment is extracted 2 3 8 main stream slope s1085 the variable s1085 is selected in this study as it is easily obtainable and reported to be the one of the measures for prediction of mean floods benson 1959 from the different measures of slope variable s1085 values are determined from eq 3 3 s 1085 e 2 e 1 0 75 l where e 2 is the elevation at the 0 85l position along the mainstream e 1 is the elevation at the 0 10l position here l is the main stream length variable s1085 is measured in the unit of m km table 1 presents a summary of descriptive statistics of the selected catchment characteristics for the 88 study sites these characteristics data are used to extract ics to develop the icr models both in qrt and prt framework note that the selected catchments are mostly rural and not subjected to any major land use changes or regulation 2 4 data preparation and at site ffa accuracy of a regional flood prediction equations largely depends on quality of the available flood data and it is possible to have missing observations in streamflow records at gauging locations a number of nearby gauged sites are generally required for data in filling for one or two years to have a complete am flow records at a site the missing am flows are estimated by developing a regression equation that uses the am flow data from six nearest stations this method provides a close enough approximation of the missing data point although there can be a slight risk associated to over or under estimation of a missing data point although the nearby sites have different geo morphological characteristics there are similarity among them due to smooth spatial variability in climate indices such as rainfall and evaporation a regression equation is developed between the site with a data gap and the closest site from the nearby six sites these regression equations present a reasonable goodness of fit with a co efficient of determination value r 2 greater than 85 only about 2 of the am flow records are infilled for any single site which is likely to result in only minor impacts on flood quantile estimates at the site of interest to ensure the data is free from rating curve error an average and maximum cut off rating ratio rr of 4 and 20 are selected respectively as suggested by rahman et al 2015 although an appropriate rr cut off is maintained for quality controlled data detection of potentially influential low flows pilf from the flood data is an important step in ffa saf 2010 in case of the selected sites pilfs are identified and censored using flike software kuczera 1999 which uses a multiple grubbs and beck test as built in facility censoring of pilfs reduces the skew of the available data significantly flike is used to carry out the at site ffa in this study using log pearson type iii lp3 distribution with a bayesian fitting method to estimate flood quantiles for annual exceedance probability aeps of 50 20 10 5 2 and 1 the aep is defined as the probability of exceedance of a flood discharge in a single year these flood quantiles are used as dependent target variables in the rffa methods developed in this study censoring of pilfs via the flike software resulted in a better fitting of lp3 distribution to the observed am flood data at a given site 3 methods 3 1 homogeneity test investigation of potential homogeneous region from selected catchments is carried out based on the method proposed in hosking and wallis 1993 this method uses l moments of the observed am flood data l moments can be derived from linear combinations of pwms and used as scale and location parameters of a probability distribution then the l moment ratios i e coefficient of variation l cv skewness l skew and kurtosis l kurt are computed from the l moments which are plotted in a three dimensional space which creates a cloud of study sites any site s far from the centre of the cloud is considered to be discordant far is measured in terms of allowance of the correlation between the l moments mathematically a discordant site can be identified by using the following equation for site i 4 d i 1 3 u i u t s 1 u i u here ū is unweighted group average ui is vector containing the l moment ratios of site i and s is sample covariance matrix the discordancy measure di is used as a standard measure to consider a site to be discordant in the multivariate analysis as reported in hosking and wallis 1993 to identify a site to be discordant di 3 is suggested in hosking and wallis 1993 however they recommend that the data for sites with large di values should still be examined for possible errors for a region to be homogeneous the l moments population values should be same for all the sites in the region to examine the homogeneity of a group of sites a heterogeneity measure is suggested by hosking and wallis 1993 the method can be mathematically described as below let site i has record length ni and sample l moment ratios are t i t3 i and t4 i if the regional average l cv l sk and l kurt weighted by the sites record length are represented as tr t3 r and t4 r where 5 t r i 1 n n i t i i 1 n n i the weighted standard deviation can be found as below 6 v i 1 n n i t i t r 2 i 1 n n i 1 2 a kappa distribution is fitted to the regional average l moments and a large number of simulations are run to generate n sim of realisations of the region with n sites each having the same kappa distribution as its frequency distribution these simulated regions are homogeneous and have no cross correlation or serial correlation they have the same record length as their real counterparts for each simulated region v is calculated heterogeneity measure or the h statistics can be computed based on the v calculated for each simulated region by using eq 7 7 h v μ v σ v where μv and σv are the mean and standard deviation of n sim values of v respectively a region is declared as heterogeneous if h has a large value values of h less than 1 can indicate acceptably homogeneous region values in between 1 and 2 can mean possibly heterogeneous and h 2 indicates a definitely heterogeneous region hosking and wallis 1993 1997 discordant site and potential homogeneous region identification are done in three steps firstly the whole dataset of 88 sites is considered to be one group and all the discordant sites that are found after the application of discordancy measure are removed together at the same time and homogeneity of the region is examined by applying the heterogeneity measure on the second step each discordant site found from the discordancy measure considering 88 sites as one group is removed one at a time and the heterogeneity measure is calculated to investigate the homogeneity of the region in the last step the dataset is divided into two groups based on catchment area and discordancy and heterogeneity measures are applied to both the groups 3 2 independent component regression ica is a statistical technique that has a capability of decomposing observed multivariate data into statistically independent components ic these ics are expressed as the linear combinations of the predictor variables with minimum loss of information the following equation can represent the ica model parastar et al 2012 8 x a s e where x is the observed data matrix s and a represent the ics and the coefficient matrix respectively this x is called as the mixing matrix of the ics and e is the error matrix the two main assumptions associated with ica are as follows i the independent components are statistically independent and ii the independent components must have non gaussian distributions the objective of ica is to identify a proper linear representation of non gaussian vectors in order to have the estimated vectors as independent as possible and to represent the mixed data as a linear combination of the independent components the ica model is quite similar to the principal component analysis pca where the multivariate data are represented by the linear combination of some orthogonal principal components pc the difference is in the way of linear representation ica seeks to find ics whereas pca seeks to find orthogonal pcs independence is a much stronger condition than orthogonality because of its characteristics as high order statistics therefore ica is generally considered to be more powerful than pca in analysing multivariate data sets as it can imitate the inherent properties of the original data sets in a better way hyvärinen et al 2004 3 3 cumulative percent relevance in case of icr it is not possible to identify the most important ics for regression analysis by looking at their loading or eigen values as is possible in case of pca zhang et al 2018 suggested a method based on cumulative percent relevance cpr using the quality relevance contribution index qr ci for each ic to select the most valuable ics for regression analysis let s i r n i 1 2 m be the i th ic and y rn be the quality variable qr ci of si to y is defined as follows 9 con t si dco r 2 s i y i 1 m d c o r 2 s i y cpr is a measure of the cumulative percentage of quality relevance captured by the first k ics and can be measured by 10 c p r k 100 i 1 k c o n t si i 1 m c o n t si with this criterion one can select a desired threshold for cpr i e 85 90 or 95 3 4 evaluation statistics to assess the performance of the developed rffa models a loo validation technique is adopted based on loo a site is left out in each step while constructing a model i e this site is treated as an ungauged site the following performance statistics are calculated for each of the models for predicted flood quantile q pred and observed flood quantile q obs the following error statistics are calculated relative error re median absolute relative error rer q pred q obs ratio median q pred q obs ratio mean square error mse root mean square error rmse bias bias relative bias rbias relative root mean square error

distribution carried out using flike kuczera 1999 as mentioned before 4 results and discussion 4 1 homogeneity analysis the h statistics i e h1 h2 and h3 are found to be 13 44 10 06 and 5 96 respectively when all the 88 sites are considered as a single region to qualify for a homogeneous region a group of sites should have h statistics less than one hosking and wallis 1993 hence the selected 88 sites are highly heterogeneous the value of di is computed for the 88 sites based on hosking and wallis 1993 criteria sites having di 3 are regarded as discordant amongst these 88 sites four sites 203002 222016 401015 and 419029 are found to have di 3 the values of di for sites 203002 401015 and 419029 are 3 78 3 48 and 3 86 respectively the value of di for site 222016 is found to be the highest 6 05 removal of these four sites that have di 3 results in h statistics being equal to 11 74 8 73 and 4 74 respectively therefore no homogeneous regions are found at this stage furthermore after removing the four discordant sites two more sites are found to have di 3 these two new sites are 208001 and 222015 having di values of 3 37 and 3 69 respectively these two discordant sites are removed from the group of 84 sites and di and h statistics are computed for the group of 82 sites h statistics for this 82 sites are found to be 12 35 8 91 and 5 01 respectively this step also renders one more discordant site 204026 having di of 3 5 the new discordant site having di of 3 5 is removed from the 82 sites forming a new group of 81 sites and again the di and h statistics are computed for the group this step does not result in any other discordant site however h1 h2 and h3 for this latest group of 81 sites do not show any significant reduction in their h values which are 11 1 8 31 and 4 83 respectively it seems that the h statistics increases rather than a decrease after the removal of these discordant sites table 2 shows the h statistics computed while each of the discordant sites di 3 is removed one at a time from the 88 sites e g site 203002 is first removed and the h statistics are computed for the remaining 87 sites then site 203002 is placed back into the group the next site is removed and the h statistics are again computed for the 87 sites as before and so on when the first discordant site 203002 is removed from the 88 sites the other three discordant sites 222016 401015 and 419029 still remain discordant having di values of 6 05 3 95 and 3 81 respectively and the h statistics show no significant reduction which indicates that this group of sites is highly heterogeneous the removal of 222016 di 6 05 provides four more discordant sites and shows no significant effect on the h statistics removal of these discordant sites one at a time shows no significant effect on reduction of h statistics furthermore all the 88 sites are divided into two groups based on their drainage divisions to see whether homogeneous region can be established there are two drainage divisions here drainage divisions 2 and 4 group 1 consists of sites that are in drainage division 2 and there are total of 50 sites in this group whereas in group 2 there are a total of 38 sites belonging to drainage division 4 both di and h statistics are examined for these two groups and presented in tables 3a and 3b application of discordancy measure to both of the groups show two discordant sites from each group i e sites 203002 and 222016 from group 1 and sites 401015 and 419029 from group 2 the h statistics for group 1 are found to be 12 81 9 62 and 6 13 respectively and in case of group 2 they are found to be 5 84 3 89 and 1 64 respectively division of groups according to their drainage divisions yield no notable reduction in h statistics moreover additional application of the discordancy measure after removing the previously found discordant sites reveals no remarkable changes from the above results it can be concluded that perfect homogeneous regions cannot be established in nsw australia in the subsequent analyses all the 88 sites are included 4 2 independent component analysis ica the technique described in the methods section to extract ics from catchment characteristics data is applied to the 88 selected sites the r script program used for this study produces the mixing matrix the un mixing matrix and pre whitening matrix along with the ics and centred original data table 4 presents the mixing matrix which is derived from the original data using fastica method in r script and table 5 presents the un mixing matrix derived by transposing the mixing matrix the un mixing matrix is then used to derive the ics which then in turn are used as the independent variables in mlr looking at table 4 one can see that the values of the mixing variables can be as high as 237 32 and as low as 96 65 the highest values are found in case of variable one v1 ranging from 96 65 to 237 32 and the lowest values are found in case of variable three v3 ranging from 0 20 to 0 05 in table 5 all the values are quite small compared to table 4 as it is the transpose matrix of table 4 details of the generated ics are displayed in table 6 ica generates the same number of ics as the observed variables therefore each station 88 selected stations has eight ics the maximum positive ics are found in case of ic4 and the maximum negative ics are found in case of ic1 ic6 has exactly 50 of positive and negative ics the mean values of negative and positive ics range from 0 93 to 0 48 and 0 95 to 0 79 respectively which is presented in columns four and five of table 4 the median values for both negative and positive ics range from 0 98 to 0 38 and 0 96 to 0 32 respectively the maximum standard deviation is found in case of positive ics which is as high as 1 16 4 3 flood prediction model development regression models are developed using flood quantiles aeps of 50 20 10 5 2 and 1 as dependent variables and ics as predictor variables in both the qrt and prt framework note that to compare the results of the newly developed models to results of a traditionally used model a quantile regression is also carried out using the catchment characteristics as the predictors weerts et al 2011 haddad and rahman 2012 ahn and palmer 2016 in case of the traditional qrt the flood quantiles are naturally log transformed to achieve near normal distribution however for models using ics as predictors flood quantiles are left to their original state as mentioned earlier although ica is a powerful method the variance or energy and the order of the ics cannot be determined hyvärinen and oja 2000 therefore a stepwise selection procedure based on their level of significance p values and cpr described in zhang et al 2018 is used to select the ics that are important for model development stepwise selection of predictors based on their p values resulted in the following regression models for qrt qrt with ics qrt ic and prt with ics prt ic for the stepwise selection a value of p 0 10 is selected for a predictor to be significant in case of cpr cpr 0 20 is chosen as the selection criterion it can be seen from the following models that both predictor variable selection techniques have identified ic1 ic2 ic5 ic7 and ic8 to be the most important predictors for model development 19 ln q t β 0 β 1 ln a β 2 ln i 62 β 3 ln sf β 4 ln sden

variable model is named as m1 qrt p value model is named as m2 qrt ic all model is named as m3 qrt ic p value model is named as m4 qrt ic cpr model is named as m5 prt model with all ics is named as m6 prt model with ics selected based on their p value is named as m7 and prt model with ics selected based on cpr method is named as m8 the colour green is associated to m1 blue is for m2 red is for m3 black is for m4 orange is for m5 hot pink is for m6 yellow is for m7 and turquoise is for m8 these model names are also shown in table 7 where the r2 and the adjusted coefficient of determination adj

skewness as mentioned in arr rahman et al 2015 ball et al 2019 low r2 and adj r2 values indicate that the developed models may need more descriptive variables to enhance the performance of the models if other descriptive predictors are unavailable careful further assessment of the regression based model is necessary fig 2 shows the standardised residual vs the fitted value plots for models m1 to m8 all the standardised residual values are almost equally distributed around the zero line and lie between the ranges of 2 and also no specific pattern heteroscedasticity can be identified however in case of model m6 most of the standardised residuals lie between 1 having very few outliers fig 3 shows the predicted values q pred vs observed values q obs plots in case of m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m7 and m8 the points are randomly scattered specially for higher flows model m6 represents the best plot out of all the models however model m6 shows some cases of underestimation for few larger observations whereas models m7 and m8 show some overestimation in case of few observations there may be some possible outliers beyond the scale of the plots figs 4 and 5 show the boxplots q pred q obs ratios and re values of eight selected models and six selected aeps 50 20 10 5 2 and 1 respectively the expected line for fig 4 is set to one and for fig 5 it is set to zero as one and zero indicates higher similarities between predicted and observed values in both cases of q pred q obs ratios and re values respectively for fig 4 the boundary for the graph is set from 1 to 3 for q pred q obs ratios and for fig 5 it is set at 300 for re values looking at the boxplots it is evident that m1 and m2 have the smallest box sizes and the median lines go through the expected line in all the model cases error bars in case of m1 and m2 are seen to be quite small however there might be potential outliers that are not visible in the selected boundary size for both figs 4 and 5 the boxplots of q pred q obs ratios and re values for models m3 m4 and m5 for m3 m4 and m5 the quantile estimation are done using qrt where predictor ics are selected differently show that the box sizes for both q pred q obs ratios and re values are not too wide however for 50 2 and 1 aeps the median lines do not match the expected line in both cases of q pred q obs ratios and re values in case of 20 10 and 5 aeps the median lines pass through the expected lines the error bars for m3 m4 and m5 show that mostly in case of lower quantiles they are within the boundary area with possible outliers the error bars for higher quantiles are quite large some even going out of the boundary of the diagram with possible outliers for both q pred q obs ratios and re values for models m6 m7 and m8 for m6 m7 and m8 the quantile estimation is done using prt where predictor ics are selected differently from figs 4 and 5 it is evident that the box sizes are quite similar to that of the qrt methods in case of m7 and m8 it is seen that these two methods are overestimating the quantiles a little more than underestimating with disproportionate box sizes for 50 10 and 5 aeps in case of q pred q obs ratios and re values box size is slightly disproportionate for 10 to 1 aeps m8 seems to be the worst performing prt model among the three models m6 m7 and m8 with the median lines being notably away from the expected line for most of the aeps for both figs 4 and 5 model m6 which has all the predictor ics included in the quantile estimation has the smallest box size among models m6 m7 and m8 whereas m7 has slightly larger box size than m6 the median line for both m6 and m7 pass through the expected line in both cases of q pred q obs ratios and re values except in case of 50 aep the error bars for m6 m7 and m8 are found to be small and visible inside the boundary of the diagram with possible outliers the performances of these models in predicting flood quantiles are provided in table 8 using absolute re reabs and rer the relevant equations to compute rer are provided in section 3 4 it can be seen from table 8 that model m2 has the lowest rer 36 63 when all aeps are considered together the models m1 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 and m8 have a rer values 3 1 8 94 8 82 8 96 15 09 12 91 and 13 46 respectively which are higher than those of m2 tables 8 and 9 present the mean median and standard deviation of reabs and absolute q pred q obs ratio values for all selected models where lowest values are marked in blue from both the tables 8 and 9 it is evident that model m2 shows an overall better performance than the other seven models none of the qrt and prt models m3 m8 using ics present any low values in table 8 however m6 shows better result for 1 aep in case of all the aeps m8 shows better result for 20 aep for q pred q obs ratio values table 9 range of median reabs for m6 is seen to be in the range of 47 to 59 whereas the range for m2 is 33 to 44 for table 9 the range of median absolute q pred q obs ratio values for m6 is found to be 0 93 to 1 24 whereas the range for m2 is found to be 0 92 to 1 02 note that this is a representation of absolute values which does not show the actual distribution of the re or q pred q obs ratio values for any of the models for further investigation statistical evaluations such as mse rmse bias rbias rrmse rmsne rer and median absolute q pred q obs ratios are examined based on the observed and predicted values for the 5 aep flood quantile for the eight selected models table 10 summarises the evaluation statistics from loo i e mse rmse bias rbias rrmse rmsne rer and median absolute q pred q obs ratios based on the observed and predicted values for the 5 aep flood for eight selected models these evaluation criteria are commonly used in rffa for cross validation purposes ilorme and griffis 2013 pandey and nguyen 1999 haddad and rahman 2012 the reason behind choosing 5 aep flood is that it is a commonly used flood quantile in ffa a small value of mse is preferable however from table 10 it is seen that mse values for the selected models are quite high the lowest value 110166 for mse is found in case of m1 the mse values for m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 and m8 range from 140 000 to 1800 000 for a model to be acceptable rmse should be relatively small in case of the selected models rmse values lie in the range of 331 to 1311 which is quite high the lowest rmse 331 is found for m1 a recent study by durocher et al 2018 in southern quebec canada found rmse as 38 and 45 in case of 10 and 1 aep floods by using spatial copula method a number of studies chokmani and ouarda 2004 chebana et al 2014 shu and ouarda 2007 found rmse values in the range 41 to 51 for 10 aep flood and 49 to 70 for 1 aep flood using ordinary kriging in pca space generalised additive model gam and single artificial neural network ann for the same dataset in quebec looking into bias one can see that the lowest positive bias 0 66 is found for m5 model m2 shows the highest negative bias of 52 94 which indicates an overall under estimation by the model and m6 shows the highest positive bias of 159 53 which indicates an overall over estimation by the model in terms of rbias the lowest value is found in case of m2 22 40 for rest of the models the rbias values range from 24 48 to 68 93 in case of the studies carried out by durocher et al 2018 chokmani and ouarda 2004 chebana et al 2014 and shu and ouarda 2007 rbias values were found in the range 5 to 20 for 10 aep flood and 7 to 27 for 1 aep flood in case of rrmse except m6 the other models perform quite well with rrmse being less than 10 rmsne for the developed models are found in the range of 0 95 to 3 6 which is quite larger than the range reported in rosbjerg et al 2013 in rosbjerg et al 2013 regression analysis is applied for flood prediction using data from all over the world excluding australia and rmsne is found in the range of 0 5 to 0 65 the highest value in the present study is found for model m5 and lowest for m2 note that australia is highly heterogeneous and flood prediction is much more challenging than the rest of the world haddad and rahman 2012 examination of the rer and median q pred q obs ratios for each of the models provides a clear view of m2 having the lowest rer 33 28 and m1 having the lowest q pred q obs ratio 1 00 however model m6 shows the highest rer of 53 69 and m8 shows the lowest q pred q obs ratio of 0 81 the ranges of rer for all the models are 33 54 and the ranges of q pred q obs ratio values are 0 81 1 08 overall from tables 8 9 it can be seen that m2 is the better performing model than the rest of the models it may be emphasised that rer is a single statistic and may not provide a true model performance and hence we prepared figs 6 and 7 where all the models are compared with respect to reabs next a plot of cumulative percentage of reabs for eight selected models fig 6 is examined looking at fig 6 in case of models m1 and m2 85 of the sites show the reabs values in the range of 0 to 99 for 5 aep flood in case of m6 and m8 it seems that 84 and 78 respectively of the sites show a reabs in the range of 0 to 99 for 5 aep flood around 60 sites in case of m2 and 45 sites in case of m6 show reabs values in the range of 0 to 49 the overall performance of models m2 and m6 are comparable model 1 m1 has eight predictor variables and model 2 m2 has only four predictor variables however in terms of rer m2 performs better rer of 36 63 than m1 rer of 39 73 in fig 6 it is also found that m2 performs better than m1 also m2 is preferable to m1 as per model parsimony principle tables 11 and 12 show the number of stations performing fair poor and good in case of m2 and m6 based on their re values and q pred q obs ratios the range of fair poor and good are arbitrarily decided based on the following values re values from 30 to 30 is good from 60 to 60 fair and beyond 60 is poor similarly q pred q obs ratio values from 0 80 to 1 3 is deemed to be good from 0 60 to 2 fair and less than 0 6 to greater than 2 is poor it can be seen from both tables that for all the selected aeps m2 displays greater number of sites performing good 31 to 41 stations in case of median re values and 22 and 34 stations in case of q pred q obs ratio however m6 displays that not many sites perform good 20 to 27 stations in case of median re values and 17 to 21 stations in case of q pred q obs ratio therefore it is clear from the above discussion that the best performing model is m2 with four predictor variables 4 4 comparison with arr rffa model in this section a comparison of reabs values between arr rffa model rahman et al 2019 and models m2 and m6 is presented a baysian gls parameter regression technique is used to develop the rffa model to estimate regional flood quantiles for arr rffa model in case of australian flood data haddad and rahman 2012 rahman et al 2015 in fig 7 the cumulative percentage values of reabs for arr rffa and models m2 and m6 are compared for the six selected aeps blue solid lines represent cumulative percent reabs for the arr rffa model red is for model m2 and green is for model m6 in fig 7 looking at fig 7 it is evident that for all the six aeps around 60 of the stations show their re values are in the range of 0 to 49 for all the three models a few of the sites show a gross over estimation in case of all the three models represented in fig 7 models m2 seem to outperform the arr rffa model and m6 performs in a similar way as the arr rffa model the reabs values for arr rffa model and models m2 and m6 are compared in table 13 it is evident from table 13 that the reabs values for arr rffa model ranging from 56 to 64 are greater than both the m2 and m6 models reabs values ranging from 33 to 44 for m2 and 47 to 59 for m6 one possible reason for these differences in reabs values by the two methods may be that arr rffa model is developed with the data from 558 stations from nsw victoria and queensland states of australia whereas m2 and m6 are developed for 88 sites in nsw i e data sets are different however it is promising to see that the reabs values from models m2 and m6 are comparable to the reabs values of arr rffa model from this research it can be stated that icr can be a viable method to estimate regional flood quantiles in case of australia even though the homogeneity criteria are not fulfilled further research with additional catchments from a wider australian region is warranted to confirm the reliability of icr in rffa in australia 5 conclusion in rffa predictor variables are often highly correlated which causes instability in regression analysis ica generates individual ics from the raw predictor variables that are uncorrelated and independent which can be used in rffa the performance of ica in rffa is assessed in this study using data from 88 catchments in nsw australia a homogeneity analysis is first carried out which resulted in no acceptable homogeneous region in nsw the ica is then applied with both qrt and prt framework it is found that prt model performs better with ica than qrt model developed with mlr shows that it performs slightly better than the prt with ica model one shortcoming of ica may be noted that this method does not give any loading on individual ics as can be found for pca therefore predictor variable selection is carried out using level of significance and cpr values this results into mlr model having four predictors i e catchment area rainfall intensity shape factor and stream density selected based on their level of significance the prt model with all the ics perform better than the seven other models the developed models are validated using loo and assessed using various statistical evaluation measures the rffa studies conducted in many other parts of the world e g durocher et al 2016 2018 chokmani and ouarda 2004 chebana et al 2014 shu and ouarda 2007 rosbjerg et al 2013 have shown better performances than this study and other australian studies in general e g haddad and rahman 2012 however the relative errors of our models are found to be comparable to arr rffa rahman et al 2019 ball et al 2019 model the results of this study reveal that ica is a viable modelling option in rffa that is easy to implement it is recommended to add more descriptive catchment characteristics to ica to have more ics in the analysis and to enhance its relative accuracy the finding of this study is expected to encourage other researchers worldwide to apply ica in rffa credit

5893,this paper examines the applicability of independent component analysis ica in regional flood frequency analysis rffa data from 88 catchments in new south wales australia are adopted in this study the ica is integrated with both quantile regression technique qrt and parameter regression technique prt a total of eight climatic and catchment characteristics is used as potential predictor variables in the study for ica independent components ic are used as the predictor variables and a cumulative percent relevance criterion is adopted to select the best predictors a leave one out validation is adopted to assess the performances of the competing models using a suit of statistical evaluation measures it is found that the qrt model with four catchment characteristics and the pr model with all the ics as predictors outperform the other candidate models these models provide a absolute median relative error in the range of 33 to 44 for the qrt model with catchment characteristics as predictors and 48 to 59 for the prt model with the ics as predictors for design flood estimation this is comparable to the relative error values 57 to 64 reported for the rffa technique recommended in the australian rainfall and runoff keywords regional flood frequency analysis design flood independent component regression cumulative percent relevance floods 1 introduction design flood estimation is an essential task in planning and designing of hydraulic structures and floodplain analysis srinivas et al 2008 stedinger and griffis 2008 garmdareh et al 2018 flood frequency analysis ffa is the most direct method to estimate frequency and magnitude of design floods ffa can be carried out based on annual maximum am or peaks over threshold pot flood data for reliable flood estimation record length of am flows at the site of interest should be long enough to identify the parent distribution confidently however in case of poorly gauged sites or ungauged sites ffa cannot be carried out confidently in these circumstances regional flood frequency analysis rffa can be used for design flood estimation ouarda et al 2008a b blöschl et al 2013 rffa attempts to transfer flood characteristics information from gauged catchments to an ungauged one within a homogeneous region blöschl and sivapalan 1997 chebana and ouarda 2008 pallard et al 2009 rahman et al 2014 garmdareh et al 2018 haddad and rahman 2019 the identification of homogeneous regions is a principal step in many rffa methods the rffa essentially involves three steps i identification of a hydrologically homogeneous region ii development of a suitable regional flood estimation model for the identified homogeneous region and iii validation of the developed rffa model ouarda 2013 haddad et al 2015 traditionally a region is often formed based on its geographical proximity and or political boundaries eng et al 2005 pilgrim 1987 tasker et al 1996 however regions formed by geographical and political considerations are often found to be hydrologically dissimilar burn 1990a b hosking and wallis 1993 merz and blöschl 2005 chebana and ouarda 2008 application of l moments based discordancy and homogeneity measures proposed by hosking and wallis 1993 can be adopted to identify homogeneous regions advantages of l moments based methods are that l moments are linear combinations of data based on probability weighted moments pwm and analogous to conventional moments with measures of location mean scale standard deviation and shape skewness and kurtosis this makes l moments less sensitive to outliers and data extremes numerous studies have been carried out using l moments based homogeneity tests for example in turkey an investigation carried out by saf 2009 using l moments based heterogeneity measure resulted into identification of three homogeneous subregions in pakistan application of l moments based heterogeneity measure on 30 gauged sites identified the region to be homogeneous ahmad et al 2017 application of this method on 51 stream gauging sites in sicily resulted into gross heterogeneity of the regions noto and la loggia 2009 l moments based

australia based on hosking and wallis 1993 criteria were largely unsuccessful there is a vast literature available for development of a suitable rffa techniques cunnane 1988 hosking and wallis 1988

2019 regression based rffa models generally assume that relationship between dependent variable flood quantile and predictor variables catchment and climatic characteristics is linear and the predictor variables are uncorrelated among themselves however these linearity assumptions are not satisfied in many practical situations chebana et al 2014 independent component analysis ica is a statistical technique that can yield statistically independent and uncorrelated components based on predictor variables comon 1994 hyvärinen and oja 2000 de lathauwer et al 2000 hyvärinen et al 2004 ica can potentially extract the independent components ic from the observed mixture of signals by adopting higher order statistical characteristics of the source the higher order statistics is usually taken as the fourth order central moment of the observed data and does not require any prior knowledge of the source signals ica has widely been adopted in signal processing arenas such as image processing financial analysis electrophysiological signal and biomedical signals vigário 1997 hyvärinen 1999 wessel 2018 wang et al 2017 artoni et al 2018 thye et al 2018 several researchers have explored the efficiency of ica in speech recognition telecommunication spectroscopy neurology and process monitoring westad and kermit 2003 yoo et al 2004 deslauriers et al 2017 hsu et al 2018 huang et al 2018 to produce robust and reliable estimates from regression based rffa models ics can be used instead of the usual raw predictor variables chen and wang 2001 proposed a regression model where ics are used as predictor variables in multiple linear regression mlr model and called it independent component regression icr technique numerous researchers have explored icr in various fields of engineering for example zhang et al 2018 applied icr for virtual sensing application kaneko et al 2008 applied it to model aqueous solubility and lu et al 2009 and chowdhury et al 2018 adopted it in financial forecasting the applications of icr are found mainly in signal processing and medical sciences however its application to hydrology is limited in one application haque et al 2017 adopted icr for their water demand modelling using data from city of aquidauana brazil to the authors knowledge icr has not been applied in rffa hence the motivation of this study is to explore the applicability of the icr in rffa a total of 88 catchments are selected from new south wales nsw australia for this study at the beginning the hosking and wallis 1993 homogeneity tests are applied to assess the homogeneity of the hypothesised regions thereafter catchment and climatic characteristics variables are transformed into ics and mlr models are developed in qrt and prt modelling frameworks using the ics as the predictor variables two alternative models using the raw catchment characteristics as predictor variables in qrt framework are also developed for comparison with the icr models all the models are validated using leave one out loo technique and a comparison of results are presented and discussed the conclusions drawn from the paper are then presented at the end 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area the flood frequency behaviour of very large catchments can significantly vary from that of smaller catchments therefore it is preferable to select small to medium sized ungauged catchments to develop the rffa models as these models are primarily intended for smaller to medium catchments australian rainfall and runoff arr rahman et al 2019 suggests an upper limit of 1000 km2 for small to medium sized catchments which seems to be reasonable to select potential catchments for this study a total of 88 catchments are selected from nsw australia having catchment areas varying from 8 to 1010 km2 with a mean of 352 km2 and median of 260 km2 it is required to have a balance between obtaining an adequate number of catchments because it provides greater spatial information and a reasonably long record length to improve the precision of rffa models rahman et al 2015 recommends selecting catchments having at least 20 years of records to develop the rffa models in australia ball et al 2019 for this study record length of am flow data for the selected catchments range from 25 to 82 years with a mean of 41 5 years and median of 37 years the physiography of the selected catchments varies from mountainous region to coastal area with the mean annual rainfall ranging from 625 to 1 955 mm mean 1 000 mm and median 910 mm the location of the selected 88 catchments is presented in fig 1 2 2 selection of catchment characteristics in this study the following guidelines are adopted in selecting the climatic and catchment characteristics catchment characteristics based on the approach by rahman 1997 the selected characteristic should conceivably affect flood generation characteristics should be explicitly defined characteristics should be easily accessible the simpler characteristic should be chosen in case that simpler characteristic and a complex one are correlated and may cause similar effects if a combined characteristic is chosen it should have a simple physical explanation there should be no high correlation between the characteristics because this presents unstable parameters in mlr analysis the prediction performance of a particular characteristic in other regionalisation studies should be examined as this might provide some information regarding the importance of a characteristic 2 3 description of selected catchment characteristics the following eight catchment characteristics are selected for this study on the basis of criteria mentioned in section 2 2 they are also described in detail in the next section the candidate catchment characteristics are catchment area a km2 design rainfall intensity with time of concentration tc i tc 2 mm h shape factor sf stream density sden forest forest mean annual rainfall mar mm mean annual evapo transpiration mae mm and slope of central 75 of mainstream s1085 m km 2 3 1 catchment area anderson 1957 characterised catchment area as the devil s own variable because almost every catchment characteristic can be linked with it since area can directly impact the probable flood magnitude from a given storm incident it is the most frequently adopted morphometric characteristic and the main scaling factor in ffa catchment area is found to be very significant by almost all of the reported rffa studies the association of catchment area with the other significant morphometric characteristics like slope stream length and stream order is the most important reason of this variable being so useful in statistical hydrology catchment areas of the selected catchments are measured by planimeter from 1 100 000 topographic maps the derived areas are also compared to the values provided in the catchment database that contained the streamflow data provided by the stream gauging authority the mean annual flood is directly proportional to other morphometric characteristics i e stream order stream length which are again directly proportional to the catchment area rahman 1997 the total volume of runoff q is proportional to the catchment a and of the general form of this equation is 1 q c a m where the exponent m varies from 0 5 to 1 00 2 3 2 rainfall intensity in previous rffa studies rainfall intensity is found to be the most influential climatic characteristic with some appropriate duration and average recurrence interval ari it is easily obtainable and it has substantial effect on flood generation process rahman 1997 an appropriate duration and aris are required to select the suitable rainfall intensity to use it as a catchment characteristic it seems to be logical to use rainfall intensity with duration equal to tc as applied in the rational method however due to variability in catchment size and shape in the study area the tc may vary from site to site it is virtually impossible to select a storm having equal time of concentration which is representative of every catchment selected in this study it is therefore decided to include the tc as duration and 2 years ari i tc 2 mm h in this study for uniformity and ease of application the formula recommended in pilgrim 1987 for victoria and eastern nsw given by eq 2 is adopted in this study to estimate tc hours from catchment area a km2 2 t c 0 76 a 0 38 however after initial investigation it is found that the rainfall intensity based on a fixed duration i e 6 hours and 2 years ari i 62 is more appropriate as suggested by rahman et al 2015 and hence this is adopted in this study 2 3 3 shape factor shape factor sf can be calculated by dividing the shortest distance between the catchment outlet and catchment centroid by the square root of the catchment area rahman et al 2015 the variable sf can have direct impact on flood generation as it is a measure of how the catchment is shaped and how fast the runoff can be generated this is why sf is selected as a catchment characteristic for this study 2 3 4 stream density stream density or drainage density can be obtained by dividing the total length of all the streams and rivers in a catchment by the total area of that catchment it provides a measurement of how efficient the drainage mechanism is in a catchment both climatic and physical characteristics are responsible for a catchment s drainage density runoff generation can be affected by soil permeability and underlying rock type in a catchment impermeable ground or exposed bedrock leads to an increase in surface runoff and therefore can cause floods during a storm the shape of a streamflow hydrograph can be affected by stream density this is why stream density is chosen as a catchment characteristic for this study 2 3 5 forest forest cover is expressed as a fraction of catchment area forrested increase in forest area can slow down the flood generation process by infiltration recent increase in deforestation all over the world might have increased global flood risk it can have a notable effect on both physical and climatic condition of a catchment therefore forest is selected in this study the fraction of catchment covered by forest is estimated on 1 100 000 topographic maps by using a planimeter 2 3 6 mean annual rainfall mar although mar may not have a direct impact or a connection with flood peaks mar can still have a secondary effect by acting as surrogate for other catchment characteristics i e vegetation it is also quite easy to obtain therefore it is included in many studies thus in this study mar is included as a candidate predictor variable the mar data is obtained from australian bureau of meteorology bom provided cd 2 3 7 mean annual evapo transpiration mae the third influential climatic characteristic in flood generation process is considered to be mae similar to mar mae does not affect the flood peak directly but can produce a secondary effect by posing as a substitute for other catchment characteristics evapo transpiration can be defined as the amount of water lost from a water body through the combined effects of evaporation and transpiration from catchment vegetation to use mae as one of the selected characteristics data is obtained from the bom cd for a catchment the mae value at the centroid of the catchment is extracted 2 3 8 main stream slope s1085 the variable s1085 is selected in this study as it is easily obtainable and reported to be the one of the measures for prediction of mean floods benson 1959 from the different measures of slope variable s1085 values are determined from eq 3 3 s 1085 e 2 e 1 0 75 l where e 2 is the elevation at the 0 85l position along the mainstream e 1 is the elevation at the 0 10l position here l is the main stream length variable s1085 is measured in the unit of m km table 1 presents a summary of descriptive statistics of the selected catchment characteristics for the 88 study sites these characteristics data are used to extract ics to develop the icr models both in qrt and prt framework note that the selected catchments are mostly rural and not subjected to any major land use changes or regulation 2 4 data preparation and at site ffa accuracy of a regional flood prediction equations largely depends on quality of the available flood data and it is possible to have missing observations in streamflow records at gauging locations a number of nearby gauged sites are generally required for data in filling for one or two years to have a complete am flow records at a site the missing am flows are estimated by developing a regression equation that uses the am flow data from six nearest stations this method provides a close enough approximation of the missing data point although there can be a slight risk associated to over or under estimation of a missing data point although the nearby sites have different geo morphological characteristics there are similarity among them due to smooth spatial variability in climate indices such as rainfall and evaporation a regression equation is developed between the site with a data gap and the closest site from the nearby six sites these regression equations present a reasonable goodness of fit with a co efficient of determination value r 2 greater than 85 only about 2 of the am flow records are infilled for any single site which is likely to result in only minor impacts on flood quantile estimates at the site of interest to ensure the data is free from rating curve error an average and maximum cut off rating ratio rr of 4 and 20 are selected respectively as suggested by rahman et al 2015 although an appropriate rr cut off is maintained for quality controlled data detection of potentially influential low flows pilf from the flood data is an important step in ffa saf 2010 in case of the selected sites pilfs are identified and censored using flike software kuczera 1999 which uses a multiple grubbs and beck test as built in facility censoring of pilfs reduces the skew of the available data significantly flike is used to carry out the at site ffa in this study using log pearson type iii lp3 distribution with a bayesian fitting method to estimate flood quantiles for annual exceedance probability aeps of 50 20 10 5 2 and 1 the aep is defined as the probability of exceedance of a flood discharge in a single year these flood quantiles are used as dependent target variables in the rffa methods developed in this study censoring of pilfs via the flike software resulted in a better fitting of lp3 distribution to the observed am flood data at a given site 3 methods 3 1 homogeneity test investigation of potential homogeneous region from selected catchments is carried out based on the method proposed in hosking and wallis 1993 this method uses l moments of the observed am flood data l moments can be derived from linear combinations of pwms and used as scale and location parameters of a probability distribution then the l moment ratios i e coefficient of variation l cv skewness l skew and kurtosis l kurt are computed from the l moments which are plotted in a three dimensional space which creates a cloud of study sites any site s far from the centre of the cloud is considered to be discordant far is measured in terms of allowance of the correlation between the l moments mathematically a discordant site can be identified by using the following equation for site i 4 d i 1 3 u i u t s 1 u i u here ū is unweighted group average ui is vector containing the l moment ratios of site i and s is sample covariance matrix the discordancy measure di is used as a standard measure to consider a site to be discordant in the multivariate analysis as reported in hosking and wallis 1993 to identify a site to be discordant di 3 is suggested in hosking and wallis 1993 however they recommend that the data for sites with large di values should still be examined for possible errors for a region to be homogeneous the l moments population values should be same for all the sites in the region to examine the homogeneity of a group of sites a heterogeneity measure is suggested by hosking and wallis 1993 the method can be mathematically described as below let site i has record length ni and sample l moment ratios are t i t3 i and t4 i if the regional average l cv l sk and l kurt weighted by the sites record length are represented as tr t3 r and t4 r where 5 t r i 1 n n i t i i 1 n n i the weighted standard deviation can be found as below 6 v i 1 n n i t i t r 2 i 1 n n i 1 2 a kappa distribution is fitted to the regional average l moments and a large number of simulations are run to generate n sim of realisations of the region with n sites each having the same kappa distribution as its frequency distribution these simulated regions are homogeneous and have no cross correlation or serial correlation they have the same record length as their real counterparts for each simulated region v is calculated heterogeneity measure or the h statistics can be computed based on the v calculated for each simulated region by using eq 7 7 h v μ v σ v where μv and σv are the mean and standard deviation of n sim values of v respectively a region is declared as heterogeneous if h has a large value values of h less than 1 can indicate acceptably homogeneous region values in between 1 and 2 can mean possibly heterogeneous and h 2 indicates a definitely heterogeneous region hosking and wallis 1993 1997 discordant site and potential homogeneous region identification are done in three steps firstly the whole dataset of 88 sites is considered to be one group and all the discordant sites that are found after the application of discordancy measure are removed together at the same time and homogeneity of the region is examined by applying the heterogeneity measure on the second step each discordant site found from the discordancy measure considering 88 sites as one group is removed one at a time and the heterogeneity measure is calculated to investigate the homogeneity of the region in the last step the dataset is divided into two groups based on catchment area and discordancy and heterogeneity measures are applied to both the groups 3 2 independent component regression ica is a statistical technique that has a capability of decomposing observed multivariate data into statistically independent components ic these ics are expressed as the linear combinations of the predictor variables with minimum loss of information the following equation can represent the ica model parastar et al 2012 8 x a s e where x is the observed data matrix s and a represent the ics and the coefficient matrix respectively this x is called as the mixing matrix of the ics and e is the error matrix the two main assumptions associated with ica are as follows i the independent components are statistically independent and ii the independent components must have non gaussian distributions the objective of ica is to identify a proper linear representation of non gaussian vectors in order to have the estimated vectors as independent as possible and to represent the mixed data as a linear combination of the independent components the ica model is quite similar to the principal component analysis pca where the multivariate data are represented by the linear combination of some orthogonal principal components pc the difference is in the way of linear representation ica seeks to find ics whereas pca seeks to find orthogonal pcs independence is a much stronger condition than orthogonality because of its characteristics as high order statistics therefore ica is generally considered to be more powerful than pca in analysing multivariate data sets as it can imitate the inherent properties of the original data sets in a better way hyvärinen et al 2004 3 3 cumulative percent relevance in case of icr it is not possible to identify the most important ics for regression analysis by looking at their loading or eigen values as is possible in case of pca zhang et al 2018 suggested a method based on cumulative percent relevance cpr using the quality relevance contribution index qr ci for each ic to select the most valuable ics for regression analysis let s i r n i 1 2 m be the i th ic and y rn be the quality variable qr ci of si to y is defined as follows 9 con t si dco r 2 s i y i 1 m d c o r 2 s i y cpr is a measure of the cumulative percentage of quality relevance captured by the first k ics and can be measured by 10 c p r k 100 i 1 k c o n t si i 1 m c o n t si with this criterion one can select a desired threshold for cpr i e 85 90 or 95 3 4 evaluation statistics to assess the performance of the developed rffa models a loo validation technique is adopted based on loo a site is left out in each step while constructing a model i e this site is treated as an ungauged site the following performance statistics are calculated for each of the models for predicted flood quantile q pred and observed flood quantile q obs the following error statistics are calculated relative error re median absolute relative error rer q pred q obs ratio median q pred q obs ratio mean square error mse root mean square error rmse bias bias relative bias rbias relative root mean square error

distribution carried out using flike kuczera 1999 as mentioned before 4 results and discussion 4 1 homogeneity analysis the h statistics i e h1 h2 and h3 are found to be 13 44 10 06 and 5 96 respectively when all the 88 sites are considered as a single region to qualify for a homogeneous region a group of sites should have h statistics less than one hosking and wallis 1993 hence the selected 88 sites are highly heterogeneous the value of di is computed for the 88 sites based on hosking and wallis 1993 criteria sites having di 3 are regarded as discordant amongst these 88 sites four sites 203002 222016 401015 and 419029 are found to have di 3 the values of di for sites 203002 401015 and 419029 are 3 78 3 48 and 3 86 respectively the value of di for site 222016 is found to be the highest 6 05 removal of these four sites that have di 3 results in h statistics being equal to 11 74 8 73 and 4 74 respectively therefore no homogeneous regions are found at this stage furthermore after removing the four discordant sites two more sites are found to have di 3 these two new sites are 208001 and 222015 having di values of 3 37 and 3 69 respectively these two discordant sites are removed from the group of 84 sites and di and h statistics are computed for the group of 82 sites h statistics for this 82 sites are found to be 12 35 8 91 and 5 01 respectively this step also renders one more discordant site 204026 having di of 3 5 the new discordant site having di of 3 5 is removed from the 82 sites forming a new group of 81 sites and again the di and h statistics are computed for the group this step does not result in any other discordant site however h1 h2 and h3 for this latest group of 81 sites do not show any significant reduction in their h values which are 11 1 8 31 and 4 83 respectively it seems that the h statistics increases rather than a decrease after the removal of these discordant sites table 2 shows the h statistics computed while each of the discordant sites di 3 is removed one at a time from the 88 sites e g site 203002 is first removed and the h statistics are computed for the remaining 87 sites then site 203002 is placed back into the group the next site is removed and the h statistics are again computed for the 87 sites as before and so on when the first discordant site 203002 is removed from the 88 sites the other three discordant sites 222016 401015 and 419029 still remain discordant having di values of 6 05 3 95 and 3 81 respectively and the h statistics show no significant reduction which indicates that this group of sites is highly heterogeneous the removal of 222016 di 6 05 provides four more discordant sites and shows no significant effect on the h statistics removal of these discordant sites one at a time shows no significant effect on reduction of h statistics furthermore all the 88 sites are divided into two groups based on their drainage divisions to see whether homogeneous region can be established there are two drainage divisions here drainage divisions 2 and 4 group 1 consists of sites that are in drainage division 2 and there are total of 50 sites in this group whereas in group 2 there are a total of 38 sites belonging to drainage division 4 both di and h statistics are examined for these two groups and presented in tables 3a and 3b application of discordancy measure to both of the groups show two discordant sites from each group i e sites 203002 and 222016 from group 1 and sites 401015 and 419029 from group 2 the h statistics for group 1 are found to be 12 81 9 62 and 6 13 respectively and in case of group 2 they are found to be 5 84 3 89 and 1 64 respectively division of groups according to their drainage divisions yield no notable reduction in h statistics moreover additional application of the discordancy measure after removing the previously found discordant sites reveals no remarkable changes from the above results it can be concluded that perfect homogeneous regions cannot be established in nsw australia in the subsequent analyses all the 88 sites are included 4 2 independent component analysis ica the technique described in the methods section to extract ics from catchment characteristics data is applied to the 88 selected sites the r script program used for this study produces the mixing matrix the un mixing matrix and pre whitening matrix along with the ics and centred original data table 4 presents the mixing matrix which is derived from the original data using fastica method in r script and table 5 presents the un mixing matrix derived by transposing the mixing matrix the un mixing matrix is then used to derive the ics which then in turn are used as the independent variables in mlr looking at table 4 one can see that the values of the mixing variables can be as high as 237 32 and as low as 96 65 the highest values are found in case of variable one v1 ranging from 96 65 to 237 32 and the lowest values are found in case of variable three v3 ranging from 0 20 to 0 05 in table 5 all the values are quite small compared to table 4 as it is the transpose matrix of table 4 details of the generated ics are displayed in table 6 ica generates the same number of ics as the observed variables therefore each station 88 selected stations has eight ics the maximum positive ics are found in case of ic4 and the maximum negative ics are found in case of ic1 ic6 has exactly 50 of positive and negative ics the mean values of negative and positive ics range from 0 93 to 0 48 and 0 95 to 0 79 respectively which is presented in columns four and five of table 4 the median values for both negative and positive ics range from 0 98 to 0 38 and 0 96 to 0 32 respectively the maximum standard deviation is found in case of positive ics which is as high as 1 16 4 3 flood prediction model development regression models are developed using flood quantiles aeps of 50 20 10 5 2 and 1 as dependent variables and ics as predictor variables in both the qrt and prt framework note that to compare the results of the newly developed models to results of a traditionally used model a quantile regression is also carried out using the catchment characteristics as the predictors weerts et al 2011 haddad and rahman 2012 ahn and palmer 2016 in case of the traditional qrt the flood quantiles are naturally log transformed to achieve near normal distribution however for models using ics as predictors flood quantiles are left to their original state as mentioned earlier although ica is a powerful method the variance or energy and the order of the ics cannot be determined hyvärinen and oja 2000 therefore a stepwise selection procedure based on their level of significance p values and cpr described in zhang et al 2018 is used to select the ics that are important for model development stepwise selection of predictors based on their p values resulted in the following regression models for qrt qrt with ics qrt ic and prt with ics prt ic for the stepwise selection a value of p 0 10 is selected for a predictor to be significant in case of cpr cpr 0 20 is chosen as the selection criterion it can be seen from the following models that both predictor variable selection techniques have identified ic1 ic2 ic5 ic7 and ic8 to be the most important predictors for model development 19 ln q t β 0 β 1 ln a β 2 ln i 62 β 3 ln sf β 4 ln sden

black is for m4 orange is for m5 hot pink is for m6 yellow is for m7 and turquoise is for m8 these model names are also shown in table 7 where the r2 and the adjusted coefficient of determination adj

if other descriptive predictors are unavailable careful further assessment of the regression based model is necessary fig 2 shows the standardised residual vs the fitted value plots for models m1 to m8 all the standardised residual values are almost equally distributed around the zero line and lie between the ranges of 2 and also no specific pattern heteroscedasticity can be identified however in case of model m6 most of the standardised residuals lie between 1 having very few outliers fig 3 shows the predicted values q pred vs observed values q obs plots in case of m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m7 and m8 the points are randomly scattered specially for higher flows model m6 represents the best plot out of all the models however model m6 shows some cases of underestimation for few larger observations whereas models m7 and m8 show some overestimation in case of few observations there may be some possible outliers beyond the scale of the plots figs 4 and 5 show the boxplots q pred q obs ratios and re values of eight selected models and six selected aeps 50 20 10 5 2 and 1 respectively the expected line for fig 4 is set to one and for fig 5 it is set to zero as one and zero indicates higher similarities between predicted and observed values in both cases of q pred q obs ratios and re values respectively for fig 4 the boundary for the graph is set from 1 to 3 for q pred q obs ratios and for fig 5 it is set at 300 for re values looking at the boxplots it is evident that m1 and m2 have the smallest box sizes and the median lines go through the expected line in all the model cases error bars in case of m1 and m2 are seen to be quite small however there might be potential outliers that are not visible in the selected boundary size for both figs 4 and 5 the boxplots of q pred q obs ratios and re values for models m3 m4 and m5 for m3 m4 and m5 the quantile estimation are done using qrt where predictor ics are selected differently show that the box sizes for both q pred q obs ratios and re values are not too wide however for 50 2 and 1 aeps the median lines do not match the expected line in both cases of q pred q obs ratios and re values in case of 20 10 and 5 aeps the median lines pass through the expected lines the error bars for m3 m4 and m5 show that mostly in case of lower quantiles they are within the boundary area with possible outliers the error bars for higher quantiles are quite large some even going out of the boundary of the diagram with possible outliers for both q pred q obs ratios and re values for models m6 m7 and m8 for m6 m7 and m8 the quantile estimation is done using prt where predictor ics are selected differently from figs 4 and 5 it is evident that the box sizes are quite similar to that of the qrt methods in case of m7 and m8 it is seen that these two methods are overestimating the quantiles a little more than underestimating with disproportionate box sizes for 50 10 and 5 aeps in case of q pred q obs ratios and re values box size is slightly disproportionate for 10 to 1 aeps m8 seems to be the worst performing prt model among the three models m6 m7 and m8 with the median lines being notably away from the expected line for most of the aeps for both figs 4 and 5 model m6 which has all the predictor ics included in the quantile estimation has the smallest box size among models m6 m7 and m8 whereas m7 has slightly larger box size than m6 the median line for both m6 and m7 pass through the expected line in both cases of q pred q obs ratios and re values except in case of 50 aep the error bars for m6 m7 and m8 are found to be small and visible inside the boundary of the diagram with possible outliers the performances of these models in predicting flood quantiles are provided in table 8 using absolute re reabs and rer the relevant equations to compute rer are provided in section 3 4 it can be seen from table 8 that model m2 has the lowest rer 36 63 when all aeps are considered together the models m1 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 and m8 have a rer values 3 1 8 94 8 82 8 96 15 09 12 91 and 13 46 respectively which are higher than those of m2 tables 8 and 9 present the mean median and standard deviation of reabs and absolute q pred q obs ratio values for all selected models where lowest values are marked in blue from both the tables 8 and 9 it is evident that model m2 shows an overall better performance than the other seven models none of the qrt and prt models m3 m8 using ics present any low values in table 8 however m6 shows better result for 1 aep in case of all the aeps m8 shows better result for 20 aep for q pred q obs ratio values table 9 range of median reabs for m6 is seen to be in the range of 47 to 59 whereas the range for m2 is 33 to 44 for table 9 the range of median absolute q pred q obs ratio values for m6 is found to be 0 93 to 1 24 whereas the range for m2 is found to be 0 92 to 1 02 note that this is a representation of absolute values which does not show the actual distribution of the re or q pred q obs ratio values for any of the models for further investigation statistical evaluations such as mse rmse bias rbias rrmse rmsne rer and median absolute q pred q obs ratios are examined based on the observed and predicted values for the 5 aep flood quantile for the eight selected models table 10 summarises the evaluation statistics from loo i e mse rmse bias rbias rrmse rmsne rer and median absolute q pred q obs ratios based on the observed and predicted values for the 5 aep flood for eight selected models these evaluation criteria are commonly used in rffa for cross validation purposes ilorme and griffis 2013 pandey and nguyen 1999 haddad and rahman 2012 the reason behind choosing 5 aep flood is that it is a commonly used flood quantile in ffa a small value of mse is preferable however from table 10 it is seen that mse values for the selected models are quite high the lowest value 110166 for mse is found in case of m1 the mse values for m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 and m8 range from 140 000 to 1800 000 for a model to be acceptable rmse should be relatively small in case of the selected models rmse values lie in the range of 331 to 1311 which is quite high the lowest rmse 331 is found for m1 a recent study by durocher et al 2018 in southern quebec canada found rmse as 38 and 45 in case of 10 and 1 aep floods by using spatial copula method a number of studies chokmani and ouarda 2004 chebana et al 2014 shu and ouarda 2007 found rmse values in the range 41 to 51 for 10 aep flood and 49 to 70 for 1 aep flood using ordinary kriging in pca space generalised additive model gam and single artificial neural network ann for the same dataset in quebec looking into bias one can see that the lowest positive bias 0 66 is found for m5 model m2 shows the highest negative bias of 52 94 which indicates an overall under estimation by the model and m6 shows the highest positive bias of 159 53 which indicates an overall over estimation by the model in terms of rbias the lowest value is found in case of m2 22 40 for rest of the models the rbias values range from 24 48 to 68 93 in case of the studies carried out by durocher et al 2018 chokmani and ouarda 2004 chebana et al 2014 and shu and ouarda 2007 rbias values were found in the range 5 to 20 for 10 aep flood and 7 to 27 for 1 aep flood in case of rrmse except m6 the other models perform quite well with rrmse being less than 10 rmsne for the developed models are found in the range of 0 95 to 3 6 which is quite larger than the range reported in rosbjerg et al 2013 in rosbjerg et al 2013 regression analysis is applied for flood prediction using data from all over the world excluding australia and rmsne is found in the range of 0 5 to 0 65 the highest value in the present study is found for model m5 and lowest for m2 note that australia is highly heterogeneous and flood prediction is much more challenging than the rest of the world haddad and rahman 2012 examination of the rer and median q pred q obs ratios for each of the models provides a clear view of m2 having the lowest rer 33 28 and m1 having the lowest q pred q obs ratio 1 00 however model m6 shows the highest rer of 53 69 and m8 shows the lowest q pred q obs ratio of 0 81 the ranges of rer for all the models are 33 54 and the ranges of q pred q obs ratio values are 0 81 1 08 overall from tables 8 9 it can be seen that m2 is the better performing model than the rest of the models it may be emphasised that rer is a single statistic and may not provide a true model performance and hence we prepared figs 6 and 7 where all the models are compared with respect to reabs next a plot of cumulative percentage of reabs for eight selected models fig 6 is examined looking at fig 6 in case of models m1 and m2 85 of the sites show the reabs values in the range of 0 to 99 for 5 aep flood in case of m6 and m8 it seems that 84 and 78 respectively of the sites show a reabs in the range of 0 to 99 for 5 aep flood around 60 sites in case of m2 and 45 sites in case of m6 show reabs values in the range of 0 to 49 the overall performance of models m2 and m6 are comparable model 1 m1 has eight predictor variables and model 2 m2 has only four predictor variables however in terms of rer m2 performs better rer of 36 63 than m1 rer of 39 73 in fig 6 it is also found that m2 performs better than m1 also m2 is preferable to m1 as per model parsimony principle tables 11 and 12 show the number of stations performing fair poor and good in case of m2 and m6 based on their re values and q pred q obs ratios the range of fair poor and good are arbitrarily decided based on the following values re values from 30 to 30 is good from 60 to 60 fair and beyond 60 is poor similarly q pred q obs ratio values from 0 80 to 1 3 is deemed to be good from 0 60 to 2 fair and less than 0 6 to greater than 2 is poor it can be seen from both tables that for all the selected aeps m2 displays greater number of sites performing good 31 to 41 stations in case of median re values and 22 and 34 stations in case of q pred q obs ratio however m6 displays that not many sites perform good 20 to 27 stations in case of median re values and 17 to 21 stations in case of q pred q obs ratio therefore it is clear from the above discussion that the best performing model is m2 with four predictor variables 4 4 comparison with arr rffa model in this section a comparison of reabs values between arr rffa model rahman et al 2019 and models m2 and m6 is presented a baysian gls parameter regression technique is used to develop the rffa model to estimate regional flood quantiles for arr rffa model in case of australian flood data haddad and rahman 2012 rahman et al 2015 in fig 7 the cumulative percentage values of reabs for arr rffa and models m2 and m6 are compared for the six selected aeps blue solid lines represent cumulative percent reabs for the arr rffa model red is for model m2 and green is for model m6 in fig 7 looking at fig 7 it is evident that for all the six aeps around 60 of the stations show their re values are in the range of 0 to 49 for all the three models a few of the sites show a gross over estimation in case of all the three models represented in fig 7 models m2 seem to outperform the arr rffa model and m6 performs in a similar way as the arr rffa model the reabs values for arr rffa model and models m2 and m6 are compared in table 13 it is evident from table 13 that the reabs values for arr rffa model ranging from 56 to 64 are greater than both the m2 and m6 models reabs values ranging from 33 to 44 for m2 and 47 to 59 for m6 one possible reason for these differences in reabs values by the two methods may be that arr rffa model is developed with the data from 558 stations from nsw victoria and queensland states of australia whereas m2 and m6 are developed for 88 sites in nsw i e data sets are different however it is promising to see that the reabs values from models m2 and m6 are comparable to the reabs values of arr rffa model from this research it can be stated that icr can be a viable method to estimate regional flood quantiles in case of australia even though the homogeneity criteria are not fulfilled further research with additional catchments from a wider australian region is warranted to confirm the reliability of icr in rffa in australia 5 conclusion in rffa predictor variables are often highly correlated which causes instability in regression analysis ica generates individual ics from the raw predictor variables that are uncorrelated and independent which can be used in rffa the performance of ica in rffa is assessed in this study using data from 88 catchments in nsw australia a homogeneity analysis is first carried out which resulted in no acceptable homogeneous region in nsw the ica is then applied with both qrt and prt framework it is found that prt model performs better with ica than qrt model developed with mlr shows that it performs slightly better than the prt with ica model one shortcoming of ica may be noted that this method does not give any loading on individual ics as can be found for pca therefore predictor variable selection is carried out using level of significance and cpr values this results into mlr model having four predictors i e catchment area rainfall intensity shape factor and stream density selected based on their level of significance the prt model with all the ics perform better than the seven other models the developed models are validated using loo and assessed using various statistical evaluation measures the rffa studies conducted in many other parts of the world e g durocher et al 2016 2018 chokmani and ouarda 2004 chebana et al 2014 shu and ouarda 2007 rosbjerg et al 2013 have shown better performances than this study and other australian studies in general e g haddad and rahman 2012 however the relative errors of our models are found to be comparable to arr rffa rahman et al 2019 ball et al 2019 model the results of this study reveal that ica is a viable modelling option in rffa that is easy to implement it is recommended to add more descriptive catchment characteristics to ica to have more ics in the analysis and to enhance its relative accuracy the finding of this study is expected to encourage other researchers worldwide to apply ica in rffa credit

hydrology biogeochemistry and ecology olefeldt et al 2017 in particular hydrological regimes play a vital role in controlling physical chemical and biological environments poff et al 1997 as noted by mitsch and gosselink 2015 hydrology is probably the single most important determinant of the establishment and maintenance of specific types of wetland over the past several decades increases in the frequency and magnitude of climate extremes knapp et al 2015 in combination with anthropogenic activities e g water level controls from the construction of dams and sluices throughout the world have dramatically altered wetland hydrological regimes kong et al 2017 alterations to hydrological regimes have contributed to the widespread loss and degradation of wetlands globally millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 junk et al 2013 davidson 2014 gardner et al 2015 in order to protect and restore wetland ecosystems several water regulation strategies have been enacted such as ecological water transfer projects e g jiang et al 2016 and water level controls e g kong et al 2017 ecological water transfer projects tend to cause abrupt wetland flooding resulting in a corresponding abrupt rise in water levels which subsequently cause abrupt changes to the biological processes of wetlands martínez santos et al 2008 however the typical objective of water level controls is to increase minimum water levels and reduce seasonal water level fluctuations coops et al 2003 unfortunately the ecological effects of water regulation strategies have yet to receive the scientific and societal attention they deserve which has led to a series of problems in this context to explore the ecological response of water level fluctuations and to quantify suitable ecological water levels for the different wetland hydrological statuses have gained increasing attention particularly concerning the effective protection and restoration of wetlands e g kingsford 2000 yuan et al 2015 liu et al 2017 reis et al 2017 furthermore alterations to both vegetation cover and open water have inevitably affected radiative and aerodynamic variables e g net radiation wind speed and vapor pressure which have subsequently altered evapotranspiration et sánchez carrillo et al 2004 guan and wilson 2009 consequently the objectives of this study were i to assess suitable water levels for wetlands taking into account the response of vegetation to water level fluctuations under different hydrological statuses ii to simulate vegetation patterns accounting for suitable water levels typical of wetland vegetation and iii to estimate et along with alterations in vegetation cover and open water under different hydrological statuses in a typical shallow water wetland namely the jilin momoge national nature reserve china considering that wetland habitat varies with hydrological regimes and vegetation cover this study also addressed the implications of wetland restoration in the section 5 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site the jilin momoge national nature reserve in the western region of jilin province northeast china covers an area of 1440 km2 the reserve has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 385 7 mm and an average annual temperature of 4 97 c jiang et al 2015 this reserve plays a key role in regulating regional climate conditions conserving biodiversity and protecting endangered water bird species dong et al 2013 owing to this the reserve has received significant attention from international organizations such as the world wildlife fund wwf the global environment facility gef and the international crane foundation icf pan et al 2006 impacted by both climate change and anthropogenic activity however the reserve has shown signs of degradation due to a loss in its natural hydrological regimes previously maintained by floodwater inflow from the nenjiang river the tao er river and the erlongtao river jiang et al 2016 the reserve was established in 1981 to protect and restore wetlands in this region of china in 1997 it was added to the list of national nature reserves of china and in 2013 it was designated a ramsar site i e a wetland of international importance in order to restore this wetland and provide habitat for its bird communities particularly for siberian crane which is listed as a threatened species in the red list of the international union for conservation of nature iucn birdlife international 2012 a wetland restoration project was implemented from 2002 to 2008 to increase water supplies into the reserve through water diversion and a causeway project from the nenjiang river jiang et al 2016 however water level alterations in the ertou wetland resulting from ecological water transfer projects have not been able to effectively maintain expectant improvements namely providing habitat for the siberian crane grus leucogeranus jiang et al 2016 moreover the lack of effective water management strategies is likely a key cause of siberian crane habitat quality degradation in the ertou wetland in particular water diverted from paddy fields have also played a critical role in increasing water levels in this wetland 2 2 materials and field experiments 1 meteorological data this study used 1961 2016 daily time series data of air temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine hours and precipitation from 14 meteorological stations under the authority of the national climatic centre of the china meteorological administration see fig 1 the pearson type iii curve was used to explore different hydrological statuses ascertained from annual precipitation which was calculated from daily precipitation the rank order of precipitation frequency used to define the hydrological status of floods normal conditions and droughts is as follows 12 5 p 37 5 37 5 p 62 5 and 62 5 p 87 5 respectively annual precipitation in combination with digital elevation model dem data were used to deduce suitable water levels for the different hydrological statuses in the ertou wetland daily air temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hour data obtained from the zhenlai meteorological

https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov modis ndvi data of the ertou wetland were used to estimate vegetation patterns applying fourier analysis results were validated from vegetation patterns obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle uav and landsat 8 satellite remote sensing images at october 2016 and october 2017 3 generation of the high resolution wetland digital elevation model dem in order to deduce suitable water levels for the different hydrological statuses we measured the relative elevation of 1542 points using the sounding rods while the altitude of the ertou wetland was determined at 6 points using the real time kinematic technique we obtained a high resolution dem of the ertou wetland by combining the relative elevation and altitude data using arcgis 10 0 4 field data used to assess suitable water levels for typical wetland vegetation quadrats were established within the ertou wetland during the growing season from may to october these quadrats were based on three transects set in areas of phragmites australis and bolboschoenus planiculmis growth seven 0 5 m 0 5 m quadrats were established in each transect at a depth from 10 cm to 50 cm at 10 cm intervals from the surface to the bottom of water wherein 0 cm was the boundary between land and water five 0 5 m 0 5 m quadrats were additionally established at a depth from 10 cm to 30 cm in the same manner to investigate p australis and b planiculmis in total 36 quadrats were investigated on a monthly basis plant community parameters including coverage height seedling number and biomass were recorded each month the biomass of two types of vegetation was estimated by their dry weight 80 c the average value of each parameter was used to reflect vegetation characteristics suitable water levels were estimated using vegetation parameters at different water depths an et al 2018 3 methods 3 1 appropriate water levels during different hydrological statuses water level fluctuations generally alter ratios between open water and vegetation cover moreover it is difficult to ascertain historical water levels in this region due to a lack of continuous data in combination with annual precipitation

water levels for flood normal and drought statuses in the ertou wetland vegetation patterns obtained from fourier analysis were compared to those obtained from the interpretation of uav and landsat images according to the comparison between these two methods table 1 fourier analysis generated optimal results of vegetation patterns wherein the agreement between fourier classifications and image interpretations was 75 19 and the kappa coefficient k reached 0 55 table 1 vegetation patterns varied along with alterations in water level fluctuations fig 2 and the ratio between vegetation cover and open water ranged from 0 07 under the 2008 drought status to 0 16 under the 2012 flood status in the jilin momoge national nature reserve between 2006 and 2015 fig 2 combined with dem values derived from the ertou wetland it can be deduced that nonlinear relationships between annual precipitation and associative water levels were as follows 5 l 0 16 0 17 p 11 92 0 43 where l represents water level and p represents precipitation annual precipitation during flood normal and drought flow statuses was 506 8 386 5 and 273 1 mm respectively shown in table 2 combined with high resolution dem suitable water levels for the ertou wetland were calculated at 1 23 0 99 and 0 81 m during flood normal and drought statuses respectively 2 simulation of vegetation patterns with water level fluctuations ecological indicators of p australis and b planiculmis are respectively provided in fig 2 and fig 3 from these indicators we can deduce that i water levels played a vital role in controlling vegetation height biomass production vegetation cover and seedling numbers ii for p australis seedling numbers differed slightly under different water levels heights vegetation cover and biomass and vegetation cover was high in areas where water levels ranged from 30 to 50 cm and iii for b planiculmis high values in seedling numbers vegetation cover and biomass were observed when water levels ranged from 0 to 20 cm combined with results from an et al 2018 and li 2013 we can deduce that the suitable water level range for b planiculmis seedlings is 5 to 30 cm table 3 combined with suitable water levels we simulated p australis and b planiculmis distribution along with open water for the different hydrological statuses as seen in fig 4 and table 4 results showed that i open water to vegetation cover ratios varied with water level fluctuations namely 1 67 0 83 and 0 48 respectively during flood normal and drought statuses ii a decrease in water level resulted in the expansion of both p australis and b planiculmis and open water area decreased with a decrease in water level iii the area percentage of p australis during the flood status was 34 9 while it reached 51 4 and 60 4 under the normal and drought statuses respectively the corresponding area percentages of b planiculmis were 2 56 3 68 and 7 22 during flood normal and drought statuses respectively and iv the corresponding ratios between b planiculmis and p australis were 7 6 and 12 during flood normal and drought statuses respectively 3 varying evapotranspiration assessments with water level fluctuations this study assessed et which was calculated using the tvet model in combination with vegetation cover dynamics figs 5 and 6 annual pet and pet values during the initial middle and end stages of the growing season were also calculated for the two species results showed that i annual pet exhibited a decreasing trend with a slope of 7 43 mm a 2 while pet yielded values of 2 59 5 17 and 3 92 mm a 2 respectively during the early middle and end growth stages on the other hand ii pe and pt exhibited opposing trends which was caused by the vegetation cover effect wherein pt reached a peak in august and september while pe only yielded low values during these two months fig 5b annual pe pt and pet of the flood normal and drought statuses fig 6 showed that pet exhibited an increasing trend with a decrease in water level during flood normal and drought statuses moreover pt increased with an increase in water level while the opposite was true for pe 5 discussion 5 1 ecological response of hydrological regimes as shown in fig 2 vegetation patterns varied with alterations in hydrological regimes the causes for this variation were primarily due to the affinities that certain individual plant species and communities have for and have developed to physiological adaptations to specific water depth ranges and water level fluctuations can result in a shifting mosaic of wetland vegetation types budelsky and galatowitsch 2000 wilcox and nichols 2008 this can also be drawn from figs 3 and 4 which show the effect of water levels on vegetation cover height seedling number and biomass production of both p australis and b planiculmis vegetation characteristics that vary with water levels during different growth stages signify that suitable ecological water levels should differ between different plant communities or the same plant communities during different growing stages many studies have been conducted on the ecological response of water level alterations e g deng et al 2012 li 2013 liu et al 2016 an et al 2018 in fact subtle fluctuations in water levels during critical periods e g the germination stage will dramatically affect the distribution of plant communities for example an et al 2018 found that the water table 5 cm below the soil surface significantly increased the emergence rate and emergence speed of b planiculmis tubers planted at a 5 cm soil depth in particular effects on vegetation cover alteration that resulted from extreme water level changes on regime shifts have caused great attention being focused towards sustaining the integrity of shallow wetland environments kong et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the alteration in ratios between vegetation cover and open water are significantly influenced by fluctuations in varying frequencies and amplitudes e g spence 1982 sánchez carrillo et al 2004 wilcox and nichols 2008 resulting in the open water area to macrophyte cover ratio to be significantly dependent on inundation sánchez carrillo et al 2004 which inevitably alters the partition of pet into pe and pt as shown in figs 6 and 7 main reasons behind changes in et in conjunction with water level fluctuations are as follows i the macrophyte to open water ratio changes with water level fluctuations e g sánchez carrillo et al 2004 ii macrophyte growth during different growth stages alters the partition of solar radiation used for evaporation and transpiration which means that the leaf area index lai plays a vital role in determining pet e g zhou and zhou 2009 and iii macrophyte growth also influences aerodynamic resistance resulting in et changes during different growth stages guan and wilson 2009 due to the structural differences of wetlands under different hydrological statuses particularly the fraction of open water to vegetation cover such differences will have a significant impact on et dynamics eichelmann et al 2018 fleischmann et al 2018 and using pet to assess annual variability in et could help determine suitable water levels to safeguard wetland systems anda et al 2017 5 2 implications for shallow water wetland restoration wetland restoration refers to the recovery of a wetland to a pristine state following a disturbance or an alteration caused by anthropogenic activities or extreme climate change mitsch and gosselink 2007 reich and lake 2015 as categorized by ruiz jaen and aide 2005 the three ecological attributes used to assess the success of ecological restoration are diversity vegetation structure and ecological processes this means that using hydrology or ecological processes alone to assess wetland restoration projects are insufficient coupling mechanisms between hydrology vegetation and habitat in wetland ecosystems have to be clarified in developing wetland restoration techniques zhao et al 2016 namely the clarification of ecological water transfer techniques jiang et al 2016 soil seed bank restoration approaches bossuyt and honnay 2008 and habitat replacement and compensation policies quigley and harper 2006 as shown in fig 4 alterations to drought flood conditions constitute a fluctuating environment for wetland plant growth while also altering the habitat of typical wetland bird species such as the siberian crane for example efforts to restore wetlands in the jilin momoge national nature reserve have played an important role in the protection of suitable stopover habitats for siberian crane through means of the regulation of water transfer projects bysykatova et al 2010 jiang et al 2016 however persistent high water levels

hydrology biogeochemistry and ecology olefeldt et al 2017 in particular hydrological regimes play a vital role in controlling physical chemical and biological environments poff et al 1997 as noted by mitsch and gosselink 2015 hydrology is probably the single most important determinant of the establishment and maintenance of specific types of wetland over the past several decades increases in the frequency and magnitude of climate extremes knapp et al 2015 in combination with anthropogenic activities e g water level controls from the construction of dams and sluices throughout the world have dramatically altered wetland hydrological regimes kong et al 2017 alterations to hydrological regimes have contributed to the widespread loss and degradation of wetlands globally millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 junk et al 2013 davidson 2014 gardner et al 2015 in order to protect and restore wetland ecosystems several water regulation strategies have been enacted such as ecological water transfer projects e g jiang et al 2016 and water level controls e g kong et al 2017 ecological water transfer projects tend to cause abrupt wetland flooding resulting in a corresponding abrupt rise in water levels which subsequently cause abrupt changes to the biological processes of wetlands martínez santos et al 2008 however the typical objective of water level controls is to increase minimum water levels and reduce seasonal water level fluctuations coops et al 2003 unfortunately the ecological effects of water regulation strategies have yet to receive the scientific and societal attention they deserve which has led to a series of problems in this context to explore the ecological response of water level fluctuations and to quantify suitable ecological water levels for the different wetland hydrological statuses have gained increasing attention particularly concerning the effective protection and restoration of wetlands e g kingsford 2000 yuan et al 2015 liu et al 2017 reis et al 2017 furthermore alterations to both vegetation cover and open water have inevitably affected radiative and aerodynamic variables e g net radiation wind speed and vapor pressure which have subsequently altered evapotranspiration et sánchez carrillo et al 2004 guan and wilson 2009 consequently the objectives of this study were i to assess suitable water levels for wetlands taking into account the response of vegetation to water level fluctuations under different hydrological statuses ii to simulate vegetation patterns accounting for suitable water levels typical of wetland vegetation and iii to estimate et along with alterations in vegetation cover and open water under different hydrological statuses in a typical shallow water wetland namely the jilin momoge national nature reserve china considering that wetland habitat varies with hydrological regimes and vegetation cover this study also addressed the implications of wetland restoration in the section 5 2 study site and materials 2 1 study site the jilin momoge national nature reserve in the western region of jilin province northeast china covers an area of 1440 km2 the reserve has a temperate continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 385 7 mm and an average annual temperature of 4 97 c jiang et al 2015 this reserve plays a key role in regulating regional climate conditions conserving biodiversity and protecting endangered water bird species dong et al 2013 owing to this the reserve has received significant attention from international organizations such as the world wildlife fund wwf the global environment facility gef and the international crane foundation icf pan et al 2006 impacted by both climate change and anthropogenic activity however the reserve has shown signs of degradation due to a loss in its natural hydrological regimes previously maintained by floodwater inflow from the nenjiang river the tao er river and the erlongtao river jiang et al 2016 the reserve was established in 1981 to protect and restore wetlands in this region of china in 1997 it was added to the list of national nature reserves of china and in 2013 it was designated a ramsar site i e a wetland of international importance in order to restore this wetland and provide habitat for its bird communities particularly for siberian crane which is listed as a threatened species in the red list of the international union for conservation of nature iucn birdlife international 2012 a wetland restoration project was implemented from 2002 to 2008 to increase water supplies into the reserve through water diversion and a causeway project from the nenjiang river jiang et al 2016 however water level alterations in the ertou wetland resulting from ecological water transfer projects have not been able to effectively maintain expectant improvements namely providing habitat for the siberian crane grus leucogeranus jiang et al 2016 moreover the lack of effective water management strategies is likely a key cause of siberian crane habitat quality degradation in the ertou wetland in particular water diverted from paddy fields have also played a critical role in increasing water levels in this wetland 2 2 materials and field experiments 1 meteorological data this study used 1961 2016 daily time series data of air temperature relative humidity wind speed sunshine hours and precipitation from 14 meteorological stations under the authority of the national climatic centre of the china meteorological administration see fig 1 the pearson type iii curve was used to explore different hydrological statuses ascertained from annual precipitation which was calculated from daily precipitation the rank order of precipitation frequency used to define the hydrological status of floods normal conditions and droughts is as follows 12 5 p 37 5 37 5 p 62 5 and 62 5 p 87 5 respectively annual precipitation in combination with digital elevation model dem data were used to deduce suitable water levels for the different hydrological statuses in the ertou wetland daily air temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hour data obtained from the zhenlai meteorological

https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov modis ndvi data of the ertou wetland were used to estimate vegetation patterns applying fourier analysis results were validated from vegetation patterns obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle uav and landsat 8 satellite remote sensing images at october 2016 and october 2017 3 generation of the high resolution wetland digital elevation model dem in order to deduce suitable water levels for the different hydrological statuses we measured the relative elevation of 1542 points using the sounding rods while the altitude of the ertou wetland was determined at 6 points using the real time kinematic technique we obtained a high resolution dem of the ertou wetland by combining the relative elevation and altitude data using arcgis 10 0 4 field data used to assess suitable water levels for typical wetland vegetation quadrats were established within the ertou wetland during the growing season from may to october these quadrats were based on three transects set in areas of phragmites australis and bolboschoenus planiculmis growth seven 0 5 m 0 5 m quadrats were established in each transect at a depth from 10 cm to 50 cm at 10 cm intervals from the surface to the bottom of water wherein 0 cm was the boundary between land and water five 0 5 m 0 5 m quadrats were additionally established at a depth from 10 cm to 30 cm in the same manner to investigate p australis and b planiculmis in total 36 quadrats were investigated on a monthly basis plant community parameters including coverage height seedling number and biomass were recorded each month the biomass of two types of vegetation was estimated by their dry weight 80 c the average value of each parameter was used to reflect vegetation characteristics suitable water levels were estimated using vegetation parameters at different water depths an et al 2018 3 methods 3 1 appropriate water levels during different hydrological statuses water level fluctuations generally alter ratios between open water and vegetation cover moreover it is difficult to ascertain historical water levels in this region due to a lack of continuous data in combination with annual precipitation vegetation cover and dem data appendix a shows the method used to calculate suitable water levels during different hydrological statuses 3 2 vegetation dynamic simulation model cellular automaton is defined by a set of units i e s n and f under a set language as follows wolfram 1984 2 s t 1 f s t n where s is a finite set and represents the cell state t denotes the transition step f is the transition rule or function and n is the amount of cell neighbors cellular automata have been widely used to simulate population dynamics of vegetation species e g huang et al 2008 qi et al 2018 in this study we used the model modified by huang et al 2008 to simulate p australis and b planiculmis dynamics in the ertou wetland appendix b provides detail on the model used to simulate vegetation

requiring readily available climate i e radiation temperature vapor pressure and wind speed and vegetation characteristics vegetation patterns were simulated by the vegetation dynamic simulation model on an annual scale furthermore vegetation patterns were also simulated under different hydrological statuses such as flood normal conditions and drought tvet model expressions proposed by guan and

water levels for flood normal and drought statuses in the ertou wetland vegetation patterns obtained from fourier analysis were compared to those obtained from the interpretation of uav and landsat images according to the comparison between these two methods table 1 fourier analysis generated optimal results of vegetation patterns wherein the agreement between fourier classifications and image interpretations was 75 19 and the kappa coefficient k reached 0 55 table 1 vegetation patterns varied along with alterations in water level fluctuations fig 2 and the ratio between vegetation cover and open water ranged from 0 07 under the 2008 drought status to 0 16 under the 2012 flood status in the jilin momoge national nature reserve between 2006 and 2015 fig 2 combined with dem values derived from the ertou wetland it can be deduced that nonlinear relationships between annual precipitation and associative water levels were as follows 5 l 0 16 0 17 p 11 92 0 43 where l represents water level and p represents precipitation annual precipitation during flood normal and drought flow statuses was 506 8 386 5 and 273 1 mm respectively shown in table 2 combined with high resolution dem suitable water levels for the ertou wetland were calculated at 1 23 0 99 and 0 81 m during flood normal and drought statuses respectively 2 simulation of vegetation patterns with water level fluctuations ecological indicators of p australis and b planiculmis are respectively provided in fig 2 and fig 3 from these indicators we can deduce that i water levels played a vital role in controlling vegetation height biomass production vegetation cover and seedling numbers ii for p australis seedling numbers differed slightly under different water levels heights vegetation cover and biomass and vegetation cover was high in areas where water levels ranged from 30 to 50 cm and iii for b planiculmis high values in seedling numbers vegetation cover and biomass were observed when water levels ranged from 0 to 20 cm combined with results from an et al 2018 and li 2013 we can deduce that the suitable water level range for b planiculmis seedlings is 5 to 30 cm table 3 combined with suitable water levels we simulated p australis and b planiculmis distribution along with open water for the different hydrological statuses as seen in fig 4 and table 4 results showed that i open water to vegetation cover ratios varied with water level fluctuations namely 1 67 0 83 and 0 48 respectively during flood normal and drought statuses ii a decrease in water level resulted in the expansion of both p australis and b planiculmis and open water area decreased with a decrease in water level iii the area percentage of p australis during the flood status was 34 9 while it reached 51 4 and 60 4 under the normal and drought statuses respectively the corresponding area percentages of b planiculmis were 2 56 3 68 and 7 22 during flood normal and drought statuses respectively and iv the corresponding ratios between b planiculmis and p australis were 7 6 and 12 during flood normal and drought statuses respectively 3 varying evapotranspiration assessments with water level fluctuations this study assessed et which was calculated using the tvet model in combination with vegetation cover dynamics figs 5 and 6 annual pet and pet values during the initial middle and end stages of the growing season were also calculated for the two species results showed that i annual pet exhibited a decreasing trend with a slope of 7 43 mm a 2 while pet yielded values of 2 59 5 17 and 3 92 mm a 2 respectively during the early middle and end growth stages on the other hand ii pe and pt exhibited opposing trends which was caused by the vegetation cover effect wherein pt reached a peak in august and september while pe only yielded low values during these two months fig 5b annual pe pt and pet of the flood normal and drought statuses fig 6 showed that pet exhibited an increasing trend with a decrease in water level during flood normal and drought statuses moreover pt increased with an increase in water level while the opposite was true for pe 5 discussion 5 1 ecological response of hydrological regimes as shown in fig 2 vegetation patterns varied with alterations in hydrological regimes the causes for this variation were primarily due to the affinities that certain individual plant species and communities have for and have developed to physiological adaptations to specific water depth ranges and water level fluctuations can result in a shifting mosaic of wetland vegetation types budelsky and galatowitsch 2000 wilcox and nichols 2008 this can also be drawn from figs 3 and 4 which show the effect of water levels on vegetation cover height seedling number and biomass production of both p australis and b planiculmis vegetation characteristics that vary with water levels during different growth stages signify that suitable ecological water levels should differ between different plant communities or the same plant communities during different growing stages many studies have been conducted on the ecological response of water level alterations e g deng et al 2012 li 2013 liu et al 2016 an et al 2018 in fact subtle fluctuations in water levels during critical periods e g the germination stage will dramatically affect the distribution of plant communities for example an et al 2018 found that the water table 5 cm below the soil surface significantly increased the emergence rate and emergence speed of b planiculmis tubers planted at a 5 cm soil depth in particular effects on vegetation cover alteration that resulted from extreme water level changes on regime shifts have caused great attention being focused towards sustaining the integrity of shallow wetland environments kong et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the alteration in ratios between vegetation cover and open water are significantly influenced by fluctuations in varying frequencies and amplitudes e g spence 1982 sánchez carrillo et al 2004 wilcox and nichols 2008 resulting in the open water area to macrophyte cover ratio to be significantly dependent on inundation sánchez carrillo et al 2004 which inevitably alters the partition of pet into pe and pt as shown in figs 6 and 7 main reasons behind changes in et in conjunction with water level fluctuations are as follows i the macrophyte to open water ratio changes with water level fluctuations e g sánchez carrillo et al 2004 ii macrophyte growth during different growth stages alters the partition of solar radiation used for evaporation and transpiration which means that the leaf area index lai plays a vital role in determining pet e g zhou and zhou 2009 and iii macrophyte growth also influences aerodynamic resistance resulting in et changes during different growth stages guan and wilson 2009 due to the structural differences of wetlands under different hydrological statuses particularly the fraction of open water to vegetation cover such differences will have a significant impact on et dynamics eichelmann et al 2018 fleischmann et al 2018 and using pet to assess annual variability in et could help determine suitable water levels to safeguard wetland systems anda et al 2017 5 2 implications for shallow water wetland restoration wetland restoration refers to the recovery of a wetland to a pristine state following a disturbance or an alteration caused by anthropogenic activities or extreme climate change mitsch and gosselink 2007 reich and lake 2015 as categorized by ruiz jaen and aide 2005 the three ecological attributes used to assess the success of ecological restoration are diversity vegetation structure and ecological processes this means that using hydrology or ecological processes alone to assess wetland restoration projects are insufficient coupling mechanisms between hydrology vegetation and habitat in wetland ecosystems have to be clarified in developing wetland restoration techniques zhao et al 2016 namely the clarification of ecological water transfer techniques jiang et al 2016 soil seed bank restoration approaches bossuyt and honnay 2008 and habitat replacement and compensation policies quigley and harper 2006 as shown in fig 4 alterations to drought flood conditions constitute a fluctuating environment for wetland plant growth while also altering the habitat of typical wetland bird species such as the siberian crane for example efforts to restore wetlands in the jilin momoge national nature reserve have played an important role in the protection of suitable stopover habitats for siberian crane through means of the regulation of water transfer projects bysykatova et al 2010 jiang et al 2016 however persistent high water levels resulting from water diversion from paddy fields have also led to a reduction in b planiculmis while further reducing suitable stopover habitats for siberian crane jiang et al 2016 due to the fact that shorebirds typically require much shallower water levels wetlands with lower topographic roughness may have a higher potential in providing suitable shorebird habitat while strategically reducing
