20095,time lapse 4d geophysics for monitoring subsurface processes comes as an emerging area of hydrogeophysics the combined use of non invasive or minimally invasive geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity time domain induced polarization complex resistivity and self potential along with traditional approaches have become commonly used to image the near surface the use of these geophysical methods is of increasing interest as these techniques provide spatial and temporal imaging of the subsurface processes that otherwise can only be measured at few specific spatial locations this review discusses the studies carried out using 4d geophysics to monitor contaminant transport affecting subsurface water and hence potentially impacting water security of groundwater dependent communities as well as ecosystems relying on shallow drainage from landfills this article highlights a series of the recent case studies from different parts of the world novel trends and their potential applications to support water security in the indian scenario keywords time lapse non invasive imaging contamination monitoring data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water security is composed of two main factors water quantity in order to satisfy the basic needs of the agricultural industrial and civil compartments of the society and water quality in order for the supplied water to be of adequate chemical state to satisfy the needs above while the former is potentially at risk as an effect of climate changes the latter is surely impacted also by human activities and also potentially by global phenomena such as climate evolution in this paper we present a number of methodological approaches and case studies focussed on contaminant transport in the subsurface and the ensuing consequences in terms of water quality the contribution of non invasive geophysical techniques to the tracking of water and contaminant motion in the subsurface can be immense these techniques provide the spatial coverage and the space time resolution that are essential to feed information into transport models in the unsaturated and saturated zones aquifer vulnerability assessments are strongly dependent on the information that can be provided by these techniques and the consequent dramatic impact on water security is evident the focus on a density populated area such as india provides an ideal example of how hazards pathways and receptors materialize a typical risk situation for water resources given the expected population growth worldwide these examples may be particularly illuminating of the times to come groundwater specifically plays an important role in water security 1 the existence of extensive aquifers considerably increases water security since the large volume of groundwater stored within aquifers can be used e g to buffer the effect of droughts on surface water supplies 27 however long residence times in groundwater on one hand provide pristine water quality when groundwater has been in place for a long time centuries while on the other hand contamination impact on groundwater may require decades or centuries to be cleaned up over time agricultural practices industry and mining activities inadequate waste disposals infrastructure and transport groundwater pollution have resulted in groundwater contamination in many parts of the india as well as around the world thus groundwater contamination is one the major concern for the indian subcontinent where major part of the population depends on the groundwater for their daily needs 34 in this regard characterizing and monitoring the subsurface contamination is a significant problem in india and worldwide because it directly impacts human health soil surface and groundwater resources contamination is primarily caused by an improper impact of various anthropogenic sources such as industrial wastes chemicals oil spills storage tanks etc and their infiltration in the subsurface however some natural processes can also contribute to it contaminated sites exist in different sizes and locations from small scale leaking underground storage tanks to large industrial areas subsurface contamination characterization and monitoring is an essentially difficult task due to the multiple contaminants having different concentrations and media therefore it is challenging to characterize the subsurface contamination because of its presence at varying depths with no surficial evidence disposal of domestic and industrial waste in unproperly made and unlined landfills are quite common practice and can potentially generate contaminated leachate plume 89 90 91 the leachate can infiltrate into the aquifers and can contaminate both surface and groundwater bodies for decades posing a serious risk to human health and the environment 90 to evaluate the risk it is essential to understand the interaction between the surrounding aquifers and the contaminant plume leaching from the landfill therefore mapping and characterization of the contaminant plume is one of the main targets of the field investigations an accurate and high resolution characterization and monitoring is required to address the subsurface contamination problems efficiently the traditional techniques used for determining the spread and fate of groundwater contamination are for the most part invasive drilling approaches to obtain point based or small scale measurements along with chemical analysis of soil and groundwater samples 8 these methods are typically expensive time consuming and require the labor intensive task of drilling closely spaced boreholes moreover these techniques only provide limited spatial information which is sparse in space and time and thus is prone to spatial aliasing problems recent applications of near surface geophysical methods have shown great potential for enhancing subsurface characterization advanced geophysical instruments have made it possible to acquire spatially rich data sets to provide extensive lateral coverage and high resolution information geophysical measurements can be conducted using sensors either located at the earth s surface or in the boreholes 75 the data acquired at the surface or in boreholes are usually modeled to provide two or three dimensional 2d or 3d subsurface distributions of the geophysical property of interest such as electrical resistivity seismic velocity etc these methods can also provide time variation in the spatial distribution of the imaged geophysical property if repeated so called time lapse measurements were performed this paper briefly describes about the concept of time lapse geophysical surveys and a discussion on geo electrical methods we reviewed the applications of time lapse geophysical surveys to monitor and characterize the subsurface contamination due to landfills organic waste and salt water intrusion 2 time lapse geo electrical surveys in a time lapse survey we collect the geophysical data at a point location or along a profile as a function of time these collected data analyzed as a time lapse section or time difference sections which are obtained by dividing or subtracting new measurements from earlier measurements it helps to enhance the geophysical attribute changes caused by natural or forcing conditions while static surveys image the subsurface properties time lapse geophysical surveys help to monitor dynamic changes of those properties 71 we can also utilize these data to determine the rate at which a process is occurring and define the volume of the subsurface region affected by the undergoing time dependent process time lapse investigation is especially important for near surface studies since the medium is much more dynamic due to the proximity of the air soil interface and the consequent fluid motion and heat transfer this is also evident by the increasing number of time lapse applications for near surface geophysical problems e g 8 10 20 21 in last few decades the data collection efficiency has significantly improved due to advancement of geophysical instruments moreover modern instruments have improved the repeatability of the measurements and enhanced the signal to noise ratio which makes the time lapse geophysical surveys more practical a detailed review about advancement in time lapse geophysical surveys can be found in 74 76 although all geophysical methods can be used in time lapse mode electrical imaging methods such as dc resistivity induced polarization and self potential and electromagnetics are the most used in subsurface contamination studies due to their sensitivity to conductivity contrasts 85 different geophysical techniques used to monitor environmental contamination has been recently reviewed 11 78 here we focused on the applications of time lapse geoelectrical methods to monitor contaminant transport leakage in the subsurface 2 1 geo electrical dc resistivity methods in the electrical resistivity method the spatial distribution of electrical resistivity ρ of the subsurface is determined using four electrode configurations to avoid the effect of contact resistances with the ground 71 one pair of electrodes is used for current injection and the measurement of the potential difference voltage between the other pair of electrodes permits the determination of apparent resistivity 68 inverse methods are then used to determine an estimate of the actual subsurface resistivity image 71 vereecken et al 86 electrical resistivity tomography ert in 2d or 3d configuration is one of the most widely used techniques for dc resistivity measurements it allows very high resolution imaging of the electrical properties of the subsurface e g 48 66 and it is easily scalable according to the electrode spacing thus producing images at different resolutions and penetrations the 2d and 3d resistivity measurements can be made with multiple pairs of potential electrodes along a profile or an area will allow a detailed image of the subsurface apparent resistivity 7 ert is commonly used geophysical method for non invasive characterization of near surface features such as geological characterization 69 70 to map buried waste and landfill boundaries 52 85 moreover the method is also useful to monitor saltwater and contaminant plumes 33 53 56 75 and leak detection and monitoring 36 ert measurements when performed repeatedly on the same profile can provide evidence of the time evolution of electrical resistivity known as time lapse ert tl ert measurements since early 1990s the tl ert surveys are in use and the data is being acquired by standard electrical imaging instruments however for long term monitoring with a fixed setup of electrodes a dedicated monitoring system is required that has a large power backup and remote access communication the alert system developed by the british geological survey 54 and the thur river riparian zone monitoring system developed by ethz 17 are common examples time lapse data can be acquired by using standard electrode configurations typically the same configuration is used throughout a monitoring survey to avoid any biasing 2 2 induced polarization the induced polarization ip method is collectively used with the electrical resistivity method to measure the ability of the ground to reversibly store electrical charge 68 71 81 in an ip survey a measurement is made of the voltage decay with time after the sudden change in injected current either switch on or off the recorded gradual voltage decrease is a complex function of charge polarization at the interfaces e g fluid grain and charge conduction within the aqueous solutions in the pores and along the grain 71 acquisition of time domain ip tdip data is similar to dc resistivity and can be made along a resistivity survey with the same four electrode setup where one pair of electrodes is used for current injection while the other is used for potential measurements the method was initially used for disseminated metallic ore prospecting 40 68 however with the advancement of techniques and a better understanding of the underlying processes the ip is routinely used to monitor hydrogeological processes 40 66 71 recently spectral induced polarization sip has been increasingly investigated to explore the spectral nature of the ip response i e its dependence on frequency the sip data can be inverted in terms of complex resistivity cr e g 39 cr is being explored as a potential technology for characterization and monitoring of non aqueous phase liquids napls contaminants in the subsurface and showed its potential to monitor the transport of subsurface contamination 14 in general ip techniques jointly applied with ert show promising results for monitoring contaminants at industrial and waste sites e g 5 25 26 59 2 3 self potential self potential sp also known as spontaneous potential is one of the oldest passive geophysical method that measures the naturally occurring electrical field in the subsurface e g 55 83 the equipment of sp consists of two or more non polarizable electrodes made of metal salt couples such as copper rods immersed in a copper sulphate solution or lead rods immersed in a lead chloride solution and a digital voltmeter 58 sp signals can be caused by various forcing mechanisms such as electrokinetic 64 66 electrochemical 51 68 and temperature gradients 66 in the early 19th century fox 28 proposed the sp method for subsurface studies during the last few decades the applications of the method have been widely used for both hydrogeophysical and environmental problems e g 67 and references therein common applications of the sp method include detecting and monitoring the flow of contaminants in the subsurface e g 4 31 33 52 62 65 77 over time various approaches have been developed for inversion of sp data in static and time lapse mode in the last decades various interpretation techniques have been developed for the quantitative interpretation of sp data e g 9 23 30 57 73 and references therein cui et al 18 used unscented kalman filter ukf approach to assimilate the time lapse self potential data for subsurface contaminant monitoring 2 3 1 time lapse inversion of geoelectrical methods different inversion approaches have been developed to invert the tl ert data e g 47 49 84 ignored the changes in ground properties during acquisition and developed a separate inversion of time lapse data for each monitoring phase by assuming time invariant static conditions their approach assumed that the time lapse images are calculated under the time invariant static condition and that the changes of the ground properties during the acquisition can be ignored around the same time the difference inversion algorithm was proposed by labrecque and yang 46 to reduce the misfit error between the datasets and model responses by inverting the differences between the background and subsequent data sets daily et al 19 proposed a similar approach based on the ratio inversion of the initial and subsequent datasets to simultaneously invert multiple datasets 4d inversion approach including time as a factor in inversion process was introduced in 2009 41 the approach has been widely used to understand dynamic variation in the subsurface 42 87 later 4d atc 4d active time constrained inversion technique was developed by using time regularization depending on the degree of resistivity changes in the space time domain 37 38 loke et al 49 have further modified the 4d inversion method 41 to obtain 3d space models incorporating the l curve method 24 to determine optimum spatial and temporal factors 3 applications of time lapse electrical surveys for contamination problems ert is one of the most common methods that is being used for the identification and tracking of the contaminant transport for last 40 years benson et al 1983 the technique is well established for uses from the surface 88 and in cross hole geophysical surveys 19 84 92 93 95 96 time lapse monitoring can be carried out for a short period of time several days with measurements taken every few hours or for long monitoring periods up to some years over the years the use of ert for monitoring environmental variables has been demonstrated in many investigations the tl ert covers a wide range of applications in subsurface that includes the movement of water or dissolved solutes in the subsurface 14 92 95 97 98 99 100 103 and hyporheic zone processes 104 ramirez et al 105 and daily et al 19 applied tl ert to evaluate the capabilities of ert to detect leaks from large metal storage tanks which have been used to store fuels solvents and other chemicals they mapped the pre spill and post spill resistivity around and below a tank mockup gasperikova et al 2012 applied time lapse surface ert and cross well ert to study the impact of recharge on a plume of subsurface contamination particularly nitrate daily and ramirez 94 applied ert to monitor a leakage through hydraulic barriers to check efficacy of contaminant containment the method has also been explored to capture remediation techniques and responses e g 106 time lapse sp data was used to reconstruct the tempo spatial variation of contaminant plumes 107 108 to date electrical surveys have been applied on various contamination problems and tracer testing here we provide a concise review on the applications of these methods for monitoring contamination transport with some selected field examples in the next section a brief review on indian scenario is presented and discussed the potential applicability of these methods however we have provided a detailed review of worldwide applications in the supplement 3 1 time lapse monitoring of contamination applications and prospects in the indian scenario according to the report published by central pollution control board in 2007 about 29 000 million liters day of wastewater generated from class i cities and class ii towns about 45 is generated from 35 metro cities alone a large part of uncollected untreated wastewater finds its way either to nearby surface water body or accumulates in the city itself forming cesspools the wastewater accumulated in these cesspools gets percolated into the ground and pollute the subsurface water bodies additionally the solid waste from industrial units is being dumped to form landfills these dumping grounds are often unsustainable as landfills since they have no foundations liners leveling cover soil leachate management or treatment facility 35 they are not planned to prevent contamination of the underlying soil and groundwater by the infiltration of the toxic leachate therefore it is necessary to monitor those landfills to track the infiltration of the contamination in the subsurface water bodies in india 2d and 3d geoelectrical methods have been used extensively to study subsurface contamination in different parts e g 15 72 80 further to map groundwater pollution in the vicinity of a landfill site 2d ert and ground penetrating radar gpr studies were performed 60 the resistivity imaging survey indicated high conductive anomalies in the top layer as well as underlying fractured rocks gpr survey further highlighted the presence of fractures which are potential pathways for migration of the fluid babbar et al 6 used resistivity logging collectively with hydrochemical analysis to study the leachate percolation in the subsurface from a non sanitary landfill site of ghazipur in a recent study 2d electrical imaging was successfully used to map the leaching of chromium into groundwater around chromite ore processing residue copr dump site 50 recently electrical resistivity and radio magnetotelluric methods were used to map the waste disposal site which was irrigated with untreated sewage water for agriculture purpose 22 surinaidu et al 82 used a multidisciplinary approach including ert satellite based land surface temperature observations continuous soil electrical conductivity and volumetric soil moisture to identify contaminated perennial groundwater seepage source locations in the highly industrial watershed in hyderabad city vertical electrical sounding and imaging have been also extensively used to study the salt water intrusion in coastal aquifers of india e g 16 29 43 india has a vast coastline of approximately 7500 km on its three sides stretches over nearly 53 coastal districts in nine coastal states 12 13 various factors controlling seawater intrusion and the mitigation strategies with a broader view of salt water intrusion issues in indian coast is reviewed by prusty farooq 61 they highlighted that the seawater intrusion is more prominent on the east coast than the west coast of india due to thicker alluvial sediments on the coastline both the east and west coast of india are being explored with various geophysical approaches to understand the salt water intrusion e g 32 45 most recently an integrated electrical resistivity and ip imaging study was performed for the delineation of the possible seawater intruded zones 44 low resistivity and chargeability values were observed for the area contaminated with saltwater as concerns the time lapse geophysical survey few studies were performed for monitoring recharge in vadose zone using tl ert 2 3 time lapse tracer and self potential measurements to characterize the hydrodynamics of fractured granite aquifer in southern india 63 time lapse sp and ert to map old mine working across railway track in a coalfield 79 for indian scenario overall 2d electrical surveys have been performed successfully to map the subsurface contamination and salt water intrusion however the 4d time lapse approach to understand time evolution of the contaminants still remained under explored in india 4 conclusions in this paper we outlined the importance of time lapse geophysical methods to study groundwater contamination which is a key component for secure water supply particularly time lapse geoelectrical methods i e electrical resistivity induced polarization and self potential for monitoring changes in the subsurface properties and their quantification have been discussed as shown with the examples reported here the past few decades have seen an immense growth in the development of the acquisition and inversion process of time lapse geoelectrical data these developments have been applied to a wide range of applications to monitor the dynamic subsurface processes in this review we illustrated their applications in monitoring leachate percolation from landfills organic waste transport in the subsurface and finally saltwater intrusion in the coastal aquifers in indian scenario 2d and 3d methods have shown a great potential to understand subsurface contamination and helped to identify and map contaminants in landfills and coastal regions addition of 4d time lapse geophysical methods would further enhance the understanding of subsurface processes and will be helpful to properly limit waste deposits and adequately monitor their surroundings credit authorship contribution statement payal rani conceptualization writing original draft giorgio cassiani writing

imaging have been also extensively used to study the salt water intrusion in coastal aquifers of india e g 16 29 43 india has a vast coastline of approximately 7500 km on its three sides stretches over nearly 53 coastal districts in nine coastal states 12 13 various factors controlling seawater intrusion and the mitigation strategies with a broader view of salt water intrusion issues in indian coast is reviewed by prusty farooq 61 they highlighted that the seawater intrusion is more prominent on the east coast than the west coast of india due to thicker alluvial sediments on the coastline both the east and west coast of india are being explored with various geophysical approaches to understand the salt water intrusion e g 32 45 most recently an integrated electrical resistivity and ip imaging study was performed for the delineation of the possible seawater intruded zones 44 low resistivity and chargeability values were observed for the area contaminated with saltwater as concerns the time lapse geophysical survey few studies were performed for monitoring recharge in vadose zone using tl ert 2 3 time lapse tracer and self potential measurements to characterize the hydrodynamics of fractured granite aquifer in southern india 63 time lapse sp and ert to map old mine working across railway track in a coalfield 79 for indian scenario overall 2d electrical surveys have been performed successfully to map the subsurface contamination and salt water intrusion however the 4d time lapse approach to understand time evolution of the contaminants still remained under explored in india 4 conclusions in this paper we outlined the importance of time lapse geophysical methods to study groundwater contamination which is a key component for secure water supply particularly time lapse geoelectrical methods i e electrical resistivity induced polarization and self potential for monitoring changes in the subsurface properties and their quantification have been discussed as shown with the examples reported here the past few decades have seen an immense growth in the development of the acquisition and inversion process of time lapse geoelectrical data these developments have been applied to a wide range of applications to monitor the dynamic subsurface processes in this review we illustrated their applications in monitoring leachate percolation from landfills organic waste transport in the subsurface and finally saltwater intrusion in the coastal aquifers in indian scenario 2d and 3d methods have shown a great potential to understand subsurface contamination and helped to identify and map contaminants in landfills and coastal regions addition of 4d time lapse geophysical methods would further enhance the understanding of subsurface processes and will be helpful to properly limit waste deposits and adequately monitor their surroundings credit authorship contribution statement payal rani conceptualization writing original draft giorgio cassiani writing

20096,access to basic water services have tremendous influence on health meeting the universal drinking water target under the sustainable development goals sdgs is however a major challenge for many governments in sub saharan africa ssa in many urban contexts in ssa private and informal water enterprises are essential to improving access to basic water services they provide critical water services especially to areas not served by public water systems building on discussions around water related jobs this paper provides a review of characteristics of informal water work and the associated health risks we believe there is an opportunity to develop a more critical scholarship that simultaneously attends to the contribution of the informal water sector as well as policies needed to ensure safe and decent work environment for workers in the informal water and sanitation sector keywords water insecurity health risks informal jobs data availability we have attached a summary of the charted data used as appendix i 1 introduction water is fundamental for ensuring human health and promoting vital and livable communities and economic development the human right to water demands access to adequate safe and affordable water services for all persons 40 the right to water is made more prominent in the sustainable development goals sdgs particularly goal 6 which calls for universal access to safely managed drinking water that is free from contaminants for all by 2030 44 however delivering safe and sustainable water presents a fundamental challenge especially for countries experiencing rapid urbanization 22 thus achieving sdg goal 6 appears to be a daunting task for many countries especially countries in sub saharan africa ssa and oceania in ssa about 320 million people still lack access to safe drinking water services 45 several factors including rapid population growth limited public investment and expansion of the existing water systems exacerbate the challenge 30 6 table 1 there is a tremendous and growing demand for water services in urban environments across many countries for example access to piped water services in ssa declined significantly from 63 in 2003 to 56 in 2015 largely due to inability of municipal services to keep pace with rapid urban development 9 thus traditional water governance models through state or public water utility systems are struggling to keep up with the pace of the ever growing demand for safe drinking water many water and sewage treatment plants built many decades ago have either reached their capacity or end of their life cycle and require replacement however due to limited financial resources governments are unable to replace old treatment plants and expand water infrastructure to meet the growing demands of the urban populations 30 thus the available public water utilities do not reach all households leaving some households especially those in peri urban areas and slum areas under served 11 the participation of private water enterprises help fills service gaps created by the public sector s inability to provide water services for all thus the role of the informal water sector in creating employment opportunities while addressing water insecurity cannot be overemphasized in ssa the proportion of people in urban areas without basic water services continues to rise for instance in ghana the number of urban water users relying on sachet water as a primary drinking water source increased from 13 8 in 2010 to 43 1 in 2014 39 nonetheless informal workers are often subjected to working in impoverished conditions without any social or legal protection world bank ilo wateraid who 43 informal water workers are often subjected to conditions that expose them to infections injuries social stigma traffic accidents and even death in their daily tasks world bank ilo wateraid who 43 for example amankwaa 5 in his study regarding street water vending in accra ghana reveals that water vendors are exposed to serious occupational risks including getting involved in road traffic accidents however over the years research concerning work and employment in ssa has mainly centered on large organizations in the formal sector while paying little attention to the informal sector where the majority 89 of employment happens and over 44 of urban workers earn their living 12 building on discussions around decent work and employment in the water sector this paper provides a review of existing evidence regarding work patterns of informal water work and the associated health risks in ssa in this review the term water vending means selling or reselling water to individuals households or firms 2 general perspectives of informality in the water sector this section briefly examines the general perspectives of informality and their relevance to understanding water governance although the current understanding of formality in the water sector is associated with statutory or legal recognition i e owned by the state and frequently uses modern technology and networks there are numerous and sometimes inconsistent conceptual understandings and definitions of informality within the water sector first some literature describes the informal sector based on legality or policy for instance early scholars such as hart 17 used the term informal to refer to self employment outside of formal employment creating a binary of formal or informal systems with blurred boundaries this understanding in our opinion is limited as it excludes the diverse labour relations and employment conditions such as short term casual employment and self employment however we agree with ahlers et al 3 that early scholars emphasized a policy shift that provided an opportunity for private individuals to provide water services mostly in urban centers second some researchers conceptualized informality with a focus on the characteristics of the informal sector the use of the term informality expanded from legal policy orientation to include the hidden and underground and the unrecorded segments of economic processes 20 for example peloso and morinville 33 in defining informality in the water sector emphasized water services that cannot be fully accounted for by the municipal pipeline or small scale water vendors such informality occurs in less developed areas of the cities and formalized middle and upper class neighborhoods 3 for example oteng ababio 2016 in his study in accra ghana revealed that some people were connected to the municipal pipeline illegally and their water use was often not accounted for by the municipal service providers although unauthorized taking of water by some individuals and water vendors is considered illegal and criminal it demonstrates how informality operates to satisfy the legitimate needs of some urban residents third the concept of informality saw further expansion in its understanding in the international arena the human right to water as well as the right to safe and decent employment took center stage in global debates and research around the concept of informality 46 besides emphasizing that enterprises of varied sizes and scales characterized the informal sector the focus was directed towards employment relationships to include informal work in the formal and private sectors 13 this expanded perspective reflects the heterogeneous and fluid nature of the informal sector which is often ignored for example sakar 2020 in their study in nairobi kenya reveals that following the enactment of the water act in 2002 the government partnered with private water businesses in informal urban areas to deliver water services this partnership is aimed at ensuring that people s right to accessible and affordable water services is protected to increase water access it is also critical to note that the rules and norms associated with water governance over the years have allowed the entry of new actors and enabled new institutional pathways for households to access water when existing actors cannot meet the needs of the populace while some informal water activities are considered illegal by the level of enforcement of regulation others are not and some also combine legal and illegal activities it is argued by ostrom 29 and nagendra and ostrom 23 that formal and informal dichotomy becomes problematic especially when there is no clear definition of the concepts guha khasnobis et al 16 emphasized that the lack of coherence seems to lead to analytical and policy problems since there is great tendency to apply the same policy instrument to very different situations although there is a lack of consensus on the definition of informality in the water sector the most common marker we derived from the various perspectives is that informality represents a significant characteristic of developing economies it is associated with small scale individual and family enterprises with few low skilled workers mostly lack legal recognition or license labor intensive with indigenous or adapted technology and low entry barriers the informal sector remains poorly understood and is often viewed as transitory or not permanent however in our opinion informality is a concept that focuses more on the authority to legitimize certain practices instead of paying attention to the conditions of those practices and the quality of the services provided the informal water market is a complex web of water related activities that collectively address water insecurity in ssa thus informality is here particularly in ssa to stay cities particularly those in ssa seem to operate as two systems formal secure versus informal self help insecure even when they inhabit the same geographical space there is an urgent need to change extant practices and regulations to facilitate attention to better water delivering service to poorer parts of the city as we see it the challenge is to engage in projects that draw the two both formal and informal toward each other to enhance water delivering services importantly increasing water access has become more critical following the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic many governments and international communities have recognized the challenges water insecure households in low and middle income countries face in following handwashing guidelines and abiding by stay at home lockdown orders 38 many african governments have implemented many successful responses to increase access to water amid the pandemic for example though temporary ghana s government offered free water to residents across the country by engaging both formal and informal water providers also world bank funded urban water supply project was expanded to support 20 new shared water points including tanker trucks in the democratic republic of congo 42 in kenya the government partnered with a non governmental organization to install water tanks in informal settlements 25 these efforts are still not enough to meet the urban poor s water needs who eventually have to rely on other informal water service providers to make up for their lack of access nevertheless all these actions highlight the interlinkages between the formal and informal water delivering systems towards achieving universal access to water 3 methods this review was guided by arksey and o malley s 8 methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews the framework represents a methodology that allows the assessment of emerging evidence as well as the identification of gaps for research development we chose a scoping review for several reasons first scoping reviews are useful for identifying and examining existing evidence when it is still unclear how a topic is understood in the literature second scoping reviews are particularly useful when literature on a topic has not yet been comprehensively reviewed pham et al 32 finally scoping reviews allow for the clarification of concepts in the literature to capture and disseminate a wider scope of research evidence 34 3 1 literature search strategy studies of potential interest were identified in three different databases global health medline and embase using several different search phrases see table 1 the search strategy was developed by the first author and a librarian only papers that were peer reviewed and written in the english language were included there were no date restrictions and only studies published in sub saharan africa were included there were no methodological restrictions and this was important for identifying a wide range of evidence related to the topic of interest after searching each database individual article titles and abstracts were screened to determine their relevance to the topic of this review empirical studies included in the review includes studies that report activities of informal water workers health risks and working environment of informal water enterprises reports and studies that were not peer reviewed were not included in the review data management and extraction all the articles included in the study were saved on a folder and charted using word document the papers were screened sequentially i e title abstract full text in three stages by the lead author and a research assistant disagreements were resolved by consensus eligible studies explicitly reported the operations of water vendors and related health impacts this information was then synthesized into a descriptive summary in the synthesis process we have tried to focus on themes that we feel are most dominant and relevant to current discourse and debates around informal water work and health in ssa 4 results from a total of 261 studies identified 43 duplicates were removed another 59 articles were removed after the remaining 218 studies were screened abstracts of the remaining 159 studies were screened and 115 studies were excluded afterward full texts of 44 studies were screened and 26 studies were excluded a final sample of 18 peer reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria a summary of the screening process is displayed in an adapted version of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses flow diagram fig 1 a summary of the charted data is presented in appendix a 4 1 characterizing the contribution of the informal water workers in ssa following the sdgs implementation many states have consented to deliver decent work for all and pledged to promote universal access to basic water for all as indicated in goal 8 and 6 of the sdgs respectively 44 these are intended to encourage small and medium sized enterprises growth while reducing unemployment especially among the poor and marginalized given this informal employment has become more prominent in most contexts particularly in ssa 12 the informal water sector is characterized by varied types of operators among several kinds are wholesale informal water providers such as private water tanker operators sarka 2020 4 51 wholesale tanker operators obtain water from private boreholes or public utility companies and resell to households or businesses 24 35 41 44 these tankers operate as an alternative arrangement with interesting service modalities for consumers resulting in a vibrant informal water delivery system running side by side with the formal or public water delivery systems in many countries 4 3 less cost intensive alternative to tanker services are individual vendors who obtain water in containers such as 20 liter containers from private boreholes or public pipes and sometimes unimproved sources including streams and sell to customers by moving from one house to another 36 26 18 the water is commonly carried by hand or on hand drawn carts 36 26 or donkey 14 migrant men mostly dominate this water vending activity 35 50 in addition stationary or direct water vending is also practiced where individuals sell water to consumers who come to the source in other cases owners of water kiosks privately managed standpipes and boreholes sell water to consumers who visit them 27 52 women dominate direct water vending operations 1 adams and colleagues noted further that the public water system sells water directly to some consumers who cannot connect pipe water to their homes 1 the point here is that with both public and private involvement in a similar venture the dichotomy between formal and informal is not explicit and well defined this dichotomy is rather a blurred fluid and amorphous distinction that is open to different interpretations lastly in some cases people connected to the public pipe water network resell the water to their neighbors 19 sometimes not for profit but to meet their daily needs satisfy social norms and obtain a form of social insurance 48 in ssa countries such as mozambique some urban dwellers rely primarily on such resellers of utility water for their daily water supply 48 the different characteristics of informal water delivery systems discussed show how informal water markets are formed how they operate and how they influence access to water in ssa such discussions are important to understand the role water vendors play as part of urban water infrastructural systems 7 39 recognizing water vendors as part of water infrastructural systems require understanding the everyday struggles associated with water provision 4 2 informal water market space for exclusion and injustice the informal water sector primarily operates as based on a binary system that creates unequal opportunities for men and women for instance men dominate mobile or door to door water delivery services by using carts or by hand which involves physical strength 50 on the other hand women are engaged mainly in stationary or direct vending of water that involves the application of less physical strength relatively 35 such normative differences in tasks have an enduring effect and serve to create inequalities in the workforces women who desire to work in the informal water sector especially in areas primarily dominated by men face persistent criticisms for not conforming to gender roles 21 indeed gender roles are closely linked to the ideological underpinnings of society for example patriarchal values and ideals that stem from the non state or informal water actors reinforce gender roles that are difficult for women to deal with some societies deem it unacceptable for women to be part of the water delivery process or water vending 50 thereby reaffirming society s influence on the water work patterns ignoring or taking for granted the perception that only men should push carts or engage in water vending paid work reinforces the gender divide the practice becomes complex and difficult to undo leading to persistent inequities between women and men therefore the informal water sector is an arena for the reinforcement and perpetuation of particular norms and if it goes unchecked may deepen inequalities though women and girls are mostly responsible for collecting water at the household level 15 they continue to be excluded mostly in decision making around water governance 1 excluding women from decision making regarding water governance in their communities creates inequalities and disempowers them adams and colleagues therefore argued in their study conducted in malawi that community based water governance widens the inequality gap they further noted that women were less represented on the decision making board of the water users association for several reasons including socio cultural barriers e g land ownership house ownership that subtly exclude women from leadership positions including engaging in water vending enterprises some informal water vendors have organized themselves into unions to safeguard their operations and ensure they provide quality water at an affordable and fair price to consumers but others do not this has created injustices in the price of water and the quality that is offered to consumers 49 for instance beard and mitlin 11 found that households in kampala paid more than three and thirteen times the price for water sold by private water vendors and residents connected to municipal water system respectively compared to the cost of direct municipal water service through their study in niamey niger youngstedt and colleagues 47 also found that water vendors in unions work collectively to determine the price of their services as well as their clientele that notwithstanding it is essential to note that informal water vendors particularly those in unions play a pivotal role in ensuring consumers have access to quality and affordable water however we state that it is unclear whether the roles played by the unions is a strategy to protect their business or to protect their consumers interests truly to help reduce inequalities in relation to informal water vending some researchers suggest that policymakers should focus on the formalization of the informal water vendors 3 28 to help provide the right working conditions however a major challenge we see is that whether formalization if adopted would likely meet every one s needs we therefor posit that understanding and considering the heterogeneity of the informal workforce would be a significant starting point to ensuring that no one is left behind it would also increase understanding of the specific roles each group or type of informal service provider plays in addressing water insecurities in ssa this might be attained by adopting a new context based approach with more focus on sustainability and equity though collection of water is largely considered a female responsibility it has become a source of livelihood strategy for both men and women seeking employment especially in urban areas in ssa this according to overå 2007 31 shows gender ideologies regarding appropriate occupations for women and men could be adapted particularly in response to a changing economy 4 3 health risks associated with informal sector jobs although informal water systems have contributed to the continuous provision of critical water services it is not without challenges these informal water delivery systems interact with societies cultures economies and the environment to create health inequalities however the dualism between formal and informal water delivery systems has masked absolute inequalities particularly concerning water insecurity and decent working conditions work has become increasingly significant as social determinant of health 10 the general working conditions of informal water vendors include the general physical and psychosocial needs of work mostly the main determinants of the workers experience and to an extent health four 37 1 50 21 out of the 18 studies explicitly discussed health impacts water vendors face in their work this clearly shows lack of academic engagements with health outcomes associated with informal water work compared to health outcomes associated with water insecurity in general or domestic water use in the following sub sections we classified some key health risks associated with informal water jobs into two broad categories biomedical health risks and psychosocial health impacts 4 3 1 biomedical heath risk water vendors especially those who carry water using pushcarts consider the repeated pulling or pushing of pushcarts as the toughest part of their job risks often reported include body pains traffic accidents and attacks from dogs 50 21 for example youngstedt et al 50 found that in niamey niger carrying heavy water loads results in physical injuries e g body pains due to heavy water loads carried exposure to attack from dogs bandits etc ahmad 2 in their study in kano nigeria also found that traffic accidents are common among informal water vendors but particularly higher among water vendors who use pushcart the author further revealed that most of the accidents and injuries encountered by water vendors who use pushcarts are due to the physical terrain and heavy nature of the pushcart when filled with a number of water containers 2 4 3 2 psychosocial health impacts in a study conducted in niamey niger youngstedt et al 50 revealed that nigerien men avoid water vending work due to dignity preservation and shame avoidance nigerien men consider water delivery to be inferior to women s work and those who engage in it are often looked down upon and less respected sarkar 37 in their study in urban slums of nairobi kenya also suggests that some vendors become distressed from sometimes negotiating prices with customers in addition water vendors especially women are exposed to emotional and verbal abuse 1 adams and colleagues 2018 emphasized that water kiosks operators especially women worry over low wages and instances where they are forced to adjudicate water conflicts at the kiosks though there is limited data on health risks related to informal water work it is clear that as urban populations increase the percentage of persons engage in the informal work including water work will tend to increase while informal water workers are exposed to similar risks there will be differences in health risks faced by different types of service providers and age groups thus there is a need for further inquiry to improve our understanding of the health risks of various groups working in the informal water sector specifically a central argument of this review is that while small scale non state water service providers are critical for bridging the water service gaps in low income areas in ssa we need to critically explore their unique roles within the water sector as well as the health risks associated with informal water work that renders the sector less decent and unsafe 5 conclusion 5 1 recommendation for future work we found very limited studies that explore health risks associated with informal water work in ssa we suggest that health risks faced by informal water workers need to be taken seriously especially considering the role they play in bridging the water service gap further exploration looking into gendered health risks of informal water vendors is also critical for future research given this future development of labor and social policies might be crucial to include health inequalities related to informal employment more broadly in lmic furthermore informal water workers and entrepreneurs are influenced mainly by the business environments in which they operate for example previous studies suggest that water vendors who are part of unions could access markets water infrastructure and financial resources with more ease than non union members 46 engagements with institutional political and economic processes are critical in understanding the disparities that decide who gets access to water infrastructure due to socio political factors 5 2 conclusion this paper discussed the informal water sector s contribution to addressing water insecurity the perspectives on informality in the water sector and highlights the limited but significant inequalities and health risks faced by workers in the informal water sector in lmics cities are highly dependent on the availability of water services and any disruption or unavailability of any sort can have public health implications the pressure on water systems in ssa will continue to intensify due to the explosive population growth in cities and towns amid climate change natural disasters and pandemics therefore both the formal and informal sectors will have to work on common grounds to meet this ever increasing demand the role of informal markets in urban water service provision mostly considered transitional or temporary is now widely accepted as an inherent characteristic of many urban centers and is likely to remain so for many decades given this creating the appropriate institutional framework and platform for informal service providers to serve communities without adequate water access while ensuring their health and safety is vital inclusive economic growth is critical as we work towards increasing access to water and decent jobs for all by 2030 as prioritized by the sdgs goals 6 and 8 paying attention to the diversity of water jobs in the informal water sector could significantly enhance their contribution in addressing water insecurity while reducing unemployment it would also likely help in designing and implementing policies and practices to accelerate water infrastructure innovation expand opportunities for all and encourage greater social engagement in informal labor laws while promoting decent workplace environment declaration of competing interest the

concepts in the literature to capture and disseminate a wider scope of research evidence 34 3 1 literature search strategy studies of potential interest were identified in three different databases global health medline and embase using several different search phrases see table 1 the search strategy was developed by the first author and a librarian only papers that were peer reviewed and written in the english language were included there were no date restrictions and only studies published in sub saharan africa were included there were no methodological restrictions and this was important for identifying a wide range of evidence related to the topic of interest after searching each database individual article titles and abstracts were screened to determine their relevance to the topic of this review empirical studies included in the review includes studies that report activities of informal water workers health risks and working environment of informal water enterprises reports and studies that were not peer reviewed were not included in the review data management and extraction all the articles included in the study were saved on a folder and charted using word document the papers were screened sequentially i e title abstract full text in three stages by the lead author and a research assistant disagreements were resolved by consensus eligible studies explicitly reported the operations of water vendors and related health impacts this information was then synthesized into a descriptive summary in the synthesis process we have tried to focus on themes that we feel are most dominant and relevant to current discourse and debates around informal water work and health in ssa 4 results from a total of 261 studies identified 43 duplicates were removed another 59 articles were removed after the remaining 218 studies were screened abstracts of the remaining 159 studies were screened and 115 studies were excluded afterward full texts of 44 studies were screened and 26 studies were excluded a final sample of 18 peer reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria a summary of the screening process is displayed in an adapted version of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses flow diagram fig 1 a summary of the charted data is presented in appendix a 4 1 characterizing the contribution of the informal water workers in ssa following the sdgs implementation many states have consented to deliver decent work for all and pledged to promote universal access to basic water for all as indicated in goal 8 and 6 of the sdgs respectively 44 these are intended to encourage small and medium sized enterprises growth while reducing unemployment especially among the poor and marginalized given this informal employment has become more prominent in most contexts particularly in ssa 12 the informal water sector is characterized by varied types of operators among several kinds are wholesale informal water providers such as private water tanker operators sarka 2020 4 51 wholesale tanker operators obtain water from private boreholes or public utility companies and resell to households or businesses 24 35 41 44 these tankers operate as an alternative arrangement with interesting service modalities for consumers resulting in a vibrant informal water delivery system running side by side with the formal or public water delivery systems in many countries 4 3 less cost intensive alternative to tanker services are individual vendors who obtain water in containers such as 20 liter containers from private boreholes or public pipes and sometimes unimproved sources including streams and sell to customers by moving from one house to another 36 26 18 the water is commonly carried by hand or on hand drawn carts 36 26 or donkey 14 migrant men mostly dominate this water vending activity 35 50 in addition stationary or direct water vending is also practiced where individuals sell water to consumers who come to the source in other cases owners of water kiosks privately managed standpipes and boreholes sell water to consumers who visit them 27 52 women dominate direct water vending operations 1 adams and colleagues noted further that the public water system sells water directly to some consumers who cannot connect pipe water to their homes 1 the point here is that with both public and private involvement in a similar venture the dichotomy between formal and informal is not explicit and well defined this dichotomy is rather a blurred fluid and amorphous distinction that is open to different interpretations lastly in some cases people connected to the public pipe water network resell the water to their neighbors 19 sometimes not for profit but to meet their daily needs satisfy social norms and obtain a form of social insurance 48 in ssa countries such as mozambique some urban dwellers rely primarily on such resellers of utility water for their daily water supply 48 the different characteristics of informal water delivery systems discussed show how informal water markets are formed how they operate and how they influence access to water in ssa such discussions are important to understand the role water vendors play as part of urban water infrastructural systems 7 39 recognizing water vendors as part of water infrastructural systems require understanding the everyday struggles associated with water provision 4 2 informal water market space for exclusion and injustice the informal water sector primarily operates as based on a binary system that creates unequal opportunities for men and women for instance men dominate mobile or door to door water delivery services by using carts or by hand which involves physical strength 50 on the other hand women are engaged mainly in stationary or direct vending of water that involves the application of less physical strength relatively 35 such normative differences in tasks have an enduring effect and serve to create inequalities in the workforces women who desire to work in the informal water sector especially in areas primarily dominated by men face persistent criticisms for not conforming to gender roles 21 indeed gender roles are closely linked to the ideological underpinnings of society for example patriarchal values and ideals that stem from the non state or informal water actors reinforce gender roles that are difficult for women to deal with some societies deem it unacceptable for women to be part of the water delivery process or water vending 50 thereby reaffirming society s influence on the water work patterns ignoring or taking for granted the perception that only men should push carts or engage in water vending paid work reinforces the gender divide the practice becomes complex and difficult to undo leading to persistent inequities between women and men therefore the informal water sector is an arena for the reinforcement and perpetuation of particular norms and if it goes unchecked may deepen inequalities though women and girls are mostly responsible for collecting water at the household level 15 they continue to be excluded mostly in decision making around water governance 1 excluding women from decision making regarding water governance in their communities creates inequalities and disempowers them adams and colleagues therefore argued in their study conducted in malawi that community based water governance widens the inequality gap they further noted that women were less represented on the decision making board of the water users association for several reasons including socio cultural barriers e g land ownership house ownership that subtly exclude women from leadership positions including engaging in water vending enterprises some informal water vendors have organized themselves into unions to safeguard their operations and ensure they provide quality water at an affordable and fair price to consumers but others do not this has created injustices in the price of water and the quality that is offered to consumers 49 for instance beard and mitlin 11 found that households in kampala paid more than three and thirteen times the price for water sold by private water vendors and residents connected to municipal water system respectively compared to the cost of direct municipal water service through their study in niamey niger youngstedt and colleagues 47 also found that water vendors in unions work collectively to determine the price of their services as well as their clientele that notwithstanding it is essential to note that informal water vendors particularly those in unions play a pivotal role in ensuring consumers have access to quality and affordable water however we state that it is unclear whether the roles played by the unions is a strategy to protect their business or to protect their consumers interests truly to help reduce inequalities in relation to informal water vending some researchers suggest that policymakers should focus on the formalization of the informal water vendors 3 28 to help provide the right working conditions however a major challenge we see is that whether formalization if adopted would likely meet every one s needs we therefor posit that understanding and considering the heterogeneity of the informal workforce would be a significant starting point to ensuring that no one is left behind it would also increase understanding of the specific roles each group or type of informal service provider plays in addressing water insecurities in ssa this might be attained by adopting a new context based approach with more focus on sustainability and equity though collection of water is largely considered a female responsibility it has become a source of livelihood strategy for both men and women seeking employment especially in urban areas in ssa this according to overå 2007 31 shows gender ideologies regarding appropriate occupations for women and men could be adapted particularly in response to a changing economy 4 3 health risks associated with informal sector jobs although informal water systems have contributed to the continuous provision of critical water services it is not without challenges these informal water delivery systems interact with societies cultures economies and the environment to create health inequalities however the dualism between formal and informal water delivery systems has masked absolute inequalities particularly concerning water insecurity and decent working conditions work has become increasingly significant as social determinant of health 10 the general working conditions of informal water vendors include the general physical and psychosocial needs of work mostly the main determinants of the workers experience and to an extent health four 37 1 50 21 out of the 18 studies explicitly discussed health impacts water vendors face in their work this clearly shows lack of academic engagements with health outcomes associated with informal water work compared to health outcomes associated with water insecurity in general or domestic water use in the following sub sections we classified some key health risks associated with informal water jobs into two broad categories biomedical health risks and psychosocial health impacts 4 3 1 biomedical heath risk water vendors especially those who carry water using pushcarts consider the repeated pulling or pushing of pushcarts as the toughest part of their job risks often reported include body pains traffic accidents and attacks from dogs 50 21 for example youngstedt et al 50 found that in niamey niger carrying heavy water loads results in physical injuries e g body pains due to heavy water loads carried exposure to attack from dogs bandits etc ahmad 2 in their study in kano nigeria also found that traffic accidents are common among informal water vendors but particularly higher among water vendors who use pushcart the author further revealed that most of the accidents and injuries encountered by water vendors who use pushcarts are due to the physical terrain and heavy nature of the pushcart when filled with a number of water containers 2 4 3 2 psychosocial health impacts in a study conducted in niamey niger youngstedt et al 50 revealed that nigerien men avoid water vending work due to dignity preservation and shame avoidance nigerien men consider water delivery to be inferior to women s work and those who engage in it are often looked down upon and less respected sarkar 37 in their study in urban slums of nairobi kenya also suggests that some vendors become distressed from sometimes negotiating prices with customers in addition water vendors especially women are exposed to emotional and verbal abuse 1 adams and colleagues 2018 emphasized that water kiosks operators especially women worry over low wages and instances where they are forced to adjudicate water conflicts at the kiosks though there is limited data on health risks related to informal water work it is clear that as urban populations increase the percentage of persons engage in the informal work including water work will tend to increase while informal water workers are exposed to similar risks there will be differences in health risks faced by different types of service providers and age groups thus there is a need for further inquiry to improve our understanding of the health risks of various groups working in the informal water sector specifically a central argument of this review is that while small scale non state water service providers are critical for bridging the water service gaps in low income areas in ssa we need to critically explore their unique roles within the water sector as well as the health risks associated with informal water work that renders the sector less decent and unsafe 5 conclusion 5 1 recommendation for future work we found very limited studies that explore health risks associated with informal water work in ssa we suggest that health risks faced by informal water workers need to be taken seriously especially considering the role they play in bridging the water service gap further exploration looking into gendered health risks of informal water vendors is also critical for future research given this future development of labor and social policies might be crucial to include health inequalities related to informal employment more broadly in lmic furthermore informal water workers and entrepreneurs are influenced mainly by the business environments in which they operate for example previous studies suggest that water vendors who are part of unions could access markets water infrastructure and financial resources with more ease than non union members 46 engagements with institutional political and economic processes are critical in understanding the disparities that decide who gets access to water infrastructure due to socio political factors 5 2 conclusion this paper discussed the informal water sector s contribution to addressing water insecurity the perspectives on informality in the water sector and highlights the limited but significant inequalities and health risks faced by workers in the informal water sector in lmics cities are highly dependent on the availability of water services and any disruption or unavailability of any sort can have public health implications the pressure on water systems in ssa will continue to intensify due to the explosive population growth in cities and towns amid climate change natural disasters and pandemics therefore both the formal and informal sectors will have to work on common grounds to meet this ever increasing demand the role of informal markets in urban water service provision mostly considered transitional or temporary is now widely accepted as an inherent characteristic of many urban centers and is likely to remain so for many decades given this creating the appropriate institutional framework and platform for informal service providers to serve communities without adequate water access while ensuring their health and safety is vital inclusive economic growth is critical as we work towards increasing access to water and decent jobs for all by 2030 as prioritized by the sdgs goals 6 and 8 paying attention to the diversity of water jobs in the informal water sector could significantly enhance their contribution in addressing water insecurity while reducing unemployment it would also likely help in designing and implementing policies and practices to accelerate water infrastructure innovation expand opportunities for all and encourage greater social engagement in informal labor laws while promoting decent workplace environment declaration of competing interest the

20097,nagavali is one of the important east flowing river basins providing a water source for more than 5 million people for various applications in two south indian states namely orissa and andhra pradesh during the last two decades the expansion and intensification of agriculture have increased through the development of various surface water storage projects to support agriculture development in this scenario understanding the complete water balance under different land use and climate is required for the sustainable management of water resources and agriculture development the present study attempted to quantify integrated hydrological processes under changing land use and climate over three decades from 1985 to 2018 with the help of coupled swat modflow the study quantified the river aquifer interactions and dynamic groundwater recharge by implementing dynamic land use and climate in the coupled hydrological model for three decades the integrated model has revealed that the combined impact of land use change and climate has increased runoff by 26 percolation by 16 irrigation water requirement by 48 and groundwater storage has declined by 20 by the end of 2018 when compared to 1991 the present study emphasized the need of modelling surface groundwater in an integrated manner for better understating hydrological processes to support sustainable water resource management keywords swat modflow base flow coupled hydrological model groundwater recharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustainable water resource management is threatened by increased water scarcity worldwide 46 an increase in population demands the intensification of agriculture to produce more food grains posing challenges to water resource managers to provide sustainable water use solutions using limited resources the long term climatic patterns and dwindling nature of stream flows and depleting groundwater resources further aggravate water resource management problems 22 27 sustainable and optimal water resource management is difficult especially in areas where surface groundwater interactions are greater and provide irrigation to agricultural fields many regions face water logging salinization and water quality problems due to improper water usage without considering interactions between surface and groundwater 40 14 34 35 these interactions are an important part of the water cycle the use of one resource will always have an impact on another resource unsustainable use of both surface and groundwater resources will seriously impact its own sustainability and other ecosystems over exploitation of groundwater can lead to depletion of the water table and affect connected surface water bodies such as streams and lakes by reducing base flows that will impact the function of the river lake ecosystem 32 26 it is highly difficult to understand these complex interactions hydrological models can help to capture critical hydrological processes to find out the best management solutions for sustainability 10 12 in recent years physically based distributed or semi distributed hydrological models are widely used to simulate and predict spatial and temporal patterns of hydrological processes at local to regional scales 21 42 models help to understand and quantify different hydrological processes and water balance with simplified conceptual representations and mathematical equations 18 13 surface hydrological models such as variable infiltration capacity vic soil water assessment tool swat precipitation runoff modelling system prms and hydrologic modelling system hec hms are applied by many researchers 44 11 17 41 to simulate the surface hydrological process but these models cannot represent typical groundwater interactions and connected processes with surface water on the other hand the groundwater model modflow is applied for various applications 38 43 23 36 37 which neglects the interactions of land atmosphere and agricultural activities with groundwater during the last decade the linking of surface groundwater hydrological processes being increased for example swat modflow 2 surinaidu et al 2015b gsflow 45 and hydrogeosphere 8 the present study is also an attempt to apply a coupled swat modflow model for understanding the total hydrological processes the present study area the nagavali river basin is situated in south india where groundwater surface interactions are more significant during the last two decades a lot of water resources development projects being initiated to support agriculture development led to change in land use setti et al 29 33 have carried out a surface water modelling study using swat to understand these development impacts and climate on stream flows however they neglected stream aquifer interactions which are very essential in the basin dynamic groundwater recharge and its linkages with surface processes and climate are also neglected water resource development and along with rainfall variability coupled with land use change in the basin may have adverse impacts on stream flow dynamics it is imperative to understand the individual hydrological components contribution to the total hydrological cycle for future water resource management the present study addresses these complex interactions among the climate land use stream flows aquifer interactions groundwater recharge which can support future water resource planning and management sustainably 2 study area the present study area nagavali river basin extends into two states orissa and andhra pradesh in the eastern peninsula of the indian sub continent that covers about 9058 km2 drainage area fig 1 a total of four districts namely khalahadi and koraput of orissa and vizianagaram and srikakulam of andhra pradesh falls in the drainage basin the river originates in kalahandi district of odisha at 1663 m elevation and enters andhra pradesh at an elevation of 150 m in srikakulam the total length of the river is 256 km out of which 160 km is in orissa thotapally narayanpuram and jaiyavathi are major irrigation projects in the nagavali river basin 4 the major tributaries of the nagavali are suvarnamukhi vegavathi janjhavathi and vottigedda 5 the climate of the river basin is tropical with a mean annual rainfall of 1138 mm average rainfall from the year 1985 to 2018 the highest temperature is generally observed during may up to 34 5 c and 28 c from january to february the river basin is home to more than 5 million people and is a source of water for various purposes during the last two decades agriculture intensification has expanded by developing various water resource projects in the region the major crops in the area are paddy sugarcane wheat potato and cotton 3 hydrogeology of the study area the streams at higher elevations are perennial and most of the tributaries are ephemeral in the nagavali river basin the drainage pattern is varying across the basin from radial to dendritic types 5 the entire area is underlaid by a crystalline rock of the pre cambrian age recent to sub recent alluvium occurs as thin and discontinuous patches along the mainstreams the regional geological map of the study area is presented in fig 1b a thick lateritic soil cap at a few places can be found in the upstream area of the basin in the basin the major rock types are weathered and fractured granites granite gneisses and their variants khondalites and charnockites 5 the thickness of the weathered mantle is about 10 m granite is very common and potential aquifers extend up to a depth of a few tens of meters the high weathering of granites and gneisses tends to leach clay and reduce the granular materials porosity however khondalites have undergone a high degree of weathering down to a depth of more than 20 m with a potential aquifer that extends more than 65 m depth below ground level bgl due to the dominant clay percent permeability is reduced in khondalites charnokites are hard and compact in nature the thickness of a weathered layer is limited to 7 10 m depth with a potential fracture occurs at 30 136 m bgl the transmissivity ranges from 0 5 to 116 m2 day for granites 0 5 to 10 68 m2 day for khondalites and it is 1 8 3 0 m2 day for charnokites groundwater occurs under unconfined to semi confined conditions 6 7 dug well dug cum bore wells and filter wells are more prominent in the basin there are no serious groundwater depletion problems in the basin the total groundwater development in the basin is about 18 4 data and methodology the data used in the study and its sources have been presented in table 1 the digital elevation model shows that the elevation ranges from 1 m in the most downstream at srikakulam district of andhra pradesh to 1663 m above mean sea level amsl at khalahandi district of orissa with an average elevation of 406 m above mean sea level amsl fig 1 the upstream of the basin is covered by sandy clayey soil and the downstream is covered by loamy soil fig 2 a the land use pattern in the basin is transforming due to water resources development the high resolution land use maps provided by national remote sensing center nrsc in comparison with land use maps provided by 28 are presented in table 2 the table shows that 46 of the area is occupied by crop land and 40 is by forest lands the maps provided by nrsc or 28 do not provide any details about crop type and source of irrigation information hence the source of irrigation information provided iwmi global land use maps are extracted and merged with these maps fig 2b and table 2 these maps show that out of the total area 0 6 area is under groundwater irrigation 10 surface water and 24 conjunctive water use 4 1 hydrological modelling coupled surface and groundwater hydrology is modelled by using swat modflow using qgis interface swat modflow is an integrated hydrological modelling framework that includes land surface and in stream hydrologic processes of swat and groundwater hydrologic processes of modflow 25 4 1 1 surface water the surface hydrological process is simulated using swat which has been tested widely for stream flow simulations 15 in the present study qswat is used for simulating surface hydrological processes dem is imported to qswat and then divided the entire area into 23 sub basins during watershed delineation including streams fig 1a then soils and lulc data of the study area are imported including four soil types and nine land use types the dominant soil types are sandy clay loam 75 of the study area and land use is cropland forest in the model the slopes were defined as four classes 0 10 10 30 30 50 and greater than 50 the entire area is specified with 650 hydrological response units hru in the present study the base model was built using the 1985 land use map then the time series land use of the successive years 1995 2005 2011 and 2015 were implemented using swat lut tool 24 the area under different land use classes between two successive provided land use maps are interpolated using swat lut four reservoirs are simulated at subbasins 11 13 and 18 22 and its location refer fig 1 the climate data including precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation was incorporated into the model for the period of 1985 to 2018 the semi automated calibration procedure sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 with swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup was used for swat model calibration 1 the model is calibrated at one outlet in the most downstream of the subwatershed of nagavali basin sub basin no 23 in srikakulam refer fig 1 considering 22 parameters and the range of parameters similar to setti et al 29 the total simulation time of the model is 33 years from 1985 to 2018 including six years warm up period 1985 to 1990 the model is calibrated from 1991 to 2012 and then it is validated from 2013 to 2018 the model performance was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 20 and coefficient of determination r2 the calibration results indicated that nsc and r2 have been improved when surface water flow processes swat coupled with groundwater flow processes modflow 4 1 2 groundwater in the present study a physically based and fully distributed model modflow newton raphson formulation modflow was used to simulate gw flow that solves groundwater flow differential equation in 3d using the finite difference approach 19 the entire nagavali river basin 9058 km2 is spatially discretized with a 1 km2 grid resolution the total number of active cells is 9058 with 159 rows and 110 columns the river network has been simulated with the modflow river package with 584 river cells the subsurface was conceptualized as a single layer aquifer model with a thickness of 65 m from the surface the groundwater model is calibrated from 2014 to 2018 using observed groundwater heads on a monthly basis at 24 locations root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrms were used to calibrate the modflow model 5 swat modflow integration swat hrus are disaggregated to have specific geographic locations and then they are intersected with modflow grid cells to pass variables between swat and modflow modflow river cells intersected with swat subbasins transfer groundwater return to streams 25 the disaggregated hrus intersected with the modflow grid pass the recharge and remaining et from swat hrus to modflow grid cells dhrus pass location and surface water flow data to modflow grid cells which are then returned to swat as calculated hydraulic heads and interactive flow rates on a daily time step 3 the entire process of swat modflow is well explained by park and bailey 25 6 results and discussion 6 1 land use change and integrated dynamic water flows the long term 1991 2018 monthly interactive water balance is shown in fig 4 the long term average annual water balance in the present study reveals that 43 2 607 mm of the rainfall is converted into evapotranspiration while atmospheric water demand is 2082 mm table 3 the runoff generated from rainfall is about 24 while the total simulated percolation is 21 of precipitation 299 mm out of which 69 is converted into deep aquifer groundwater recharge the total simulated groundwater irrigation water demand is 717 mm the simulated average aquifer storage is about 1539 mm considering the total aquifer thickness is 65 m in the present study and other plausible assumptions mentioned in the above sections the net annual average transfer of water between the aquifer and the river is about 16 mm in the study area the comparative water balance for different periods shows an increase in irrigation water requirement of about 48 from 1991 1995 to 2016 2018 which shows that crop area has increased tremendously based on land use maps the area under cropland has increased by 5 6 in 1995 when compared to 1985 and it increased by 3 5 by 2015 while the area of forest lands decreased by 12 by 2015 refer to table 2 the land use change has a tremendous impact on the hydrological system and as a result runoff has increased by 25 which may be attributed to forest land having converted to cropland causing increased runoff while percolation has also increased by 16 which could be due to an increase in return flows from irrigation the increase in irrigation water requirement and surface runoff might be the result of the combined impact of climate and land use change but individual impacts on water demand are not quantified in this study the results also show that around a 20 decline in groundwater storage in 28 years from 1991 to 2018 the major depletion observed in the simulated model between the years 2015 to 2018 that may be due to the extensive development of agriculture in the basin however the results may be considered only when taking into the account of limitations of the data and model the availability of freshwater is under great stress due to climate change land use transformation and mounting human demands human communities are at risk for exposure and create adaptation challenges due to vulnerable water supplies across the globe 9 in the present study also land use and climate change had a greater impact on the total water supply and its distribution as reported above in this section hence proper management strategies should be developed to avoid any adverse impacts on the total hydrological ecosystem for example the construction of upstream reservoirs has created avenues to expand and intensify irrigation however it is at the cost of degraded forest lands and limited downstream water flows thoughtful regulation of reservoirs with proper land use plans along with suitable watershed development can help sustainable water resources management for the development of agriculture while protecting the rights of other water dependent ecosystems saideepa et al 2012 6 2 surface and groundwater interactions nagavali river basin has undergone major land use changes as mentioned in the previous section agricultural land has been increased with the support of surface water development through dams such as jhanjavati narayanapuram anicut and thotapally barrage reservoir and connected canal irrigation water facilities these land use dynamics along with water resource development combined with variable climatic patterns have significant impacts on the groundwater surface groundwater interaction processes and total water balance in the basin fig 5 shows that groundwater elevations range from 0 1 m amsl in the most downstream near the coat to 1200 m amsl in the most upstream fig 5a b the seasonal and spatial variations may be attributed to climate rainfall topographic variations and human impacts irrigation use fig 5c d shows that groundwater is significantly recharged by surface water streams in the upstream reaches while in the downstream groundwater is being discharged to the river the negative sign shows significant river leakage to the aquifer and the positive sign indicates gaining stream the comparative interactions of 2018 with 1991 show that groundwater contribution to the streams has reduced several folds and the quantity of stream leakage to the aquifer has also reduced which may be due to irrigation water withdrawals that led to a reversal of hydraulic head between river bottom and groundwater head but the spatial patterns vary from place to place for example some stream cells are losing water to the aquifer western part of the area see fig 5c d which may be due to irrigation withdrawals and the hydraulic gradient between the river head aquifer interface in the area the results inferred that in the basin significant surface groundwater interactions are being taken place hence proper conjunctive water use planning may be designed to overcome future problems for example groundwater pumping may be promoted where canal seepage is at a greater extent and demand reduction of groundwater and supply surface water on a seasonal scale where water depletion problems arise in the area the stream aquifer interactions got shifted spatially and temporally which is modulated by physical processes and human interventions including expansion of irrigation and increased water resource development however relatively low groundwater development and the huge potential of existing groundwater storage mapping of potential groundwater zones and proper conjunctive use of both surface groundwater resources may help sustainable management of water resources for sustainable agriculture development in the study region as human induced impacts affect water and the environment and are highly nonlinear they should be well defined measured and understood to maintain the balance between supply and demand 39 the present study only quantified the water balance which may help to get an understanding of the water requirements of humans for management but neglects the environmental water requirement like many other studies across the globe 16 hence considering both human and environmental water requirements may provide better solutions for water security in the area for all ecosystems the present river basin falls in two interstates andhra pradesh and orissa in india and has mutual water sharing agreements go 2004 hence the mutual sharing of data understating of transboundary water requirements and joint data collection and monitoring committees may help to solve and develop better water management strategies to meet sustainable human environment water requirements and their development 33 7 limitations due to a lack of information on detailed aquifer geometry the subsurface of the aquifer in modflow model is more generalized with a single layer aquifer system with uniform aquifer properties the source of the irrigation information is static though a time series of land use information has been implemented in the modelling work the crop rotation is implemented only on major crops vegetables and other horticulture irrigated information is not implemented due to lack of information 8 conclusions the present study quantified the total terrestrial water budget for nagavali river basin considering time series land use and climate for three decades using integrated hydrological modelling which coupled both surface and groundwater flow processes with plausible assumptions the study results indicated that land use and water resource development are modulated by human influence and it is being impacted the total water balance in the study area the long term water balance 1991 2018 indicated the runoff irrigation water requirement and groundwater recharge have increased by 26 48 and 16 respectively due to the combined impact of climate change and land use transformation while groundwater storage has declined by 20 since only 24 of the area is in conjunctive water use and 10 of the area is groundwater dependent agriculture a lot of scope for intensification and expansion of agriculture by identifying potential groundwater aquifers in addition to proper surface water resource development however the model explained that groundwater storage is on a declining trend and spatial patterns of stream aquifer interactions have been changed in the last 28 years hence it is suggested to attempt any water resource development in the area need to be considered spatial and temporal dynamics of hydrological processes to provide sustainable water for all dependent ecosystems that include humans and the environment while protecting upstream and downstream water requirement and rights the current study may help to better understand the dynamics of different hydrological fluxes that could help better water resource management and agriculture development credit authorship contribution statement l surinaidu conceptualization data curation formal

compared to 1991 the present study emphasized the need of modelling surface groundwater in an integrated manner for better understating hydrological processes to support sustainable water resource management keywords swat modflow base flow coupled hydrological model groundwater recharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustainable water resource management is threatened by increased water scarcity worldwide 46 an increase in population demands the intensification of agriculture to produce more food grains posing challenges to water resource managers to provide sustainable water use solutions using limited resources the long term climatic patterns and dwindling nature of stream flows and depleting groundwater resources further aggravate water resource management problems 22 27 sustainable and optimal water resource management is difficult especially in areas where surface groundwater interactions are greater and provide irrigation to agricultural fields many regions face water logging salinization and water quality problems due to improper water usage without considering interactions between surface and groundwater 40 14 34 35 these interactions are an important part of the water cycle the use of one resource will always have an impact on another resource unsustainable use of both surface and groundwater resources will seriously impact its own sustainability and other ecosystems over exploitation of groundwater can lead to depletion of the water table and affect connected surface water bodies such as streams and lakes by reducing base flows that will impact the function of the river lake ecosystem 32 26 it is highly difficult to understand these complex interactions hydrological models can help to capture critical hydrological processes to find out the best management solutions for sustainability 10 12 in recent years physically based distributed or semi distributed hydrological models are widely used to simulate and predict spatial and temporal patterns of hydrological processes at local to regional scales 21 42 models help to understand and quantify different hydrological processes and water balance with simplified conceptual representations and mathematical equations 18 13 surface hydrological models such as variable infiltration capacity vic soil water assessment tool swat precipitation runoff modelling system prms and hydrologic modelling system hec hms are applied by many researchers 44 11 17 41 to simulate the surface hydrological process but these models cannot represent typical groundwater interactions and connected processes with surface water on the other hand the groundwater model modflow is applied for various applications 38 43 23 36 37 which neglects the interactions of land atmosphere and agricultural activities with groundwater during the last decade the linking of surface groundwater hydrological processes being increased for example swat modflow 2 surinaidu et al 2015b gsflow 45 and hydrogeosphere 8 the present study is also an attempt to apply a coupled swat modflow model for understanding the total hydrological processes the present study area the nagavali river basin is situated in south india where groundwater surface interactions are more significant during the last two decades a lot of water resources development projects being initiated to support agriculture development led to change in land use setti et al 29 33 have carried out a surface water modelling study using swat to understand these development impacts and climate on stream flows however they neglected stream aquifer interactions which are very essential in the basin dynamic groundwater recharge and its linkages with surface processes and climate are also neglected water resource development and along with rainfall variability coupled with land use change in the basin may have adverse impacts on stream flow dynamics it is imperative to understand the individual hydrological components contribution to the total hydrological cycle for future water resource management the present study addresses these complex interactions among the climate land use stream flows aquifer interactions groundwater recharge which can support future water resource planning and management sustainably 2 study area the present study area nagavali river basin extends into two states orissa and andhra pradesh in the eastern peninsula of the indian sub continent that covers about 9058 km2 drainage area fig 1 a total of four districts namely khalahadi and koraput of orissa and vizianagaram and srikakulam of andhra pradesh falls in the drainage basin the river originates in kalahandi district of odisha at 1663 m elevation and enters andhra pradesh at an elevation of 150 m in srikakulam the total length of the river is 256 km out of which 160 km is in orissa thotapally narayanpuram and jaiyavathi are major irrigation projects in the nagavali river basin 4 the major tributaries of the nagavali are suvarnamukhi vegavathi janjhavathi and vottigedda 5 the climate of the river basin is tropical with a mean annual rainfall of 1138 mm average rainfall from the year 1985 to 2018 the highest temperature is generally observed during may up to 34 5 c and 28 c from january to february the river basin is home to more than 5 million people and is a source of water for various purposes during the last two decades agriculture intensification has expanded by developing various water resource projects in the region the major crops in the area are paddy sugarcane wheat potato and cotton 3 hydrogeology of the study area the streams at higher elevations are perennial and most of the tributaries are ephemeral in the nagavali river basin the drainage pattern is varying across the basin from radial to dendritic types 5 the entire area is underlaid by a crystalline rock of the pre cambrian age recent to sub recent alluvium occurs as thin and discontinuous patches along the mainstreams the regional geological map of the study area is presented in fig 1b a thick lateritic soil cap at a few places can be found in the upstream area of the basin in the basin the major rock types are weathered and fractured granites granite gneisses and their variants khondalites and charnockites 5 the thickness of the weathered mantle is about 10 m granite is very common and potential aquifers extend up to a depth of a few tens of meters the high weathering of granites and gneisses tends to leach clay and reduce the granular materials porosity however khondalites have undergone a high degree of weathering down to a depth of more than 20 m with a potential aquifer that extends more than 65 m depth below ground level bgl due to the dominant clay percent permeability is reduced in khondalites charnokites are hard and compact in nature the thickness of a weathered layer is limited to 7 10 m depth with a potential fracture occurs at 30 136 m bgl the transmissivity ranges from 0 5 to 116 m2 day for granites 0 5 to 10 68 m2 day for khondalites and it is 1 8 3 0 m2 day for charnokites groundwater occurs under unconfined to semi confined conditions 6 7 dug well dug cum bore wells and filter wells are more prominent in the basin there are no serious groundwater depletion problems in the basin the total groundwater development in the basin is about 18 4 data and methodology the data used in the study and its sources have been presented in table 1 the digital elevation model shows that the elevation ranges from 1 m in the most downstream at srikakulam district of andhra pradesh to 1663 m above mean sea level amsl at khalahandi district of orissa with an average elevation of 406 m above mean sea level amsl fig 1 the upstream of the basin is covered by sandy clayey soil and the downstream is covered by loamy soil fig 2 a the land use pattern in the basin is transforming due to water resources development the high resolution land use maps provided by national remote sensing center nrsc in comparison with land use maps provided by 28 are presented in table 2 the table shows that 46 of the area is occupied by crop land and 40 is by forest lands the maps provided by nrsc or 28 do not provide any details about crop type and source of irrigation information hence the source of irrigation information provided iwmi global land use maps are extracted and merged with these maps fig 2b and table 2 these maps show that out of the total area 0 6 area is under groundwater irrigation 10 surface water and 24 conjunctive water use 4 1 hydrological modelling coupled surface and groundwater hydrology is modelled by using swat modflow using qgis interface swat modflow is an integrated hydrological modelling framework that includes land surface and in stream hydrologic processes of swat and groundwater hydrologic processes of modflow 25 4 1 1 surface water the surface hydrological process is simulated using swat which has been tested widely for stream flow simulations 15 in the present study qswat is used for simulating surface hydrological processes dem is imported to qswat and then divided the entire area into 23 sub basins during watershed delineation including streams fig 1a then soils and lulc data of the study area are imported including four soil types and nine land use types the dominant soil types are sandy clay loam 75 of the study area and land use is cropland forest in the model the slopes were defined as four classes 0 10 10 30 30 50 and greater than 50 the entire area is specified with 650 hydrological response units hru in the present study the base model was built using the 1985 land use map then the time series land use of the successive years 1995 2005 2011 and 2015 were implemented using swat lut tool 24 the area under different land use classes between two successive provided land use maps are interpolated using swat lut four reservoirs are simulated at subbasins 11 13 and 18 22 and its location refer fig 1 the climate data including precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation was incorporated into the model for the period of 1985 to 2018 the semi automated calibration procedure sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 with swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup was used for swat model calibration 1 the model is calibrated at one outlet in the most downstream of the subwatershed of nagavali basin sub basin no 23 in srikakulam refer fig 1 considering 22 parameters and the range of parameters similar to setti et al 29 the total simulation time of the model is 33 years from 1985 to 2018 including six years warm up period 1985 to 1990 the model is calibrated from 1991 to 2012 and then it is validated from 2013 to 2018 the model performance was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 20 and coefficient of determination r2 the calibration results indicated that nsc and r2 have been improved when surface water flow processes swat coupled with groundwater flow processes modflow 4 1 2 groundwater in the present study a physically based and fully distributed model modflow newton raphson formulation modflow was used to simulate gw flow that solves groundwater flow differential equation in 3d using the finite difference approach 19 the entire nagavali river basin 9058 km2 is spatially discretized with a 1 km2 grid resolution the total number of active cells is 9058 with 159 rows and 110 columns the river network has been simulated with the modflow river package with 584 river cells the subsurface was conceptualized as a single layer aquifer model with a thickness of 65 m from the surface the groundwater model is calibrated from 2014 to 2018 using observed groundwater heads on a monthly basis at 24 locations root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrms were used to calibrate the modflow model 5 swat modflow integration swat hrus are disaggregated to have specific geographic locations and then they are intersected with modflow grid cells to pass variables between swat and modflow modflow river cells intersected with swat subbasins transfer groundwater return to streams 25 the disaggregated hrus intersected with the modflow grid pass the recharge and remaining et from swat hrus to modflow grid cells dhrus pass location and surface water flow data to modflow grid cells which are then returned to swat as calculated hydraulic heads and interactive flow rates on a daily time step 3 the entire process of swat modflow is well explained by park and bailey 25 6 results and discussion 6 1 land use change and integrated dynamic water flows the long term 1991 2018 monthly interactive water balance is shown in fig 4 the long term average annual water balance in the present study reveals that 43 2 607 mm of the rainfall is converted into evapotranspiration while atmospheric water demand is 2082 mm table 3 the runoff generated from rainfall is about 24 while the total simulated percolation is 21 of precipitation 299 mm out of which 69 is converted into deep aquifer groundwater recharge the total simulated groundwater irrigation water demand is 717 mm the simulated average aquifer storage is about 1539 mm considering the total aquifer thickness is 65 m in the present study and other plausible assumptions mentioned in the above sections the net annual average transfer of water between the aquifer and the river is about 16 mm in the study area the comparative water balance for different periods shows an increase in irrigation water requirement of about 48 from 1991 1995 to 2016 2018 which shows that crop area has increased tremendously based on land use maps the area under cropland has increased by 5 6 in 1995 when compared to 1985 and it increased by 3 5 by 2015 while the area of forest lands decreased by 12 by 2015 refer to table 2 the land use change has a tremendous impact on the hydrological system and as a result runoff has increased by 25 which may be attributed to forest land having converted to cropland causing increased runoff while percolation has also increased by 16 which could be due to an increase in return flows from irrigation the increase in irrigation water requirement and surface runoff might be the result of the combined impact of climate and land use change but individual impacts on water demand are not quantified in this study the results also show that around a 20 decline in groundwater storage in 28 years from 1991 to 2018 the major depletion observed in the simulated model between the years 2015 to 2018 that may be due to the extensive development of agriculture in the basin however the results may be considered only when taking into the account of limitations of the data and model the availability of freshwater is under great stress due to climate change land use transformation and mounting human demands human communities are at risk for exposure and create adaptation challenges due to vulnerable water supplies across the globe 9 in the present study also land use and climate change had a greater impact on the total water supply and its distribution as reported above in this section hence proper management strategies should be developed to avoid any adverse impacts on the total hydrological ecosystem for example the construction of upstream reservoirs has created avenues to expand and intensify irrigation however it is at the cost of degraded forest lands and limited downstream water flows thoughtful regulation of reservoirs with proper land use plans along with suitable watershed development can help sustainable water resources management for the development of agriculture while protecting the rights of other water dependent ecosystems saideepa et al 2012 6 2 surface and groundwater interactions nagavali river basin has undergone major land use changes as mentioned in the previous section agricultural land has been increased with the support of surface water development through dams such as jhanjavati narayanapuram anicut and thotapally barrage reservoir and connected canal irrigation water facilities these land use dynamics along with water resource development combined with variable climatic patterns have significant impacts on the groundwater surface groundwater interaction processes and total water balance in the basin fig 5 shows that groundwater elevations range from 0 1 m amsl in the most downstream near the coat to 1200 m amsl in the most upstream fig 5a b the seasonal and spatial variations may be attributed to climate rainfall topographic variations and human impacts irrigation use fig 5c d shows that groundwater is significantly recharged by surface water streams in the upstream reaches while in the downstream groundwater is being discharged to the river the negative sign shows significant river leakage to the aquifer and the positive sign indicates gaining stream the comparative interactions of 2018 with 1991 show that groundwater contribution to the streams has reduced several folds and the quantity of stream leakage to the aquifer has also reduced which may be due to irrigation water withdrawals that led to a reversal of hydraulic head between river bottom and groundwater head but the spatial patterns vary from place to place for example some stream cells are losing water to the aquifer western part of the area see fig 5c d which may be due to irrigation withdrawals and the hydraulic gradient between the river head aquifer interface in the area the results inferred that in the basin significant surface groundwater interactions are being taken place hence proper conjunctive water use planning may be designed to overcome future problems for example groundwater pumping may be promoted where canal seepage is at a greater extent and demand reduction of groundwater and supply surface water on a seasonal scale where water depletion problems arise in the area the stream aquifer interactions got shifted spatially and temporally which is modulated by physical processes and human interventions including expansion of irrigation and increased water resource development however relatively low groundwater development and the huge potential of existing groundwater storage mapping of potential groundwater zones and proper conjunctive use of both surface groundwater resources may help sustainable management of water resources for sustainable agriculture development in the study region as human induced impacts affect water and the environment and are highly nonlinear they should be well defined measured and understood to maintain the balance between supply and demand 39 the present study only quantified the water balance which may help to get an understanding of the water requirements of humans for management but neglects the environmental water requirement like many other studies across the globe 16 hence considering both human and environmental water requirements may provide better solutions for water security in the area for all ecosystems the present river basin falls in two interstates andhra pradesh and orissa in india and has mutual water sharing agreements go 2004 hence the mutual sharing of data understating of transboundary water requirements and joint data collection and monitoring committees may help to solve and develop better water management strategies to meet sustainable human environment water requirements and their development 33 7 limitations due to a lack of information on detailed aquifer geometry the subsurface of the aquifer in modflow model is more generalized with a single layer aquifer system with uniform aquifer properties the source of the irrigation information is static though a time series of land use information has been implemented in the modelling work the crop rotation is implemented only on major crops vegetables and other horticulture irrigated information is not implemented due to lack of information 8 conclusions the present study quantified the total terrestrial water budget for nagavali river basin considering time series land use and climate for three decades using integrated hydrological modelling which coupled both surface and groundwater flow processes with plausible assumptions the study results indicated that land use and water resource development are modulated by human influence and it is being impacted the total water balance in the study area the long term water balance 1991 2018 indicated the runoff irrigation water requirement and groundwater recharge have increased by 26 48 and 16 respectively due to the combined impact of climate change and land use transformation while groundwater storage has declined by 20 since only 24 of the area is in conjunctive water use and 10 of the area is groundwater dependent agriculture a lot of scope for intensification and expansion of agriculture by identifying potential groundwater aquifers in addition to proper surface water resource development however the model explained that groundwater storage is on a declining trend and spatial patterns of stream aquifer interactions have been changed in the last 28 years hence it is suggested to attempt any water resource development in the area need to be considered spatial and temporal dynamics of hydrological processes to provide sustainable water for all dependent ecosystems that include humans and the environment while protecting upstream and downstream water requirement and rights the current study may help to better understand the dynamics of different hydrological fluxes that could help better water resource management and agriculture development credit authorship contribution statement l surinaidu conceptualization data curation formal

20098,expanding populations intensive agriculture climate change water pollution and depleting natural water resources are the main drivers of water scarcity in india improvisations in wastewater treatment processes for the degradation of pollutants by cost effective means are critical to ensure safe wastewater discharge and its reuse while advancements in technology and science have provided alternatives to the traditional activated sludge process owing to lack of infrastructure funding and awareness the majority of wastewaters being discharged remain untreated depletion of groundwater and its pollution threatens human well being food production aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem balance and climate change previous urban planning programs such as jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission laid the foundation for today s water infrastructure and policies for water management dedicated ministries and programs execute wastewater treatment and discharge river and lake rejuvenation groundwater management and wastewater reuse this review highlights the existing scenario of wastewater treatment with respect to its discharge and reuse in india technocratic involvement of limited stakeholders in the management of the multifaceted issue of water management will further require collaborations and collective action with public and private partners for a robust ecosystem and climate resistant water management key considerations in wastewater treatment groundwater management existing knowledge gaps and policies for water management in india are discussed keywords india groundwater policy water scarcity wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction the national institution for transforming india niti aayog a think tank by the government of india reported that 600 million people in india encounter extreme to high water stress and continued lack of effective interventions can lead to unrelenting water crisis 1 with a decadal growth of 17 the expanding urban population largely contributes to water demand and water pollution from domestic and industrial wastewater discharges 2 extensive migration of rural population to cities has led to an upsurge in utility services resulting in overexploitation of groundwaters besides expanding population industrialization accounts for about a 4 rise in water demand annually resulting in a substantial increase in industrial wastewaters volume 3 it is estimated that the total water demand for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors will rise to 103 billion cubic metres bcm in 2025 and 1447 bcm by 2050 3 disproportionate distribution of natural water resources due to diverse geographies climate change and irregular monsoons trade and commerce further challenge water management in india freshwater inadequacy has led to a rise in the demand for non conventional water resources worldwide with 21 major cities nearing water depletion and various cities being subjected to water supply cuts india now ranks thirteen in the list of water stressed countries 4 this second most populated country is home to 1 3 billion people and the wastewaters generated varies from 15 to 135 l per person day which imposes critical challenges in developing low cost wastewater treatment technologies that meet the current discharge standards 5 6 furthermore water quality challenges such as removal of emerging pollutants and safe greywater reuse also impact water usage calling for urgent attention for the management of this blue gold new ideas have led to the development of inventive technologies that facilitate the wastewater treatment process worldwide on going research and advancements in this area have helped improve the existing process and offer cost effective alternatives activated sludge process asp and trickling filter like techniques are routine biological methods in wastewater treatment processes in india in large scale treatment of wastewaters using asp constant efforts are being made to address the energy requirement of the process which is a major contributor to the process cost molecular approaches have shed light on the composition and conforming functional capacities of activated biomass which otherwise remained least understood and were often considered a black box 7 the knowledge of the functional ability of the bioremediation processes has helped improvise and improve the conventional wastewater treatment processes 8 9 besides asps membrane technologies are also common in wastewater management owing to the multifaceted solutions provided by membranes the membrane based process has been proved to be effective in the treatment and supply of water for domestic and industrial use food and beverage medicine pharma and metallurgy industries 10 common membrane based techniques include microfiltration ultrafiltration ion exchange osmosis reverse and forward and electrodialysis processes to address contaminants from personal care products a benchtop electrocoagulation unit was found effective in the removal of nutrients pathogens and personal care products in domestic wastewaters 11 a cost effective sequential bio filtration system was proposed in addition to the existing post treatment process as it could treat nutrients and polychlorinated biphenyl removal 12 the secondary and tertiary stages of wastewater treatment processes have used microalgae based technologies in cases of eutrophication caused by the presence of inorganics in wastewaters and the effective removal of heavy metal and xenobiotics 13 another advancement in the bioremediation of wastewaters is that of the bioelectrochemical systems and microbial fuel cells which rely on inherent microbial metabolisms that generate electric power while treating the organic matter in wastewater depending on the characteristics of the influent other hybrid techniques such as bacteria algae based approaches integrated membrane microbial fuel cell technologies and sequential anaerobic aerobic processes have been developed for wastewater treatment in india 14 16 the water pollution sources have been categorized as point sources and non point sources environmental protection agency defines point sources as a single identifiable source of water pollution whereas non point sources are defined as diffused sources that are not traceable to a single source point 17 discharges from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants are point sources of wastewaters and phenomena such as urban runoffs agricultural and livestock runoffs are major non point sources of wastewater pollution the current government norm focuses on the treatment of wastewater originating from point sources whereas the non point source discharges are often neglected the pollution of natural water resources is an outcome of diverse wastewaters from sources of which a few are unaccounted for in the wastewater treatment process design water pollution sources such as agricultural runoffs atmospheric depositions and urban and rural runoffs contribute significantly to water pollution which are yet not included in the wastewater management plan 18 20 with respect to the use of chemicals in agriculture while there are now some regulations introduced that the prohibit sale of unbranded pesticides and insecticides in agriculture its implementation in agricultural practices remains uncertain 21 2 wastewater discharge discharge of domestic and industrial wastewaters into water bodies leads to health risks ecological damages and economic loss in about 118 cities of india wastewaters are discharged indirectly into water bodies and in 41 cities wastewaters are directed into rivers 22 information on the national status of wastewater generation and wastewater treatment in all states of india is provided by environmental information system centre on hygiene sanitation sewage treatment systems and technology ministry of environment forest and climate change of the government of india 23 about 25 of industrial wastewaters are discharged into the marine water bodies of our country it has been reported that 6614 million litres per day mld wastewater with an organic pollution load of 426 tonnes per day tpd is discharged into the ganga river 24 owing to the lack of sewage treatment capacity presently 38791 mld of untreated sewage 62 of the total sewage is discharged into water bodies 25 the indian government has specified discharge limits for wastewaters that are revised with the introduction of new policies and regulations that address the increasing water pollution in 1968 the indian standards institution declared the tolerance limits for sewage effluent discharge into surface waters with a maximum limit of various water quality parameters the central pollution control board cpcb norms define the discharge parameters such as ph colour biochemical oxygen demand bod total organic carbon toc oil and grease chromium total dissolved solids tds sulphides phenolics etc specific to the caustic soda industry petroleum industry sugar industry cotton textile industries cement industries leather tanneries and fertilizer industries 25 despite these amendments in addressing various environmental issues the pollution of rivers and streams has amplified 22 a recent national inventory report released by cpcb 2019 stated that from 2016 to 2017 more than 55 000 industrial units produced a total of 7 17 million tonnes of hazardous waste a majority of which is a liquid waste 26 in recent years the honourable national green tribunal s ngt directions have addressed issues of river pollution and wastewater reuse and revised wastewater discharge guidelines 27 29 the ngt s directions for the state to form a river rejuvenation committee in order to design and implement action to address river pollution and wastewater reuse action plans were inclusive of infrastructure upgradation and monitoring program for wastewater reuse wastewater generation and its discharge remain an intensifying problem that has for long attracted innovation and research in private and governmental institutes in india persistent pollutants such as triclocarban and benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers could be detected in water sediment and fish sampled from the rivers kaveri vellar and thamirapani in tamil nadu of india with a possibility of bioaccumulation in inhabiting organisms 30 a joint venture between the european union and india led to the construction of two pilot plants in north and central india using constructed wetlands and solar energy based disinfection techniques for wastewater treatment and reclamation in rural india 31 the wastewater treated in these plants was reused by the local communities for agricultural irrigation zero liquid discharge zld is a strategy proposed by cpcb 2016 for new standards of wastewater discharged by the fertilizer sector and distilleries among other industries 32 33 the objective of zld is to eliminate liquid discharge thus promoting recycling and reuse of wastewaters the ngt s guidelines suggest the adoption of zld for industries releasing highly polluted wastewaters zld has been implemented at a few industrial plants in india like unilever and procter and gamble however the initial installation costs fuel expenses accounting for high operational cost and process failure in case of high total dissolved solids in wastewaters are major bottlenecks to this technology 34 in the last decade government and private organizations have focused on adopting different routes for wastewater treatment alternatives of the conventional asp process include wetlands aquifer systems membrane technologies and biological filters which are gaining popularity for instance about 76 78 organics 77 97 nutrients ad 99 5 99 9 microbes could be removed using natural wetlands for pilot scale wastewater treatment at hyderabad 35 ten full scale moving bed bioreactor systems across india were compared for their efficiency for water reuse and replacement which proved to be a good alternative useful in municipal wastewater treatment plants 36 electrochemical treatment of textile effluent proved to be efficient for colour removal and reducing the organic loading rendering it suitable for the industry for its reuse 37 the performance of soil aquifer treatment was assessed which looked like an attractive option for water reuse in developing countries like india 38 39 principles of network theory and mathematical modelling have been used to understand the risk associated with wastewater discharge in india the inca n and inca p models revealed the transfer of 548 tons and 77 051 tons of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively from tributary ramganga to ganga these nutrients were largely contributed by nearby industries and agricultural run offs 40 the use of a water quality index for a water body at delhi was demonstrated which could further aid in designing policies to maintain wetlands for wastewater management in urban areas 41 despite these advancements there is still potential for developing low cost wastewater treatment technologies that meet the current discharge standards 3 groundwater pollution water warehouses lying under the earth s surface constitute about 30 of the total freshwater resource as groundwaters that are usually extracted through wells bore wells and pumps for human use and agriculture besides serving as a source of freshwater the groundwaters hold an integral position in sustaining aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem balance and support adaptation to uncertain monsoons and extreme summers in the current era of climate change agricultural practices industry and mining activities improper waste disposals infrastructure and transport groundwater pollution have resulted in groundwater contamination in various regions of india the 5th minor irrigation census by the central ground water board reported about 60 groundwater depletion in india from 2007 to 2017 of which about 90 was used in irrigation water extensive agriculture in the case of crops like paddy and sugarcane has led to a depletion of groundwaters especially in the northern regions of india as confirmed by a satellite image based study by the national aeronautics and space administration 42 furthermore the states possessing substantial levels of groundwater are polluted waters various studies have detected toxicants and heavy metals like arsenic chromium lead nitrate cadmium pesticides 43 46 over withdrawal led by agriculture and withdrawal and groundwater pollution threaten the availability of freshwater for consumption and agriculture 47 the groundwater problem gets even more complicated to resolve as deforestation hampers the water holding capacity of soils and climate change has led to droughts and floods in various regions 48 the niti aayog s observations that were based on indicators such as groundwater restoration irrigation management water use in agriculture drinking water supply and water policy framework in assessing state level water management resulted in learning that 70 of the groundwater resources which account for about 40 of total water supply in india were contaminated 49 the national water framework bill was introduced in 2013 that prohibited companies through privatization of water and the groundwater sustainable management bill that was introduced in 2017 aimed at decentralization of groundwater use and its regulation more recently in july 2019 the ministry of environment forest and climate change has discussed the regulation of groundwater through measures like a registry of bore wells and reuse of wastewaters and strict rules have been imposed for clearance of new projects that rely on groundwater in severely impacted regions in a case seeking remedial action against falling groundwater levels in the country the ngt recently passed an order directing cpcb to determine past illegal extraction of groundwater and environmental compensation to be recovered leading to the formulation of the environmental compensation formula 50 currently central water commission central ground water authority and central pollution control board contribute to laws and policies for groundwater use in india routine groundwater monitoring periodic risk assessment and identification of point and non point sources of pollution and groundwater pollution control are some of the necessary actions in preserving and improving groundwater quality and our health 4 policy and actions vis à vis management in india the institutional and legal provisions in the treatment of wastewaters have been enlisted in the water prevention and control of pollution act 1974 under this act standards are developed and enforced for the treatment of municipal wastewater by pollution control boards the cpcb recommends wastewater discharge standards and the state pollution boards are at liberty to imply more severe standards in the case of certain highly polluted rivers or streams 51 for industries that generate toxic wastewaters or higher concentrations of pollutants the directions recommend the application of zld 32 33 environment protection act 1986 provided the standards of quality of air water or soil for various areas and purposes defined hazardous substances and the acceptable concentration of environmental pollutants following the environmental protection agency s standards industry specific standards for emission and effluent discharge were provided in the environmental protection rules 1989 india s national water policy was first formulated in 1987 and was last revised in 2012 for planning and developing optimizing use of water resources with respect to water management in urban india the jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission jnnurm 2005 2014 made some significant contributions the mission was inclusive of water and sanitation in its objective of urban development that aimed at extending basic services to the urban poor by improving housing water and sanitation along with infrastructure and asset management its sub mission entitled urban infrastructure and governance focused on water supply and sanitation besides solid waste management road development and redevelopment of old cities as a result of this mission priority sectors in water management such as water supply sewerage solid waste management and drainage were identified the progress and learnings from this mission helped shaped the ongoing atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation amrut 2015 ongoing under the ministry of housing and urban affairs that has funded about 90 cities of india for various objectives of this scheme 52 the objectives of amrut aim to provide every household access to assured water supply and sewerage connections by augmentation of existing water supply water treatment installation of meters rehabilitation of old water supply systems stormwater drainage rejuvenation of water bodies for drinking water and recharging of groundwaters as a result of amrut the conclusive state annual action plans to track year wise progress in water supply and sewerage infrastructure were also developed in may 2019 the ministry of water resources river development and ganga rejuvenation and the ministry of drinking water and sanitation merged to form the ministry of jal shakti various ongoing programs under this ministry include the ganga rejuvenation interlinking of rivers programme command area development works flood management infrastructure development and research and development in water management through inter sectoral co ordination the ganga rejuvenation initiative aims at restoring the continuous and unpolluted flow of the river the interlinking of rivers programme aims at achieving water distribution equity by enhancing the availability of water for which around 30 links for inter basin transfer of water have been identified 53 in addition to groundwaters and rivers lakes are an integral component of the environmental ecosystems and its biodiversity lakes serve as a source of water supply for a municipality aquaculture and agriculture extensive development and urbanization have impacted the lakes of india as a result of which several lake rejuvenation projects have been undertaken ministry of environment forests and climate change implements the national lake conservation plan for the protection and management of polluted lakes in urban and semi urban regions of india this plan assists state governments in lake conservation initiatives through partnerships with local communities and private institutes initiatives at the hebbal lake in mysuru mansagar lake in rajasthan kaikondrahalli lake in karnataka rajokri lake in delhi powai lake in mumbai hussain sagar lake in hyderabad jakkur lake in bangalore sembakkam lake in chennai udaipur lakes in rajasthan and others in india led by government and private institutions as their corporate social responsibility have led to establishing private sector s partnerships with local communities and government for undertaking these lake rejuvenation projects and water infrastructures issues such partnerships can strengthen public private collaborations that can accelerate the progress in water management especially in developing countries 54 55 even though india has taken various measures to improve its water supply there are still extremely serious apprehensions regarding the availability of safe drinking water these challenges cannot be tackled and solved by one organization or any government entity alone instead it demands a collaborative and determined effort of relevant stakeholders to contribute to reducing costs and designing solutions to existing water challenges the rapid growth of urban and peri urban areas of india requires that sewage treatment plants constructed be sustainable and able to adapt to the community s changing sanitation needs in recommending a suitable wastewater system there is a need for collaborations among water authorities wastewater treatment technologies developers public participation climate scientists geological and social experts india s swachh bharat mission also emphasizes the need for teamwork and consultation by the inclusion of diverse groups from all potential hierarchies 56 an assessment of existing water policies for indian states that were identified as water scarce including punjab haryana rajasthan gujarat chhattisgarh andhra pradesh and tamil nadu revealed that india is defiant in the translation of scientific knowledge in policymaking 57 the delhi water reform project revealed the flexibility of water policies and the role of the world bank local and state governments in shaping water policies for urban india 58 a recent comparison of water pricing in urban cities of india and china revealed significant variations in water tariffs and water prices to be higher in water scarce cities 59 the reason of rising in water prices in india and china was assessed and it could be derived that both countries fail in meeting policy targets 60 a similar comparison of water management in india and sweden led to the conclusion that an integral part of water management is to educate people about the significance of water resources and wastewater management 61 an assessment of the world s 400 largest river basins and water storage capacity for water security recognized water shortage risks in india and other countries like australia northern china spain and the western usa 62 with about 20 million groundwater irrigators and 14 million tube wells in india the privately owned groundwater infrastructure makes up for a larger area of irrigation in comparison to surface irrigation 63 the shifting of the paradigm from waste water treatment to resource recovery systems can address water scarcity and advance water and agricultural sustainability reuse of grey wastewater provides an opportunity to generate a circular economy by benefiting resource recovery food and animal farming environmental sustainability 27 besides preventing further pollution the existing contaminants of water bodies draw equal attention with respect to water resource management india has witnessed the 3 main laws the water act 1974 water cess act 1977 and environmental act 1986 that have defined more than 30 parameters for wastewater discharge into water bodies however there is potential for improvements in existing metrics for the inclusion of surface water groundwater interactions non renewable groundwater resources risk and uncertainties and socio economic disparities of india 64 while we witness the rapid urbanization at the cost of natural resources insights provided in this review help identify gaps that need consideration in the formulation of the next water policy the identified gaps include a need to incorporate non point sources in wastewater treatment and management implement effective wastewater reuse strategies nutrient recovery from wastewaters and prevention of widespread antibiotic resistance in water bodies at present india s 40 of thermal power plants are in areas with limited water and in the previous years 2013 2016 these utilities were forced to temporarily shut down owing to water shortage 65 going forward in attempts at water infrastructure expansion the impact of deforestation and climate change needs to be included in the evaluation of proposed outputs 5 conclusion the paper aimed to highlight the issues seeking attention and consideration from policymakers to achieve efficient wastewater management in india the policies and various missions under distinct ministries of india that work for water management in india were discussed and the guidelines for wastewater discharge were summarized the contribution of non point sources to water pollution and existing gaps in wastewater management strategies were identified the findings and message conveyed by various international and national reports have raised awareness around the depletion of water resources and the extent of water pollution 49 65 emerging pollutants and micropollutants antimicrobial resistance and pathogens in natural water resources and reused grey waters greenhouse gas emissions by the water industry

20098,expanding populations intensive agriculture climate change water pollution and depleting natural water resources are the main drivers of water scarcity in india improvisations in wastewater treatment processes for the degradation of pollutants by cost effective means are critical to ensure safe wastewater discharge and its reuse while advancements in technology and science have provided alternatives to the traditional activated sludge process owing to lack of infrastructure funding and awareness the majority of wastewaters being discharged remain untreated depletion of groundwater and its pollution threatens human well being food production aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem balance and climate change previous urban planning programs such as jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission laid the foundation for today s water infrastructure and policies for water management dedicated ministries and programs execute wastewater treatment and discharge river and lake rejuvenation groundwater management and wastewater reuse this review highlights the existing scenario of wastewater treatment with respect to its discharge and reuse in india technocratic involvement of limited stakeholders in the management of the multifaceted issue of water management will further require collaborations and collective action with public and private partners for a robust ecosystem and climate resistant water management key considerations in wastewater treatment groundwater management existing knowledge gaps and policies for water management in india are discussed keywords india groundwater policy water scarcity wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction the national institution for transforming india niti aayog a think tank by the government of india reported that 600 million people in india encounter extreme to high water stress and continued lack of effective interventions can lead to unrelenting water crisis 1 with a decadal growth of 17 the expanding urban population largely contributes to water demand and water pollution from domestic and industrial wastewater discharges 2 extensive migration of rural population to cities has led to an upsurge in utility services resulting in overexploitation of groundwaters besides expanding population industrialization accounts for about a 4 rise in water demand annually resulting in a substantial increase in industrial wastewaters volume 3 it is estimated that the total water demand for domestic industrial and agricultural sectors will rise to 103 billion cubic metres bcm in 2025 and 1447 bcm by 2050 3 disproportionate distribution of natural water resources due to diverse geographies climate change and irregular monsoons trade and commerce further challenge water management in india freshwater inadequacy has led to a rise in the demand for non conventional water resources worldwide with 21 major cities nearing water depletion and various cities being subjected to water supply cuts india now ranks thirteen in the list of water stressed countries 4 this second most populated country is home to 1 3 billion people and the wastewaters generated varies from 15 to 135 l per person day which imposes critical challenges in developing low cost wastewater treatment technologies that meet the current discharge standards 5 6 furthermore water quality challenges such as removal of emerging pollutants and safe greywater reuse also impact water usage calling for urgent attention for the management of this blue gold new ideas have led to the development of inventive technologies that facilitate the wastewater treatment process worldwide on going research and advancements in this area have helped improve the existing process and offer cost effective alternatives activated sludge process asp and trickling filter like techniques are routine biological methods in wastewater treatment processes in india in large scale treatment of wastewaters using asp constant efforts are being made to address the energy requirement of the process which is a major contributor to the process cost molecular approaches have shed light on the composition and conforming functional capacities of activated biomass which otherwise remained least understood and were often considered a black box 7 the knowledge of the functional ability of the bioremediation processes has helped improvise and improve the conventional wastewater treatment processes 8 9 besides asps membrane technologies are also common in wastewater management owing to the multifaceted solutions provided by membranes the membrane based process has been proved to be effective in the treatment and supply of water for domestic and industrial use food and beverage medicine pharma and metallurgy industries 10 common membrane based techniques include microfiltration ultrafiltration ion exchange osmosis reverse and forward and electrodialysis processes to address contaminants from personal care products a benchtop electrocoagulation unit was found effective in the removal of nutrients pathogens and personal care products in domestic wastewaters 11 a cost effective sequential bio filtration system was proposed in addition to the existing post treatment process as it could treat nutrients and polychlorinated biphenyl removal 12 the secondary and tertiary stages of wastewater treatment processes have used microalgae based technologies in cases of eutrophication caused by the presence of inorganics in wastewaters and the effective removal of heavy metal and xenobiotics 13 another advancement in the bioremediation of wastewaters is that of the bioelectrochemical systems and microbial fuel cells which rely on inherent microbial metabolisms that generate electric power while treating the organic matter in wastewater depending on the characteristics of the influent other hybrid techniques such as bacteria algae based approaches integrated membrane microbial fuel cell technologies and sequential anaerobic aerobic processes have been developed for wastewater treatment in india 14 16 the water pollution sources have been categorized as point sources and non point sources environmental protection agency defines point sources as a single identifiable source of water pollution whereas non point sources are defined as diffused sources that are not traceable to a single source point 17 discharges from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants are point sources of wastewaters and phenomena such as urban runoffs agricultural and livestock runoffs are major non point sources of wastewater pollution the current government norm focuses on the treatment of wastewater originating from point sources whereas the non point source discharges are often neglected the pollution of natural water resources is an outcome of diverse wastewaters from sources of which a few are unaccounted for in the wastewater treatment process design water pollution sources such as agricultural runoffs atmospheric depositions and urban and rural runoffs contribute significantly to water pollution which are yet not included in the wastewater management plan 18 20 with respect to the use of chemicals in agriculture while there are now some regulations introduced that the prohibit sale of unbranded pesticides and insecticides in agriculture its implementation in agricultural practices remains uncertain 21 2 wastewater discharge discharge of domestic and industrial wastewaters into water bodies leads to health risks ecological damages and economic loss in about 118 cities of india wastewaters are discharged indirectly into water bodies and in 41 cities wastewaters are directed into rivers 22 information on the national status of wastewater generation and wastewater treatment in all states of india is provided by environmental information system centre on hygiene sanitation sewage treatment systems and technology ministry of environment forest and climate change of the government of india 23 about 25 of industrial wastewaters are discharged into the marine water bodies of our country it has been reported that 6614 million litres per day mld wastewater with an organic pollution load of 426 tonnes per day tpd is discharged into the ganga river 24 owing to the lack of sewage treatment capacity presently 38791 mld of untreated sewage 62 of the total sewage is discharged into water bodies 25 the indian government has specified discharge limits for wastewaters that are revised with the introduction of new policies and regulations that address the increasing water pollution in 1968 the indian standards institution declared the tolerance limits for sewage effluent discharge into surface waters with a maximum limit of various water quality parameters the central pollution control board cpcb norms define the discharge parameters such as ph colour biochemical oxygen demand bod total organic carbon toc oil and grease chromium total dissolved solids tds sulphides phenolics etc specific to the caustic soda industry petroleum industry sugar industry cotton textile industries cement industries leather tanneries and fertilizer industries 25 despite these amendments in addressing various environmental issues the pollution of rivers and streams has amplified 22 a recent national inventory report released by cpcb 2019 stated that from 2016 to 2017 more than 55 000 industrial units produced a total of 7 17 million tonnes of hazardous waste a majority of which is a liquid waste 26 in recent years the honourable national green tribunal s ngt directions have addressed issues of river pollution and wastewater reuse and revised wastewater discharge guidelines 27 29 the ngt s directions for the state to form a river rejuvenation committee in order to design and implement action to address river pollution and wastewater reuse action plans were inclusive of infrastructure upgradation and monitoring program for wastewater reuse wastewater generation and its discharge remain an intensifying problem that has for long attracted innovation and research in private and governmental institutes in india persistent pollutants such as triclocarban and benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers could be detected in water sediment and fish sampled from the rivers kaveri vellar and thamirapani in tamil nadu of india with a possibility of bioaccumulation in inhabiting organisms 30 a joint venture between the european union and india led to the construction of two pilot plants in north and central india using constructed wetlands and solar energy based disinfection techniques for wastewater treatment and reclamation in rural india 31 the wastewater treated in these plants was reused by the local communities for agricultural irrigation zero liquid discharge zld is a strategy proposed by cpcb 2016 for new standards of wastewater discharged by the fertilizer sector and distilleries among other industries 32 33 the objective of zld is to eliminate liquid discharge thus promoting recycling and reuse of wastewaters the ngt s guidelines suggest the adoption of zld for industries releasing highly polluted wastewaters zld has been implemented at a few industrial plants in india like unilever and procter and gamble however the initial installation costs fuel expenses accounting for high operational cost and process failure in case of high total dissolved solids in wastewaters are major bottlenecks to this technology 34 in the last decade government and private organizations have focused on adopting different routes for wastewater treatment alternatives of the conventional asp process include wetlands aquifer systems membrane technologies and biological filters which are gaining popularity for instance about 76 78 organics 77 97 nutrients ad 99 5 99 9 microbes could be removed using natural wetlands for pilot scale wastewater treatment at hyderabad 35 ten full scale moving bed bioreactor systems across india were compared for their efficiency for water reuse and replacement which proved to be a good alternative useful in municipal wastewater treatment plants 36 electrochemical treatment of textile effluent proved to be efficient for colour removal and reducing the organic loading rendering it suitable for the industry for its reuse 37 the performance of soil aquifer treatment was assessed which looked like an attractive option for water reuse in developing countries like india 38 39 principles of network theory and mathematical modelling have been used to understand the risk associated with wastewater discharge in india the inca n and inca p models revealed the transfer of 548 tons and 77 051 tons of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively from tributary ramganga to ganga these nutrients were largely contributed by nearby industries and agricultural run offs 40 the use of a water quality index for a water body at delhi was demonstrated which could further aid in designing policies to maintain wetlands for wastewater management in urban areas 41 despite these advancements there is still potential for developing low cost wastewater treatment technologies that meet the current discharge standards 3 groundwater pollution water warehouses lying under the earth s surface constitute about 30 of the total freshwater resource as groundwaters that are usually extracted through wells bore wells and pumps for human use and agriculture besides serving as a source of freshwater the groundwaters hold an integral position in sustaining aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem balance and support adaptation to uncertain monsoons and extreme summers in the current era of climate change agricultural practices industry and mining activities improper waste disposals infrastructure and transport groundwater pollution have resulted in groundwater contamination in various regions of india the 5th minor irrigation census by the central ground water board reported about 60 groundwater depletion in india from 2007 to 2017 of which about 90 was used in irrigation water extensive agriculture in the case of crops like paddy and sugarcane has led to a depletion of groundwaters especially in the northern regions of india as confirmed by a satellite image based study by the national aeronautics and space administration 42 furthermore the states possessing substantial levels of groundwater are polluted waters various studies have detected toxicants and heavy metals like arsenic chromium lead nitrate cadmium pesticides 43 46 over withdrawal led by agriculture and withdrawal and groundwater pollution threaten the availability of freshwater for consumption and agriculture 47 the groundwater problem gets even more complicated to resolve as deforestation hampers the water holding capacity of soils and climate change has led to droughts and floods in various regions 48 the niti aayog s observations that were based on indicators such as groundwater restoration irrigation management water use in agriculture drinking water supply and water policy framework in assessing state level water management resulted in learning that 70 of the groundwater resources which account for about 40 of total water supply in india were contaminated 49 the national water framework bill was introduced in 2013 that prohibited companies through privatization of water and the groundwater sustainable management bill that was introduced in 2017 aimed at decentralization of groundwater use and its regulation more recently in july 2019 the ministry of environment forest and climate change has discussed the regulation of groundwater through measures like a registry of bore wells and reuse of wastewaters and strict rules have been imposed for clearance of new projects that rely on groundwater in severely impacted regions in a case seeking remedial action against falling groundwater levels in the country the ngt recently passed an order directing cpcb to determine past illegal extraction of groundwater and environmental compensation to be recovered leading to the formulation of the environmental compensation formula 50 currently central water commission central ground water authority and central pollution control board contribute to laws and policies for groundwater use in india routine groundwater monitoring periodic risk assessment and identification of point and non point sources of pollution and groundwater pollution control are some of the necessary actions in preserving and improving groundwater quality and our health 4 policy and actions vis à vis management in india the institutional and legal provisions in the treatment of wastewaters have been enlisted in the water prevention and control of pollution act 1974 under this act standards are developed and enforced for the treatment of municipal wastewater by pollution control boards the cpcb recommends wastewater discharge standards and the state pollution boards are at liberty to imply more severe standards in the case of certain highly polluted rivers or streams 51 for industries that generate toxic wastewaters or higher concentrations of pollutants the directions recommend the application of zld 32 33 environment protection act 1986 provided the standards of quality of air water or soil for various areas and purposes defined hazardous substances and the acceptable concentration of environmental pollutants following the environmental protection agency s standards industry specific standards for emission and effluent discharge were provided in the environmental protection rules 1989 india s national water policy was first formulated in 1987 and was last revised in 2012 for planning and developing optimizing use of water resources with respect to water management in urban india the jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission jnnurm 2005 2014 made some significant contributions the mission was inclusive of water and sanitation in its objective of urban development that aimed at extending basic services to the urban poor by improving housing water and sanitation along with infrastructure and asset management its sub mission entitled urban infrastructure and governance focused on water supply and sanitation besides solid waste management road development and redevelopment of old cities as a result of this mission priority sectors in water management such as water supply sewerage solid waste management and drainage were identified the progress and learnings from this mission helped shaped the ongoing atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation amrut 2015 ongoing under the ministry of housing and urban affairs that has funded about 90 cities of india for various objectives of this scheme 52 the objectives of amrut aim to provide every household access to assured water supply and sewerage connections by augmentation of existing water supply water treatment installation of meters rehabilitation of old water supply systems stormwater drainage rejuvenation of water bodies for drinking water and recharging of groundwaters as a result of amrut the conclusive state annual action plans to track year wise progress in water supply and sewerage infrastructure were also developed in may 2019 the ministry of water resources river development and ganga rejuvenation and the ministry of drinking water and sanitation merged to form the ministry of jal shakti various ongoing programs under this ministry include the ganga rejuvenation interlinking of rivers programme command area development works flood management infrastructure development and research and development in water management through inter sectoral co ordination the ganga rejuvenation initiative aims at restoring the continuous and unpolluted flow of the river the interlinking of rivers programme aims at achieving water distribution equity by enhancing the availability of water for which around 30 links for inter basin transfer of water have been identified 53 in addition to groundwaters and rivers lakes are an integral component of the environmental ecosystems and its biodiversity lakes serve as a source of water supply for a municipality aquaculture and agriculture extensive development and urbanization have impacted the lakes of india as a result of which several lake rejuvenation projects have been undertaken ministry of environment forests and climate change implements the national lake conservation plan for the protection and management of polluted lakes in urban and semi urban regions of india this plan assists

government and private institutions as their corporate social responsibility have led to establishing private sector s partnerships with local communities and government for undertaking these lake rejuvenation projects and water infrastructures issues such partnerships can strengthen public private collaborations that can accelerate the progress in water management especially in developing countries 54 55 even though india has taken various measures to improve its water supply there are still extremely serious apprehensions regarding the availability of safe drinking water these

20099,as the global community faces increasing water related challenges enabling safe and secure water access will require cooperation purposeful water management and a variety of expertise and interdisciplinary research collaboration this review uses tools from bibliometrics and network science to explore overlap and collaboration of scholars studying transboundary water resources and water security management we explore intersections between these communities through an analysis of publications trends a content analysis of abstracts using natural language processing and co authorship networks we glean five key findings from our results including that slight variations in keywords used in the literature search in these two topic areas result in different communities of scholars and publications our results show that while publications on these topics are increasing over time and there is meaningful overlap between the two topics the number of scholars publishing in both areas is not increasing over time the co authorship networks demonstrate that few authors participate in both transboundary water resources and water security management research communities and that authors who have knowledge from both topic areas are uniquely positioned within their social networks to facilitate collaboration we find no correlation between the betweenness centrality and the citation count for authors measures which are both used to evaluate author influence the content analysis of abstracts reveals important areas of overlap in the topics addressed such as climate change development and governance as well as areas of dissimilarity in the scales and focus of these works although we found that the broad scope of the water security framework included some of the most prominent scholars studying transboundary water resources much of the transboundary water resource scholarship was not captured by water security keywords this work demonstrates that if we are to continue to use integrative yet actionable frameworks in the pursuit of convergent water research we must think carefully about how we craft these frameworks and whether our choice of language is constructive or destructive in bringing together relevant scholars and research keywords bibliometric analysis networks water management transboundary water resources water security research collaboration 1 introduction under future climate change an increasing proportion of the global population will face a variety of water related challenges such as water scarcity and flooding 27 increased variability will necessitate skilled and purposeful water management often requiring the cooperation of many parties especially since about 40 of the global population lives in an international river basin shared among two or more countries 35 as the study of water security transcends many scales 9 13 and is often transboundary in nature and other similar themes such as the importance of good governance are often explored 9 13 we hypothesized that there would be substantial overlap and regular examples of collaboration between scholars who study water security management and scholars who study transboundary water resources the need for interdisciplinarity and simultaneous consideration of diverse and interconnected issues in addressing global water challenges has been recognized by numerous scholars 10 33 previous studies have also shown that collaboration can increase the number of publications a researcher publishes 21 and that collaborative works tend to have a higher impact 18 if we are to address grand water challenges with collaboration and convergent research aiding in this pursuit we must determine how best to bring the relevant skills and expertise of many researchers together in a productive collaboration a first step in this process is to ensure diverse research communities can communicate effectively across language language has the potential to both constrain and facilitate collaboration and the specific language used to describe various water related concepts has evolved over time a discussion at the environmental peacebuilding conference held in irvine california in october 2019 on the topic of definitions and language use inspired this work the first high level panel of this conference began by articulating how different parties defined environmental peacebuilding some panel members focused on environmental security as a framework and explicitly spoke about the environment and war including preventative defense and environmental cooperation others were more interested in using the term to emphasize a relationship between the environment and healthy communities one panel member claimed that a more generalizable definition should be created to unite the community as people currently use the definition in the way that they like it best while some panel members thought that coming to a shared agreement on the definition was important others emphasized that the definition does not matter instead in practice they described that people need an entry point with which to realize that their work is relevant in multiple contexts in this study we utilize tools from bibliometrics and network science to analyze overlap and collaboration between the study of transboundary water resources and water security management to examine whether there is a sufficient entry point for these two communities of researchers to come together these two topic areas were frequently featured at the environmental peacebuilding conference and seemed to explore similar themes although we observed that methodological techniques or foci seemed to differ depending on whether the session focused on one topic or the other we seek to expand understanding and stimulate discourse around how and why transboundary water resource and water security management research themes overlap and differ first we identify communities of researchers who study transboundary water resources and water security management through keyword searches in the web of science 8 we then investigate overlap through examining the growth of publications in the two topic areas exploring disciplinary scope and publication sources examining the content of abstracts using natural language processing techniques to determine word frequency and word similarity and constructing co authorship networks and publication networks rather than providing a thematic analysis style review our study expands current research across both transboundary water resources and water security management using these three techniques to explore the current state of collaboration and to showcase areas of intersection and dissimilarity that may provide potential opportunities for knowledge sharing 2 materials and methods 2 1 database generation and categorical analysis search terms were selected to identify research within the web of science wos database 8 related to water resources shared over boundaries we included all publications that were returned from the keyword search when the search terms were present in the title abstract keywords or keywords plus 7 29 our dataset was exported from wos on may 13th 2020 and analyzed using python table s1 contains select phrases used in exploratory topic searches and the resulting number of publications the two keyword searches transboundary water resources and water security management were chosen due to their similar size search results and their inclusion of keywords comparing transboundary and water security authors whose publications are found in the results of both topic searches in wos are defined as overlapping authors in this study overlapping authors are examined as a proxy for research participation in each topic area of transboundary water resources and water security management we examine author overlap by comparing the number of authors whose published literature appears in each topic search 2 2 content analysis to examine overlap between topics we analyze the content of abstracts for all publications found in the search results using natural language processing techniques from wordcloud 24 and natural language toolkit nltk 3 python packages first we compare the 30 most commonly used words and phrases in each topic area we use word frequency to examine potential overlap or differences between publications on transboundary water resources and water security as we would expect that if the documents described similar content their most frequently used words would also be similar next we use the similar function within nltk to examine the distributional similarity of important and relevant words and we compare the similar words returned for each topic area distributional similarity measures the number of contexts shared by a word of choice and other words found within the body of text 26 by examining other words found within common contexts as transboundary security and management in each topic area and comparing them we are able to hypothesize about whether or not the words are being used in similar ways in each research community 2 3 network creation and analysis in addition to categorical and content analyses we utilized tools from network science the study of complex phenomena through networks to construct and analyze two different types of networks co authorship networks and a publication network fig 1 co authorship networks were constructed with information gathered from each wos search in which nodes represent authors and edges between authors indicate co authorship fig 1 the average node degree number of edges represents the average number of co authors or research collaborations edge weights represent the frequency of collaborations the number of connected components represents the number of isolated co author communities or singular authors and we use the size of the largest connected component as an indication of how connected researchers are to the rest of the field 11 25 we examine the network structure of each topic separately as well as a combined network in which authors that appear in both topic searches are denoted we also examine network position by computing the betweenness centrality of nodes as a potential proxy for control over communication activity within the network 1 betweenness centrality is a measure of the frequency in which a node appears in the shortest paths of other nodes 12 building on chung s 2009 interpretation of burt s 1992 structural holes theory in which power and influence accrue to those who broker connections between unconnected groups of people 6 we examine betweenness centrality as it relates to a node s topic categorization and connection to others who publish in a particular topic betweenness centrality may also represent a measure of structural social capital held by a researcher within the network 23 li et al 23 describe relational social capital as assets that are shared through relationships which can be manifested in trust commitment and reciprocity and expressed as repeated co authorships 23 in our network this is expressed as the edge weight cognitive social capital can be expressed in a co authorship network through the extent of time that an author has published in a particular discipline 23 after an author spends time in a discipline they gain knowledge of shared visions traditions codes languages knowledge interpretations systems of meanings social networks and collectively owned social capital 23 which they can then share with others because we assign authors to explicit research communities through the bounds of our topic searches within the web of science publication database we can measure cognitive capital through both publication tenure and topic expertise we also calculate the total number of citations each author receives for their publications in either topic and examine whether this correlates with an author s betweenness centrality if we use citation count as a potential measure of influence 17 we would expect that it would be correlated with betweenness centrality as this is a measure of potential structural influence within the network we also construct and analyze a network in which publications are nodes edges are instances of co authorship among one or more authors in the publication and node color represents the topic area fig 1 here we seek to understand how particular ideas or frameworks for understanding water resources are connected by research collaborations we examine how publications from each topic area are linked to one another through authors involved in multiple topic areas to understand the potential for information flow all networks were created using the networkx python package 16 and visualized using gephi 2 we utilized the fruchterman reingold force directed algorithm within gephi to create network layouts code to create the networks from wos search results can be found in the si 3 findings and discussion our results lead us to consider 5 main findings outlined below and featured in fig 2 3 1 content and author overlap studies of transboundary water resources twr and water security and management wsm have meaningful overlap even though few authors publish in both topics analysis of results from the web of science searches reveals overlap in the general disciplinary reach for each topic among the four most prevalent disciplinary categories fig 3 a a wide variety of disciplines study each topic but the distribution of categories is larger for the wsm topic area twr publications fall into 65 different wos categories whereas wsm publications fall into 103 different categories and twr only has 7 unique categories while 58 categories overlap some notable differences include 9 publications that fall under social issues within twr literature compared with zero wsm publications in this category similarly 6 7 of publications from twr compared to only 0 8 of publications from wsm fall into the category of law although addressing water security can most certainly involve social issues and law e g kuokkanen 2017 38 it appears that this is not captured within the wos categorization overall the overlap between the top 4 most frequent categories between the two topic searches and the general similarity between categorizations indicate an apparent similarity between the disciplinary reach of the two topic searches exploring the language used in abstracts in each topic area allowed us to better understand content similarities and differences between the two topic areas and we found many areas of overlap as well as some important distinctions relating to scale and focus among the most frequently used 100 words and phrases within abstract text in transboundary water resources and water security management search results a total of 68 words phrases are shared table s3 our results suggest that both climate change and development are particularly salient themes within twr and wsm scholarship as these words have high frequency across both groups of articles table s3 beyond word frequency an examination of words that appear in the same contexts as specific keywords showed us similarities and differences in the ways in which these words are used in each body of abstracts fig 4 when comparing words which share the same contexts as the word transboundary in each collection of abstracts sustainable land water and future are found in both collections fig 4 contexts relating to scale differ when referencing transboundary in each group twr features words such as international regional mekong basin and local whereas urban is the only word similar to transboundary in wsm abstracts referring to scale iuwm also appears referring to integrated urban water management again at the urban scale words associated with the context of water sources differ between collections of abstracts words such as river and surface share contexts with transboundary in twr abstracts whereas words such as ground and drinking share contexts with transboundary in wsm abstracts we interpret these results to mean that wsm literature is more often focused on smaller scales whereas twr literature focuses on state to state scales and larger hydrologic features such as rivers or large international basins this supports findings from previous reviews which found that water security research at transboundary scales is significantly less frequent than other scales 9 13 cook and bakker 9 highlighted that scholars within different disciplines tend to highlight different scales studies of development most often focused on the national scale hydrological studies occurred at the watershed regional or national scale and social science studies were most often focused at the community scale 9 work which examines conflict and cooperation over transboundary water resources often highlights the state to state scale largely because this work deals with water resources in the complex context of institutional political social and cultural systems although some of this work also describes sub national scales 31 34 there are 10 words that are found in similar contexts to the word management that appear in both twr and wsm abstracts fig 4 many of these words are associated with the quality and quantity of water and words relating to human interaction with the water system appear such as governance wsm abstracts return more words with a negative connotation with similarity to management such as shortage insecurity and stress whereas these words are not found in the 20 most similar words in twr abstracts twr abstracts contain words similar to management that are related to human negotiation over water resources such as shared sharing or cooperation while wsm abstracts contain words that seem to refer more to the water system itself such as infrastructure and conservation our results also suggest that the inclusion of the keyword management with water security tends to highlight research at urban scales fig 4 we interpret our similarity results around the context of management to show a difference between topics where wsm abstracts focus more on how the water infrastructure is managed and twr literature focuses more on the social nature and negotiation taking place within water management such as studies on conflict and cooperation over water resources 34 definitions of water security provided by entities such as the global water partnership and the un recognize that management and negotiation are key components of water security 15 32 and previous water security scholarship has called for a more integrative and broad framing of water security research while recognizing the difficulties in operationalizing this broad framing and the prevalence of reductionist studies 9 36 cook and bakker describe that an integrative approach to water security highlights the topic of governance advancing water security research 9 while governance coordination and collaboration have long been main themes within research on transboundary water resources 34 wolf describes that increasing threats to water resources related to water quality and the use of less traditional sources that are not constrained to watershed boundaries could distinguish future water disputes from those in the past 34 which could more tightly link scholarship on transboundary water resources and water security in exploring whether the words transboundary and security were being used in the same way in twr and wsm literature we noticed that these words shared many contexts with words representing other systems such as food and agricultural within the wsm literature in twr abstracts however transboundary and security shared more common contexts with words representing the water system itself such as basin or river these results suggest that the conceptualization of security of the water system may extend to include other systems explicitly within water security literature whereas other systems are mentioned less often or explicitly within twr literature previous work has highlighted water security in the context of the water energy food wef nexus suggesting that water security is often paramount to ensure food and energy security 30 it is likely that the conceptualization of research on twr and wsm will continue to evolve as both twr and wsm appear to be relatively new terms in the literature twr emerges within two publications in 1991 and wsm emerges from three publications in 1995 fig 5 the first instance in which an author published works in both topic areas occurs in 2000 fig 5 a total of 4 577 authors published in either topic area with 1 551 publishing only on the topic of twr 2 832 only publishing on the topic of wsm and 194 representing 4 2 of the total publishing in both topics between 1991 and 2019 the percentage of authors publishing in both topic areas in a given year ranges from 0 8 to 6 2 from 2000 to 2019 the percentage of authors publishing in both topic areas does not appear to be increasing from 2015 to 2019 and between 1991 and 2007 only 7 authors published in both topic areas thus while the disciplinary reach and similar content between abstracts suggests that there is substantial overlap between the topics few scholars are publishing in both areas 3 2 effect of variations in keywords one potential reason that scholars would not appear in search results for both twr and wsm even if their work might fall under these topic areas is that they are not using the same terminology or keywords to describe their work our results suggest that even slight variations in the keywords used in a literature search in these topics produce different communities of scholars and publications table 1 table s1 as shown in table 1 very few authors overlap between topic searches in general even between searches in a similar topic that use seemingly similar language comparing searches that each use the word governance produces some author overlap 969 authors overlap between the water resources governance search and the river basin governance search 30 of the authors in the water resources governance search and 45 of the authors in the river basin governance search when comparing keywords used for searches that address the two main topic areas considered in this paper we find very little overlap as mentioned previously only 194 authors overlap between transboundary water resources and water security management searches 11 and 6 of authors in each search previous work has shown that author chosen keywords are likely to include field specific language 39 one study examining the field specificity of keywords in 200 articles found that the percentage of keywords described as general terms was very low only 5 7 of words used in titles and only 21 of keywords 37 using field specific language that is not well understood by many disciplines could prevent the sharing of knowledge among relevant communities and especially in a web based search of literature could make research less discoverable in addition to field specific language the language used to describe broad research themes changes over time although the first instances of research described by transboundary water resources and water security management keywords appear in 1991 and 1995 respectively in web of science the first search result for river basin management appears in 1963 this could indicate that research on the themes described in this work has occurred long before 1991 but the language has changed or expanded this makes language choice very important and also provides grounds for an investigation into whether this language could be a barrier in uniting communities of scholars and instigating collaboration on important research addressing grand water challenges authors who publish in multiple topic areas addressing both transboundary water resources and water security management who may be familiar with the language spoken in both communities have the potential to share ideas and knowledge gained from both topic areas with other researchers this furthers convergent water research and a lack of author overlap between topic searches might suggest fewer opportunities for knowledge sharing within these communities table 1 an additional barrier to knowledge sharing between twr and wsm could be that scholars in each topic area are publishing their work in different sources publication sources returned from each topic search share four of the top 10 most popular journals fig 3b overall 128 publication sources feature publications from both twr and wsm topic searches as showcased by the fact that not a single source has published more than 49 publications on either topic there is a large distribution of publication sources for both topic searches wsm literature returns a greater number of different publication sources 461 sources while twr literature covers 364 different outlets a lack of overlap may suggest that ideas shared on each topic may not reach scholars in the other topic if they do not frequently read publications from the same sources thus potential for knowledge sharing may be greater in sources that contain publications from both topics 3 3 variation in collaboration scale and scope analysis of co authorship networks show that collaborations vary in scale and frequency and wsm may have a broader scope which includes some of the most prominent scholars in twr our water security and management co authorship network had 3 026 authors while the transboundary water resources co authorship network contained 1 745 authors table 2 fig 6 the wsm network had a higher average number of authors per paper and the average node degree is also greater in the wsm network the greater average node degree suggests that co authorship is more frequent in the wsm network than the twr network since average node degree can be a proxy for research collaboration 25 nodes representing authors who publish in both topic areas have a higher average node degree 11 6 unweighted 12 5 weighted which could indicate that authors who publish in both topic areas are more collaborative although the structure of our co authorship network naturally includes more collaborators for authors who publish in both topic areas the greatest number of citations for an author who has published works in the wsm network is 2 809 whereas the most highly cited author who has published works in the twr network has 378 the most highly cited author in the twr network publishes in both topic areas in contrast the most highly cited author in the wsm network only published in the area of wsm from our analysis of the co authorship networks statistics we conclude that the wsm network appears to have larger collaborations than the twr network the wsm network contains a few very highly cited authors who do not publish in twr whereas the most highly cited author in the twr network also publishes within wsm we interpret these results to mean that wsm could be a broader topic area under which some twr literature coincides 3 4 influence of authors who publish in both topic areas authors who publish in both topics have a higher normalized average betweenness centrality than those who fall in only one topic area by two orders of magnitude 0 001 versus 4 10 5 for twr and 8 10 5 for wsm however these authors may not be seen as traditionally influential based on their citation count fig 6 panel a showcases instances within the network where a node in the both category serves as a bridge between two topic clusters which would otherwise be disconnected the existence of authors that connect the two topic areas suggests that the two topic areas are likely meaningfully connected or relevant to one another somehow since authors tend to publish works within a general scholarly domain the publication network emphasizes the key role that authors who publish in both topic areas could play in connecting researchers and relevant bodies of work 24 of the authors in the publication network fall into the both category and link papers of different topic areas whereas these authors only make up 4 in the co authorship network fig 6 panel a there are only 19 papers that are returned in both topic searches thus only 19 nodes in this publication network fall into the both category many of these nodes are linked to publications in either topic demonstrating that the authors who published that work are active in other areas and came together to collaborate fig s4 panel b interestingly some nodes which appear in both topic searches are singular nodes within the publication network indicating that the authors of that publication have not published other work on the topics of transboundary water resources or water security and management beyond that one publication which covers both topics because betweenness centrality can be seen as a proxy of power and influence as a controller of information 1 6 we also investigated the relationship between betweenness centrality and author citation count within publications returned by the topic search while the author with the highest citations has the second highest betweenness centrality in the twr network the author with the highest citation count in the wsm network has the 34th highest betweenness centrality we observe no linear relationship between the betweenness centrality and citation count for each node r2 0 022 fig s5 the lack of relationship suggests that some nodes which are influential based on citations are not influential based on betweenness centrality and vice versa if we view the citation count of an author as a potential measure of influence 17 we would expect to see betweenness centrality and citation count correlated in these data our results challenge this previous work since we found that betweenness centrality and citation count are not correlated within our network previous scholarship suggests that outside factors influence citation practices and in the context of our network we believe that this could explain why we did not find correlation between betweenness centrality and citation count the prestige of an institution 22 or journal may have influence over the number of citations a publication receives 28 and it has been shown that publications from authors from traditionally underrepresented groups may receive a disproportionately low number of citations for example women tend to be cited less than their male counterparts 1 in countries with high research productivity even when women are in the same roles 20 2 in astronomy even when paper properties are controlled for 4 and 3 in the field of engineering and technology even when articles by women engineers were published in journals with higher impact factors 14 within the field of communications chakravartty et al 5 found that non white authors were cited significantly fewer times than their white counterparts 5 variation in self citation practices among groups may also influence citation count for example men tend to cite themselves more frequently than women 19 thus although citation count may be used as a measure of influence in some cases it is an imperfect measure that does not always reflect the power and influence of an author we emphasize that in our network citation count does not accurately reflect the power and influence of authors with unique capability to further convergent research the factors mentioned above among others may explain a lack of correlation between citation count and betweenness centrality 3 5 institutional factors influencing particular co author clusters outside factors influence the organization of some clusters of co authors within the network in which all authors share an institutional affiliation or research funding source the network structure includes a handful of very dense large clusters of nodes fig 6 many of these clusters represent a large research collaboration that resulted in a single paper one example of this is depicted in fig 6 location c in which 53 authors collaborate on a single paper and only one of the authors in that cluster has published additional work within either topic area depicted in the network in this case in the other topic area we also identified instances in which repeated collaborations could be traced to multiple publications from the same research funding source fig 6 location d suggesting that sometimes research funding may influence research collaboration frequency or structure overall however the collaboration frequency is weak the average collaboration frequency represented by the average edge weight is one and the distribution of edge weights is skewed toward a single collaboration instance fig s2 in some instances we see that institutions influence the organization of nodes that fall in the both category the centermost node in fig 6 panel b shows an example of an author who publishes in both topics whose neighbors also publish in both topics each of these authors share an institutional affiliation except for one we found multiple examples of this suggesting that perhaps particular institutions are more likely to have scholars who publish in both topic areas and collaborate although we could not discern why using our methods we surmise that this trend may occur for a variety of reasons 1 these institutions may recruit scholars whose research is cross cutting and the institution may have a legacy of scholarship in these topic areas 2 co authorship practices at the institution may be such that co authorship is frequently awarded to colleagues at the institution or 3 there is a particular culture of collaboration at the institution that supports frequent co authorship with colleagues at the institution the first and third hypotheses may suggest that institutions could play a role in facilitating collaboration that could aid in research progress in important convergent global water related challenges under future and current climate change these institutions may have a focus that captures broader water related work which is well suited to the similarities in scope between the two topic areas we include in this study this highlights an interesting premise for future research to elucidate ways in which institutions can influence such convergent approaches 4 future work and limitations we have provided a precursory review of overlap and dissimilarities between twr and wsm scholarship utilizing tools from natural language processing and network science but we mainly highlight the current state of research collaboration future research has the potential to unlock further understanding in this space we highlighted authors who publish in each domain as potentially important facilitators of collaboration and brokers of knowledge but we wonder does this facilitation and translation of field specific language actually occur does the work written by scholars who publish in both topic areas advance water research in a way that the work written by scholars who only publish in one topic does not does the involvement of an interdisciplinary scholar add richness or innovation to the scholarship in our study we assume that co authorship implies collaboration though this does not necessarily measure the varying degrees to which co authors work together in practice further analysis of the publications included in the dataset in this study may reveal whether there is a real benefit to the scholarship resulting from co authorship and meaningful collaboration between authors in different topic areas additionally scholars in these areas could opine on further frameworks tools or knowledge that could be particularly useful in being shared between these communities to advance future work we have included the dataset and code inclusive of our analysis si https doi org 10 26207 6qpj e819 the methods employed in this work are likely useful to explore overlap between other scholarly communities as we chose two communities represented by two sets of search terms as an illustrative example but could have chosen any number of combinations of search terms we selected twr and wsm as keywords based on inspiration from the environmental peacebuilding conference yet the methods we developed could be replicated to leverage helpful exploration across and between any fields we hope that this work will stimulate discourse about entry points within research frameworks and communities and inspire future work which explores more terminology multiple scholars have shown that identifying relevant bodies of literature based on search terms can be challenging issues such as keyword choice for particular paradigms evolving over time bentley 2008 variance in author keyword choice kipp 2006 excessive specificity of keywords babaii taase 2013 heckner et al 2008 and limitations of databases müngen kaya 2018 can make it difficult for scholars from one community to find relevant literature from another this reflects both a need for careful thought by authors in their choice of keywords in publications as discussed earlier in this work and also a limitation in our work in that the scholarly communities represented are based upon search terms and are likely incomplete the scope of this study is limited to academic literature found in wos we acknowledge that full research participation in a topic area may not be captured by publication results in wos from a keyword search however we argue that this is still a relevant analysis because scientific knowledge is often gained and shared through the published literature we also acknowledge that grey literature contributes significantly to the topics featured in this article and that the important influence of this body of work is not captured in our study 5 conclusions from our five findings we would like to leave the readers with three main conclusions first the use of language in scholarly publications can have important implications in how knowledge is shared especially within water resources topics even a slight alteration in the keywords used in a search in a scholarly database causes a large variance in the publication results returned table 1 if a scholar is not familiar with the language or keywords used in another sub discipline or field they may miss out on what would otherwise be relevant work and knowledge from other topic areas or disciplines this suggests that researchers must be purposeful in the keywords they use and that utilizing generalized keywords may facilitate the spread of knowledge to a broader but still relevant audience second scholars who are active in more than one topic area or discipline may be able to facilitate collaboration utilizing cognitive capital that they have acquired in each discipline to facilitate the use of a shared language this is not to say that all scholars must be interdisciplinary but that these scholars have a unique role to play in executing convergent research in our co authorship and publication networks we find that authors who publish on topics of both transboundary water resources and water security have a unique role in connecting what would otherwise be disparate scholarly communities on either topic while these authors hold a high level of influence in the collaboration network as measured by betweenness centrality this measure of influence is not correlated with a traditional measure of influence through citation count finally our analysis of the content of abstracts reveals relevant intersections between topics of transboundary water resources and water security management in areas such as climate change development sustainability management governance water availability and other topics differences in foci between the two topic areas included the scale systems and the type of water infrastructure considered although we found that the broad scope of the wsm framework included some of the most prominent scholars in twr much of the twr scholarship was not captured by these keywords table 1 if we are to continue to use integrative yet actionable frameworks in the pursuit of convergent water research we must think carefully about how we craft these frameworks and whether our choice of language is constructive or destructive in bringing together relevant scholars and research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

20099,as the global community faces increasing water related challenges enabling safe and secure water access will require cooperation purposeful water management and a variety of expertise and interdisciplinary research collaboration this review uses tools from bibliometrics and network science to explore overlap and collaboration of scholars studying transboundary water resources and water security management we explore intersections between these communities through an analysis of publications trends a content analysis of abstracts using natural language processing and co authorship networks we glean five key findings from our results including that slight variations in keywords used in the literature search in these two topic areas result in different communities of scholars and publications our results show that while publications on these topics are increasing over time and there is meaningful overlap between the two topics the number of scholars publishing in both areas is not increasing over time the co authorship networks demonstrate that few authors participate in both transboundary water resources and water security management research communities and that authors who have knowledge from both topic areas are uniquely positioned within their social networks to facilitate collaboration we find no correlation between the betweenness centrality and the citation count for authors measures which are both used to evaluate author influence the content analysis of abstracts reveals important areas of overlap in the topics addressed such as climate change development and governance as well as areas of dissimilarity in the scales and focus of these works although we found that the broad scope of the water security framework included some of the most prominent scholars studying transboundary water resources much of the transboundary water resource scholarship was not captured by water security keywords this work demonstrates that if we are to continue to use integrative yet actionable frameworks in the pursuit of convergent water research we must think carefully about how we craft these frameworks and whether our choice of language is constructive or destructive in bringing together relevant scholars and research keywords bibliometric analysis networks water management transboundary water resources water security research collaboration 1 introduction under future climate change an increasing proportion of the global population will face a variety of water related challenges such as water scarcity and flooding 27 increased variability will necessitate skilled and purposeful water management often requiring the cooperation of many parties especially since about 40 of the global population lives in an international river basin shared among two or more countries 35 as the study of water security transcends many scales 9 13 and is often transboundary in nature and other similar themes such as the importance of good governance are often explored 9 13 we hypothesized that there would be substantial overlap and regular examples of collaboration between scholars who study water security management and scholars who study transboundary water resources the need for interdisciplinarity and simultaneous consideration of diverse and interconnected issues in addressing global water challenges has been recognized by numerous scholars 10 33 previous studies have also shown that collaboration can increase the number of publications a researcher publishes 21 and that collaborative works tend to have a higher impact 18 if we are to address grand water challenges with collaboration and convergent research aiding in this pursuit we must determine how best to bring the relevant skills and expertise of many researchers together in a productive collaboration a first step in this process is to ensure diverse research communities can communicate effectively across language language has the potential to both constrain and facilitate collaboration and the specific language used to describe various water related concepts has evolved over time a discussion at the environmental peacebuilding conference held in irvine california in october 2019 on the topic of definitions and language use inspired this work the first high level panel of this conference began by articulating how different parties defined environmental peacebuilding some panel members focused on environmental security as a framework and explicitly spoke about the environment and war including preventative defense and environmental cooperation others were more interested in using the term to emphasize a relationship between the environment and healthy communities one panel member claimed that a more generalizable definition should be created to unite the community as people currently use the definition in the way that they like it best while some panel members thought that coming to a shared agreement on the definition was important others emphasized that the definition does not matter instead in practice they described that people need an entry point with which to realize that their work is relevant in multiple contexts in this study we utilize tools from bibliometrics and network science to analyze overlap and collaboration between the study of transboundary water resources and water security management to examine whether there is a sufficient entry point for these two communities of researchers to come together these two topic areas were frequently featured at the environmental peacebuilding conference and seemed to explore similar themes although we observed that methodological techniques or foci seemed to differ depending on whether the session focused on one topic or the other we seek to expand understanding and stimulate discourse around how and why transboundary water resource and water security management research themes overlap and differ first we identify communities of researchers who study transboundary water resources and water security management through keyword searches in the web of science 8 we then investigate overlap through examining the growth of publications in the two topic areas exploring disciplinary scope and publication sources examining the content of abstracts using natural language processing techniques to determine word frequency and word similarity and constructing co authorship networks and publication networks rather than providing a thematic analysis style review our study expands current research across both transboundary water resources and water security management using these three techniques to explore the current state of collaboration and to showcase areas of intersection and dissimilarity that may provide potential opportunities for knowledge sharing 2 materials and methods 2 1 database generation and categorical analysis search terms were selected to identify research within the web of science wos database 8 related to water resources shared over boundaries we included all publications that were returned from the keyword search when the search terms were present in the title abstract keywords or keywords plus 7 29 our dataset was exported from wos on may 13th 2020 and analyzed using python table s1 contains select phrases used in exploratory topic searches and the resulting number of publications the two keyword searches transboundary water resources and water security management were chosen due to their similar size search results and their inclusion of keywords comparing transboundary and water security authors whose publications are found in the results of both topic searches in wos are defined as overlapping authors in this study overlapping authors are examined as a proxy for research participation in each topic area of transboundary water resources and water security management we examine author overlap by comparing the number of authors whose published literature appears in each topic search 2 2 content analysis to examine overlap between topics we analyze the content of abstracts for all publications found in the search results using natural language processing techniques from wordcloud 24 and natural language toolkit nltk 3 python packages first we compare the 30 most commonly used words and phrases in each topic area we use word frequency to examine potential overlap or differences between publications on transboundary water resources and water security as we would expect that if the documents described similar content their most frequently used words would also be similar next we use the similar function within nltk to examine the distributional similarity of important and relevant words and we compare the similar words returned for each topic area distributional similarity measures the number of contexts shared by a word of choice and other words found within the body of text 26 by examining other words found within common contexts as transboundary security and management in each topic area and comparing them we are able to hypothesize about whether or not the words are being used in similar ways in each research community 2 3 network creation and analysis in addition to categorical and content analyses we utilized tools from network science the study of complex phenomena through networks to construct and analyze two different types of networks co authorship networks and a publication network fig 1 co authorship networks were constructed with information gathered from each wos search in which nodes represent authors and edges between authors indicate co authorship fig 1 the average node degree number of edges represents the average number of co authors or research collaborations edge weights represent the frequency of collaborations the number of connected components represents the number of isolated co author communities or singular authors and we use the size of the largest connected component as an indication of how connected researchers are to the rest of the field 11 25 we examine the network structure of each topic separately as well as a combined network in which authors that appear in both topic searches are denoted we also examine network position by computing the betweenness centrality of nodes as a potential proxy for control over communication activity within the network 1 betweenness centrality is a measure of the frequency in which a node appears in the shortest paths of other nodes 12 building on chung s 2009 interpretation of burt s 1992 structural holes theory in which power and influence accrue to those who broker connections between unconnected groups of people 6 we examine betweenness centrality as it relates to a node s topic categorization and connection to others who publish in a particular topic betweenness centrality may also represent a measure of structural social capital held by a researcher within the network 23 li et al 23 describe relational social capital as assets that are shared through relationships which can be manifested in trust commitment and reciprocity and expressed as repeated co authorships 23 in our network this is expressed as the edge weight cognitive social capital can be expressed in a co authorship network through the extent of time that an author has published in a particular discipline 23 after an author spends time in a discipline they gain knowledge of shared visions traditions codes languages knowledge interpretations systems of meanings social networks and collectively owned social capital 23 which they can then share with others because we assign authors to explicit research communities through the bounds of our topic searches within the web of science publication database we can measure cognitive capital through both publication tenure and topic expertise we also calculate the total number of citations each author receives for their publications in either topic and examine whether this correlates with an author s betweenness centrality if we use citation count as a potential measure of influence 17 we would expect that it would be correlated with betweenness centrality as this is a measure of potential structural influence within the network we also construct and analyze a network in which publications are nodes edges are instances of co authorship among one or more authors in the publication and node color represents the topic area fig 1 here we seek to understand how particular ideas or frameworks for understanding water resources are connected by research collaborations we examine how publications from each topic area are linked to one another through authors involved in multiple topic areas to understand the potential for information flow all networks were created using the networkx python package 16 and visualized using gephi 2 we utilized the fruchterman reingold force directed algorithm within gephi to create network layouts code to create the networks from wos search results can be found in the si 3 findings and discussion our results lead us to consider 5 main findings outlined below and featured in fig 2 3 1 content and author overlap studies of transboundary water resources twr and water security and management wsm have meaningful overlap even though few authors publish in both topics analysis of results from the web of science searches reveals overlap in the general disciplinary reach for each topic among the four most prevalent disciplinary categories fig 3 a a wide variety of disciplines study each topic but the distribution of categories is larger for the wsm topic area twr publications fall into 65 different wos categories whereas wsm publications fall into 103 different categories and twr only has 7 unique categories while 58 categories overlap some notable differences include 9 publications that fall under social issues within twr literature compared with zero wsm publications in this category similarly 6 7 of publications from twr compared to only 0 8 of publications from wsm fall into the category of law although addressing water security can most certainly involve social issues and law e g kuokkanen 2017 38 it appears that this is not captured within the wos categorization overall the overlap between the top 4 most frequent categories between the two topic searches and the general similarity between categorizations indicate an apparent similarity between the disciplinary reach of the two topic searches exploring the language used in abstracts in each topic area allowed us to better understand content similarities and differences between the two topic areas and we found many areas of overlap as well as some important distinctions relating to scale and focus among the most frequently used 100 words and phrases within abstract text in transboundary water resources and water security management search results a total of 68 words phrases are shared table s3 our results suggest that both climate change and development are particularly salient themes within twr and wsm scholarship as these words have high frequency across both groups of articles table s3 beyond word frequency an examination of words that appear in the same contexts as specific keywords showed us similarities and differences in the ways in which these words are used in each body of abstracts fig 4 when comparing words which share the same contexts as the word transboundary in each collection of abstracts sustainable land water and future are found in both collections fig 4 contexts relating to scale differ when referencing transboundary in each group twr features words such as international regional mekong basin and local whereas urban is the only word similar to transboundary in wsm abstracts referring to scale iuwm also appears referring to integrated urban water management again at the urban scale words associated with the context of water sources differ between collections of abstracts words such as river and surface share contexts with transboundary in twr abstracts whereas words such as ground and drinking share contexts with transboundary in wsm abstracts we interpret these results to mean that wsm literature is more often focused on smaller scales whereas twr literature focuses on state to state scales and larger hydrologic features such as rivers or large international basins this supports findings from previous reviews which found that water security research at transboundary scales is significantly less frequent than other scales 9 13 cook and bakker 9 highlighted that scholars within different disciplines tend to highlight different scales studies of development most often focused on the national scale hydrological studies occurred at the watershed regional or national scale and social science studies were most often focused at the community scale 9 work which examines conflict and cooperation over transboundary water resources often highlights the state to state scale largely because this work deals with water resources in the complex context of institutional political social and cultural systems although some of this work also describes sub national scales 31 34 there are 10 words that are found in similar contexts to the word management that appear in both twr and wsm abstracts fig 4 many of these words are associated with the quality and quantity of water and words relating to human interaction with the water system appear such as governance wsm abstracts return more words with a negative connotation with similarity to management such as shortage insecurity and stress whereas these words are not found in the 20 most similar words in twr abstracts twr abstracts contain words similar to management that are related to human negotiation over water resources such as shared sharing or cooperation while wsm abstracts contain words that seem to refer more to the water system itself such as infrastructure and conservation our results also suggest that the inclusion of the keyword management with water security tends to highlight research at urban scales fig 4 we interpret our similarity results around the context of management to show a difference between topics where wsm abstracts focus more on how the water infrastructure is managed and twr literature focuses more on the social nature and negotiation taking place within water management such as studies on conflict and cooperation over water resources 34 definitions of water security provided by entities such as the global water partnership and the un recognize that management and negotiation are key components of water security 15 32 and previous water security scholarship has called for a more integrative and broad framing of water security research while recognizing the difficulties in operationalizing this broad framing and the prevalence of reductionist studies 9 36 cook and bakker describe that an integrative approach to water security highlights the topic of governance advancing water security research 9 while governance coordination and collaboration have long been main themes within research on transboundary water resources 34 wolf describes that increasing threats to water resources related to water quality and the use of less traditional sources that are not constrained to watershed boundaries could distinguish future water disputes from those in the past 34 which could more tightly link scholarship on transboundary water resources and water security in exploring whether the words transboundary and security were being used in the same way in twr and wsm literature we noticed that these words shared many contexts with words representing other systems such as food and agricultural within the wsm literature in twr abstracts however transboundary and security shared more common contexts with words representing the water system itself such as basin or river these results suggest that the conceptualization of security of the water system may extend to include other systems explicitly within water security literature whereas other systems are mentioned less often or explicitly within twr literature previous work has highlighted water security in the context of the water energy food wef nexus suggesting that water security is often paramount to ensure food and energy security 30 it is likely that the conceptualization of research on twr and wsm will continue to evolve as both twr and wsm appear to be relatively new terms in the literature twr emerges within two publications in 1991 and wsm emerges from three publications in 1995 fig 5 the first instance in which an author published works in both topic areas occurs in 2000 fig 5 a total of 4 577 authors published in either topic area with 1 551 publishing only on the topic of twr 2 832 only publishing on the topic of wsm and 194 representing 4 2 of the total publishing in both topics between 1991 and 2019 the percentage of authors publishing in both topic areas in a given year ranges from 0 8 to 6 2 from 2000 to 2019 the percentage of authors publishing in both topic areas does not appear to be increasing from 2015 to 2019 and between 1991 and 2007 only 7 authors published in both topic areas thus while the disciplinary reach and similar content between abstracts suggests that there is substantial overlap between the topics few scholars are publishing in both areas 3 2 effect of variations in keywords one potential reason that scholars would not appear in search results for both twr and wsm even if their work might fall under these topic areas is that they are not using the same terminology or keywords to describe their work our results suggest that even slight variations in the keywords used in a literature search in these topics produce different communities of scholars and publications table 1 table s1 as shown in table 1 very few authors overlap between topic searches in general even between searches in a similar topic that use seemingly similar language comparing searches that each use the word governance produces some author overlap 969 authors overlap between the water resources governance search and the river basin governance search 30 of the authors in the water resources governance search and 45 of the authors in the river basin governance search when comparing keywords used for searches that address the two main topic areas considered in this paper we find very little overlap as mentioned previously only 194 authors overlap between transboundary water resources and water security management searches 11 and 6 of authors in each search previous work has shown that author chosen keywords are likely to include field specific language 39 one study examining the field specificity of keywords in 200 articles found that the percentage of keywords described as general terms was very low only 5 7 of words used in titles and only 21 of keywords 37 using field specific language that is not well understood by many disciplines could prevent the sharing of knowledge among relevant communities and especially in a web based search of literature could make research less discoverable in addition to field specific language the language used to describe broad research themes changes over time although the first instances of research described by transboundary water resources and water security management keywords appear in 1991 and 1995 respectively in web of science the first search result for river basin management appears in 1963 this could indicate that research on the themes described in this work has occurred long before 1991 but the language has changed or expanded this makes language choice very important and also provides grounds for an investigation into whether this language could be a barrier in uniting communities of scholars and instigating collaboration on important research addressing grand water challenges authors who publish in multiple topic areas addressing both transboundary water resources and water security management who may be familiar with the language spoken in both communities have the potential to share ideas and knowledge gained from both topic areas with other researchers this furthers convergent water research and a lack of author overlap between topic searches might suggest fewer opportunities for knowledge sharing within these communities table 1 an additional barrier to knowledge sharing between twr and wsm could be that scholars in each topic area are publishing their work in different sources publication sources returned from each topic search share four of the top 10 most popular journals fig 3b overall 128 publication sources feature publications from both twr and wsm topic searches as showcased by the fact that not a single source has published more than 49 publications on either topic there is a large distribution of publication sources for both topic searches wsm literature returns a greater number of different publication sources 461 sources while twr literature covers 364 different outlets a lack of overlap may suggest that ideas shared on each topic may not reach scholars in the other topic if they do not frequently read publications from the same sources thus potential for knowledge sharing may be greater in sources that contain publications from both topics 3 3 variation in collaboration scale and scope analysis of co authorship networks show that collaborations vary in scale and frequency and wsm may have a broader scope which includes some of the most prominent scholars in twr our water security and management co authorship network had 3 026 authors while the transboundary water resources co authorship network contained 1 745 authors table 2 fig 6 the wsm network had a higher average number of authors per paper and the average node degree is also greater in the wsm network the greater average node degree suggests that co authorship is more frequent in the wsm network than the twr network since average node degree can be a proxy for research collaboration 25 nodes representing authors who publish in both topic areas have a higher average node degree 11 6 unweighted 12 5 weighted which could indicate that authors who publish in both topic areas are more collaborative although the structure of our co authorship network naturally includes more collaborators for authors who publish in both topic areas the greatest number of citations for an author who has published works in the wsm network is 2 809 whereas the most highly cited author who has published works in the twr network has 378 the most highly cited author in the twr network publishes in both topic areas in contrast the most highly cited author in the wsm network only published in the area of wsm from our analysis of the co authorship networks statistics we conclude that the wsm network appears to have larger collaborations than the twr network the wsm network contains a few very highly cited authors who do not publish in twr whereas the most highly cited author in the twr network also publishes within wsm we interpret these results to mean that wsm could be a broader topic area under which some twr literature coincides 3 4 influence of authors who publish in both topic areas authors who publish in both topics have a higher normalized average betweenness centrality than those who fall in only one topic area by two orders of magnitude 0 001 versus 4 10 5 for twr and 8 10 5 for wsm however these authors may not be seen as traditionally influential based on their citation count fig 6 panel a showcases instances within the network where a node in the both category serves as a bridge between two topic clusters which would otherwise be disconnected the existence of authors that connect the two topic areas suggests that the two topic areas are likely meaningfully connected or relevant to one another somehow since authors tend to publish works within a general scholarly domain the publication network emphasizes the key role that authors who publish in both topic areas could play in connecting researchers and relevant bodies of work 24 of the authors in the publication network fall into the both category and link papers of different topic areas whereas these authors only make up 4 in the co authorship network fig 6 panel a there are only 19 papers that are returned in both topic searches thus only 19 nodes in this publication network fall into the both category many of these nodes are linked to publications in either topic demonstrating that the authors who published that work are active in other areas and came together to collaborate fig s4 panel b interestingly some nodes which appear in both topic searches are singular nodes within the publication network indicating that the authors of that publication have not published other work on the topics of transboundary water resources or water security and management beyond that one publication which covers both topics because betweenness centrality can be seen as a proxy of power and influence as a controller of information 1 6 we also investigated the relationship between betweenness centrality and author citation count within publications returned by the topic search while the author with the highest citations has the second highest betweenness centrality in the twr network the author with the highest citation count in the wsm network has the 34th highest betweenness centrality we observe no linear relationship between the betweenness centrality and citation count for each node r2 0 022 fig s5 the lack of relationship suggests that some nodes which are influential based on citations are not influential based on betweenness centrality and vice versa if we view the citation count of an author as a potential measure of influence 17 we would expect to see betweenness centrality and citation count correlated in these data our results challenge this previous work since we found that betweenness centrality and citation count are not correlated within our network previous scholarship suggests that outside factors influence citation practices and in the context of our network we believe that this could explain why we did not find correlation between betweenness centrality and citation count the prestige of an institution 22 or journal may have influence over the number of citations a publication receives 28 and it has been shown that publications from authors from traditionally underrepresented groups may receive a disproportionately low number of citations for example women tend to be cited less than their male counterparts 1 in countries with high research productivity even when women are in the same roles 20 2 in astronomy even when paper properties are controlled for 4 and 3 in the field of engineering and technology even when articles by women engineers were published in journals with higher impact factors 14 within the field of communications chakravartty et al 5 found that non white authors were cited significantly fewer times than their white counterparts 5 variation in self citation practices among groups may also influence citation count for example men tend to cite themselves more frequently than women 19 thus although citation count may be used as a measure of influence in some cases it is an imperfect measure that does not always reflect the power and influence of an author we emphasize that in our network citation count does not accurately reflect the power and influence of authors with unique capability to further convergent research the factors mentioned above among others may explain a lack of correlation between citation count and betweenness centrality 3 5 institutional factors influencing particular co author clusters outside factors influence the organization of some clusters of co authors within the network in which all authors share an institutional affiliation or research funding source the network structure includes a handful of very dense large clusters of nodes fig 6 many of these clusters represent a large research collaboration that resulted in a single paper one example of this is depicted in fig 6 location c in which 53 authors collaborate on a single paper and only one of the authors in that cluster has published additional work within either topic area depicted in the network in this case in the other topic area we also identified instances in which repeated collaborations could be traced to multiple publications from the same research funding source fig 6 location d suggesting that sometimes research funding may influence research collaboration frequency or structure overall however the collaboration frequency is weak the average collaboration frequency represented by the average edge weight is one and the distribution of edge weights is skewed toward a single collaboration instance fig s2 in some instances we see that institutions influence the organization of nodes that fall in the both category the centermost node in fig 6 panel b shows an example of an author who publishes in both topics whose neighbors also publish in both topics each of these authors share an institutional affiliation except for one we found multiple examples of this suggesting that perhaps particular institutions are more likely to have scholars who publish in both topic areas and collaborate although we could not discern why using our methods we surmise that this trend may occur for a variety of reasons 1 these institutions may recruit scholars whose research is cross cutting and the institution may have a legacy of scholarship in these topic areas 2 co authorship practices at the institution may be such that co authorship is frequently awarded to colleagues at the institution or 3 there is a particular culture of collaboration at the institution that supports frequent co authorship with colleagues at the institution the first and third hypotheses may suggest that institutions could play a role in facilitating collaboration that could aid in research progress in important convergent global water related challenges under future and current climate change these institutions may have a focus that captures broader water related work which is well suited to the similarities in scope between the two topic areas we include in this study this highlights an interesting premise for future research to elucidate ways in which institutions can influence such convergent approaches 4 future work and limitations we have provided a precursory review of overlap and dissimilarities between twr and wsm scholarship utilizing tools from natural language processing and network science but we mainly highlight the current state of research collaboration future research has the potential to unlock further understanding in this space we highlighted authors who publish in each domain as potentially important facilitators of collaboration and brokers of knowledge but we wonder does this facilitation and translation of field specific language actually occur does the work written by scholars who publish in both topic areas advance water research in a way that the work written by scholars who only publish in one topic does not does the involvement of an interdisciplinary scholar add richness or innovation to the scholarship in our study we assume that co authorship implies collaboration though this does not necessarily measure the varying degrees to which co authors work together in practice further analysis of the publications included in the dataset in this study may reveal whether there is a real benefit to the scholarship resulting from co authorship and meaningful collaboration between authors in different topic areas additionally scholars in these areas could opine on further frameworks tools or knowledge that could be particularly useful in being shared between these communities to advance future work we have included the dataset and code inclusive of our analysis si https doi org 10 26207 6qpj e819 the methods employed in this work are likely useful to explore overlap between other scholarly communities as we chose two communities represented by two sets of search terms as an illustrative example but could have chosen any number of combinations of search terms we selected twr and wsm as keywords based on inspiration from the environmental peacebuilding conference yet the methods we developed could be replicated to leverage helpful exploration across and between any fields we hope that this work will stimulate discourse about entry points within research frameworks and communities and inspire future work which explores more terminology multiple scholars have shown that identifying relevant bodies of literature based on search terms can be challenging issues such as keyword choice for particular paradigms evolving over time bentley 2008 variance in author keyword choice kipp 2006 excessive specificity of keywords babaii taase 2013 heckner et al 2008 and limitations of databases müngen kaya 2018 can make it difficult for scholars from one community to find relevant literature from another this reflects both a need for careful thought by authors in their choice of keywords in publications as discussed earlier in this work and also a limitation in our work in that the scholarly communities represented are based upon search terms and are likely incomplete the scope of this study is limited to academic literature found in wos we acknowledge that full research participation in a topic area may not be captured by publication results in wos from a keyword search however we argue that this is still a relevant analysis because scientific knowledge is often gained and shared through the published literature we also acknowledge that grey literature contributes significantly to the topics featured in this article and that the important influence of this body of work is not captured in our study 5 conclusions from our five findings we would like to leave the readers with three main conclusions first the use of language in scholarly publications can have important implications in how knowledge is shared especially within water resources topics even a slight alteration in the keywords used in a search in a scholarly database causes a large variance in the publication results returned table 1 if a scholar is not familiar with the language or keywords used in another sub discipline or field they may miss out on what would otherwise be relevant work and knowledge from other topic areas or disciplines this suggests that researchers must be purposeful in the keywords they use and that utilizing generalized keywords may facilitate the spread of knowledge to a broader but still relevant audience second scholars who are active in more than one topic area or discipline may be able to facilitate collaboration utilizing cognitive capital that they have acquired in each discipline to facilitate the use of a shared language this is not to say that all scholars must be interdisciplinary but that these scholars have a unique role to play in executing convergent research in our co authorship and publication networks we find that authors who publish on topics of both transboundary water resources and water security have a unique role in connecting what would otherwise be disparate scholarly communities on either topic while these authors hold a high level of influence in the collaboration network as measured by betweenness centrality this measure of influence is not correlated with a traditional measure of influence through citation count finally our analysis of the content of abstracts reveals relevant intersections between topics of transboundary water resources and water security management in areas such as climate change development sustainability management governance water availability and other topics differences in foci between the two topic areas included the scale systems and the type of water infrastructure considered although we found that the broad scope of the wsm framework included some of the most prominent scholars in twr much of the twr scholarship was not captured by these keywords table 1 if we are to continue to use integrative yet actionable frameworks in the pursuit of convergent water research we must think carefully about how we craft these frameworks and whether our choice of language is constructive or destructive in bringing together relevant scholars and research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
