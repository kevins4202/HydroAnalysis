23310,this paper outlines empirical formulas to provide adequate predictions of the ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure the ultimate strength formulation was derived from published test data found in the open literature the formulas consider the failure mode interactions which include the parameter of shell yielding inter frame buckling overall buckling and stiffener tripping the failure modes were inserted in the quadratic merchant rankine formula afterward the knockdown factors were empirically derived to best fit the actual collapse pressure it is found that the proposed formulation can predict the ultimate strengths of ring stiffened cylinders more accurately and consistently than other codified rules pd5500 gl abs api the simple criterion for the assessment of failure modes was also provided furthermore parametric studies were conducted to observe the effect of the design parameter on sizing the ring stiffened cylinder when the failure

designed to operate in deep water in its basic form the submarine structure has to provide optimum structural efficiency to withstand the hydrostatic pressure one method to improve the structural capacity is by using ring stiffened cylinders for the submarine pressure hull some approaches regarding the use of the ring stiffened cylinder as the primary structural member for large underwater structures were also conducted by ross and waterman 2000 and ross 2006 similarly the study of the strengthened cylindrical shell under the external pressure were performed by ghanbari ghazijahani et al 2014 2015a 2015b and ghanbari ghazijahani and showkati 2013 they have performed numerous number of ultimate strength investigation of the corrugated and longitudinal stiffened cylindrical shells which carried out by internal vacuum their extensive test works contribute to an improved design in enhancing structural capacity of shell structure by the minimum weight these structural units are mainly designed based on the concept of ultimate strength as stated by ellinas et al 1983 this fundamental form also has some similarities with those used in the offshore oil and gas industry das et al 2003 in reality under the loading conditions the ring stiffened cylinders can fail in one or coupling with more failure modes shell yielding local and overall buckling and instability of the ring stiffener faulkner 1991 cho et al 2018 buckling phenomena occur when most of the stored strain membrane energy is converted to bending energy which can cause catastrophic failure kendrick 1955 in light of these complicated buckling phenomena accurately assessing their behaviour is great importance in the structural engineering field recently many theoretical and experimental types of research have been conducted with various high pressure model tests by many researchers slankard and nash 1953 kirstein and slankard 1956 lunchick 1959 kendrick 1955 1964 1965 1970 reynolds 1960 miller and kinra 1981 yokota et al 1985 yamamoto et al 1989 frieze 1994 cerik and cho 2013 cho et al 2017 2018 these comprehensive works have led to a general understanding of the failure mechanism for this cylinder and recommendations of some adequate formulas that can be the guidance for failure prevention furthermore it is essential to precisely predict the ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinders subjected to hydrostatic pressure the early concept for ultimate strength of a cylindrical shell was expressed by von mises 1929 the shell was modelled with uniform thickness for a simply supported boundary condition winderburg and trilling 1934 then developed another simplified equation based on von mises s formulae to predict the collapse pressure under hydrostatic pressure loading they explained that failure of the vessel might occur in two types of ways a short vessel with a relatively thick shell fails by stressing the walls and reaching the yield point while a long vessel with a relatively thin shell will fail because of its instability or when buckling of the shell occurs at stresses that are considerably below the yield point the types of failure are analogous to the simple column action i e a short and thick column will fail by yield while a long and thin column will collapse by instability this work was then continued by von sanden and gunther 1952 who developed two equations to predict the pressure at which yielding of the shell occurs at the frame and mid bay reynolds 1960 presented a solution to the buckling pressure which is a function of the cylinder geometry tangent modulus e t and secant modulus e s as determined from the stress strain curve of the shell material that work proceeded based on the differential equations of equilibrium for the plastic range of cylindrical shells pulos 1963 a further failure is the overall collapse of the ring stiffener and the shell which was satisfied by bryant 1954 the solution used a modified version of the bresse pressure as the failure of the single ring stiffener and associated shell plating and a simplified von mises pressure for the shell failure of the finite length of a cylinder moreover a brief analytical example has been conducted by wenk and kennard 1956 to clarify the failure of overall collapse precipitated by tripping of the stiffener the analyses show that before global collapse mode the additional circumferential stresses in the flange of t stiffeners and radial stresses at the web as its attachment to the cylindrical shell can generate the yielding which results in a trigger for ring tripping the criteria for the minimum stiffener tripping stress were merely presented by kendrick 1972 for the assumed pinned stiffener moreover the consideration of stiffener tripping as the failure of that typical structure has been more extensively studied by morandi et al 1996 a closed form solution was proposed for the elastic and inelastic tripping pressure the elastic tripping pressure arises from the axisymmetric hoop stress at the frame centroid which is governed based on the interaction form with the von mises elastic buckling pressure where the inelastic tripping allowed for the tangent modulus in which the fabrication effects of welding and cold bending are included recently there are several code recommendations to predict the strength of ring stiffened cylinders based on the research mentioned above and derived theory those include the pd 5500 british standard specification for unfired fusion welded pressure vessels bsi 2009 dnv germanischer lloyd naval ship technology dnv gl 2015 american bureau of shipping rules for building and classing of underwater vehicles abs 2002 and api american petroleum institute from the bulletin on stability design of cylindrical shells bulletin 2u api 2000 however those current design code solutions consider the failure mode independently of each other the idea of the present work to improve the accuracy and reliability of the design formula is to include the effects of interaction through the simple form strength formulation which accounts for the shell yield local overall buckling and stiffener tripping such that they are dependent on each other then to accommodate the discrepancy due to the actual initial geometrical shape and material imperfection the residual stresses by cold rolled forming and welding knockdown factors were derived by regression analyses applied to the available test data subsequently the accuracy of the proposed formula has been tested with available test data and compared with the existing rules 2 ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinder 2 1 ring stiffened cylinder test data to measure the adequacy of design code it is first necessary to substantiate the relevant test data for the comparison study one of the most convenient ways to deal with model uncertainty is to compare experimental results in the design code prediction the tested model data considered in this study are taken from various existing test data references as in the introduction explained the experimental investigation on ring stiffened cylinders began with the most straightforward model of ring stiffened cylinders as shown in fig 1 which represents a typical vessel subjected to uniform external pressure the tested ring stiffened cylinder models were mostly fabricated from general structure steel with a young s modulus of 206 000 mpa and yield stress between 230 and 420 mpa only a few models were fabricated from high strength steel with a yield stress up to 500 mpa yokota et al 1985 and there was a navsea test model price 2002 with a yield strength between 680 mpa and 1080 mpa the minimum radius was approximately 190 mm miller and kinra 1981 and the largest found was approximately 700 mm kendrick 1955 the test on the shortest cylinder was performed by frieze 1994 with 300 mm in overall length and the longest tested models 4870 mm were utilized by kendrick 1964 the test models were processed by cold rolled forming and welding thus there were considerable residual stresses and imperfections similar to the real practice because the buckling collapse load depends on many parameters table 1 shows the basic geometrical properties of the collected tested data on ring stiffened cylinder models the hydrostatic pressure test on a ring stiffened cylinder is conducted inside the pressure chamber in a vertical position as shown in fig 2 a and c it is reported on the experimental work done by slankard and nash 1953 kirstein and slankard 1956 lunchick 1959 reynolds 1960 where it has been carried out at david taylor model basin dtmb and frieze 1994 using the university of glasgow facilities the horizontal testing method was reported by yokota et al 1985 yamamoto et al 1989 which is conducted in the mitsubishi heavy industries and cho et al 2017 in university of ulsan as can be seen in fig 2 b and d the gravitational load can be attributed in the vertical type of hydrostatic testing apparatus as in the real underwater environment the pressure will increase linearly with the change of depth another issue is the pressure medium used to compress the model inside the chamber david taylor model basin works reported in the open literature were the only ones performed using oil as the pressure medium this fluid medium was chosen to avoid the requirement of waterproofing the electrical wire resistance strain gages other experimental works were reported using water as the testing fluid however the different strain energy of the testing fluid seems to be difficult to quantify since no report has mentioned considering this effect on the ultimate strength of such typical structures it is also described in the figure that the stiffener spacing was reduced toward the end plate of the model to avoid failure at the end of the compartment the results of the failure modes of the tested models are summarized in fig 3 the local buckling failure mode from the ring stiffened cylinder test results is shown in figs 4 a and 5 a this mode is marked by the axisymmetric yield at the cylindrical shell between the stiffeners or in the mid bay of a cylinder it is characterized by the local deformation of the shell between ring stiffeners the representative model for the shell yielding failure mode is shown in figs 6 a and 7 b the overall buckling failure mode consists of the shell and frame deformation in one compartment length as shown in figs 5 b and 6 b it occurs when the stiffener is relatively small compared to the shell thickness and the cylinder is relatively long it is marked by the large lobes over the compartments in the longitudinal direction in addition some of the models also failed by the interactive buckling mode when the local and overall buckling occurs together as shown in figs 4 b and 7 a 2 2 design code recommendation in the ultimate strength assessment of the ring stiffened cylinders there were several design code recommendations mentioned by refs cho and frieze 1988 das et al 2003 mackay 2007 cerik et al 2013 and cho et al 2018 those codes were also able to be used in the strength prediction of offshore platforms which has similarities to the analysis of submarine pressure hull first were pd 5500 and dnv germanischer lloyd dnv gl which are extensively used in europe and second were abs and api which are widely known in the us a comparison study of those design codes was also performed by price 2002 and temme 2003 despite their discrepancies in the early stage design these design codes were helpful in judging the initial feasibility of the design current design codes for these structures is based on a deterministic approach where each failure mode is considered independently from the others the failure is identified either by prediction of the lowest collapse pressures for local buckling modes or by the overall buckling mode to accommodate the actual capacity of the structure some of the adequate safety factors were applied to implicitly account for the geometrical shape and material imperfections as well as residual stresses due to fabrication the references above show that the code was adequately reliable results from the prediction of the presented design codes are plotted in fig 8 the assessment was made with the 107 available test data by comparing the actual collapse pressure p c a c t against the prediction p c p r e d from the design code recommendation the comparison between experimental and predicted results from the design code was statistically modelled by the mean value of bias and the coefficient of variation the more accurate prediction is marked by the unity of the mean bias and the smallest value of cov using these guidelines for comparison pd 5500 provides more accurate prediction by the mean and cov which approached 0 96 and 11 85 per cent the other results show that the design formulae from dnv gl abs and api are less accurate with mean values of 0 94 1 07 and 0 94 and the cov values are 13 44 14 18 and 14 95 per cent respectively overall there is still room to improve the formulas as mentioned earlier due to the non unity for bias and the large uncertainty in the evaluation using a large amount of test data since the early 80s the approximation of the inter frame buckling criteria has been associated with the ratio of the von mises elastic buckling pressure p m against the yield pressure p y this characteristic pressure ratio provides a better procedure for determining the ultimate strength of the pressure hull these design criteria were firstly adopted by pd 5500 and abs later also used them as standard practice for building and classifying underwater structures however the wide scatter among the recent test data can be seen from fig 9 all of the collected test data was plotted on a non dimensional basis for inter frame design criteria p m p y this ratio can generate an empirical tool to predict the collapse pressure pd 5500 assumed that when the ring stiffened cylinder exhibited out of roundness greater than 0 5 per cent of the radius the lower bound curve is likely fitted it is approximately 15 per cent offset from the mean curve and generates a 50 safety margin however this criteria produces skewness when the entirety of the test data is assessed in fig 10 as discussed by cho and frieze 1988 when the pressure ratio p y p m is smaller than 1 0 there is some tendency for pd 5500 to overestimate the collapse pressure this skewness indicates that the actual collapse pressure is not sufficiently governed by only two parameters p m p y some of the variation in the material properties thickness geometrical imperfections and residual stress likely correspond to the uncertainty furthermore the interaction with the other failure modes could play a role 3 failure mode interaction formula it is important in deriving an ultimate strength formulation that the effect of the failure mode interaction be included depending upon the dimensions of the stiffener and cylindrical shell ring stiffened cylinders failed in the interactive buckling mode as can be seen in the test results of kendrick 1955 and cho et al 2017 2018 in fig 4 b and 7 a as stated in the references the occurrence of stiffener tripping manifest to the collapse of the shell together with the stiffeners which can trigger the overall buckling after the local buckling has occurred herein lies that the structural collapse limit in the realistic manner is dependent on the other failure modes therefore in this section the ultimate strength design formulation is proposed based on the failure mode interaction which considers the interaction of shell yield inter frame buckling overall buckling and stiffener tripping one simple form based on the interaction between yielding and buckling is the quadratic merchant rankine formula and it has been proven to exhibit simplicity and accuracy by cho and frieze 1988 and cho and lee 1998 the quadratic formula and empirically derived knockdown factors can predict the static strengths of ring stiffened cylinders more accurately and consistently than the existing codes the simple formula was written as 1 p c ρ p m 2 p c p y 2 1 where p c is the collapse pressure p m is the local buckling pressure p y is the yield pressure and ρ is the knockdown factor this formula provides the dependent relationship between the failure modes to determine the collapse pressure knockdown factors are introduced as a reduction factor to handle the discrepancy and improve the skewness as well as to validate the prediction with test results 2 p c ρ l p m p c ρ o a p n p c ρ t p t 2 p c p y 2 1 next the proposed formulation is given by eq 2 the proposed equation similarly adopted eq 1 as the basis that provides the quadratic linearity of the local buckling pressure p m overall buckling pressure p m tripping pressure p t and yield pressure p y the thickness variation initial shape and material imperfection as well as the residual stress due to welding were assumed to be evaluated by the knockdown factor given as the knockdown factor for local buckling ρ l overall buckling ρ o a and tripping ρ t the yield pressure p y formula of the combined shell and ring stiffener is defined by the wilson equation in eq 3 this explains the case in which the mean stress in the plating at midbay between stiffeners reaches the yield point of the material the detailed notation can be found in fig 1 while the γ and g is the stiffener parameter as defined in the nomenclatures 3 p y σ y t r 1 γ g however the yielding behaviour of the material is related to the yield criterion which defines the allowable state of stress for the material in reality the collapse pressure usually exceeds the yield point of the material it is necessary to modify the yield pressure formula concerning the von mises yield criterion this is shown by eq 4 which is more extensive on its function approaching the equivalent stress 4 p y σ y t r 1 1 4 1 γ g 2 1 γ g 2 in the local buckling mode the failure was demonstrated by the loss of stability of the shell with the frame in the local area it can further occur with n circumferential wave lobes between the frames for this reason the critical parameter is the frame spacing in 1933 von mises developed the solution for the collapse pressure of a radially loaded simply supported cylindrical shell he developed a solution for the collapse pressure of a radially loaded cylindrical shell of finite length and for the first time with the presented number of circumferential waves that the shell collapsed as eq 5 5 p m e t r n 2 1 1 2 π r l s 2 1 n 2 l s π r 2 1 2 t 2 12 r 2 1 v 2 n 2 1 π r l s 2 2 the overall buckling failure mode consists of the shell and frame deformation in one compartment length it occurs when the stiffener is relatively small compared to the shell thickness and the cylinder is relatively long it is characterized by long wavelengths in both the circumferential n and axial directions bryant s two term approximation to the overall buckling pressure as given in eq 6 combines von mises and bresse s relations timoshenko and gere 1961 with simply supported boundary conditions for long ring framed compartments 6 p n n 2 1 e i c r 3 l s e t r n 2 1 1 2 π r l c 2 1 n 2 l c π r 2 1 2 7 l e f f 1 556 r t n 1 0 5 n 4 t r 2 0 5 n 2 t r 3 0 5 e is the young s modulus v is defined as the poisson ratio and i c is the second moment area of the combined cross section of the ring frame and the shell that depends on the calculation chosen for the effective breadth of shell plating at the stiffener junction which contributes to the overall flexural stiffness of the cylinder the effective width was suggested from bijlaard 1957 as in eq 7 this equation was used simultaneously in the overall buckling formula eq 6 which is dependent on the wave number n the last mode that should be considered is the stiffener tripping this mode is marked by the rotation of the stiffener about the stiffener to plate junction it is reported by cho et al 2017 2018 and verified in the numerical investigation that when the load increases the stiffener tripping affects the overall buckling of the shell as displayed in fig 11 8 σ t g j e t p n r 2 k 0 n r n 2 i o k 0 n ξ p m r n 2 9 p t σ t p y f r s σ y r f this phenomenon can be analogous to lateral torsional buckling of the column under the compression load in cylindrical cases the circumferential compressive load could lead to local deformation in the stiffener the effect of which can be higher depending on the out of straightness of the stiffener therefore it would be more realistic to include the stiffener tripping in the assessment of collapse pressure faulkner 1991 proposed the elastic tripping stress as defined in eq 8 the tripping stress was combined with shear modulus g the st venant pure torsion j warping γ of the cross section between the stiffener and the shell axis and rotational spring restraint k 0 n from the shell due to the stiffener s torsion parameter t p of the stiffener to plate junction the elastic tripping stress σ t must be minimized for the circumferential wave number n to estimate the equivalent external pressure p t that leads to tripping the relation between the circumferential yield pressure p y f and yield strength from eq 9 is used 3 1 derivation of the knockdown factor the next step that follows this formulation is to determine the knockdown factors as underlined above the term knockdown factor represents the reduction in the actual ultimate strength of the structures and there are a number of different ways that such reduction factors can be calculated the approach described below is based on the regression analyses using the best fit curve the approach is demonstrated using the published test data the test data have been taken from various published reports on steel welded ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressures as summarized in sub sections 2 1 the procedures involved in calculating knockdown factors are summarized in fig 12 using the tested data the relationship between the knockdown factors and the combination of suitable parameter was defined this step is taken to analyse the appropriate dependent non dimensional parameter on which to derive the knockdown factors then this parameter is going to be utilized in a simple regression that can provide the best fit against the test data the first parameters h w t w l s r r t l s t and l c d were chosen to represent the geometric parameters and the parameters e σ y were selected to correspond to the material properties in the meantime a set trial assumption has been made for the first unknown knockdown factor for local ρ l and overall buckling ρ o a however the variance of this first stand point can be neglected since evaluation of the factors reaches its closest as the unity of the bias and minimum cov by using the first assumed stand point where ρ l and ρ o a equal 0 8 and 1 0 respectively and rearranging eq 2 the tripping knockdown factors ρ t are determined the corresponding basic parameters of ring stiffened cylinders were assessed to determine the dependent parameter that can be adequately used to derive the factors then the examination continues to find ρ o a with respect to the deterministic value of ρ t finally by using ρ t and ρ o a this knockdown factor will be applied to derive the last remaining knockdown factor ρ l the degree of dependency regarding how each parameter affects the others can be seen in table 2 generally it has scattered results however the parameter of stiffener geometry h w t w probably gives the best basis parameter for ρ t and ρ o a unlike the case of ρ o a and ρ t the trend parameter for ρ l is less influential meaning that there is no strongly dependent parameter affected another factor is e σ y which has less effect but in the real case the effects of material properties play an important role therefore this parameter will be included in the combination of basic variables by substitution into eq 2 and performing the best fit evaluation of any combination parameter involved to represent the knockdown factors improvement of the mean bias of collapse prediction and least scatter as the minimum value of cov can be achieved the regression analyses results of the combination parameters are listed in tables 3 through 5 due to the nonlinearity of the scattered data the results are presented in exponential form for each knockdown factor ρ t ρ o a and ρ l the bias of the collapse prediction was measured using x m as the ratio of the actual collapse pressure to the predicted value it can be seen in table 3 that in the finding of ρ t the parameter combination of h w t w e 1000 σ y gives the best value in terms of fitting the experimental data the best fit curve from the scattered data of the actual knockdown factor for tripping is plotted in fig 13 however all values will still be examined to find the next knockdown factors in table 4 using the equation for ρ t the same procedures have been carried out in relation to ρ o a it is found that the use of the combination of stiffener spacing radius and shell thickness l s r l s t for ρ t and h w t w e 1000 σ y for ρ oa generates the best mean and least scattered of the ratio of actual to predicted strength as the mean and cov approach 1 01 and 8 12 respectively the value of the overall knockdown factor linearly increases with the combination parameter as described in fig 14 furthermore by using the best equation set in table 4 again the technique is utilized to calculate ρ l as listed in table 5 it shows that the combination of stiffener height to thickness stiffener spacing radius to shell thickness and material properties h w t w r l s t e 1000 σ y gives the best mean and cov approach 1 00 and 7 70 respectively the curve shows more unity then the previous ones as shown in fig 15 this last sets for deriving the knockdown factor provide the best equation sets for ρ t ρ oa and ρ l finally the last sets of the knockdown factor are summarized as follows 10 ρ t 207374 e x p 0 0088 l s r l s t t r i p p i n g 11 ρ o a 1 055 e x p 0 167 h w t w e 1000 σ y f o r o v e r a l l b u c k l i n g 12 ρ l 0 674 e x p 0

different approaches pd5500 dnv gl abs and api are compared the results of the authentication are listed in table 6 along with other codified rules it can be seen that its accuracy is fairly good as the mean approaches 1 00 together with cov 7 70 the quality of the result is followed by pd 5500 dnv gl abs and api respectively at the final stage in the regression analysis it is important to perform regression diagnostics of the developed formula the investigation can be done by plotting the residual graph between ratios from actual to prediction results x m against the basic parameter if there is an apparent relationship with those explanatory parameters it means that the independent variable should be considered carefully in the evaluation of the design formula parameter to be much improved fig 16 through 18 show the prediction of the proposed formula together with the existing formulation against the basic parameter it has been proved in the table where the skewness of the xm ratio which is created by the proposed formula shows no sharpness trend line the corresponding parameter is sufficiently included in the formulation it can be clearly seen for instance in fig 17 that the dnv gl and pd 5500 formulations show skewness against the parameters r t and e 1000σ y this indicates that when the corresponding parameter that has an effect on the strength predictions is correctly considered in the formulations their prediction accuracies will be much improved this is the shortcoming of existing formulations the skewness check indicates that the proposed formula provides adequate prediction since it is shown to have less effect on the basic parameters 3 3 parametric study to demonstrate the use of eq 2 in the practical design case it was utilized in the simple criterion for the assessment of the failure mode as affirmed by cho et al 2018 the criteria were re plotted using more extensive test data as can be seen in fig 19 it is verified that the distinctive collapse mode can be identified by the pressure ratio of p n p m there is a clear zone for models that failed by overall buckling and local buckling marked by a ratio p n p m less than 1 0 and p n p m over 2 0 respectively in addition there is a transition zone where the shell yielding and the interactive buckling mode occurred in between the local and overall buckling failure the shell yielding is likely closer to the overall buckling zone about p n p m 1 00 1 50 whereas the interactive buckling mode local failure combined with overall buckling tends to be near the local buckling range p n p m 1 50 2 50 in detail tendencies from the failure modes that fall somewhere in between the transition zone for the shell yielding and interactive buckling mode can be checked separately using the failure envelope of either buckling or yielding lunchick 1959 which is shown in fig 20 if the slenderness ratio exceeds the critical value λ 0 65 the cylinder will fail by elastic buckling or when the collapse pressure is smaller than the yield pressure p c p y or p c p y 1 in contrast with long cylinders a short cylinder in which the slenderness ratio is less than the critical slenderness value λ 0 65 or the collapse pressure is in the regime of p c p y 1 will fail by yield however it is noted that the overall buckling failure is described as part of the transition of the yield range in between 0 60 and 0 9 of the slenderness ratio however it was initially suspected that the failure mode growth in the ultimate strength can be different depending on the change of the basic parameter to quantify this influence using the proposed formula a thorough parametric study was performed to assess the basic geometry in the design parameter of ring stiffened cylinder structures the basic design parameters are varied from the base model chosen to investigate the progression of the failure mode affected by those changed the basic parameters are the compartment length to radius l c r radius to shell thickness r t stiffener spacing to shell thickness l s t and stiffener height to thickness h w t w ratios the base model utilized in this work is the actual tested model from cho et al 2018 the representative for each failure mode is taken model rs 6 failed by local buckling rs 9 by overall buckling rs 10 by shell yielding and rs ii by the interactive mode the details of these base models are clearly presented in table 7 the modification of the basic parameter is done based on the range of real structures the ratios of actual construction of the pressure hull for submersible and submarine structures from urm 1991 were utilized the parameters are specified in table 8 according to that range parameter and analysis cases from the four base models are presented in table 9 4 results and discussion fig 21 shows the possible failure indicator in the case of variation of the overall compartment length of the cylinder in this case the other basic parameters are fixed and the overall length is varied according to the indicator when the overall length of the cylinder increases by more than three times the radius the failure progresses into overall buckling in contrast when the cylinder becomes shorter than the diameter size it will fall into the local buckling failure regime p n p m 2 5 in the other cases the shell thickness was varied six times it can be noted that the change of shell thickness affected the failure mode progression as shown in fig 22 if the shell thickness reduces for the same diameter to approximately 0 3 times the original the cylinder will fail into the local buckling regime for instance in model rs 6 the maximum thickness case is 7 5 mm equal to r t 36 60 and the cylinder experiences overall buckling failure when the shell thickness reduces to less than 0 46 times the maximum or is equal to r t 78 43 it falls into the local buckling mode the results of the stiffener spacing and size variation can be seen in fig 23 through 24 a heavier stiffener will strengthen the ultimate strength and also change the failure mode into local buckling failure a lighter stiffener tends to fail in overall buckling for example in the case of model rs ii as can be seen in fig 23 when the stiffener thickness is 5 92 mm or equal to h w t w is 6 76 it fails in the interactive failure mode regime p n p m 2 5 when the stiffener thickness increases to 8 00 mm or the h w t w is 5 00 local buckling failure occurs in contrast a decrease in the stiffener thickness value to 0 50 mm h w t w 80 00 will increase the possibility of yielding or overall buckling from fig 24 it can further be noted that the stiffener spacing also has influence on the evolution of failure modes using the same shell thickness a narrow space between stiffeners gives more resistance to the ultimate strength and pronounces the tendency of failing by overall buckling in the range of p n p m 1 0 for instance in the case of model rs 10 which has failed by shell yielding in the regime of the transition zone in between p n p m 1 00 1 50 as the space between the stiffener becomes 50 mm l s t 11 16 the collapse prediction increases and the overall buckling is dominant if the stiffener spacing is extended to more than 1100 mm l s t 245 54 local buckling will take place however separate verification must be considered using figs 25 and 26 which are the failure envelopes for either yielding or buckling again the effect of changing the stiffener space and the shell thickness in the evolution of failure has also been declared a thinner shell section generates local buckling failure tendencies and a narrow space between the stiffener will generates more resistance to local buckling which means that the possibility of shell yielding and overall collapse of the compartment will exist to clearly illustrate the decrease in shell thickness and stiffener spacing against the failure mode progression based on the previous criterion the following two sample cases were varied from the base models rs ii and rs 10 and are presented in figs 27 and 28 as declared in the test report for model rs ii it fails by the interactive failure mode consisting of local and overall buckling by increasing the shell thickness to 2 8 times t 14 00 mm the original thickness the ultimate strength is reinforced by approximately 3 5 times failing a purely overall buckling failure mode from fig 28 for the base model rs 6 the stiffener spacing is changed from 50 mm l s t 11 16 to 1100 mm l s t 245 54 it is concluded that growth of the failure mode can be triggered by the variation of the stiffener spacing increasing the stiffener space will decrease all of the characteristic pressures p y p m p n p t this causes the predicted collapse pressure to drop and as plotted that 20 times increase of the space will reduce of approximately 90 for the ultimate strength it can be seen that when the stiffener spacing extent more than 10 times as the value of l s t ratio from 145 09 the local buckling is dominant 5 conclusions in this paper a design formulation was proposed to predict the collapse pressure for ring stiffened cylinders the formulation has included the failure mode interactions such as shell yielding inter frame overall buckling and stiffener tripping where the form of the merchant rankine formula was selected a set of proposed formula was composed with knockdown factors which were derived using 107 test result of ring stiffened cylinders the statistical data of the collapse prediction eq 2 against the actual test result in terms of bias and coefficient of variation are verified to be more unity and reliable the accuracy of the proposed formula showed much improved than those of other design code recommendations such as those of pd 5500 abs dnv gl api which account the failure modes separately parametric study and its application to the failure assessment are also made the simple criterion using the characteristic pressure ratio and the slenderness indicator could be used in forecast the failure mode of the ring stiffened cylinder structures using the criterion the distinctive failure mode shell yielding inter frame and or overall failure can be easily predicted from the studied results the variation of basic geometric ratios such as l c r r t l s t and h w t w on the actual base tested model may affect the failure mode of the structure it is noteworthy that the results of the parametric study which based on the actual structures allow the designer to have a good idea of how a particular ring stiffened cylinder design would be evaluated by each design parameter however more advanced optimization study and numerical investigation are still needed to give more comprehensive solutions for the submarine designer to obtain an optimum design and limitations acknowledgment the second author gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the research and

23310,this paper outlines empirical formulas to provide adequate predictions of the ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressure the ultimate strength formulation was derived from published test data found in the open literature the formulas consider the failure mode interactions which include the parameter of shell yielding inter frame buckling overall buckling and stiffener tripping the failure modes were inserted in the quadratic merchant rankine formula afterward the knockdown factors were empirically derived to best fit the actual collapse pressure it is found that the proposed formulation can predict the ultimate strengths of ring stiffened cylinders more accurately and consistently than other codified rules pd5500 gl abs api the simple criterion for the assessment of failure modes was also provided furthermore parametric studies were conducted to observe the effect of the design parameter on sizing the ring stiffened cylinder when the failure

designed to operate in deep water in its basic form the submarine structure has to provide optimum structural efficiency to withstand the hydrostatic pressure one method to improve the structural capacity is by using ring stiffened cylinders for the submarine pressure hull some approaches regarding the use of the ring stiffened cylinder as the primary structural member for large underwater structures were also conducted by ross and waterman 2000 and ross 2006 similarly the study of the strengthened cylindrical shell under the external pressure were performed by ghanbari ghazijahani et al 2014 2015a 2015b and ghanbari ghazijahani and showkati 2013 they have performed numerous number of ultimate strength investigation of the corrugated and longitudinal stiffened cylindrical shells which carried out by internal vacuum their extensive test works contribute to an improved design in enhancing structural capacity of shell structure by the minimum weight these structural units are mainly designed based on the concept of ultimate strength as stated by ellinas et al 1983 this fundamental form also has some similarities with those used in the offshore oil and gas industry das et al 2003 in reality under the loading conditions the ring stiffened cylinders can fail in one or coupling with more failure modes shell yielding local and overall buckling and instability of the ring stiffener faulkner 1991 cho et al 2018 buckling phenomena occur when most of the stored strain membrane energy is converted to bending energy which can cause catastrophic failure kendrick 1955 in light of these complicated buckling phenomena accurately assessing their behaviour is great importance in the structural engineering field recently many theoretical and experimental types of research have been conducted with various high pressure model tests by many researchers slankard and nash 1953 kirstein and slankard 1956 lunchick 1959 kendrick 1955 1964 1965 1970 reynolds 1960 miller and kinra 1981 yokota et al 1985 yamamoto et al 1989 frieze 1994 cerik and cho 2013 cho et al 2017 2018 these comprehensive works have led to a general understanding of the failure mechanism for this cylinder and recommendations of some adequate formulas that can be the guidance for failure prevention furthermore it is essential to precisely predict the ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinders subjected to hydrostatic pressure the early concept for ultimate strength of a cylindrical shell was expressed by von mises 1929 the shell was modelled with uniform thickness for a simply supported boundary condition winderburg and trilling 1934 then developed another simplified equation based on von mises s formulae to predict the collapse pressure under hydrostatic pressure loading they explained that failure of the vessel might occur in two types of ways a short vessel with a relatively thick shell fails by stressing the walls and reaching the yield point while a long vessel with a relatively thin shell will fail because of its instability or when buckling of the shell occurs at stresses that are considerably below the yield point the types of failure are analogous to the simple column action i e a short and thick column will fail by yield while a long and thin column will collapse by instability this work was then continued by von sanden and gunther 1952 who developed two equations to predict the pressure at which yielding of the shell occurs at the frame and mid bay reynolds 1960 presented a solution to the buckling pressure which is a function of the cylinder geometry tangent modulus e t and secant modulus e s as determined from the stress strain curve of the shell material that work proceeded based on the differential equations of equilibrium for the plastic range of cylindrical shells pulos 1963 a further failure is the overall collapse of the ring stiffener and the shell which was satisfied by bryant 1954 the solution used a modified version of the bresse pressure as the failure of the single ring stiffener and associated shell plating and a simplified von mises pressure for the shell failure of the finite length of a cylinder moreover a brief analytical example has been conducted by wenk and kennard 1956 to clarify the failure of overall collapse precipitated by tripping of the stiffener the analyses show that before global collapse mode the additional circumferential stresses in the flange of t stiffeners and radial stresses at the web as its attachment to the cylindrical shell can generate the yielding which results in a trigger for ring tripping the criteria for the minimum stiffener tripping stress were merely presented by kendrick 1972 for the assumed pinned stiffener moreover the consideration of stiffener tripping as the failure of that typical structure has been more extensively studied by morandi et al 1996 a closed form solution was proposed for the elastic and inelastic tripping pressure the elastic tripping pressure arises from the axisymmetric hoop stress at the frame centroid which is governed based on the interaction form with the von mises elastic buckling pressure where the inelastic tripping allowed for the tangent modulus in which the fabrication effects of welding and cold bending are included recently there are several code recommendations to predict the strength of ring stiffened cylinders based on the research mentioned above and derived theory those include the pd 5500 british standard specification for unfired fusion welded pressure vessels bsi 2009 dnv germanischer lloyd naval ship technology dnv gl 2015 american bureau of shipping rules for building and classing of underwater vehicles abs 2002 and api american petroleum institute from the bulletin on stability design of cylindrical shells bulletin 2u api 2000 however those current design code solutions consider the failure mode independently of each other the idea of the present work to improve the accuracy and reliability of the design formula is to include the effects of interaction through the simple form strength formulation which accounts for the shell yield local overall buckling and stiffener tripping such that they are dependent on each other then to accommodate the discrepancy due to the actual initial geometrical shape and material imperfection the residual stresses by cold rolled forming and welding knockdown factors were derived by regression analyses applied to the available test data subsequently the accuracy of the proposed formula has been tested with available test data and compared with the existing rules 2 ultimate strength of ring stiffened cylinder 2 1 ring stiffened cylinder test data to measure the adequacy of design code it is first necessary to substantiate the relevant test data for the comparison study one of the most convenient ways to deal with model uncertainty is to compare experimental results in the design code prediction the tested model data considered in this study are taken from various existing test data references as in the introduction explained the experimental investigation on ring stiffened cylinders began with the most straightforward model of ring stiffened cylinders as shown in fig 1 which represents a typical vessel subjected to uniform external pressure the tested ring stiffened cylinder models were mostly fabricated from general structure steel with a young s modulus of 206 000 mpa and yield stress between 230 and 420 mpa only a few models were fabricated from high strength steel with a yield stress up to 500 mpa yokota et al 1985 and there was a navsea test model price 2002 with a yield strength between 680 mpa and 1080 mpa the minimum radius was approximately 190 mm miller and kinra 1981 and the largest found was approximately 700 mm kendrick 1955 the test on the shortest cylinder was performed by frieze 1994 with 300 mm in overall length and the longest tested models 4870 mm were utilized by kendrick 1964 the test models were processed by cold rolled forming and welding thus there were considerable residual stresses and imperfections similar to the real practice because the buckling collapse load depends on many parameters table 1 shows the basic geometrical properties of the collected tested data on ring stiffened cylinder models the hydrostatic pressure test on a ring stiffened cylinder is conducted inside the pressure chamber in a vertical position as shown in fig 2 a and c it is reported on the experimental work done by slankard and nash 1953 kirstein and slankard 1956 lunchick 1959 reynolds 1960 where it has been carried out at david taylor model basin dtmb and frieze 1994 using the university of glasgow facilities the horizontal testing method was reported by yokota et al 1985 yamamoto et al 1989 which is conducted in the mitsubishi heavy industries and cho et al 2017 in university of ulsan as can be seen in fig 2 b and d the gravitational load can be attributed in the vertical type of hydrostatic testing apparatus as in the real underwater environment the pressure will increase linearly with the change of depth another issue is the pressure medium used to compress the model inside the chamber david taylor model basin works reported in the open literature were the only ones performed using oil as the pressure medium this fluid medium was chosen to avoid the requirement of waterproofing the electrical wire resistance strain gages other experimental works were reported using water as the testing fluid however the different strain energy of the testing fluid seems to be difficult to quantify since no report has mentioned considering this effect on the ultimate strength of such typical structures it is also described in the figure that the stiffener spacing was reduced toward the end plate of the model to avoid failure at the end of the compartment the results of the failure modes of the tested models are summarized in fig 3 the local buckling failure mode from the ring stiffened cylinder test results is shown in figs 4 a and 5 a this mode is marked by the axisymmetric yield at the cylindrical shell between the stiffeners or in the mid bay of a cylinder it is characterized by the local deformation of the shell between ring stiffeners the representative model for the shell yielding failure mode is shown in figs 6 a and 7 b the overall buckling failure mode consists of the shell and frame deformation in one compartment length as shown in figs 5 b and 6 b it occurs when the stiffener is relatively small compared to the shell thickness and the cylinder is relatively long it is marked by the large lobes over the compartments in the longitudinal direction in addition some of the models also failed by the interactive buckling mode when the local and overall buckling occurs together as shown in figs 4 b and 7 a 2 2 design code recommendation in the ultimate strength assessment of the ring stiffened cylinders there were several design code recommendations mentioned by refs cho and frieze 1988 das et al 2003 mackay 2007 cerik et al 2013 and cho et al 2018 those codes were also able to be used in the strength prediction of offshore platforms which has similarities to the analysis of submarine pressure hull first were pd 5500 and dnv germanischer lloyd dnv gl which are extensively used in europe and second were abs and api which are widely known in the us a comparison study of those design codes was also performed by price 2002 and temme 2003 despite their discrepancies in the early stage design these design codes were helpful in judging the initial feasibility of the design current design codes for these structures is based on a deterministic approach where each failure mode is considered independently from the others the failure is identified either by prediction of the lowest collapse pressures for local buckling modes or by the overall buckling mode to accommodate the actual capacity of the structure some of the adequate safety factors were applied to implicitly account for the geometrical shape and material imperfections as well as residual stresses due to fabrication the references above show that the code was adequately reliable results from the prediction of the presented design codes are plotted in fig 8 the assessment was made with the 107 available test data by comparing the actual collapse pressure p c a c t against the prediction p c p r e d from the design code recommendation the comparison between experimental and predicted results from the design code was statistically modelled by the mean value of bias and the coefficient of variation the more accurate prediction is marked by the unity of the mean bias and the smallest value of cov using these guidelines for comparison pd 5500 provides more accurate prediction by the mean and cov which approached 0 96 and 11 85 per cent the other results show that the design formulae from dnv gl abs and api are less accurate with mean values of 0 94 1 07 and 0 94 and the cov values are 13 44 14 18 and 14 95 per cent respectively overall there is still room to improve the formulas as mentioned earlier due to the non unity for bias and the large uncertainty in the evaluation using a large amount of test data since the early 80s the approximation of the inter frame buckling criteria has been associated with the ratio of the von mises elastic buckling pressure p m against the yield pressure p y this characteristic pressure ratio provides a better procedure for determining the ultimate strength of the pressure hull these design criteria were firstly adopted by pd 5500 and abs later also used them as standard practice for building and classifying underwater structures however the wide scatter among the recent test data can be seen from fig 9 all of the collected test data was plotted on a non dimensional basis for inter frame design criteria p m p y this ratio can generate an empirical tool to predict the collapse pressure pd 5500 assumed that when the ring stiffened cylinder exhibited out of roundness greater than 0 5 per cent of the radius the lower bound curve is likely fitted it is approximately 15 per cent offset from the mean curve and generates a 50 safety margin however this criteria produces skewness when the entirety of the test data is assessed in fig 10 as discussed by cho and frieze 1988 when the pressure ratio p y p m is smaller than 1 0 there is some tendency for pd 5500 to overestimate the collapse pressure this skewness indicates that the actual collapse pressure is not sufficiently governed by only two parameters p m p y some of the variation in the material properties thickness geometrical imperfections and residual stress likely correspond to the uncertainty furthermore the interaction with the other failure modes could play a role 3 failure mode interaction formula it is important in deriving an ultimate strength formulation that the effect of the failure mode interaction be included depending upon the dimensions of the stiffener and cylindrical shell ring stiffened cylinders failed in the interactive buckling mode as can be seen in the test results of kendrick 1955 and cho et al 2017 2018 in fig 4 b and 7 a as stated in the references the occurrence of stiffener tripping manifest to the collapse of the shell together with the stiffeners which can trigger the overall buckling after the local buckling has occurred herein lies that the structural collapse limit in the realistic manner is dependent on the other failure modes therefore in this section the ultimate strength design formulation is proposed based on the failure mode interaction which considers the interaction of shell yield inter frame buckling overall buckling and stiffener tripping one simple form based on the interaction between yielding and buckling is the quadratic merchant rankine formula and it has been proven to exhibit simplicity and accuracy by cho and frieze 1988 and cho and lee 1998 the quadratic formula and empirically derived knockdown factors can predict the static strengths of ring stiffened cylinders more accurately and consistently than the existing codes the simple formula was written as 1 p c ρ p m 2 p c p y 2 1 where p c is the collapse pressure p m is the local buckling pressure p y is the yield pressure and ρ is the knockdown factor this formula provides the dependent relationship between the failure modes to determine the collapse pressure knockdown factors are introduced as a reduction factor to handle the discrepancy and improve the skewness as well as to validate the prediction with test results 2 p c ρ l p m p c ρ o a p n p c ρ t p t 2 p c p y 2 1 next the proposed formulation is given by eq 2 the proposed equation similarly adopted eq 1 as the basis that provides the quadratic linearity of the local buckling pressure p m overall buckling pressure p m tripping pressure p t and yield pressure p y the thickness variation initial shape and material imperfection as well as the residual stress due to welding were assumed to be evaluated by the knockdown factor given as the knockdown factor for local buckling ρ l overall buckling ρ o a and tripping ρ t the yield pressure p y formula of the combined shell and ring stiffener is defined by the wilson equation in eq 3 this explains the case in which the mean stress in the plating at midbay between stiffeners reaches the yield point of the material the detailed notation can be found in fig 1 while the γ and g is the stiffener parameter as defined in the nomenclatures 3 p y σ y t r 1 γ g however the yielding behaviour of the material is related to the yield criterion which defines the allowable state of stress for the material in reality the collapse pressure usually exceeds the yield point of the material it is necessary to modify the yield pressure formula concerning the von mises yield criterion this is shown by eq 4 which is more extensive on its function approaching the equivalent stress 4 p y σ y t r 1 1 4 1 γ g 2 1 γ g 2 in the local buckling mode the failure was demonstrated by the loss of stability of the shell with the frame in the local area it can further occur with n circumferential wave lobes between the frames for this reason the critical parameter is the frame spacing in 1933 von mises developed the solution for the collapse pressure of a radially loaded simply supported cylindrical shell he developed a solution for the collapse pressure of a radially loaded cylindrical shell of finite length and for the first time with the presented number of circumferential waves that the shell collapsed as eq 5 5 p m e t r n 2 1 1 2 π r l s 2 1 n 2 l s π r 2 1 2 t 2 12 r 2 1 v 2 n 2 1 π r l s 2 2 the overall buckling failure mode consists of the shell and frame deformation in one compartment length it occurs when the stiffener is relatively small compared to the shell thickness and the cylinder is relatively long it is characterized by long wavelengths in both the circumferential n and axial directions bryant s two term approximation to the overall buckling pressure as given in eq 6 combines von mises and bresse s relations timoshenko and gere 1961 with simply supported boundary conditions for long ring framed compartments 6 p n n 2 1 e i c r 3 l s e t r n 2 1 1 2 π r l c 2 1 n 2 l c π r 2 1 2 7 l e f f 1 556 r t n 1 0 5 n 4 t r 2 0 5 n 2 t r 3 0 5 e is the young s modulus v is defined as the poisson ratio and i c is the second moment area of the combined cross section of the ring frame and the shell that depends on the calculation chosen for the effective breadth of shell plating at the stiffener junction which contributes to the overall flexural stiffness of the cylinder the effective width was suggested from bijlaard 1957 as in eq 7 this equation was used simultaneously in the overall buckling formula eq 6 which is dependent on the wave number n the last mode that should be considered is the stiffener tripping this mode is marked by the rotation of the stiffener about the stiffener to plate junction it is reported by cho et al 2017 2018 and verified in the numerical investigation that when the load increases the stiffener tripping affects the overall buckling of the shell as displayed in fig 11 8 σ t g j e t p n r 2 k 0 n r n 2 i o k 0 n ξ p m r n 2 9 p t σ t p y f r s σ y r f this phenomenon can be analogous to lateral torsional buckling of the column under the compression load in cylindrical cases the circumferential compressive load could lead to local deformation in the stiffener the effect of which can be higher depending on the out of straightness of the stiffener therefore it would be more realistic to include the stiffener tripping in the assessment of collapse pressure faulkner 1991 proposed the elastic tripping stress as defined in eq 8 the tripping stress was combined with shear modulus g the st venant pure torsion j warping γ of the cross section between the stiffener and the shell axis and rotational spring restraint k 0 n from the shell due to the stiffener s torsion parameter t p of the stiffener to plate junction the elastic tripping stress σ t must be minimized for the circumferential wave number n to estimate the equivalent external pressure p t that leads to tripping the relation between the circumferential yield pressure p y f and yield strength from eq 9 is used 3 1 derivation of the knockdown factor the next step that follows this formulation is to determine the knockdown factors as underlined above the term knockdown factor represents the reduction in the actual ultimate strength of the structures and there are a number of different ways that such reduction factors can be calculated the approach described below is based on the regression analyses using the best fit curve the approach is demonstrated using the published test data the test data have been taken from various published reports on steel welded ring stiffened cylinders under hydrostatic pressures as summarized in sub sections 2 1 the procedures involved in calculating knockdown factors are summarized in fig 12 using the tested data the relationship between the knockdown factors and the combination of suitable parameter was defined this step is taken to analyse the appropriate dependent non dimensional parameter on which to derive the knockdown factors then this parameter is going to be utilized in a simple regression that can provide the best fit against the test data the first parameters h w t w l s r r t l s t and l c d were chosen to represent the geometric parameters and the parameters e σ y were selected to correspond to the material properties in the meantime a set trial assumption has been made for the first unknown knockdown factor for local ρ l and overall buckling ρ o a however the variance of this first stand point can be neglected since evaluation of the factors reaches its closest as the unity of the bias and minimum cov by using the first assumed stand point where ρ l and ρ o a equal 0 8 and 1 0 respectively and rearranging eq 2 the tripping knockdown factors ρ t are determined the corresponding basic parameters of ring stiffened cylinders were assessed to determine the dependent parameter that can be adequately used to derive the factors then the examination continues to find ρ o a with respect to the deterministic value of ρ t finally by using ρ t and ρ o a this knockdown factor will be applied to derive the last remaining knockdown factor ρ l the degree of dependency regarding how each parameter affects the others can be seen in table 2 generally it has scattered results however the parameter of stiffener geometry h w t w probably gives the best basis parameter for ρ t and ρ o a unlike the case of ρ o a and ρ t the trend parameter for ρ l is less influential meaning that there is no strongly dependent parameter affected another factor is e σ y which has less effect but in the real case the effects of material properties play an important role therefore this parameter will be included in the combination of basic variables by substitution into eq 2 and performing the best fit evaluation of any combination parameter involved to represent the knockdown factors improvement of the mean bias of collapse prediction and least scatter as the minimum value of cov can be achieved the regression analyses results of the combination parameters are listed in tables 3 through 5 due to the nonlinearity of the scattered data the results are presented in exponential form for each knockdown factor ρ t ρ o a and ρ l the bias of the collapse prediction was measured using x m as the ratio of the actual collapse pressure to the predicted value it can be seen in table 3 that in the finding of ρ t the parameter combination of h w t w e 1000 σ y gives the best value in terms of fitting the experimental data the best fit curve from the scattered data of the actual knockdown factor for tripping is plotted in fig 13 however all values will still be examined to find the next knockdown factors in table 4 using the equation for ρ t the same procedures have been carried out in relation to ρ o a it is found that the use of the combination of stiffener spacing radius and shell thickness l s r l s t for ρ t and h w t w e 1000 σ y for ρ oa generates the best mean and least scattered of the ratio of actual to predicted strength as the mean and cov approach 1 01 and 8 12 respectively the value of the overall knockdown factor linearly increases with the combination parameter as described in fig 14 furthermore by using the best equation set in table 4 again the technique is utilized to calculate ρ l as listed in table 5 it shows that the combination of stiffener height to thickness stiffener spacing radius to shell thickness and material properties h w t w r l s t e 1000 σ y gives the best mean and cov approach 1 00 and 7 70 respectively the curve shows more unity then the previous ones as shown in fig 15 this last sets for deriving the knockdown factor provide the best equation sets for ρ t ρ oa and ρ l finally the last sets of the knockdown factor are summarized as follows 10 ρ t 207374 e x p 0 0088 l s r l s t t r i p p i n g 11 ρ o a 1 055 e x p 0 167 h w t w e 1000 σ y f o r o v e r a l l b u c k l i n g 12 ρ l 0 674 e x p 0

different approaches pd5500 dnv gl abs and api are compared the results of the authentication are listed in table 6 along with other codified rules it can be seen that its accuracy is fairly good as the mean approaches 1 00 together with cov 7 70 the quality of the result is followed by pd 5500 dnv gl abs and api respectively at the final stage in the regression analysis it is important to perform regression diagnostics of the developed formula the investigation can be done by plotting the residual graph between ratios from actual to prediction results x m against the basic parameter if there is an apparent relationship with those explanatory parameters it means that the independent variable should be considered carefully in the evaluation of the design formula parameter to be much improved fig 16 through 18 show the prediction of the proposed formula together with the existing formulation against the basic parameter it has been proved in the table where the skewness of the xm ratio which is created by the proposed formula shows no sharpness trend line the corresponding parameter is sufficiently included in the formulation it can be clearly seen for instance in fig 17 that the dnv gl and pd 5500 formulations show skewness against the parameters r t and e 1000σ y this indicates that when the corresponding parameter that has an effect on the strength predictions is correctly considered in the formulations their prediction accuracies will be much improved this is the shortcoming of existing formulations the skewness check indicates that the proposed formula provides adequate prediction since it is shown to have less effect on the basic parameters 3 3 parametric study to demonstrate the use of eq 2 in the practical design case it was utilized in the simple criterion for the assessment of the failure mode as affirmed by cho et al 2018 the criteria were re plotted using more extensive test data as can be seen in fig 19 it is verified that the distinctive collapse mode can be identified by the pressure ratio of p n p m there is a clear zone for models that failed by overall buckling and local buckling marked by a ratio p n p m less than 1 0 and p n p m over 2 0 respectively in addition there is a transition zone where the shell yielding and the interactive buckling mode occurred in between the local and overall buckling failure the shell yielding is likely closer to the overall buckling zone about p n p m 1 00 1 50 whereas the interactive buckling mode local failure combined with overall buckling tends to be near the local buckling range p n p m 1 50 2 50 in detail tendencies from the failure modes that fall somewhere in between the transition zone for the shell yielding and interactive buckling mode can be checked separately using the failure envelope of either buckling or yielding lunchick 1959 which is shown in fig 20 if the slenderness ratio exceeds the critical value λ 0 65 the cylinder will fail by elastic buckling or when the collapse pressure is smaller than the yield pressure p c p y or p c p y 1 in contrast with long cylinders a short cylinder in which the slenderness ratio is less than the critical slenderness value λ 0 65 or the collapse pressure is in the regime of p c p y 1 will fail by yield however it is noted that the overall buckling failure is described as part of the transition of the yield range in between 0 60 and 0 9 of the slenderness ratio however it was initially suspected that the failure mode growth in the ultimate strength can be different depending on the change of the basic parameter to quantify this influence using the proposed formula a thorough parametric study was performed to assess the basic geometry in the design parameter of ring stiffened cylinder structures the basic design parameters are varied from the base model chosen to investigate the progression of the failure mode affected by those changed the basic parameters are the compartment length to radius l c r radius to shell thickness r t stiffener spacing to shell thickness l s t and stiffener height to thickness h w t w ratios the base model utilized in this work is the actual tested model from cho et al 2018 the representative for each failure mode is taken model rs 6 failed by local buckling rs 9 by overall buckling rs 10 by shell yielding and rs ii by the interactive mode the details of these base models are clearly presented in table 7 the modification of the basic parameter is done based on the range of real structures the ratios of actual construction of the pressure hull for submersible and submarine structures from urm 1991 were utilized the parameters are specified in table 8 according to that range parameter and analysis cases from the four base models are presented in table 9 4 results and discussion fig 21 shows the possible failure indicator in the case of variation of the overall compartment length of the cylinder in this case the other basic parameters are fixed and the overall length is varied according to the indicator when the overall length of the cylinder increases by more than three times the radius the failure progresses into overall buckling in contrast when the cylinder becomes shorter than the diameter size it will fall into the local buckling failure regime p n p m 2 5 in the other cases the shell thickness was varied six times it can be noted that the change of shell thickness affected the failure mode progression as shown in fig 22 if the shell thickness reduces for the same diameter to approximately 0 3 times the original the cylinder will fail into the local buckling regime for instance in model rs 6 the maximum thickness case is 7 5 mm equal to r t 36 60 and the cylinder experiences overall buckling failure when the shell thickness reduces to less than 0 46 times the maximum or is equal to r t 78 43 it falls into the local buckling mode the results of the stiffener spacing and size variation can be seen in fig 23 through 24 a heavier stiffener will strengthen the ultimate strength and also change the failure mode into local buckling failure a lighter stiffener tends to fail in overall buckling for example in the case of model rs ii as can be seen in fig 23 when the stiffener thickness is 5 92 mm or equal to h w t w is 6 76 it fails in the interactive failure mode regime p n p m 2 5 when the stiffener thickness increases to 8 00 mm or the h w t w is 5 00 local buckling failure occurs in contrast a decrease in the stiffener thickness value to 0 50 mm h w t w 80 00 will increase the possibility of yielding or overall buckling from fig 24 it can further be noted that the stiffener spacing also has influence on the evolution of failure modes using the same shell thickness a narrow space between stiffeners gives more resistance to the ultimate strength and pronounces the tendency of failing by overall buckling in the range of p n p m 1 0 for instance in the case of model rs 10 which has failed by shell yielding in the regime of the transition zone in between p n p m 1 00 1 50 as the space between the stiffener becomes 50 mm l s t 11 16 the collapse prediction increases and the overall buckling is dominant if the stiffener spacing is extended to more than 1100 mm l s t 245 54 local buckling will take place however separate verification must be considered using figs 25 and 26 which are the failure envelopes for either yielding or buckling again the effect of changing the stiffener space and the shell thickness in the evolution of failure has also been declared a thinner shell section generates local buckling failure tendencies and a narrow space between the stiffener will generates more resistance to local buckling which means that the possibility of shell yielding and overall collapse of the compartment will exist to clearly illustrate the decrease in shell thickness and stiffener spacing against the failure mode progression based on the previous criterion the following two sample cases were varied from the base models rs ii and rs 10 and are presented in figs 27 and 28 as declared in the test report for model rs ii it fails by the interactive failure mode consisting of local and overall buckling by increasing the shell thickness to 2 8 times t 14 00 mm the original thickness the ultimate strength is reinforced by approximately 3 5 times failing a purely overall buckling failure mode from fig 28 for the base model rs 6 the stiffener spacing is changed from 50 mm l s t 11 16 to 1100 mm l s t 245 54 it is concluded that growth of the failure mode can be triggered by the variation of the stiffener spacing increasing the stiffener space will decrease all of the characteristic pressures p y p m p n p t this causes the predicted collapse pressure to drop and as plotted that 20 times increase of the space will reduce of approximately 90 for the ultimate strength it can be seen that when the stiffener spacing extent more than 10 times as the value of l s t ratio from 145 09 the local buckling is dominant 5 conclusions in this paper a design formulation was proposed to predict the collapse pressure for ring stiffened cylinders the formulation has included the failure mode interactions such as shell yielding inter frame overall buckling and stiffener tripping where the form of the merchant rankine formula was selected a set of proposed formula was composed with knockdown factors which were derived using 107 test result of ring stiffened cylinders the statistical data of the collapse prediction eq 2 against the actual test result in terms of bias and coefficient of variation are verified to be more unity and reliable the accuracy of the proposed formula showed much improved than those of other design code recommendations such as those of pd 5500 abs dnv gl api which account the failure modes separately parametric study and its application to the failure assessment are also made the simple criterion using the characteristic pressure ratio and the slenderness indicator could be used in forecast the failure mode of the ring stiffened cylinder structures using the criterion the distinctive failure mode shell yielding inter frame and or overall failure can be easily predicted from the studied results the variation of basic geometric ratios such as l c r r t l s t and h w t w on the actual base tested model may affect the failure mode of the structure it is noteworthy that the results of the parametric study which based on the actual structures allow the designer to have a good idea of how a particular ring stiffened cylinder design would be evaluated by each design parameter however more advanced optimization study and numerical investigation are still needed to give more comprehensive solutions for the submarine designer to obtain an optimum design and limitations acknowledgment the second author gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the research and

verified that loads outside of the plane have a more obvious impact on the risers it is necessary to conduct three dimensional analysis keywords vector form intrinsic finite element vfife hanging riser steel lazy wave riser geometric configuration 1 introduction with the continuous expansion of the human footstep the exploitation of marine oil and gas has gradually entered the deep sea in which riser system is important as well as vulnerable connection part connected the sea floating devices to the submarine equipment chatjigeorgiou 2008 as a consequence the design construction and installation methods of marine risers have become vital technical issues in the process of oil and gas exploration according to dnv os f201 dnv 2001 the marine risers are classified as top tensioned risers and compliant risers by how floater motions should be absorbed by the riser system moreover compliant risers can be not only flexible risers and steel catenary risers scr but also pliant wave lazy wave lazy s steep wave riser in virtue of their relatively low cost and good adaptability of floating and heaving motions flexible risers and scr are the preferred choices of risers for deep water oil and gas exploitation nearly a decade the risers has attracted broad attention from scientific academia and industrial circles many researchers have conducted in depth study on them at the same time a number of the research works were published because of the similar structural mechanic characteristics this paper would take both of the flexible riser and scr as the examples of marine risers for study jain 1994 gave the static analysis method of the overhang section of lazy wave riser by finite difference fd method chatjigeorgiou 2008 2010 proposed a finite differences solution method to analyze the numerical treatment of the dynamic equilibrium problem of 2d catenary risers as well as the nonlinear dynamics problem of 3d catenary risers conveying fluid and subjected to end imposed excitations webster 1977 conducted the earlier finite element analysis of the deep sea moors and cable systems garrett 1982 presented a new three dimensional finite element model of an inextensible elastic rod with equal principal stiffness the model permits large deflections and finite rotations and accounts for tension variation along its length paulling and webster 1986 improved the slender flexible rod model based on the finite element method of absolute node coordinate formulation so that it can consider axial elongation chai and varyani 2006 used the absolute coordinate formulation for the three dimensional flexible risers for further analysis taking into account the bending shear coupling radial axial coupling and the effect of the flow nakajima et al 1982 modified a new method to analyze the multi component mooring system and the method is motivated by the lumped mass method originally developed by walton and polachek 1959 ghadimi 1988 derived the motion equations of flexible risers including nodal shear forces and bending moments in three dimensional space using the lumped mass discretization method it can be seen that the research and analysis methods currently used in marine risers mainly include finite difference method finite element method and lumped mass method these methods are characterized by mathematical analysis of the components however this paper will take a new calculation method vector form intrinsic finite element vfife also termed as finite particle method fpm vfife is a new numerical analysis method proposed by ting et al 2004 it is certainly an innovative concept of structural analysis in this method the structure is described as a collection of particles which are connected by rod elements without quality and only withstand the internal force and the motion of particles meet newton s second law the path unit is used to describe the motion state of the particle and the virtual inverse motion is used to calculate the pure deformation substituting the mathematical model with the physical model it does not require any integrated stiffness matrix nor does it require an iterative solution to the governing equation it can effectively deal with the geometric large displacement of space non linear and discontinuous material constitutive relations structural and rigid body movement and their mutual coupling behavior and other complex situations wu et al 2007 wu and ting 2008 presented a large deflection analysis of membrane structures in which a 4 node quadrilateral membrane element and a triangular membrane element were proposed to reveal that the proposed element based on an intrinsic model called vfife could go through the patch tests and possesses stable convergent and accurate results yu and luo 2009 proved the capabilities and accuracy of the fpm in their studies using a motion analysis of deployable structures lee et al 2007 found that the new developed method of vfife could be a promised method in analysis of the offshore template structures including its dynamic characteristic large displacement motion and structural type through static and dynamic analysis of a typical marine riser in this paper the vfife method is applied to analyze the three dimensional marine risers and the physical model of the risers is established in the solution of the motion formula the central differential method of explicit time integration is used the calculation step includes two cycles one is for particle position the position of the current time is obtained by the position of last time calculated via the difference method the other is for the element the pure deformation is calculated by the virtual reverse motion and the internal force of the element is calculated to obtain the particle force of the current position the first cycle is used to solve the particle position of the next time point the second cycle is used to solve the internal force of the next moment followed by reciprocating it can obtain the state of each particle at every time point to determine the whole configuration and internal force of the structure 2 fundamentals of vector form intrinsic finite element vfife 2 1 point value description assuming that the rod a b is a physical continuum structure and its shape is made up by an infinite number of points as presented in fig 1 depending on the nature and precision of the problem a limited number of points are selected among the infinite points which are used to describe the shape and spatial position of the rod the position of the other points between the spatial points can be represented by a set of successive normalized interpolation functions in this model the rod is described by a finite number of points which have mass also called particles these particles with point values are connected by rod element which has no mass and all internal forces and external forces are added to the particles therefore the equivalent mass m α the quality of the rod element divided equally to the particles is substituted for the quality of the hypostatic part of the rod such as the particle j the mass of which is defined as 1 m j m j α 1 n m α j m α 1 2 ρ l where m j is the mass added on the particle j n is the number of rod elements connected to the particle j m α is the mass contributed from each rod element and assigned to particle j and ρ is the mass per unit length of the rod element l is the length of the rod element in addition the riser includes the internal flow according to the actual situation it need consider the quality of the flow similarly to m j the moment of inertia matrix i j also includes the moment of inertia i m contributed from spatial particle itself and the equivalent moment of inertia i α from the hypostatic rod i m and i α are both 3 3 matrices 2 i j i m α 1 n i α j i α m α r 2 where r is the gyration radius of the cross section in the direction of the principal coordinates the proof can be found in ref ting et al 2012 2 2 the route description by time points when the rod is subjected to external forces the position vector of any particle is a function relating to time variable commonly known as a path or time trajectory described by the particle on a set of time points in continuous time values assuming that the analysis period t a t t b is a time slice of the time trajectory and it can be described by a set of governing equations it is called the path unit fig 2 the position vectors of the particle at time t a t t b are expressed as x a x x b respectively the question needs to be described is how the particle converts from x a to x b the mechanics law that needs to be followed in the position transformation process 1 the law of motion the position of the rod is represented by a set of particles and the particles will change positions once subjected to force that is the displacement vectors displacement follows the motion formula 2 hooke s law after the force added to the rod there must be a change in shape that is the deformation or the relative displacement vector between the two points based on the material mechanics the deformation follows the relationship between stress and strain during a path unit t a t t b the motion equations of particle j at time t are expressed as 3 m j d 2 d t 2 x j y j z j p j x p j y p j z 1 n p μ x p μ y p μ z f μ x f μ y f μ z 4 i x x i x y i x z i y x i y y i y z i z x i z y i z z d 2 d t 2 θ j x θ j y θ j z q j x q j y q j z 1 n q μ x q μ y q μ z m μ x m μ y m μ z the position vector x j x j y j z j in the particle motion formula and the direction vector θ j of the particle j are described by the global coordinates m j is the total mass of the particle including the mass provided by the connected rod element the matrix i j is the total mass moment of inertia p j and q j are the concentrated forces and moments acting on the particle p μ and f μ are the equivalent forces provided by the connected rod element and the internal force of the particle q μ and m μ are the equivalent bending moment provided by the connected rod element and the internal bending moment of the particle n is the total number of connected rod elements the number of rods connected to the particles in this model is 2 n 2 2 3 principal coordinates and deformation of the rod element 2 3 1 principal coordinates the rod structure is more complex in three dimensional rod internal force including axial force torque and two sets of bending moment as well as shear force the bending moment must be calculated by the deflection theory of the asymmetric cross section the calculation process generally takes two methods one is to directly calculate in the global coordinates the other is to find the beam section of the main axis direction calculate at the principal coordinates and then convert results to the global coordinates this model takes the second method as shown in fig 3 the principal direction vectors of the rod 1 2 at time t a are e a 1 e a 2 e a 3 which are defined as 5 e a 1 x a 2 x a 1 x a 2 x a 1 e 13 x a 3 x a 1 x a 3 x a 1 e a 2 e 13 e a 1 e 13 e a 1 e a 3 e a 1 e a 2 similarly the principal direction vectors of the rod are e b 1 e b 2 e b 3 at time t b during the period of t b t a the displacement vectors of the nodes are u 1 u 2 respectively and the rotation vectors are β 1 β 2 respectively it is noteworthy that in a path unit of t a t t b the rod element 1 2 need to be simplified as follows 1 the deformations including elongation torsion angles and rotation angles of the rod element are infinitesimal within the time interval t t a hence it is assumed that the geometric shape of the element remains constant in the internal force calculation within this interval 2 within the time interval t t a the axis of rod element is straight the rod must be prismatic all points on the same rod element must have identical principal axis direction the internal force of the element can be calculated by the material mechanics deflection theory so the principal directions of two consecutive time points such as e a 1 e a 2 e a 3 and e b 1 e b 2 e b 3 have a rotational vector relationship of a rigid plane assuming that the rotation vector of the element principal axis is γ b which is divided into two components one is the cross section rotating around its normal the rotational vector of which is γ 1 the other is the normal of cross section that rotates from 1 a 2 a to 1 b 2 b the vector of which is γ 2 take node 1 as a reference point for rotation the rotation of the cross section around its normal is expressed as γ 1 β 1 e a 1 e a 1 and the vector γ 2 is calculated as γ 2 θ ba e ba where θ ba is the rotational angle vector and e ba is the direction vector of rotational axis which are defined as θ ba sin 1 e a 1 e b 1 e ba e a 1 e b 1 e a 1 e b 1 then γ b is obtained as γ b γ 1 γ 2 β 1 e a 1 e a 1 θ ba e ba so the relationship between the direction vectors of e b 2 and e a 2 is described as 6 e b 2 r b e a 2 where r b i sin γ b a γ 1 cos γ b a γ 2 and the angle γ b of the element vector are expressed as 7 γ b γ b e γ l γ m γ n γ γ b γ b a γ 0 n γ m γ n γ 0 l γ m γ l γ 0 after getting e b 1 and e b 2 the third vector e b 3 can be figured out 8 e b 3 e b 1 e b 2 so the direction of the principal axis at the starting point t a is rotated by the rotation vector in the interval t b t a to obtain the new principal direction at the next time point t b 2 3 2 deformation of the rod element at first define the principal coordinates of a set of rod elements x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ 3 parallel to e a 1 e a 2 e a 3 respectively principle coordinates are settled at the start time t a of a path unit and remain unchanged during all path unit the rotational relationship between principle coordinates and global coordinates is described as 9 x ˆ ω a x where x ˆ t x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ 3 is principle coordinates x t x 1 y 2 z 3 is global coordinate and ω a is described as ω a e a 1 t e a 2 t e a 3 t t and then the nodal rotations at global coordinates β 1 β 2 are converted to β ˆ 1 β ˆ 2 described by principle coordinates during the interval of t b t a β ˆ j ω a β j j 1 2 in order to eliminate the deformation and rotation of the rigid body it is need to do the virtual reverse movement of the rod take node 1 as the reference point for rotation set u 1 as the displacement vector of the rod element as shown in fig 4 after the reverse translation it can calculate the relative displacement vector of the element nodes 1 b 2 b relative to the reference point node 1 a 10 η 1 0 η 2 u 2 u 1 the magnitude of the rigid body rotation is the rotation vector γ b at the corresponding time point after the reverse movement the displacement and the angle between the virtual rod and the actual rod at t b moment are the true deformation including displacements and angles which caused the internal force the true deformation displacement is described as 11 η 2 d δ ˆ e e a 1 δ ˆ e η 2 d l b l a where l a and l b are the spans of the element 1 a 2 a and 1 b 2 b the true deformation angles are described as 12 β ˆ j d β ˆ j γ ˆ b β ˆ 1 j β ˆ 1 1 β ˆ 2 j θ ˆ 2 t β ˆ 3 j θ ˆ 3 t φ ˆ 1 j φ ˆ 2 j φ ˆ 3 j j 1 2 where φ ˆ 1 1 and φ ˆ 1 2 are the twist angle of node 1 and node 2 respectively φ ˆ 2 1 and φ ˆ 3 1 are the bending angles of node 1 φ ˆ 2 2 and φ ˆ 3 2 are the bending angles of node 2 the twist angle of node 1 is zero because node 1 is the reference point and fig 4 shows that the bending angle in the plane x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 therefore there are six nodal deformation components of the rod element which represent the four deformation behaviors of the rod the change of the axis elongation the axial twist and the two groups of bending the relevant content can be found in ref ting et al 2012 2 4 calculation of internal force and moment of nodes the nodal forces and nodal bending moments of the rod element at the virtual position are expressed as f ˆ j t ƒ ˆ 1 j ƒ ˆ 2 j ƒ ˆ 3 j m ˆ j t m ˆ 1 j m ˆ 2 j m ˆ 3 j j 1 2 the nodal forces and the nodal bending moments of the initial structure are expressed as f ˆ j t ƒ ˆ 1 a j ƒ ˆ 2 a j ƒ ˆ 3 a j m ˆ j t m ˆ 1 a j m ˆ 2 a j m ˆ 3 a j and the relationship are expressed as f ˆ j f ˆ a j δ f ˆ j m ˆ j m ˆ a j δ m ˆ j j 1 2 where δ f ˆ j and δ m ˆ j are the nodal force and nodal bending moment produced due to displacement deformation and rotation deformation at the interval t b t a according to hooke s law and deflection theory of material mechanics substituting the axial deformation δ ˆ e and bending angles φˆ 2 1 φˆ 2 2 φˆ 3 1 φˆ 3 2 into the formula can get the δ f ˆ j and δ m ˆ j and then the nodal force and bending moment can be obtained the node forces of node 2 are ƒˆ 1 2 ƒ ˆ 1 a 2 e a a a δ ˆ e l a ƒ ˆ 2 2 1 l a m ˆ 3 1 m ˆ 3 2 ƒˆ 3 2 1 l a m ˆ 2 1 m ˆ 2 2 the node forces of node 1 are ƒ ˆ 1 1 ƒ ˆ 1 2 ƒ ˆ 2 1 ƒ ˆ 2 2 ƒ ˆ 3 1 ƒˆ 3 2 the bending moments of node 2 are m ˆ 1 2 m ˆ 1 a 2 g a j ˆ a l a φˆ 1 2 m ˆ 2 2 m ˆ 2 a 2 e a i ˆ 2 a l a 2 φ ˆ 2 1 4 φ ˆ 2 2 m ˆ 3 2 m ˆ 3 a 2 e a i ˆ 3 a l a 2 φ ˆ 3 1 4 φ ˆ 3 2 the bending moments of node 1 are m ˆ 1 1 m ˆ 1 2 m ˆ 2 1 m ˆ 2 a 1 e a i ˆ 2 a l a 4 φ ˆ 2 1 2 φ ˆ 2 2 m ˆ 3 1 m ˆ 3 a 1 e a i ˆ 3 a l a 4 φ ˆ 3 1 2 φ ˆ 3 2 it should be noted that the internal force and moment increment of the node are expressed in the principal coordinates while the internal force and bending moment of the infrastructural node are represented in the global coordinates for the superposition the internal force and the bending of the infrastructure are converted to the principal coordinates at first after the superposition internal force and bending moment of time t b are obtained and then it is need to convert the force and moment into global coordinates as the internal force and bending moment obtained through the virtual reverse movement it is necessary for a positive rotation to get the final node internal force and bending moment which are expressed as 13 f j ƒ j x ƒ j y ƒ j z r t ω a t ƒ ˆ 1 j ƒ ˆ 2 j ƒ ˆ 3 j m j m j x m j y m j z r t ω a t m ˆ 1 j m ˆ 2 j m ˆ 3 j j 1 2 where r t ω a are respectively the transformation matrix of space rotation between the direction vectors and transformation matrix between the global coordinates and the principal coordinates the computation of them can be found above 3 model establishment of riser 3 1 governing equation as depicted in fig 5 the initial position of the riser is an oblique straight line divided into n segments numbered from the bottom upwards the top 1 2 3 i j n 1 n n 1 by n 1 particles the bottom of the riser is pinned the n 1th point of the riser is moved horizontally to the designated point l 1 in the given time meanwhile the gravity and buoyancy are loaded on the riser in ramped loading way and then the riser under the action of gravity buoyancy and internal forces will reach the target shape in the three dimensional coordinates the direction of the current can be arbitrarily selected the equivalent mass is determined by cross sectional area span as well as density of the rod and the internal flow considering the structural damping the governing equation for the particle is 14 m j d 2 dt 2 x j y j z j f j x e x i f j y e x i f j z e x i f j x i n t f j y i n t f j z i n t f j x d m p f j y d m p f j z d m p 15 i x x 0 0 0 i y y 0 0 0 i z z d 2 d t 2 θ j x

mass of the hypostatic rod connected to the point the inertial matrix i j also includes the equivalent moment of inertia of the hypostatic rod connected to the point and θ j is the deformation angle of j and f j dmp ξ j m j d x j d t m j dmp ξ j i j d x j d t ξ is the damping coefficient f j exi and m j exi are the external force and external moment of particle j f j int m j int are the internal force and internal moment of particle j 3 2 hydrodynamic load the actual wave and current loads acted on the riser are distributed loads distributed to each particle of the riser by the traditional finite element method the forces applied to the riser element can be calculated using the morrison equation morison et al 1950 the riser is a tilted cylinder considering the additional mass and drag force in the tangential direction the force vector of hydrodynamic loads acting on the inclined column zhu 1991 can be written as 16 f ρ w π d 2 4 u c a ρ w π d 2 4 u n r n 1 2 c d ρ w d u n r n u n r

velocity and acceleration vector of the rod structure that is orthogonal to the cylindrical axis u n r n is the norm of vector u n r n u nt u nt are the velocity and acceleration vectors of water particle for the tangential direction of the column axis r n r n are the velocity and acceleration vector of the rod structure in the tangential direction of the column axis c a c d and c a t c d t are the mass coefficients and the drag force coefficients of the normal direction and tangential direction respectively 3 3 the effect of internal flow according to the published literature the internal flow can reduce structural stiffness provide negative damping irani et al 1987 and induce additional large displacement of risers chucheepsakul and huang 1994 therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of the internal flow since the inside of the riser usually contains the oil and gas mixture the internal flow field is very complicated in this paper a plug flow is adopted assuming that the internal flow of the riser is as an infinitely flexible rod the columnar body has the same flow velocity at each point on its section so the force induced by internal flow according to paidoussis 1998 is 17 q f m i n d 2 r d t 2 m i n t u i n s 2 r s t m i n 2 r t 2 2 u i n 2 r s t u i n 2 2 r s 2 where m i n is the mass of the internal flow per element length and r s t is the profile curve of the riser d d t is the full derivative operator for time the first term is the inertial force caused by the inner flow the second is the coriolis force caused by the rotation of the riser and the third is the centripetal force caused by the directional change of internal flow to maintain the same curvature with the tube considering the influence of the internal flow the effective tension dnv 2001 of the riser is 18 t e t p 0 a 0 p i a i m i n u i n 2 3 4 numerical solution the central differential difference method is used to solve the problem which is complex iteration and convergence problem caused by implicit difference however in order to control the convergence problem it is necessary to control the time step in this method the step to solve the equations can be divided into two steps first the position vector x j n 1 on step n 1 of particle j is calculated based on the position vectors x j n 1 on step n 1 and x j n on step n second the internal force acting on each particle is calculated according to x j n 1 then the position vector of step n 1 is replaced by step n the position vector of step n is replaced by step n 1 update the position vectors like this repeat the above steps cycle the calculation until the analysis is completed applying matlab to program the logic diagram is as follows fig 6 supposing the time step is h the position vectors x j n 1 and x j n are substituted into the particle equation of motion and the corresponding difference equation is 19 x j n 1 y j n 1 z j n 1 2 c 1 x j n y j n z j n c 2 x j n 1 y j n 1 z j n 1 c 1 h 2 f

the element performance in presenting the behavior of risers in statics and dynamics 4 1 hanging riser as a representative of flexible riser a realistic hanging riser configuration pinned at both ends in an infinite water depth is analyzed the parameters used for analysis are cited from reference of low and langley 2006 using the lumped mass discretization as presented in table 1 the horizontal and vertical distances between the top and bottom ends are 100 m and 50 m respectively the top node is positioned at a water depth of 5 m the riser was divided into 20 elements and 21 particles a snapshot of the riser equilibrium configuration forming process from the assumed position to the equilibrium configuration is shown in fig 7 comparisons of the tensions and support reactions at the top and bottom ends are presented in table 2 in dynamic analysis six working conditions are adopted and the data can be found in table 3 the comparison of the top tension between the reference and vfife shows that the results of vfife relatively agree well with the reference in fig 8 only the maximum value and the minimum value have a bit difference and almost all of which under 1 the damping ratio is seen to be the main source for this difference so in general the results of top tension in dynamic analysis relatively match well with the reference and it proves the feasibility of vfife in dynamic analysis of marine risers in time domain 4 2 steel catenary riser the second riser model is a steel catenary riser and the data is shown in table 4 in this model the angle between the direction of the current and the plane of the initial riser is 90 and the internal flow is considered in the calculation as shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the vfife is in relatively good agreement with the three dimensional absolute coordinate formulation model chai and varyani 2006 the maximum y direction displacements are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively in which the three dimensional absolute coordinate formulation model is about 20 43 m the model of vfiffe is about 20 36 m the difference is 0 343 it indicates the good match of the two models at the same time the direction of the current has a certain impact on the configuration of the riser it can be seen the tension and the bending moment obtained from vfife diagram also agree well with the reference figss 12 and 13 the maximum bending moment gotten from vfife is 7 604 10 4 n m while the result of reference is 7 595 10 4 n m so the maximum bending moment difference of this two method is 0 118 the small difference also can get from the comparison of actual tension overall the calculated results of vfife are in good agreement with chai and varyani 2006 4 3 steel lazy wave riser the third example is steel lazy wave riser slwr and the data comes from wang and duan 2015 as shown in table 5 the static configuration of slwr obtained by vfife method is consistent with the result of the literature when the current velocity is zero as shown in fig 14 the tension of touchdown point is 149 9 kn and the top tension is 827 kn getting from vfife while the results of wang are respectively about 150 kn and 833 58 kn of which the differences are only 0 067 and 0 789 shown in fig 15 and the bending moment obtained by the vfife also agrees well with the bending moment obtained by wang shown in fig 16 in addition to the results compared with wang s study which proved that the vfife can be applied to calculate configuration and internal force of three dimensional sler different ocean currents velocities and directions are also taken into consideration and parameter sensitivity analysis is carried out in this paper and it should be noted that the weight of the internal flow is not considered during the process which used to be compared with the literature while it is taken into consideration in the last case different direction of the current and it should be indicated that in this model the vertical soil resistance is simplified by the linear elastic vertical spring model and it is expressed as f k y where k is the soil stiffness y is used to express the vertical corresponding displacement in the analysis of different current velocities the angle degree between the direction of the current and the x axis is 0 the current velocities are taken 1 5 m s 1 25 m s 1 m s 0 75 m s 0 5 m s 0 m s respectively to get the comparisons of configurations fig 17 tensions fig 18 as well as bending moments fig 19 it can be seen that when the current velocity moves along the positive direction of the x axis the greater the current velocity is the slower change of the float section will be it also can be got that the tension of the flowline section to the part of the upper section increases with the increase of the current velocity and the closer to the flowline section the more distinct the influence will be however when it is closer to the top of the riser the tension would decrease with the increase of the current velocity in the analysis of different directions of the current the speed is constant at 1 5 m s it is shown in fig 20 that the bigger the angle between the direction of current and the positive direction of x axis is the more obviously the riser float section will upraise one reason is that the current out of the plane leads to the displacement along the positive direction of y axis the second reason is that the current in the plane causes the lateral displacement along the x axis of the riser fig 21 shows the three dimensional view of the riser configuration under a certain current direction that is pi 2 a top view and a left view of the riser shape are also shown in fig 22 respectively fig 23 shows a comparison of the riser tensions at the different current directions it can be seen that when the current velocity is 1 5 m s the impact on the configuration of slwr caused by the different direction currents is relatively obvious 5 conclusion in this paper the modeling and nonlinear analysis of three dimensional marine risers using vfife have been presented the basic concepts of vfife based on the theory of vector mechanics and numerical

verified that loads outside of the plane have a more obvious impact on the risers it is necessary to conduct three dimensional analysis keywords vector form intrinsic finite element vfife hanging riser steel lazy wave riser geometric configuration 1 introduction with the continuous expansion of the human footstep the exploitation of marine oil and gas has gradually entered the deep sea in which riser system is important as well as vulnerable connection part connected the sea floating devices to the submarine equipment chatjigeorgiou 2008 as a consequence the design construction and installation methods of marine risers have become vital technical issues in the process of oil and gas exploration according to dnv os f201 dnv 2001 the marine risers are classified as top tensioned risers and compliant risers by how floater motions should be absorbed by the riser system moreover compliant risers can be not only flexible risers and steel catenary risers scr but also pliant wave lazy wave lazy s steep wave riser in virtue of their relatively low cost and good adaptability of floating and heaving motions flexible risers and scr are the preferred choices of risers for deep water oil and gas exploitation nearly a decade the risers has attracted broad attention from scientific academia and industrial circles many researchers have conducted in depth study on them at the same time a number of the research works were published because of the similar structural mechanic characteristics this paper would take both of the flexible riser and scr as the examples of marine risers for study jain 1994 gave the static analysis method of the overhang section of lazy wave riser by finite difference fd method chatjigeorgiou 2008 2010 proposed a finite differences solution method to analyze the numerical treatment of the dynamic equilibrium problem of 2d catenary risers as well as the nonlinear dynamics problem of 3d catenary risers conveying fluid and subjected to end imposed excitations webster 1977 conducted the earlier finite element analysis of the deep sea moors and cable systems garrett 1982 presented a new three dimensional finite element model of an inextensible elastic rod with equal principal stiffness the model permits large deflections and finite rotations and accounts for tension variation along its length paulling and webster 1986 improved the slender flexible rod model based on the finite element method of absolute node coordinate formulation so that it can consider axial elongation chai and varyani 2006 used the absolute coordinate formulation for the three dimensional flexible risers for further analysis taking into account the bending shear coupling radial axial coupling and the effect of the flow nakajima et al 1982 modified a new method to analyze the multi component mooring system and the method is motivated by the lumped mass method originally developed by walton and polachek 1959 ghadimi 1988 derived the motion equations of flexible risers including nodal shear forces and bending moments in three dimensional space using the lumped mass discretization method it can be seen that the research and analysis methods currently used in marine risers mainly include finite difference method finite element method and lumped mass method these methods are characterized by mathematical analysis of the components however this paper will take a new calculation method vector form intrinsic finite element vfife also termed as finite particle method fpm vfife is a new numerical analysis method proposed by ting et al 2004 it is certainly an innovative concept of structural analysis in this method the structure is described as a collection of particles which are connected by rod elements without quality and only withstand the internal force and the motion of particles meet newton s second law the path unit is used to describe the motion state of the particle and the virtual inverse motion is used to calculate the pure deformation substituting the mathematical model with the physical model it does not require any integrated stiffness matrix nor does it require an iterative solution to the governing equation it can effectively deal with the geometric large displacement of space non linear and discontinuous material constitutive relations structural and rigid body movement and their mutual coupling behavior and other complex situations wu et al 2007 wu and ting 2008 presented a large deflection analysis of membrane structures in which a 4 node quadrilateral membrane element and a triangular membrane element were proposed to reveal that the proposed element based on an intrinsic model called vfife could go through the patch tests and possesses stable convergent and accurate results yu and luo 2009 proved the capabilities and accuracy of the fpm in their studies using a motion analysis of deployable structures lee et al 2007 found that the new developed method of vfife could be a promised method in analysis of the offshore template structures including its dynamic characteristic large displacement motion and structural type through static and dynamic analysis of a typical marine riser in this paper the vfife method is applied to analyze the three dimensional marine risers and the physical model of the risers is established in the solution of the motion formula the central differential method of explicit time integration is used the calculation step includes two cycles one is for particle position the position of the current time is obtained by the position of last time calculated via the difference method the other is for the element the pure deformation is calculated by the virtual reverse motion and the internal force of the element is calculated to obtain the particle force of the current position the first cycle is used to solve the particle position of the next time point the second cycle is used to solve the internal force of the next moment followed by reciprocating it can obtain the state of each particle at every time point to determine the whole configuration and internal force of the structure 2 fundamentals of vector form intrinsic finite element vfife 2 1 point value description assuming that the rod a b is a physical continuum structure and its shape is made up by an infinite number of points as presented in fig 1 depending on the nature and precision of the problem a limited number of points are selected among the infinite points which are used to describe the shape and spatial position of the rod the position of the other points between the spatial points can be represented by a set of successive normalized interpolation functions in this model the rod is described by a finite number of points which have mass also called particles these particles with point values are connected by rod element which has no mass and all internal forces and external forces are added to the particles therefore the equivalent mass m α the quality of the rod element divided equally to the particles is substituted for the quality of the hypostatic part of the rod such as the particle j the mass of which is defined as 1 m j m j α 1 n m α j m α 1 2 ρ l where m j is the mass added on the particle j n is the number of rod elements connected to the particle j m α is the mass contributed from each rod element and assigned to particle j and ρ is the mass per unit length of the rod element l is the length of the rod element in addition the riser includes the internal flow according to the actual situation it need consider the quality of the flow similarly to m j the moment of inertia matrix i j also includes the moment of inertia i m contributed from spatial particle itself and the equivalent moment of inertia i α from the hypostatic rod i m and i α are both 3 3 matrices 2 i j i m α 1 n i α j i α m α r 2 where r is the gyration radius of the cross section in the direction of the principal coordinates the proof can be found in ref ting et al 2012 2 2 the route description by time points when the rod is subjected to external forces the position vector of any particle is a function relating to time variable commonly known as a path or time trajectory described by the particle on a set of time points in continuous time values assuming that the analysis period t a t t b is a time slice of the time trajectory and it can be described by a set of governing equations it is called the path unit fig 2 the position vectors of the particle at time t a t t b are expressed as x a x x b respectively the question needs to be described is how the particle converts from x a to x b the mechanics law that needs to be followed in the position transformation process 1 the law of motion the position of the rod is represented by a set of particles and the particles will change positions once subjected to force that is the displacement vectors displacement follows the motion formula 2 hooke s law after the force added to the rod there must be a change in shape that is the deformation or the relative displacement vector between the two points based on the material mechanics the deformation follows the relationship between stress and strain during a path unit t a t t b the motion equations of particle j at time t are expressed as 3 m j d 2 d t 2 x j y j z j p j x p j y p j z 1 n p μ x p μ y p μ z f μ x f μ y f μ z 4 i x x i x y i x z i y x i y y i y z i z x i z y i z z d 2 d t 2 θ j x θ j y θ j z q j x q j y q j z 1 n q μ x q μ y q μ z m μ x m μ y m μ z the position vector x j x j y j z j in the particle motion formula and the direction vector θ j of the particle j are described by the global coordinates m j is the total mass of the particle including the mass provided by the connected rod element the matrix i j is the total mass moment of inertia p j and q j are the concentrated forces and moments acting on the particle p μ and f μ are the equivalent forces provided by the connected rod element and the internal force of the particle q μ and m μ are the equivalent bending moment provided by the connected rod element and the internal bending moment of the particle n is the total number of connected rod elements the number of rods connected to the particles in this model is 2 n 2 2 3 principal coordinates and deformation of the rod element 2 3 1 principal coordinates the rod structure is more complex in three dimensional rod internal force including axial force torque and two sets of bending moment as well as shear force the bending moment must be calculated by the deflection theory of the asymmetric cross section the calculation process generally takes two methods one is to directly calculate in the global coordinates the other is to find the beam section of the main axis direction calculate at the principal coordinates and then convert results to the global coordinates this model takes the second method as shown in fig 3 the principal direction vectors of the rod 1 2 at time t a are e a 1 e a 2 e a 3 which are defined as 5 e a 1 x a 2 x a 1 x a 2 x a 1 e 13 x a 3 x a 1 x a 3 x a 1 e a 2 e 13 e a 1 e 13 e a 1 e a 3 e a 1 e a 2 similarly the principal direction vectors of the rod are e b 1 e b 2 e b 3 at time t b during the period of t b t a the displacement vectors of the nodes are u 1 u 2 respectively and the rotation vectors are β 1 β 2 respectively it is noteworthy that in a path unit of t a t t b the rod element 1 2 need to be simplified as follows 1 the deformations including elongation torsion angles and rotation angles of the rod element are infinitesimal within the time interval t t a hence it is assumed that the geometric shape of the element remains constant in the internal force calculation within this interval 2 within the time interval t t a the axis of rod element is straight the rod must be prismatic all points on the same rod element must have identical principal axis direction the internal force of the element can be calculated by the material mechanics deflection theory so the principal directions of two consecutive time points such as e a 1 e a 2 e a 3 and e b 1 e b 2 e b 3 have a rotational vector relationship of a rigid plane assuming that the rotation vector of the element principal axis is γ b which is divided into two components one is the cross section rotating around its normal the rotational vector of which is γ 1 the other is the normal of cross section that rotates from 1 a 2 a to 1 b 2 b the vector of which is γ 2 take node 1 as a reference point for rotation the rotation of the cross section around its normal is expressed as γ 1 β 1 e a 1 e a 1 and the vector γ 2 is calculated as γ 2 θ ba e ba where θ ba is the rotational angle vector and e ba is the direction vector of rotational axis which are defined as θ ba sin 1 e a 1 e b 1 e ba e a 1 e b 1 e a 1 e b 1 then γ b is obtained as γ b γ 1 γ 2 β 1 e a 1 e a 1 θ ba e ba so the relationship between the direction vectors of e b 2 and e a 2 is described as 6 e b 2 r b e a 2 where r b i sin γ b a γ 1 cos γ b a γ 2 and the angle γ b of the element vector are expressed as 7 γ b γ b e γ l γ m γ n γ γ b γ b a γ 0 n γ m γ n γ 0 l γ m γ l γ 0 after getting e b 1 and e b 2 the third vector e b 3 can be figured out 8 e b 3 e b 1 e b 2 so the direction of the principal axis at the starting point t a is rotated by the rotation vector in the interval t b t a to obtain the new principal direction at the next time point t b 2 3 2 deformation of the rod element at first define the principal coordinates of a set of rod elements x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ 3 parallel to e a 1 e a 2 e a 3 respectively principle coordinates are settled at the start time t a of a path unit and remain unchanged during all path unit the rotational relationship between principle coordinates and global coordinates is described as 9 x ˆ ω a x where x ˆ t x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ 3 is principle coordinates x t x 1 y 2 z 3 is global coordinate and ω a is described as ω a e a 1 t e a 2 t e a 3 t t and then the nodal rotations at global coordinates β 1 β 2 are converted to β ˆ 1 β ˆ 2 described by principle coordinates during the interval of t b t a β ˆ j ω a β j j 1 2 in order to eliminate the deformation and rotation of the rigid body it is need to do the virtual reverse movement of the rod take node 1 as the reference point for rotation set u 1 as the displacement vector of the rod element as shown in fig 4 after the reverse translation it can calculate the relative displacement vector of the element nodes 1 b 2 b relative to the reference point node 1 a 10 η 1 0 η 2 u 2 u 1 the magnitude of the rigid body rotation is the rotation vector γ b at the corresponding time point after the reverse movement the displacement and the angle between the virtual rod and the actual rod at t b moment are the true deformation including displacements and angles which caused the internal force the true deformation displacement is described as 11 η 2 d δ ˆ e e a 1 δ ˆ e η 2 d l b l a where l a and l b are the spans of the element 1 a 2 a and 1 b 2 b the true deformation angles are described as 12 β ˆ j d β ˆ j γ ˆ b β ˆ 1 j β ˆ 1 1 β ˆ 2 j θ ˆ 2 t β ˆ 3 j θ ˆ 3 t φ ˆ 1 j φ ˆ 2 j φ ˆ 3 j j 1 2 where φ ˆ 1 1 and φ ˆ 1 2 are the twist angle of node 1 and node 2 respectively φ ˆ 2 1 and φ ˆ 3 1 are the bending angles of node 1 φ ˆ 2 2 and φ ˆ 3 2 are the bending angles of node 2 the twist angle of node 1 is zero because node 1 is the reference point and fig 4 shows that the bending angle in the plane x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 therefore there are six nodal deformation components of the rod element which represent the four deformation behaviors of the rod the change of the axis elongation the axial twist and the two groups of bending the relevant content can be found in ref ting et al 2012 2 4 calculation of internal force and moment of nodes the nodal forces and nodal bending moments of the rod element at the virtual position are expressed as f ˆ j t ƒ ˆ 1 j ƒ ˆ 2 j ƒ ˆ 3 j m ˆ j t m ˆ 1 j m ˆ 2 j m ˆ 3 j j 1 2 the nodal forces and the nodal bending moments of the initial structure are expressed as f ˆ j t ƒ ˆ 1 a j ƒ ˆ 2 a j ƒ ˆ 3 a j m ˆ j t m ˆ 1 a j m ˆ 2 a j m ˆ 3 a j and the relationship are expressed as f ˆ j f ˆ a j δ f ˆ j m ˆ j m ˆ a j δ m ˆ j j 1 2 where δ f ˆ j and δ m ˆ j are the nodal force and nodal bending moment produced due to displacement deformation and rotation deformation at the interval t b t a according to hooke s law and deflection theory of material mechanics substituting the axial deformation δ ˆ e and bending angles φˆ 2 1 φˆ 2 2 φˆ 3 1 φˆ 3 2 into the formula can get the δ f ˆ j and δ m ˆ j and then the nodal force and bending moment can be obtained the node forces of node 2 are ƒˆ 1 2 ƒ ˆ 1 a 2 e a a a δ ˆ e l a ƒ ˆ 2 2 1 l a m ˆ 3 1 m ˆ 3 2 ƒˆ 3 2 1 l a m ˆ 2 1 m ˆ 2 2 the node forces of node 1 are ƒ ˆ 1 1 ƒ ˆ 1 2 ƒ ˆ 2 1 ƒ ˆ 2 2 ƒ ˆ 3 1 ƒˆ 3 2 the bending moments of node 2 are m ˆ 1 2 m ˆ 1 a 2 g a j ˆ a l a φˆ 1 2 m ˆ 2 2 m ˆ 2 a 2 e a i ˆ 2 a l a 2 φ ˆ 2 1 4 φ ˆ 2 2 m ˆ 3 2 m ˆ 3 a 2 e a i ˆ 3 a l a 2 φ ˆ 3 1 4 φ ˆ 3 2 the bending moments of node 1 are m ˆ 1 1 m ˆ 1 2 m ˆ 2 1 m ˆ 2 a 1 e a i ˆ 2 a l a 4 φ ˆ 2 1 2 φ ˆ 2 2 m ˆ 3 1 m ˆ 3 a 1 e a i ˆ 3 a l a 4 φ ˆ 3 1 2 φ ˆ 3 2 it should be noted that the internal force and moment increment of the node are expressed in the principal coordinates while the internal force and bending moment of the infrastructural node are represented in the global coordinates for the superposition the internal force and the bending of the infrastructure are converted to the principal coordinates at first after the superposition internal force and bending moment of time t b are obtained and then it is need to convert the force and moment into global coordinates as the internal force and bending moment obtained through the virtual reverse movement it is necessary for a positive rotation to get the final node internal force and bending moment which are expressed as 13 f j ƒ j x ƒ j y ƒ j z r t ω a t ƒ ˆ 1 j ƒ ˆ 2 j ƒ ˆ 3 j m j m j x m j y m j z r t ω a t m ˆ 1 j m ˆ 2 j m ˆ 3 j j 1 2 where r t ω a are respectively the transformation matrix of space rotation between the direction vectors and transformation matrix between the global coordinates and the principal coordinates the computation of them can be found above 3 model establishment of riser 3 1 governing equation as depicted in fig 5 the initial position of the riser is an oblique straight line divided into n segments numbered from the bottom upwards the top 1 2 3 i j n 1 n n 1 by n 1 particles the bottom of the riser is pinned the n 1th point of the riser is moved horizontally to the designated point l 1 in the given time meanwhile the gravity and buoyancy are loaded on the riser in ramped loading way and then the riser under the action of gravity buoyancy and internal forces will reach the target shape in the three dimensional coordinates the direction of the current can be arbitrarily selected the equivalent mass is determined by cross sectional area span as well as density of the rod and the internal flow considering the structural damping the governing equation for the particle is 14 m j d 2 dt 2 x j y j z j f j x e x i f j y e x i f j z e x i f j x i n t f j y i n t f j z i n t f j x d m p f j y d m p f j z d m p 15 i x x 0 0 0 i y y 0 0 0 i z z d 2 d t 2 θ j x

mass of the hypostatic rod connected to the point the inertial matrix i j also includes the equivalent moment of inertia of the hypostatic rod connected to the point and θ j is the deformation angle of j and f j dmp ξ j m j d x j d t m j dmp ξ j i j d x j d t ξ is the damping coefficient f j exi and m j exi are the external force and external moment of particle j f j int m j int are the internal force and internal moment of particle j 3 2 hydrodynamic load the actual wave and current loads acted on the riser are distributed loads distributed to each particle of the riser by the traditional finite element method the forces applied to the riser element can be calculated using the morrison equation morison et al 1950 the riser is a tilted cylinder considering the additional mass and drag force in the tangential direction the force vector of hydrodynamic loads acting on the inclined column zhu 1991 can be written as 16 f ρ w π d 2 4 u c a ρ w π d 2 4 u n r n 1 2 c d ρ w d u n r n u n r

velocity and acceleration vector of the rod structure that is orthogonal to the cylindrical axis u n r n is the norm of vector u n r n u nt u nt are the velocity and acceleration vectors of water particle for the tangential direction of the column axis r n r n are the velocity and acceleration vector of the rod structure in the tangential direction of the column axis c a c d and c a t c d t are the mass coefficients and the drag force coefficients of the normal direction and tangential direction respectively 3 3 the effect of internal flow according to the published literature the internal flow can reduce structural stiffness provide negative damping irani et al 1987 and induce additional large displacement of risers chucheepsakul and huang 1994 therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of the internal flow since the inside of the riser usually contains the oil and gas mixture the internal flow field is very complicated in this paper a plug flow is adopted assuming that the internal flow of the riser is as an infinitely flexible rod the columnar body has the same flow velocity at each point on its section so the force induced by internal flow according to paidoussis 1998 is 17 q f m i n d 2 r d t 2 m i n t u i n s 2 r s t m i n 2 r t 2 2 u i n 2 r s t u i n 2 2 r s 2 where m i n is the mass of the internal flow per element length and r s t is the profile curve of the riser d d t is the full derivative operator for time the first term is the inertial force caused by the inner flow the second is the coriolis force caused by the rotation of the riser and the third is the centripetal force caused by the directional change of internal flow to maintain the same curvature with the tube considering the influence of the internal flow the effective tension dnv 2001 of the riser is 18 t e t p 0 a 0 p i a i m i n u i n 2 3 4 numerical solution the central differential difference method is used to solve the problem which is complex iteration and convergence problem caused by implicit difference however in order to control the convergence problem it is necessary to control the time step in this method the step to solve the equations can be divided into two steps first the position vector x j n 1 on step n 1 of particle j is calculated based on the position vectors x j n 1 on step n 1 and x j n on step n second the internal force acting on each particle is calculated according to x j n 1 then the position vector of step n 1 is replaced by step n the position vector of step n is replaced by step n 1 update the position vectors like this repeat the above steps cycle the calculation until the analysis is completed applying matlab to program the logic diagram is as follows fig 6 supposing the time step is h the position vectors x j n 1 and x j n are substituted into the particle equation of motion and the corresponding difference equation is 19 x j n 1 y j n 1 z j n 1 2 c 1 x j n y j n z j n c 2 x j n 1 y j n 1 z j n 1 c 1 h 2 f

the element performance in presenting the behavior of risers in statics and dynamics 4 1 hanging riser as a representative of flexible riser a realistic hanging riser configuration pinned at both ends in an infinite water depth is analyzed the parameters used for analysis are cited from reference of low and langley 2006 using the lumped mass discretization as presented in table 1 the horizontal and vertical distances between the top and bottom ends are 100 m and 50 m respectively the top node is positioned at a water depth of 5 m the riser was divided into 20 elements and 21 particles a snapshot of the riser equilibrium configuration forming process from the assumed position to the equilibrium configuration is shown in fig 7 comparisons of the tensions and support reactions at the top and bottom ends are presented in table 2 in dynamic analysis six working conditions are adopted and the data can be found in table 3 the comparison of the top tension between the reference and vfife shows that the results of vfife relatively agree well with the reference in fig 8 only the maximum value and the minimum value have a bit difference and almost all of which under 1 the damping ratio is seen to be the main source for this difference so in general the results of top tension in dynamic analysis relatively match well with the reference and it proves the feasibility of vfife in dynamic analysis of marine risers in time domain 4 2 steel catenary riser the second riser model is a steel catenary riser and the data is shown in table 4 in this model the angle between the direction of the current and the plane of the initial riser is 90 and the internal flow is considered in the calculation as shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the vfife is in relatively good agreement with the three dimensional absolute coordinate formulation model chai and varyani 2006 the maximum y direction displacements are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively in which the three dimensional absolute coordinate formulation model is about 20 43 m the model of vfiffe is about 20 36 m the difference is 0 343 it indicates the good match of the two models at the same time the direction of the current has a certain impact on the configuration of the riser it can be seen the tension and the bending moment obtained from vfife diagram also agree well with the reference figss 12 and 13 the maximum bending moment gotten from vfife is 7 604 10 4 n m while the result of reference is 7 595 10 4 n m so the maximum bending moment difference of this two method is 0 118 the small difference also can get from the comparison of actual tension overall the calculated results of vfife are in good agreement with chai and varyani 2006 4 3 steel lazy wave riser the third example is steel lazy wave riser slwr and the data comes from wang and duan 2015 as shown in table 5 the static configuration of slwr obtained by vfife method is consistent with the result of the literature when the current velocity is zero as shown in fig 14 the tension of touchdown point is 149 9 kn and the top tension is 827 kn getting from vfife while the results of wang are respectively about 150 kn and 833 58 kn of which the differences are only 0 067 and 0 789 shown in fig 15 and the bending moment obtained by the vfife also agrees well with the bending moment obtained by wang shown in fig 16 in addition to the results compared with wang s study which proved that the vfife can be applied to calculate configuration and internal force of three dimensional sler different ocean currents velocities and directions are also taken into consideration and parameter sensitivity analysis is carried out in this paper and it should be noted that the weight of the internal flow is not considered during the process which used to be compared with the literature while it is taken into consideration in the last case different direction of the current and it should be indicated that in this model the vertical soil resistance is simplified by the linear elastic vertical spring model and it is expressed as f k y where k is the soil stiffness y is used to express the vertical corresponding displacement in the analysis of different current velocities the angle degree between the direction of the current and the x axis is 0 the current velocities are taken 1 5 m s 1 25 m s 1 m s 0 75 m s 0 5 m s 0 m s respectively to get the comparisons of configurations fig 17 tensions fig 18 as well as bending moments fig 19 it can be seen that when the current velocity moves along the positive direction of the x axis the greater the current velocity is the slower change of the float section will be it also can be got that the tension of the flowline section to the part of the upper section increases with the increase of the current velocity and the closer to the flowline section the more distinct the influence will be however when it is closer to the top of the riser the tension would decrease with the increase of the current velocity in the analysis of different directions of the current the speed is constant at 1 5 m s it is shown in fig 20 that the bigger the angle between the direction of current and the positive direction of x axis is the more obviously the riser float section will upraise one reason is that the current out of the plane leads to the displacement along the positive direction of y axis the second reason is that the current in the plane causes the lateral displacement along the x axis of the riser fig 21 shows the three dimensional view of the riser configuration under a certain current direction that is pi 2 a top view and a left view of the riser shape are also shown in fig 22 respectively fig 23 shows a comparison of the riser tensions at the different current directions it can be seen that when the current velocity is 1 5 m s the impact on the configuration of slwr caused by the different direction currents is relatively obvious 5 conclusion in this paper the modeling and nonlinear analysis of three dimensional marine risers using vfife have been presented the basic concepts of vfife based on the theory of vector mechanics and numerical calculation are point values description and path unit and the structural behavior is described by clear physical model and particles motion governing equations unlike the traditional mathematical model there is no need for an integrated stiffness matrix and no iterative solution to the control equations which can be flexible to solve the structural problems a hanging riser a simple steel catenary riser and a steel lazy wave riser are used to carry out the riser analysis including static and the dynamic analysis in which the different hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loadings are considered the described model here is the basis to study three dimensional nonlinear problems in risers such as the lateral displacement caused by hydrodynamic load out of plane it is necessary to

and an underwater explosion bubble both in still water and waves are simulated the dynamics of the ship global responses and the influence of the waves are analyzed which shows noteworthy nonlinearity keywords bubble dynamics underwater explosion fluid structure interaction global response waves 1 introduction shock responses of structure in water subjected to underwater explosion loads have always been the concern of researchers all over the world brett et al 2000 cole 1948 cui et al 2016 geers and hunter 2002 hung and hwangfu 2010 klaseboer et al 2005a wang 2013 xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011b 2014 2016 2017a the interaction between the fluid and the structure is highly nonlinear especially considering the free surface effect global strength is one of the most important aspects in ship strength evaluation as a typical slender structure the ship hull can be bended or twisted as a beam subject to the loads distributing uneven along the longitudinal direction of the ship when the bending moment at the ship hull section exceeds the ultimate moment longitudinal structural parts will fail and leads to the loose of the global strength underwater explosion bubble load is one of the most threatening load that a ship may encounter brett and yiannakopolous 2008 chen et al 2009 cole 1948 hung and hwangfu 2010 klaseboer et al 2005a liu et al 2014 wang and khoo 2004 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 2014 2016 2017b due to the low frequency feature of the bubble oscillation load which can be close to the frequency of the low order vibration modes of the ship resonance effects may lead to serious global response of the ship and threaten its global strength chen et al 2009 hicks 1986 wilkerson 1985 xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011a 2014 many of the traditional researchers used spherical underwater explosion bubble model to predict the whipping response of ships steller 1983 studied the damping factors in the whipping responses of the submarine subject to an underwater explosion loading hicks 1986 simulated the whipping responses of the surface ship caused by underwater explosion kwon and cunningham 1998 analyzed the difference between several simplification method of the stiffened cylindrical shell subject to underwater explosion researches above used the spherical bubble dynamics model ignoring the effects of the its deformation and nonlinear interaction with boundaries if the explosion was far enough from the ship the error is negligible for the surface ship the effects of the free surface must be considered zhang zong analyzed the whipping responses of the surface ship subject to the bubble load adopting the spherical bubble model and the linearized free surface condition zhang and zong 2011 zhang et al 2014 as for the nonspherical motion of the underwater explosion bubble nearby the floating structure klaseboer et al 2005b employed bem to simulate the underwater explosion bubble dynamics nearby a surface ship however the ship is fixed and the free surface is linearized which ignores the corresponding nonlinear interaction between them xiao et al 2017 investigated the whipping responses of a fluid filled cylindrical shell subjected to underwater explosion using the doubly asymptotic approximation method considering the inner fluid when the ship sailing in the sea it must encounter wave loads which also threats the global strength of the ship if the surface ship subjects the wave loads and the underwater explosion loads at the same time the overlaying effect will imperil the ship strength even more seriously however the relevant studies are rarely published and most of the previous researchers studied the 2 nonlinear progresses separately liu et al 2012 adopted bem and the velocity potential superposition method to investigate the nonlinear interaction between underwater explosion bubble and waves xue et al 2001a 2001b investigated the three dimensional wave wave and wave body interaction with the periodic green s function tanizawa 1995 deduced the acceleration potential method for the nonlinear simulation of 3 dimensional 3d body motion in waves and subsequently koo 2003 established the interaction model between floating body and nonlinear waves with 2d potential numerical wave tank in this paper the interactions between an underwater explosion bubble surface waves and a ship are investigated numerically the paper is organized as following firstly the theoretical and numerical models of the bubble dynamics and fluid structure interaction are presented secondly an experiment is carried out to validate the numerical models then the interaction between the bubble and the ship in still water is simulated and analyzed at last cases in different waves are studied and the influences of the waves are discussed 2 theoretical and numerical model 2 1 bubble dynamics based on bem as shown in fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system is built up with its origin placed at the midship on the free surface x axis pointing to the stern of the ship and z axis pointing upward as for the underwater explosion bubble the surrounding fluid is used to be assumed inviscid and incompressible because of the high reynolds number and the low mach s number for most life time of the bubble cole 1948 klaseboer et al 2005a liu et al 2016b thus there exists a velocity potential ϕ which satisfies the laplace equation 1 2 ϕ 0 taking g 1 p q as the green s function in three dimensional domain we can obtain the boundary integral equation 2 c p ϕ s g p q ϕ q n q g p q n q ϕ q d s where p and q are the field point and the source point respectively s is the boundary of the fluid domain which consists of the free surface s f the bubble surface s b and the wet surface of structure s s n is the unit normal vector pointing into the fluid and c is the solid angle watching the fluid domain from point p the boundary conditions of the fluid field can be expressed as 3 ϕ n v n for the wet surface of the structure and 4 ϕ t p p ρ f 1 2 ϕ 2 g z for the free surface and the bubble surface where v is the structural velocity p is the hydrostatic pressure at the depth where the vertical coordinate z 0 ρ f is the density of the fluid and p is the pressure at the surface particularly p is the atmosphere at the free surface and defined by the adiabatic gas law at the bubble surface 5 p p 0 v 0 v γ where p 0 is the initial pressure of the bubble v 0 and v are the initial and the current volume of the bubble respectively γ is the ratio of specific heats in this paper γ is taken as 1 25 for the explosion products cole 1948 as many previous works have been implemented on the bubble dynamics simulation with bem the initial conditions numerical discretization of eq 2 and the time marching scheme are omitted in this paper and they can be referred to the published articles for detailed mixed eulerian lagrangian method mel implementation best 2002 klaseboer et al 2005a liu et al 2016a wang et al 2003 wu et al 2017 zhang and liu 2015 zhang et al 1998 2 2 decomposition theory of velocity potential in waves in this paper the third order stokes wave theory in deep water is adopted to describe the incident waves the wave amplitude function η w and the incident potential ϕ w can be expressed as 6 η w x t a w cos θ w 1 2 k w a w cos 2 θ w 3 8 k w a w 2 cos 3 θ w o k w a w 4 7 ϕ w x z t a w ω w k w e k w z sin θ w o k w a w 4 where a w is the first order wave amplitude ω w is the circular frequency k w is the wave number θ w x t k w x ω w t ς w ς w is the phase angle and c w is the phase velocity which is expressed as 8 c w ω w k w 1 1 2 k w a w 2 g k w o k w a w 4 then the velocity potential of the fluid can be decomposed as 9 ϕ ϕ w ϕ d where ϕ d is the disturbance potential of the ship and the bubble decaying to 0 at infinity thus ϕ d and its normal derivative satisfies the boundary integral equation considering the incident potential ϕ w is prescribed we can update ϕ d with the modified bernoulli equation 10 ϕ d t p p ρ f 1 2 ϕ 2 g z a w ω w 2 k w e k w z cos θ w where the last term on the right hand represents the effect of the incident potential comparing with the nonlinear numerical wave tank koo and kim 2004 koo 2003 wu and hu 2004 the decomposition method avoids the stability and convergence problems caused by the treatment of the wave maker baffle 2 3 nonlinear fsi model for global responses of ship 2 3 1 calculation of hydrodynamic pressure on body surface the most challenging part in fsi simulation is to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure accurately because it is the connection between the mutual dependent solvers of the fluid and the structure with the potential flow assumption the hydrodynamic pressure on the wet surface of the structure in water can be expressed as 11 p p ρ f ϕ 1 2 ρ f ϕ 2 ρ f g z where ϕ ϕ t is used to be approximated by the differential method however the differential method introduces errors which are amplified with the time increment decreasing and lead to serious instability of the simulation liu et al 2016a ni et al 2013 in this paper the acceleration potential method presented by tanizawa 1995 is adopted to solve this problem avoiding the differential procedure because ϕ is linear to the velocity potential ϕ it also satisfies the boundary integral equation 12 c p ϕ s g p q ϕ q n q g p q n q ϕ q d s ϕ is known for the free surface and the bubble surface at the beginning of each time increment if only ϕ n on the wet surface is known the corresponding ϕ can be obtained by solving eq 12 next we will explain how to determine ϕ n on the wet surface 2 3 2 boundary conditions for body surface as discussed above accurate calculation of ϕ n is essential to solve the fsi problem in this section we re going to deduce the boundary condition on the wet surface following the previous works of van daalen 1993 and tanizawa 1995 for an arbitrary point on the wet surface of the structure in water we have 13 ϕ n ϕ t n d ϕ d t n v ϕ n where d d t is the derivative with respect to time following the material velocity v of the structure the velocity of the fluid and the structure satisfy the following impenetrable condition of the wet surface 14 ϕ n v n taking the material derivative of eq 14 we have 15 d ϕ d t n d v d t n d n d t v ϕ a n d n d t v ϕ where a is the material acceleration of the structure then by substituting eq 15 into eq 13 it can be expressed as 16 ϕ n a n ϑ where ϑ d n d t v ϕ v ϕ n since the whole dynamic system is solved by the time marching scheme such as the runge kutta method only the highest order differential terms of each variable at t are treated as unknown therefore ϕ ϕ and v are known then the second term of ϑ can be calculated in a local coordinate system as shown in fig 2 a local cartesian coordinate system placed at point p with 3 axis determined by τ 1 τ 2 and n which are 2 orthotropic tangent vectors and the normal vector respectively besides let s denote s 1 and s 2 as the arc length coordinates along the body surface at the directions of τ 1 and τ 2 respectively thus we can rewrite the second term of ϑ in the local cartesian coordinates system as 17 v ϕ n v n 2 ϕ n 2 i 1 2 v τ i τ i ϕ n v n i 1 2 2 ϕ τ i 2 i 1 2 v τ i τ i ϕ n each term in eq 17 can be calculated through the differential method by assuming that the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the wet surface are both known which is usually true for the mel method adopted in this paper then the second order differential terms in eq 17 can be calculated with the differential with respect to s i as follows 18 2 ϕ τ i 2 2 ϕ s i 2 κ i ϕ n 19 τ i ϕ n s i ϕ n n s i ϕ s i ϕ n κ i ϕ s i where κ i is the local curvature at the direction of τ i which is positive for a convex surface and negative for a concave surface observing from the fluid then the s terms can be easily calculated by difference the variables on the wet surface substitute eq 18 and eq 19 into eq 17 and we have 20 ϑ d n d t v ϕ v n i 1 2 2 ϕ s i 2 κ i ϕ n i 1 2 v τ i s i ϕ n κ i ϕ s i 2 3 3 mode superposition method for fsi in this paper the structural responses are solved with mode superposition method which is easier to look inside into the mechanism of structure dynamics to reduce the simulation scale the ship is simplified to a hull girder of which the distribution of mass and stiffness correspond to the original ship the simplification is reasonable because only global response and rigid motion are concerned in this paper the structural dynamic equations ignoring the damping effects can be written as 21 m i d i k i d i f i where m and k are the mass and stiffness matrices respectively d and f are the displacement and external nodal force vectors respectively the superscript i 1 2 3 stands for the 3 directions we adopt the mode superposition method to solve eq 21 and the displacement vector is decomposed into k modes 22 d i ψ j i x j ψ i x where ψ j i is the ith order normalized vibration mode vector and x j is the corresponding principal coordinate the convention of summation on repeated indices is adopted here to simplify the equations for instance the subscript j indicates the summation of the expressions of each vibration mode as for a typical slender structure the global response of a surface ship is usually analyzed with the ship hull girder model in this paper the hull girder is discretized into 40 linear beam elements the timoshenko beam element with tapered cross section is adopted to simulate the section change along the length direction then the first 12 vibration modes are extracted with the eigenvalue method in abaqus of which the first 6 modes correspond to the rigid motion in 6 degrees of freedom and the later 6 modes correspond to the first 3 order bending modes in vertical and horizontal directions respectively the 6 dimensionless bending modes are drawn in fig 3 where l is stand for the ship length substituting eq 22 into eq 16 we have 23 ϕ n i 1 3 ψ j i x j n i ϑ similar to the rigid motion decomposition method of koo and kim 2004 the auxiliary function ϕ can also be decomposed corresponding to the structure vibration modes as 24 ϕ ϕ 0 x i ϕ i where ϕ i are the linear parts with respect to the structural motion and ϕ 0 is the residual part each component in eq 24 can be calculated by solving the corresponding boundary integral equation of which the boundary conditions for the free surface and the bubble are 25 ϕ 0 p p 1 2 ρ f ϕ 2 ρ f g z ϕ j 0 j 1 2 k while the boundary conditions of the wet surface of the structure are 26 ϕ 0 n ϑ ϕ j n ψ j i n i j 1 2 k then the hydrodynamic pressure on the wet surface can be expressed as 27 p p ρ f x j ϕ j where 28 p p ρ f ϕ 2 2 ρ f g z ρ f ϕ 0 substitutes eq 22 and eq 27 into eq 21 we have 29 m i ψ i x k i ψ i x t i p j 1 m ρ f t i x j φ j where φ i is the column vector of ϕ i on each node t i is the integral coefficient matrix defined as t l m i s n l n m n i d s representing the linear mapping between the pressure p on the wet surface and the nodal force vector f i and n is the linear shape function on surface mesh element premultiplying eq 29 with the mode matrix ψ i t and take advantage of the orthogonality between the mode matrix ψ and the mass matrix m we can rewrite the equations as 30 m e m a x k e x f a where m e ψ t m ψ and k e ψ t k ψ are the diagonal equivalent mass and stiffness matrixes for the extracted modes respectively f a and m a are the generalized external force and the symmetric added mass matrix defined as 31a f a ψ t p and 31b m a ρ f ψ t t i 1 n x i φ i respectively from eq 30 and eq 31 b we can see that the motions of different modes are no longer independent but coupled together by the added mass matrix by solving eq 30 the fully coupled fluid motion and structural response are calculated at the same time then the free surface and the underwater explosion bubble can be updated with the traditional mel method 2 3 4 double node technique for the intersection of free surface and wet surface in the presented numerical model all the boundary conditions are definite except the intersection line of the free surface and the wet surface the nodes on the intersection line must satisfy both the boundary conditions of the free surface and the wet surface of the ship which leads to the inconsistency that the number of the constrained equations exceeds the number of the unknowns in eq 2 maskew 1993 and wang 2005 developed different methods to solved the problem however their methods either degrade the accuracy or cannot be used in the traditional mel method in this paper we adopt the double node technique presented in liu et al 2016b and expand it into three dimensional model the main idea of the double node technique includes 2 steps in the first step each node on the intersection is split into 2 nodes which are treated as free surface node and wet surface node respectively and have discontinuous normal velocities with the fact that the 2 nodes must share the same spatial position and velocity potential we can further reduce the linear equations constructed for the split nodes to match the numbers of equations to the unknowns the detailed procedure can refer to the published paper liu et al 2016b the second step of the double node technique is to update the position of the intersection nodes reasonably since we have the velocity components in the directions of both the free surface and the wet surface an extra constrain along the tangential direction is introduced to construct the linear equations of the material velocity ϕ i of the intersection node i 32 n f n w r i r j i t ϕ i ϕ n f ϕ n w ϕ i ϕ j i t where i and j are the 2 adjacent nodes on the intersection line n f and n w are the unit normal vectors of the free surface and the wet surface of node i respectively 2 4 time integration and non dimensionalization to achieve unified accuracy in different cases the problem is non dimensonalized with respect to the length scale r m density scale ρ f and pressure scale p where r m is the maximum equivalent radius of the bubble expand spherically with the hydrostatic pressure p then table 1 gives the scales of the other variables with a proper initial condition both structure and fluid motion are advanced explicitly with the runge kutta method to maintain the stability of the fully coupled numerical models the time increment is determined by both the fluid solver and structure solver 33 δ t min δ t f δ t s where t f and t s are the stable time increments determined by the fluid solver and the structure solver respectively t f is determined by the maximum change of the non dimensional velocity potential blake and gibson 1981 and t s is calculated with the maximum structure vibration frequency f max 34 δ t s 1 k s f max where k s is the increment factor taken as 20 in this paper as the description above the numerical fsi model is established following the flow chart in fig 4 2 5 validation of the numerical model to validate the numerical model presented above an experiment is carried out in a circular water tank with a depth of 20m and a diameter of 48m a stiffened cylindrical shell made of q235 steel is submerged at the depth of 10m the 0 5 kg tnt equivalent explosive charge of sr103 is placed at the same depth of the structure and 3m away from its midpoint the thickness of the shell is 2 mm and the diameter is 165mm 8 stiffens are weld evenly to ensure the local transverse strength which is shown in fig 5 the structure is hanged with ropes at the second and the 7th stiffens to locate the submerging depth because the explosive is at the same depth the dynamic responses of the structure is mainly in the horizontal direction so that they re not restricted by the hanging 16 strain gauges are mounted on the structure in the longitudinal direction before the experiment the vibration mode frequency is tested by the hammering method in air which shows that the first and the second order modes frequencies are 27 5 hz and 76 3 hz the frequencies are used to adjust the numerical model to offset the error in the structure machining at the same depth as the explosive a pressure gauge is placed 7m away from the charge to measure the underwater explosion load fig 6 shows the shock pressure caused by the underwater explosion observed by the pressure gauge the first pressure peak is the incident shock wave while the second one is the shockwave reflected by the boundaries of the water tank the pressure peak at about t 0 14s is the first bubble impulse pressure in the numerical model the wet surface of the cylindrical shell and the bubble are discretized into 3950 and 980 triangular elements respectively as shown in fig 7 the structural material is assumed to be linear elastic with a density of 7850 kg m3 an elastic module of 2 01 1011pa and a poisson ratio of 0 3 the hull girder of the cylindrical shell is discretized into 20 linear beam elements the bending modes of the beam are extracted with the lanczos method in abaqus the first 3 order bending modes are drawn in fig 8 and the corresponding frequency are 53 10 hz 87 93 hz and 123 07 hz respectively after the simulation of the motion of the cylindrical shell the longitudinal strain responses ε at the blast side of the shell are calculated with the relation between the beam deflection d and the strain 35 ε 1 2 2 d x 2 θ where θ is the diameter of the cylindrical shell fig 9 shows the comparison between the strain results of the simulation and the experiments at the middle of the cylindrical shell which are drawn with dash line and solid line respectively as we can see from fig 9 the strain history is dominated by the first order bending motion of which the frequency is about 11 1 hz submerged in the water initially the structure starts whipping due to the rapid expansion of the bubble even if the shockwave is significant to the structure damage it mostly causes the high frequency local responses which are not concerned in the global strength evaluation of ship structure compared with the experimental results the simulation results are smoother which indicates the numerical model fails to capture the high frequency local responses due to the absence of the high order modes in the hull girder model however the simulation results agree well with the experimental ones in the low frequency responses at t 0 136s the first bubble pulsation loads acts on the structure because of the disaccord between the directions of the structure motion and the loads the motion direction is altered which is shown as the second strain peak in fig 9 3 interaction between bubble and ship in still water with the new fsi model presented above a case in still water is simulated to study the nonlinear interaction between the underwater explosion bubble and the surface ship in still water the weight of the explosive is 500 kg detonated 15m beneath the free surface and 18 35m away from the center plane of the ship about twice of the maximum bubble radius of 9 17m 3 1 discretization of field boundaries as shown in fig 10 all the boundaries including the bubble the free surface and the wet surface of the ship are discretized into unstructured linear triangle elements the free surface and the wet surface of the ship are discretized into 4500 and 1300 elements respectively because of the motion of the waterline the mesh on the wet surface must slide accordingly to maintain the mesh quality we adopt the density potential method dpm to achieve this goal zhang and liu 2015 in each time increment the nodes on the wet surface are advanced with the following iterative algorithm 36 r 0 r v δ t 37 r i 1 r i k s φ r i where the superscript i indicates that it s the result of the ith iteration k is the iteration step size s n n is the gradient operator within the tangential plane φ is the density potential defined as 38 φ i j 1 n element a i j with a i j is the area of element j adjoining to node i the dpm procedure can advance the mesh nodes to achieve the uniformity of the mesh along with the changing of the waterline to avoid the offset of the wet surface nodes from the ship hull caused by the accumulated error of the dpm we project the wet surface nodes to the ship hull at each time increment after using the dpm 39 r i r i n near s 0 r i r near s 0 n near s 0 where s 0 is the surface of the ship hull n near s 0 and r near s 0 are the unit normal vector and the nodal coordinates of the node on s 0 which is nearest to node i on the wet surface 3 2 dynamics of bubble and free surface in this case the dynamics of the bubble and the free surface at several typical moments are shown in fig 11 in which the color contour represents the dimensionless velocity potential at the very first time the bubble is generated in still water and subsequently starts expanding during the expansion the free surface above the bubble is pushed to develop a huge spike beside the ship due to the big bubble size the effects of gravity are remarkable which promote the bubble to develop a high speed liquid jet at the bottom of the bubble the bubble is penetrated by the jet at t 1 75 because of the gravity the spike height only reached 0 33m when the bubble achieved its maximum volume as shown in fig 12 during the collapsing phase of the bubble the spike doesn t emerge higher but starts dropping down due to the buoyancy and the attraction of the bubble when the bubble rebound to its maximum volume at t 2 10 the free surface is pushed even higher than that at t 0 87 because of a smaller distance between the bubble and the free surface however the spike is much smaller than that during the first period of the bubble which is caused by the energy loss of the bubble because of the obstruction of the ship the bubble can hardly affect the free surface on the portside of the ship however the motion of the ship subjected to the bubble load cause that the free surface on the portside of the ship deforms obviously during the simulation similarly the vertical motion of the free surface nearby the bow and the stern is conducted by the vertical global responses of the ship 3 3 global responses of ship the whipping responses of the ship are studied in this section by analyzing the principle displacements of the bending modes fig 13 and fig 14 demonstrate the changes of the generalized forces and the principal coordinates along with time for the first 2 bending modes respectively because of the still water moment caused by the difference between the longitudinal distributions of the buoyancy and the gravity the principal coordinate of the first order vertical bending mode starts from 0 08 at t 0 which indicates that the ship is hogging slightly at the beginning of the simulation subsequently the initial bubble with highly suppressed inner gas radiates bubble pulsation load because the incident load is decaying with the distance from the bubble the peak pressure locates at the midship and decreases along to the stern and the bow of which the longitudinal distribution is similar to the first order bending mode thus the first order generalized force is much greater than the other 2 order modes due to the ghost reflection effects of the free surface on the wet surface the hydrodynamic pressure of shipboard is so small resulting in that the resultant force in the horizontal direction is much smaller than that in the vertical direction the fact leads to a phenomenon that the vertical global response of the surface ship is usually much serious than the horizontal one even if the bubble is broadside of the ship premultiplied by the mode shape matrix the principal coordinate vector can be transformed into the global cartier coordinate system to acquire the real deflection of each node on the ship hull girder fig 15 and fig 16 show the change of the vertical displacement of the hull girder along with time respectively in which the vertical axis represents the longitudinal location on the hull girder 0 5 l representing the ship stern and 0 5 l representing the ship bow from the results we can see that the bending responses of the hull girder is dominated by the first order bending mode both in vertical and horizontal direction which consists with that the first order principal force is largest the bending center of the hull girder deviates to the stern because of the nonuniformity of the mass and stiffness distribution thus the measure transverse section should also deviate from midship section to the stern during the longitudinal strength evaluation besides rigid motion obviously appears in both vertical and horizontal displacements because of the restoring force of the balance between buoyancy and gravity the upward rigid motion soon decreases while the horizontal rigid motion keeps growing without the restoring force fig 17 and fig 18 show the changes of the generalized added mass along with time in the vertical and horizontal direction which are token from the diagonal elements of the added mass matrixes each added mass is nondimensionalized with respect to its initial value when the explosive detonates in the water there re 2 factors affecting the added mass of the ship on the one hand the bubble expands immediately which pushes the water away from the ship and decreases the added mass on the other hand the bubble lifts the free surface so that the draft of the ship increases which increases the added mass of the ship the balance between the 2 factors leads to the change of the added mass in the simulation as for the second factor the vertical bending generalized added mass is less sensible compared with the vertical one because the vertical bending added mass is mostly determined by the shape of the waterline while the horizontal one depends on the draft thus the maximum change of the horizontal bending added mass is about 50 which is much greater than the 9 of the change of the vertical one 4 interaction between bubble and ship in waves when surface ship encounters wave in the sea either the wave amplitude or the relative position of the ship is quite random to acquire a conservative result the most dangerous case used to be taken as the evaluating case therefore we take the wavelength equaling to the ship length and the ship locating right on the wave crest or in the wave trough which always generates the biggest bending moment considering bem can hardly the nonlinearity caused by the ship bottom break out from the water when the amplitude of the wave is high enough we only simulate the cases with limited wave amplitude taken as λ w 100 at the same time the phase angle ζ w is chosen as π and 0 representing the cases of wave crest and trough respectively which are the most threatening situations for the global strength of the ship as shown in fig 19 4 1 influences of waves on free surface firstly the case with ζ w π is simulated in which the ship locates in the wave trough and is sagging initially the motion of the free surface is shown in fig 20 where the color contour represents the vertical displacement of the free surface and the wave travels from the ship bow to the stern when the bubble archives its maximum volume a spike emerges on the free surface above the bubble as high as 0 19 0 36 higher than the free surface of the trough of the wave because of the smaller distance from the bubble to the free surface the spike is 0 29 higher than that in the still water case due to the incident wave effect the bubble is no longer locates in beneath the wave trough any more along with the time marching which leads to the asymmetric evolution of the free surface near the midship section subjected to the gravity and the attraction of the collapsing bubble the spike on the free surface fades away when the bubble collapses to its minimum volume as shown in fig 20 c the ship whips because of the bubble load and disturbs the free surface near the bow and the stern when the bubble rebounds at t 2 1 a smaller spike emerges at the free surface fig 21 shows vertical displacement of the free surface in the case with ζ w 0 representing the ship locates on the wave crest similar to the prior case the wave propagates from the bow to the stern even though the bubble starts expanding at the same location the distance to the free surface is longer which generates a wider but lower spike on the free surface as shown in fig 21 b the collapse and the rebound of the bubble are shown in c and d respectively the ship whips subjected to the hydrodynamic load and its motion disturbs the free surface near the ship hull 4 2 influences of waves on added mass as discussed before the change of the added mass of the ship will affect the responses of the structure thus we compared the added mass of the ship in waves with that in still water by analyzing the change of the added mass nondimensionalized by the added mass in still water along with time fig 22 and fig 23 show the vertical and horizontal bending generalized added mass of the case with the ship locating in the trough the draft at the bow and the stern is greater than that of the still water while the draft at the midship is smaller which consist with the bending mode shapes both in vertical and horizontal directions thus the added mass increases initially for both of the vertical and horizontal bending modes the horizontal added mass increases by about 19 greater than 5 of the vertical one because it s more sensitive to the draft during the subsequent interaction with the bubble the change of the added mass along with time is similar to the still water case the added mass of the first order horizontal bending mode increases by 75 when the bubble start rebounding at t 2 2 and the vertical one increases by 20 both is greater than that in the still water case in contrast the vertical and horizontal bending generalized added mass of the case with the ship locating in on the crest are shown in fig 24 and fig 25 respectively the draft near the midship is greater than that near the bow and the stern initially which is opposite to the distribution of the first order vertical bending mode shape thus the vertical and horizontal bending added masses are 4 greater than that in the still water moreover the diminution of the second order vertical bending added mass is 7 of that in the still water while the second and the third order horizontal bending added masses changes little during the interaction between the ship and the underwater explosion bubble the changes of the added mass are similar to those of the still water case and the maximum changes of the vertical and the horizontal bending added masses are by 10 and 48 respectively in conclusion the changes of the added masses due to the waves are small and will lead to finite effects on the subsequent responses of the ship during the interactions the change trend of the added masses is similar to that of the case in still water but the studies presented in this paper limit the wave amplitude to ensure that the bottom of the ship wouldn t exceed water otherwise the impact process during the reenter of the ship into the water is crucial for the responses of the ship 4 3 influences of waves on global response of ship because the first order bending motion dominates the global response of the ship in both horizontal and vertical directions only the first order bending motion is analyzed in this section fig 26 and fig 27 show the comparison between the vertical and horizontal generalized forces with different incident waves respectively the existence of the waves changes both the amplitude and the time of the secondary pulsation load due to the bubble the real initial depth of the bubble in waves is altered due to the deformation of the free surface so the bubble period below the wave trough is smaller than that in still water due to a smaller distance from the free surface while it s bigger below the crest then the vertical and horizontal generalized displacements in waves with different initial phases are compared with those in still water in fig 28 and fig 29 respectively the ship is bended by the still water moment and the wave moment so that the vertical generalized displacements are 0 14 and 0 02 respectively which indicates the components of the wave effect are 0 06 less than that of the still water moment the waves with the phases difference of π are equivalent to those with the opposite amplitudes during the subsequent interaction between the bubble and the ship the effect of the waves is not linear correlated with the wave amplitude as for the vertical bending responses the changes of the added masses are so small that the bending periods are not much different but the maximum deflection of the girder locating at the crest is 0 015 than that in still water while the girder locating at the trough changes little for the horizontal displacements the changes of the added masses affect the period of the global responses so that the case of the ship in the crest with the smallest added masses archives its second extremum earliest the effects are amplified in the following interactions and change both the third extremums and the corresponding time nonlinearly because the wave length is always taken as the ship length during the global strength evaluation we only analyze the influence of the wave amplitude so we simulate several cases with different wave amplitudes the first 3 extremums change along with the wave amplitudes are drawn in fig 30 and fig 31 we can see that the extremums of the generalized displacements are not linear correlated with the wave amplitude for the first extremum right after the explosive explosion the nonlinearity is small because the wave hasn t prorogated too far and the added mass hasn t change too much however great nonlinearity is shown in for the second and the third extremums thus the traditional superposition method for the joint effect of the underwater explosion bubble and the waves can t estimate the responses of the ship accurately because it ignores the nonlinearity 5 conclusion in this paper the interaction model between the underwater explosion bubble the surface waves and the ship is established considering the nonlinear coupling after the validation of the numerical model by comparing with the experimental results several cases in still water and different waves are simulated to investigate the global responses of the ship subjected to underwater explosion bubble load through the simulation results we found that the influences of the waves on the global responses of the ship in the following 3 aspects firstly the waves change the longitudinal distribution of the draft of the ship which leads to an initial wave moment existing the whole interaction period superimposed with the dynamic inner moment caused by the underwater explosion bubble it threats the global strength of the ship secondly because of the inclined free surface and the incident wave pressure field the bubble dynamics and the corresponding bubble load are changed thirdly the waves change the added masses of the ship and then affect the global responses among the 3 factors above only the first one is nearly linear thus the relationship between the waves and the global responses shows noteworthy nonlinearity under their joint influences which indicates that the traditional superposition methods based on linear theory can t estimate the global strength of the ship accurately acknowledgements

keywords bubble dynamics underwater explosion fluid structure interaction global response waves 1 introduction shock responses of structure in water subjected to underwater explosion loads have always been the concern of researchers all over the world brett et al 2000 cole 1948 cui et al 2016 geers and hunter 2002 hung and hwangfu 2010 klaseboer et al 2005a wang 2013 xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011b 2014 2016 2017a the interaction between the fluid and the structure is highly nonlinear especially considering the free surface effect global strength is one of the most important aspects in ship strength evaluation as a typical slender structure the ship hull can be bended or twisted as a beam subject to the loads distributing uneven along the longitudinal direction of the ship when the bending moment at the ship hull section exceeds the ultimate moment longitudinal structural parts will fail and leads to the loose of the global strength underwater explosion bubble load is one of the most threatening load that a ship may encounter brett and yiannakopolous 2008 chen et al 2009 cole 1948 hung and hwangfu 2010 klaseboer et al 2005a liu et al 2014 wang and khoo 2004 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 2014 2016 2017b due to the low frequency feature of the bubble oscillation load which can be close to the frequency of the low order vibration modes of the ship resonance effects may lead to serious global response of the ship and threaten its global strength chen et al 2009 hicks 1986 wilkerson 1985 xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2011a 2014 many of the traditional researchers used spherical underwater explosion bubble model to predict the whipping response of ships steller 1983 studied the damping factors in the whipping responses of the submarine subject to an underwater explosion loading hicks 1986 simulated the whipping responses of the surface ship caused by underwater explosion kwon and cunningham 1998 analyzed the difference between several simplification method of the stiffened cylindrical shell subject to underwater explosion researches above used the spherical bubble dynamics model ignoring the effects of the its deformation and nonlinear interaction with boundaries if the explosion was far enough from the ship the error is negligible for the surface ship the effects of the free surface must be considered zhang zong analyzed the whipping responses of the surface ship subject to the bubble load adopting the spherical bubble model and the linearized free surface condition zhang and zong 2011 zhang et al 2014 as for the nonspherical motion of the underwater explosion bubble nearby the floating structure klaseboer et al 2005b employed bem to simulate the underwater explosion bubble dynamics nearby a surface ship however the ship is fixed and the free surface is linearized which ignores the corresponding nonlinear interaction between them xiao et al 2017 investigated the whipping responses of a fluid filled cylindrical shell subjected to underwater explosion using the doubly asymptotic approximation method considering the inner fluid when the ship sailing in the sea it must encounter wave loads which also threats the global strength of the ship if the surface ship subjects the wave loads and the underwater explosion loads at the same time the overlaying effect will imperil the ship strength even more seriously however the relevant studies are rarely published and most of the previous researchers studied the 2 nonlinear progresses separately liu et al 2012 adopted bem and the velocity potential superposition method to investigate the nonlinear interaction between underwater explosion bubble and waves xue et al 2001a 2001b investigated the three dimensional wave wave and wave body interaction with the periodic green s function tanizawa 1995 deduced the acceleration potential method for the nonlinear simulation of 3 dimensional 3d body motion in waves and subsequently koo 2003 established the interaction model between floating body and nonlinear waves with 2d potential numerical wave tank in this paper the interactions between an underwater explosion bubble surface waves and a ship are investigated numerically the paper is organized as following firstly the theoretical and numerical models of the bubble dynamics and fluid structure interaction are presented secondly an experiment is carried out to validate the numerical models then the interaction between the bubble and the ship in still water is simulated and analyzed at last cases in different waves are studied and the influences of the waves are discussed 2 theoretical and numerical model 2 1 bubble dynamics based on bem as shown in fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system is built up with its origin placed at the midship on the free surface x axis pointing to the stern of the ship and z axis pointing upward as for the underwater explosion bubble the surrounding fluid is used to be assumed inviscid and incompressible because of the high reynolds number and the low mach s number for most life time of the bubble cole 1948 klaseboer et al 2005a liu et al 2016b thus there exists a velocity potential ϕ which satisfies the laplace equation 1 2 ϕ 0 taking g 1 p q as the green s function in three dimensional domain we can obtain the boundary integral equation 2 c p ϕ s g p q ϕ q n q g p q n q ϕ q d s where p and q are the field point and the source point respectively s is the boundary of the fluid domain which consists of the free surface s f the bubble surface s b and the wet surface of structure s s n is the unit normal vector pointing into the fluid and c is the solid angle watching the fluid domain from point p the boundary conditions of the fluid field can be expressed as 3 ϕ n v n for the wet surface of the structure and 4 ϕ t p p ρ f 1 2 ϕ 2 g z for the free surface and the bubble surface where v is the structural velocity p is the hydrostatic pressure at the depth where the vertical coordinate z 0 ρ f is the density of the fluid and p is the pressure at the surface particularly p is the atmosphere at the free surface and defined by the adiabatic gas law at the bubble surface 5 p p 0 v 0 v γ where p 0 is the initial pressure of the bubble v 0 and v are the initial and the current volume of the bubble respectively γ is the ratio of specific heats in this paper γ is taken as 1 25 for the explosion products cole 1948 as many previous works have been implemented on the bubble dynamics simulation with bem the initial conditions numerical discretization of eq 2 and the time marching scheme are omitted in this paper and they can be referred to the published articles for detailed mixed eulerian lagrangian method mel implementation best 2002 klaseboer et al 2005a liu et al 2016a wang et al 2003 wu et al 2017 zhang and liu 2015 zhang et al 1998 2 2 decomposition theory of velocity potential in waves in this paper the third order stokes wave theory in deep water is adopted to describe the incident waves the wave amplitude function η w and the incident potential ϕ w can be expressed as 6 η w x t a w cos θ w 1 2 k w a w cos 2 θ w 3 8 k w a w 2 cos 3 θ w o k w a w 4 7 ϕ w x z t a w ω w k w e k w z sin θ w o k w a w 4 where a w is the first order wave amplitude ω w is the circular frequency k w is the wave number θ w x t k w x ω w t ς w ς w is the phase angle and c w is the phase velocity which is expressed as 8 c w ω w k w 1 1 2 k w a w 2 g k w o k w a w 4 then the velocity potential of the fluid can be decomposed as 9 ϕ ϕ w ϕ d where ϕ d is the disturbance potential of the ship and the bubble decaying to 0 at infinity thus ϕ d and its normal derivative satisfies the boundary integral equation considering the incident potential ϕ w is prescribed we can update ϕ d with the modified bernoulli equation 10 ϕ d t p p ρ f 1 2 ϕ 2 g z a w ω w 2 k w e k w z cos θ w where the last term on the right hand represents the effect of the incident potential comparing with the nonlinear numerical wave tank koo and kim 2004 koo 2003 wu and hu 2004 the decomposition method avoids the stability and convergence problems caused by the treatment of the wave maker baffle 2 3 nonlinear fsi model for global responses of ship 2 3 1 calculation of hydrodynamic pressure on body surface the most challenging part in fsi simulation is to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure accurately because it is the connection between the mutual dependent solvers of the fluid and the structure with the potential flow assumption the hydrodynamic pressure on the wet surface of the structure in water can be expressed as 11 p p ρ f ϕ 1 2 ρ f ϕ 2 ρ f g z where ϕ ϕ t is used to be approximated by the differential method however the differential method introduces errors which are amplified with the time increment decreasing and lead to serious instability of the simulation liu et al 2016a ni et al 2013 in this paper the acceleration potential method presented by tanizawa 1995 is adopted to solve this problem avoiding the differential procedure because ϕ is linear to the velocity potential ϕ it also satisfies the boundary integral equation 12 c p ϕ s g p q ϕ q n q g p q n q ϕ q d s ϕ is known for the free surface and the bubble surface at the beginning of each time increment if only ϕ n on the wet surface is known the corresponding ϕ can be obtained by solving eq 12 next we will explain how to determine ϕ n on the wet surface 2 3 2 boundary conditions for body surface as discussed above accurate calculation of ϕ n is essential to solve the fsi problem in this section we re going to deduce the boundary condition on the wet surface following the previous works of van daalen 1993 and tanizawa 1995 for an arbitrary point on the wet surface of the structure in water we have 13 ϕ n ϕ t n d ϕ d t n v ϕ n where d d t is the derivative with respect to time following the material velocity v of the structure the velocity of the fluid and the structure satisfy the following impenetrable condition of the wet surface 14 ϕ n v n taking the material derivative of eq 14 we have 15 d ϕ d t n d v d t n d n d t v ϕ a n d n d t v ϕ where a is the material acceleration of the structure then by substituting eq 15 into eq 13 it can be expressed as 16 ϕ n a n ϑ where ϑ d n d t v ϕ v ϕ n since the whole dynamic system is solved by the time marching scheme such as the runge kutta method only the highest order differential terms of each variable at t are treated as unknown therefore ϕ ϕ and v are known then the second term of ϑ can be calculated in a local coordinate system as shown in fig 2 a local cartesian coordinate system placed at point p with 3 axis determined by τ 1 τ 2 and n which are 2 orthotropic tangent vectors and the normal vector respectively besides let s denote s 1 and s 2 as the arc length coordinates along the body surface at the directions of τ 1 and τ 2 respectively thus we can rewrite the second term of ϑ in the local cartesian coordinates system as 17 v ϕ n v n 2 ϕ n 2 i 1 2 v τ i τ i ϕ n v n i 1 2 2 ϕ τ i 2 i 1 2 v τ i τ i ϕ n each term in eq 17 can be calculated through the differential method by assuming that the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the wet surface are both known which is usually true for the mel method adopted in this paper then the second order differential terms in eq 17 can be calculated with the differential with respect to s i as follows 18 2 ϕ τ i 2 2 ϕ s i 2 κ i ϕ n 19 τ i ϕ n s i ϕ n n s i ϕ s i ϕ n κ i ϕ s i where κ i is the local curvature at the direction of τ i which is positive for a convex surface and negative for a concave surface observing from the fluid then the s terms can be easily calculated by difference the variables on the wet surface substitute eq 18 and eq 19 into eq 17 and we have 20 ϑ d n d t v ϕ v n i 1 2 2 ϕ s i 2 κ i ϕ n i 1 2 v τ i s i ϕ n κ i ϕ s i 2 3 3 mode superposition method for fsi in this paper the structural responses are solved with mode superposition method which is easier to look inside into the mechanism of structure dynamics to reduce the simulation scale the ship is simplified to a hull girder of which the distribution of mass and stiffness correspond to the original ship the simplification is reasonable because only global response and rigid motion are concerned in this paper the structural dynamic equations ignoring the damping effects can be written as 21 m i d i k i d i f i where m and k are the mass and stiffness matrices respectively d and f are the displacement and external nodal force vectors respectively the superscript i 1 2 3 stands for the 3 directions we adopt the mode superposition method to solve eq 21 and the displacement vector is decomposed into k modes 22 d i ψ j i x j ψ i x where ψ j i is the ith order normalized vibration mode vector and x j is the corresponding principal coordinate the convention of summation on repeated indices is adopted here to simplify the equations for instance the subscript j indicates the summation of the expressions of each vibration mode as for a typical slender structure the global response of a surface ship is usually analyzed with the ship hull girder model in this paper the hull girder is discretized into 40 linear beam elements the timoshenko beam element with tapered cross section is adopted to simulate the section change along the length direction then the first 12 vibration modes are extracted with the eigenvalue method in abaqus of which the first 6 modes correspond to the rigid motion in 6 degrees of freedom and the later 6 modes correspond to the first 3 order bending modes in vertical and horizontal directions respectively the 6 dimensionless bending modes are drawn in fig 3 where l is stand for the ship length substituting eq 22 into eq 16 we have 23 ϕ n i 1 3 ψ j i x j n i ϑ similar to the rigid motion decomposition method of koo and kim 2004 the auxiliary function ϕ can also be decomposed corresponding to the structure vibration modes as 24 ϕ ϕ 0 x i ϕ i where ϕ i are the linear parts with respect to the structural motion and ϕ 0 is the residual part each component in eq 24 can be calculated by solving the corresponding boundary integral equation of which the boundary conditions for the free surface and the bubble are 25 ϕ 0 p p 1 2 ρ f ϕ 2 ρ f g z ϕ j 0 j 1 2 k while the boundary conditions of the wet surface of the structure are 26 ϕ 0 n ϑ ϕ j n ψ j i n i j 1 2 k then the hydrodynamic pressure on the wet surface can be expressed as 27 p p ρ f x j ϕ j where 28 p p ρ f ϕ 2 2 ρ f g z ρ f ϕ 0 substitutes eq 22 and eq 27 into eq 21 we have 29 m i ψ i x k i ψ i x t i p j 1 m ρ f t i x j φ j where φ i is the column vector of ϕ i on each node t i is the integral coefficient matrix defined as t l m i s n l n m n i d s representing the linear mapping between the pressure p on the wet surface and the nodal force vector f i and n is the linear shape function on surface mesh element premultiplying eq 29 with the mode matrix ψ i t and take advantage of the orthogonality between the mode matrix ψ and the mass matrix m we can rewrite the equations as 30 m e m a x k e x f a where m e ψ t m ψ and k e ψ t k ψ are the diagonal equivalent mass and stiffness matrixes for the extracted modes respectively f a and m a are the generalized external force and the symmetric added mass matrix defined as 31a f a ψ t p and 31b m a ρ f ψ t t i 1 n x i φ i respectively from eq 30 and eq 31 b we can see that the motions of different modes are no longer independent but coupled together by the added mass matrix by solving eq 30 the fully coupled fluid motion and structural response are calculated at the same time then the free surface and the underwater explosion bubble can be updated with the traditional mel method 2 3 4 double node technique for the intersection of free surface and wet surface in the presented numerical model all the boundary conditions are definite except the intersection line of the free surface and the wet surface the nodes on the intersection line must satisfy both the boundary conditions of the free surface and the wet surface of the ship which leads to the inconsistency that the number of the constrained equations exceeds the number of the unknowns in eq 2 maskew 1993 and wang 2005 developed different methods to solved the problem however their methods either degrade the accuracy or cannot be used in the traditional mel method in this paper we adopt the double node technique presented in liu et al 2016b and expand it into three dimensional model the main idea of the double node technique includes 2 steps in the first step each node on the intersection is split into 2 nodes which are treated as free surface node and wet surface node respectively and have discontinuous normal velocities with the fact that the 2 nodes must share the same spatial position and velocity potential we can further reduce the linear equations constructed for the split nodes to match the numbers of equations to the unknowns the detailed procedure can refer to the published paper liu et al 2016b the second step of the double node technique is to update the position of the intersection nodes reasonably since we have the velocity components in the directions of both the free surface and the wet surface an extra constrain along the tangential direction is introduced to construct the linear equations of the material velocity ϕ i of the intersection node i 32 n f n w r i r j i t ϕ i ϕ n f ϕ n w ϕ i ϕ j i t where i and j are the 2 adjacent nodes on the intersection line n f and n w are the unit normal vectors of the free surface and the wet surface of node i respectively 2 4 time integration and non dimensionalization to achieve unified accuracy in different cases the problem is non dimensonalized with respect to the length scale r m density scale ρ f and pressure scale p where r m is the maximum equivalent radius of the bubble expand spherically with the hydrostatic pressure p then table 1 gives the scales of the other variables with a proper initial condition both structure and fluid motion are advanced explicitly with the runge kutta method to maintain the stability of the fully coupled numerical models the time increment is determined by both the fluid solver and structure solver 33 δ t min δ t f δ t s where t f and t s are the stable time increments determined by the fluid solver and the structure solver respectively t f is determined by the maximum change of the non dimensional velocity potential blake and gibson 1981 and t s is calculated with the maximum structure vibration frequency f max 34 δ t s 1 k s f max where k s is the increment factor taken as 20 in this paper as the description above the numerical fsi model is established following the flow chart in fig 4 2 5 validation of the numerical model to validate the numerical model presented above an experiment is carried out in a circular water tank with a depth of 20m and a diameter of 48m a stiffened cylindrical shell made of q235 steel is submerged at the depth of 10m the 0 5 kg tnt equivalent explosive charge of sr103 is placed at the same depth of the structure and 3m away from its midpoint the thickness of the shell is 2 mm and the diameter is 165mm 8 stiffens are weld evenly to ensure the local transverse strength which is shown in fig 5 the structure is hanged with ropes at the second and the 7th stiffens to locate the submerging depth because the explosive is at the same depth the dynamic responses of the structure is mainly in the horizontal direction so that they re not restricted by the hanging 16 strain gauges are mounted on the structure in the longitudinal direction before the experiment the vibration mode frequency is tested by the hammering method in air which shows that the first and the second order modes frequencies are 27 5 hz and 76 3 hz the frequencies are used to adjust the numerical model to offset the error in the structure machining at the same depth as the explosive a pressure gauge is placed 7m away from the charge to measure the underwater explosion load fig 6 shows the shock pressure caused by the underwater explosion observed by the pressure gauge the first pressure peak is the incident shock wave while the second one is the shockwave reflected by the boundaries of the water tank the pressure peak at about t 0 14s is the first bubble impulse pressure in the numerical model the wet surface of the cylindrical shell and the bubble are discretized into 3950 and 980 triangular elements respectively as shown in fig 7 the structural material is assumed to be linear elastic with a density of 7850 kg m3 an elastic module of 2 01 1011pa and a poisson ratio of 0 3 the hull girder of the cylindrical shell is discretized into 20 linear beam elements the bending modes of the beam are extracted with the lanczos method in abaqus the first 3 order bending modes are drawn in fig 8 and the corresponding frequency are 53 10 hz 87 93 hz and 123 07 hz respectively after the simulation of the motion of the cylindrical shell the longitudinal strain responses ε at the blast side of the shell are calculated with the relation between the beam deflection d and the strain 35 ε 1 2 2 d x 2 θ where θ is the diameter of the cylindrical shell fig 9 shows the comparison between the strain results of the simulation and the experiments at the middle of the cylindrical shell which are drawn with dash line and solid line respectively as we can see from fig 9 the strain history is dominated by the first order bending motion of which the frequency is about 11 1 hz submerged in the water initially the structure starts whipping due to the rapid expansion of the bubble even if the shockwave is significant to the structure damage it mostly causes the high frequency local responses which are not concerned in the global strength evaluation of ship structure compared with the experimental results the simulation results are smoother which indicates the numerical model fails to capture the high frequency local responses due to the absence of the high order modes in the hull girder model however the simulation results agree well with the experimental ones in the low frequency responses at t 0 136s the first bubble pulsation loads acts on the structure because of the disaccord between the directions of the structure motion and the loads the motion direction is altered which is shown as the second strain peak in fig 9 3 interaction between bubble and ship in still water with the new fsi model presented above a case in still water is simulated to study the nonlinear interaction between the underwater explosion bubble and the surface ship in still water the weight of the explosive is 500 kg detonated 15m beneath the free surface and 18 35m away from the center plane of the ship about twice of the maximum bubble radius of 9 17m 3 1 discretization of field boundaries as shown in fig 10 all the boundaries including the bubble the free surface and the wet surface of the ship are discretized into unstructured linear triangle elements the free surface and the wet surface of the ship are discretized into 4500 and 1300 elements respectively because of the motion of the waterline the mesh on the wet surface must slide accordingly to maintain the mesh quality we adopt the density potential method dpm to achieve this goal zhang and liu 2015 in each time increment the nodes on the wet surface are advanced with the following iterative algorithm 36 r 0 r v δ t 37 r i 1 r i k s φ r i where the superscript i indicates that it s the result of the ith iteration k is the iteration step size s n n is the gradient operator within the tangential plane φ is the density potential defined as 38 φ i j 1 n element a i j with a i j is the area of element j adjoining to node i the dpm procedure can advance the mesh nodes to achieve the uniformity of the mesh along with the changing of the waterline to avoid the offset of the wet surface nodes from the ship hull caused by the accumulated error of the dpm we project the wet surface nodes to the ship hull at each time increment after using the dpm 39 r i r i n near s 0 r i r near s 0 n near s 0 where s 0 is the surface of the ship hull n near s 0 and r near s 0 are the unit normal vector and the nodal coordinates of the node on s 0 which is nearest to node i on the wet surface 3 2 dynamics of bubble and free surface in this case the dynamics of the bubble and the free surface at several typical moments are shown in fig 11 in which the color contour represents the dimensionless velocity potential at the very first time the bubble is generated in still water and subsequently starts expanding during the expansion the free surface above the bubble is pushed to develop a huge spike beside the ship due to the big bubble size the effects of gravity are remarkable which promote the bubble to develop a high speed liquid jet at the bottom of the bubble the bubble is penetrated by the jet at t 1 75 because of the gravity the spike height only reached 0 33m when the bubble achieved its maximum volume as shown in fig 12 during the collapsing phase of the bubble the spike doesn t emerge higher but starts dropping down due to the buoyancy and the attraction of the bubble when the bubble rebound to its maximum volume at t 2 10 the free surface is pushed even higher than that at t 0 87 because of a smaller distance between the bubble and the free surface however the spike is much smaller than that during the first period of the bubble which is caused by the energy loss of the bubble because of the obstruction of the ship the bubble can hardly affect the free surface on the portside of the ship however the motion of the ship subjected to the bubble load cause that the free surface on the portside of the ship deforms obviously during the simulation similarly the vertical motion of the free surface nearby the bow and the stern is conducted by the vertical global responses of the ship 3 3 global responses of ship the whipping responses of the ship are studied in this section by analyzing the principle displacements of the bending modes fig 13 and fig 14 demonstrate the changes of the generalized forces and the principal coordinates along with time for the first 2 bending modes respectively because of the still water moment caused by the difference between the longitudinal distributions of the buoyancy and the gravity the principal coordinate of the first order vertical bending mode starts from 0 08 at t 0 which indicates that the ship is hogging slightly at the beginning of the simulation subsequently the initial bubble with highly suppressed inner gas radiates bubble pulsation load because the incident load is decaying with the distance from the bubble the peak pressure locates at the midship and decreases along to the stern and the bow of which the longitudinal distribution is similar to the first order bending mode thus the first order generalized force is much greater than the other 2 order modes due to the ghost reflection effects of the free surface on the wet surface the hydrodynamic pressure of shipboard is so small resulting in that the resultant force in the horizontal direction is much smaller than that in the vertical direction the fact leads to a phenomenon that the vertical global response of the surface ship is usually much serious than the horizontal one even if the bubble is broadside of the ship premultiplied by the mode shape matrix the principal coordinate vector can be transformed into the global cartier coordinate system to acquire the real deflection of each node on the ship hull girder fig 15 and fig 16 show the change of the vertical displacement of the hull girder along with time respectively in which the vertical axis represents the longitudinal location on the hull girder 0 5 l representing the ship stern and 0 5 l representing the ship bow from the results we can see that the bending responses of the hull girder is dominated by the first order bending mode both in vertical and horizontal direction which consists with that the first order principal force is largest the bending center of the hull girder deviates to the stern because of the nonuniformity of the mass and stiffness distribution thus the measure transverse section should also deviate from midship section to the stern during the longitudinal strength evaluation besides rigid motion obviously appears in both vertical and horizontal displacements because of the restoring force of the balance between buoyancy and gravity the upward rigid motion soon decreases while the horizontal rigid motion keeps growing without the restoring force fig 17 and fig 18 show the changes of the generalized added mass along with time in the vertical and horizontal direction which are token from the diagonal elements of the added mass matrixes each added mass is nondimensionalized with respect to its initial value when the explosive detonates in the water there re 2 factors affecting the added mass of the ship on the one hand the bubble expands immediately which pushes the water away from the ship and decreases the added mass on the other hand the bubble lifts the free surface so that the draft of the ship increases which increases the added mass of the ship the balance between the 2 factors leads to the change of the added mass in the simulation as for the second factor the vertical bending generalized added mass is less sensible compared with the vertical one because the vertical bending added mass is mostly determined by the shape of the waterline while the horizontal one depends on the draft thus the maximum change of the horizontal bending added mass is about 50 which is much greater than the 9 of the change of the vertical one 4 interaction between bubble and ship in waves when surface ship encounters wave in the sea either the wave amplitude or the relative position of the ship is quite random to acquire a conservative result the most dangerous case used to be taken as the evaluating case therefore we take the wavelength equaling to the ship length and the ship locating right on the wave crest or in the wave trough which always generates the biggest bending moment considering bem can hardly the nonlinearity caused by the ship bottom break out from the water when the amplitude of the wave is high enough we only simulate the cases with limited wave amplitude taken as λ w 100 at the same time the phase angle ζ w is chosen as π and 0 representing the cases of wave crest and trough respectively which are the most threatening situations for the global strength of the ship as shown in fig 19 4 1 influences of waves on free surface firstly the case with ζ w π is simulated in which the ship locates in the wave trough and is sagging initially the motion of the free surface is shown in fig 20 where the color contour represents the vertical displacement of the free surface and the wave travels from the ship bow to the stern when the bubble archives its maximum volume a spike emerges on the free surface above the bubble as high as 0 19 0 36 higher than the free surface of the trough of the wave because of the smaller distance from the bubble to the free surface the spike is 0 29 higher than that in the still water case due to the incident wave effect the bubble is no longer locates in beneath the wave trough any more along with the time marching which leads to the asymmetric evolution of the free surface near the midship section subjected to the gravity and the attraction of the collapsing bubble the spike on the free surface fades away when the bubble collapses to its minimum volume as shown in fig 20 c the ship whips because of the bubble load and disturbs the free surface near the bow and the stern when the bubble rebounds at t 2 1 a smaller spike emerges at the free surface fig 21 shows vertical displacement of the free surface in the case with ζ w 0 representing the ship locates on the wave crest similar to the prior case the wave propagates from the bow to the stern even though the bubble starts expanding at the same location the distance to the free surface is longer which generates a wider but lower spike on the free surface as shown in fig 21 b the collapse and the rebound of the bubble are shown in c and d respectively the ship whips subjected to the hydrodynamic load and its motion disturbs the free surface near the ship hull 4 2 influences of waves on added mass as discussed before the change of the added mass of the ship will affect the responses of the structure thus we compared the added mass of the ship in waves with that in still water by analyzing the change of the added mass nondimensionalized by the added mass in still water along with time fig 22 and fig 23 show the vertical and horizontal bending generalized added mass of the case with the ship locating in the trough the draft at the bow and the stern is greater than that of the still water while the draft at the midship is smaller which consist with the bending mode shapes both in vertical and horizontal directions thus the added mass increases initially for both of the vertical and horizontal bending modes the horizontal added mass increases by about 19 greater than 5 of the vertical one because it s more sensitive to the draft during the subsequent interaction with the bubble the change of the added mass along with time is similar to the still water case the added mass of the first order horizontal bending mode increases by 75 when the bubble start rebounding at t 2 2 and the vertical one increases by 20 both is greater than that in the still water case in contrast the vertical and horizontal bending generalized added mass of the case with the ship locating in on the crest are shown in fig 24 and fig 25 respectively the draft near the midship is greater than that near the bow and the stern initially which is opposite to the distribution of the first order vertical bending mode shape thus the vertical and horizontal bending added masses are 4 greater than that in the still water moreover the diminution of the second order vertical bending added mass is 7 of that in the still water while the second and the third order horizontal bending added masses changes little during the interaction between the ship and the underwater explosion bubble the changes of the added mass are similar to those of the still water case and the maximum changes of the vertical and the horizontal bending added masses are by 10 and 48 respectively in conclusion the changes of the added masses due to the waves are small and will lead to finite effects on the subsequent responses of the ship during the interactions the change trend of the added masses is similar to that of the case in still water but the studies presented in this paper limit the wave amplitude to ensure that the bottom of the ship wouldn t exceed water otherwise the impact process during the reenter of the ship into the water is crucial for the responses of the ship 4 3 influences of waves on global response of ship because the first order bending motion dominates the global response of the ship in both horizontal and vertical directions only the first order bending motion is analyzed in this section fig 26 and fig 27 show the comparison between the vertical and horizontal generalized forces with different incident waves respectively the existence of the waves changes both the amplitude and the time of the secondary pulsation load due to the bubble the real initial depth of the bubble in waves is altered due to the deformation of the free surface so the bubble period below the wave trough is smaller than that in still water due to a smaller distance from the free surface while it s bigger below the crest then the vertical and horizontal generalized displacements in waves with different initial phases are compared with those in still water in fig 28 and fig 29 respectively the ship is bended by the still water moment and the wave moment so that the vertical generalized displacements are 0 14 and 0 02 respectively which indicates the components of the wave effect are 0 06 less than that of the still water moment the waves with the phases difference of π are equivalent to those with the opposite amplitudes during the subsequent interaction between the bubble and the ship the effect of the waves is not linear correlated with the wave amplitude as for the vertical bending responses the changes of the added masses are so small that the bending periods are not much different but the maximum deflection of the girder locating at the crest is 0 015 than that in still water while the girder locating at the trough changes little for the horizontal displacements the changes of the added masses affect the period of the global responses so that the case of the ship in the crest with the smallest added masses archives its second extremum earliest the effects are amplified in the following interactions and change both the third extremums and the corresponding time nonlinearly because the wave length is always taken as the ship length during the global strength evaluation we only analyze the influence of the wave amplitude so we simulate several cases with different wave amplitudes the first 3 extremums change along with the wave amplitudes are drawn in fig 30 and fig 31 we can see that the extremums of the generalized displacements are not linear correlated with the wave amplitude for the first extremum right after the explosive explosion the nonlinearity is small because the wave hasn t prorogated too far and the added mass hasn t change too much however great nonlinearity is shown in for the second and the third extremums thus the traditional superposition method for the joint effect of the underwater explosion bubble and the waves can t estimate the responses of the ship accurately because it ignores the nonlinearity 5 conclusion in this paper the interaction model between the underwater explosion bubble the surface waves and the ship is established considering the nonlinear coupling after the validation of the numerical model by comparing with the experimental results several cases in still water and different waves are simulated to investigate the global responses of the ship subjected to underwater explosion bubble load through the simulation results we found that the influences of the waves on the global responses of the ship in the following 3 aspects firstly the waves change the longitudinal distribution of the draft of the ship which leads to an initial wave moment existing the whole interaction period superimposed with the dynamic inner moment caused by the underwater explosion bubble it threats the global strength of the ship secondly because of the inclined free surface and the incident wave pressure field the bubble dynamics and the corresponding bubble load are changed thirdly the waves change the added masses of the ship and then affect the global responses among the 3 factors above only the first one is nearly linear thus the relationship between the waves and the global responses shows noteworthy nonlinearity under their joint influences which indicates that the traditional superposition methods based on linear theory can t estimate the global strength of the ship accurately acknowledgements

23313,torpedo anchors are regarded as one of the most efficient mooring solutions for taut mooring systems and can withstand vertical loads the estimation of the undrained pullout capacity of the anchors is vital for the design of offshore floating facilities there have been some achievements obtained for the calculation of the holding capacity of a torpedo anchor via field tests conventional model tests under one gravity centrifuge tests with a high value of gravity acceleration and numerical tests however a simple and reliable formula is still required to calculate the holding capacity of a torpedo anchor in this study 240 sets of laboratory tests were performed and 11 differently shaped model anchors vertically embedded in a soft sedimentary bed were pulled out vertically from different types of cohesive soils and different embedment depths the characteristics of the loading curves were analyzed and the relationship between the pullout capacities and properties of the anchors and types of soils were investigated based on force analysis and the laboratory data a formula was proposed for the calculation of the undrained monotonic holding capacity of a torpedo anchor which mainly depends on the embedded depth of the anchor net weight geometry and in situ soil properties the calculated vertical holding capacities were consistent with the laboratory and field data obtained by the authors and other scientists keywords torpedo anchor pullout force vertical pullout capacity cohesive soil embedded depth 1 introduction wind and wave pressure have a significant effect on the stability of tower and ocean structures thus the foundation of ocean structures must provide sufficient holding power to maintain its stability torpedo anchor is an effective solution to provide sufficient holding power as a consequence of the immense global demand for oil and gas the offshore exploitation frontier is moving fast to water depths of approximately 3000 m de aguiar et al 2009 the greater the water depth the larger the mooring space would be in order to reduce the length of the mooring line and mooring space a taut mooring system tms including a torpedo anchor deeply penetrated into the seabed and a fairly straight mooring line connected to the vessel as illustrated in fig 1 is preferred to the catenary mooring system torpedo anchors or the so called torpedo piles are regarded as one of the most efficient mooring solutions for tmss and can withstand vertical loads while circumventing problems associated with other types of anchors this type of anchor has a rocket shape with a varying number of fins embedded into the seabed by free fall using its own weight as driven energy de aguiar et al 2009 wang et al 2016 such an anchoring system with torpedo anchors at brazil offshore has already been field proven by petrobras a brazilian oil company fernandes et al 2011 torpedo anchors can provide the required dynamic penetration force which makes them considerably more practical and cost effective than conventional anchors such as suction driven drilled and grouted piles and drag embedment anchors sabetamal et al 2013 owing to these advantages they have several practical applications in 2003 a high holding capacity torpedo anchor was designed to sustain loads imposed by the mooring lines of petrobras floating production storage and offloading fpso p 50 de araujo et al 2004 subsequently more floating production systems have been anchored using the torpedo concept brandão et al 2006 two deep penetration torpedo anchors of weight 80 tons each were installed in august 2009 at the gjøa field in the north sea off the western coast of norway lieng et al 2010 their maximum pullout capacity was approximately 700 tons a hybrid mooring system with weights and buoys may provide a performance superior to that of the tms yuan et al 2014 these successful applications further established this type of anchor as a viable alternative solution to the anchorage of fpsos and similar structures in a soft sedimentary seabed in the existing oil and gas industry an accurate estimation of the holding capacity of the anchor is not only crucial for the safety and stability of vessels and other marine facilities but also necessary for an economical design many studies have been conducted on the vertical holding capacity of a torpedo anchor via field tests medeiros 2002 brandão et al 2006 lieng et al 2010 o beirne et al 2014 conventional model tests under one gravity gilbert et al 2008 and centrifuge tests with a high value of gravity acceleration o loughlin et al 2004 richardson et al 2009 hossain et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2014 based on force analysis and test data several methods have been proposed for the calculation of the vertical holding capacity of a torpedo anchor embedded in soft soils simplified pile capacity calculation procedures was published by the api in 2002 api rp 2a wsd 2002 and modified in 2014 api rp 2geo 2011 this api method api rp 2a wsd 2002 was adopted for the prediction of the vertical capacity of dynamic installed anchors by o loughlin et al 2004 and gilbert et al 2008 the predicted capacity matched the measured capacity by the model tests of o loughlin et al 2004 when the empirical side shear factor i e side friction factor α equaled 0 8 for torpedo anchors with and without fins whereas gilbert et al 2008 regarded the side friction factor to be 0 5for a torpedo anchor without fins however this factor may have different values for a torpedo anchor with fins because the rheological change of the soil immediately adjacent to the anchor would be different if the torpedo anchor has fins richardson et al 2009 conducted a series of centrifuge model tests at 200 g where the installation and pullout of various anchor configurations were tested the theoretical anchor capacity for zero fin dynamic anchors was defined as the sum of the submerged weight and frictional and bearing resistances a more general torpedo model with four fins was proposed by assuming a constant bearing capacity value n c of 12 for the anchor tip and pad eye based on cone resistance and 7 5 for the fins embedded strip foundation based on their tests the back calculated friction ratio α was demonstrated to increase with the increasing in consolidation time thus reflecting the increase in shear strength of the soil with dissipation of the excess pore pressures their analyses indicated that the friction ratio against non dimensional consolidation time followed the same relationship as that for a torpedo anchor with or without fins moreover o beirne et al 2014 completed a series of experimental field tests in a glacial lake lower lough erne located in northern ireland using a 1 20 reduced scale anchor to assess the capacity of dynamically installed anchors under both vertical and inclined monotonic loading the best fit between the measurements and predictions was obtained using α 0 5 which was close to the inverse of the soil sensitivity i e 1 s t however various types of soil may exhibit different soil sensitivities hossain et al 2013 carried out several laboratory tests in a drum centrifuge at 200 g by varying the drop height the pullout angles at the mudline were 0 45 and 80 two torpedo anchor geometries were explored by varying the fin and tip geometry hossain et al 2015 further presented 20 tests including 11 tests with kaolin clay and 9 tests with calcareous silt it was demonstrated that the normalized vertical holding capacities versus non dimensional time in their tests significantly deviated from the trend of the tests conducted by richardson et al 2009 see their fig 16 liu et al 2014 presented a series of model centrifuge tests simulating the dynamic installation and monotonic pullout of dynamically installed torpedo anchors in normally consolidated clay it was demonstrated that for models without fins irrespective of the angle at which the model penetrated the soil the lowest value of holding capacity was obtained when the pullout and penetration directions were the same by examining the api approaches including api rp 2geo 2011 it can be observed that the suction force at the tip was not considered which may be an important factor furthermore although the calculation method for the side friction factor α is provided accurately determining the vertical effective stress at that depth is still a challenge owing to the shortage of pile load tests in soils when calculating the side friction factor considerable care should be taken for the application of this method particularly when the ratio of the soil undrained shear strength to the vertical effective stress is greater than three furthermore the empirical factor n c is assumed to be 9 api rp 2geo 2011 whereas o loughlin et al 2004 and gilbert et al 2008 regarded this bearing capacity factor n c as 12 and 17 for the ellipsoidal tip respectively it can be observed that the bearing capacity factor depends on the local soil properties at the anchor position which requires further investigation many investigations on the vertical holding capacity of torpedo anchors were performed in recent years brandão et al 2006 de aguiar et al 2009 de sousa et al 2011 sagrilo et al 2012 hossain et al 2013 liu et al 2014 raie and tassoulas 2016 it is still a challenge to incorporate the combined effect of the strain rate and softening of the soil immediately adjacent to the anchor during the pullout process hence these numerical models should be developed further although commercial computer software programs such as abaqus and ansys are often used to estimate the holding capacity the calibration and validation should be carefully performed therefore as the geometry of torpedo anchors is generally complex further physical tests are necessary for the validation of the numerical models moreover fast estimation of the vertical holding capacity of the anchor and the recognition of the interactions between the in situ surrounding soil and anchor during the pullout process should be explored some investigations on the holding capacity of objects of other shapes embedded in marine soils were conducted which may provide referable clues and analytical methods for the study on the holding capacity of torpedo anchors for horizontal anchors vesic 1971 proposed an analytical solution for the pullout capacity based on the cavity expansion theory in a rigid plastic material das 1980 presented a more versatile approach for the estimation of the pullout capacity of shallow and deep horizontal anchors with an empirical expression derived from model tests das et al 1985 further determined that the ultimate pullout load of shallow rectangular vertical anchor plates could be expressed in the form of a nondimensional breakout factor an empirical equation for the determination of the ultimate pullout load was proposed for this kind of anchor subsequently das et al 1994 performed many laboratory model tests for the estimation of the short term short time consolidation of soil ultimate uplift capacity of a circular plate anchor embedded in saturated soft kaolinite and montmorillonite beds they observed that for a given clay and moisture content the suction force generally decreased with an increase in the embedment ratio merifield et al 2001 presented simple empirical equations for predicting the pullout capacity of strip anchors in clay singh and ramaswamy 2008 explored the effect of the shape of anchor plates on their breakout capacity an empirical relationship to determine the shape factor and holding capacity of plate anchors buried in saturated cohesive soils was proposed charlton et al 2016 introduced an advanced constitutive model formulated within the kinematic hardening framework to predict the degradation of a structure e g while loading a plate anchor embedded in a natural soft clay deposit to its pullout capacity koh et al 2016 explored the shear resistance method and a direct piezocone based design method to obtain theoretical solutions for the vertical pullout capacity of the caisson singh et al 2016 proposed a generalized design approach for inclined strip anchors in clay however the formulae for the pullout capacity of pile anchors or plate anchors are not suitable for direct application to torpedo anchors from the above literature review it can be concluded that although the numerical method can provide reasonable results for the prediction of holding capacity provided model calibrations are carefully conducted using test data the modeling process is quite complex and time consuming further physical tests are required to extend the experimental ranges and understand the load displacement behavior and failure mechanism of interactions between torpedo anchors and the surrounding soil during pullout more importantly a simple and general method for the calculation of vertical holding capacity remains to be established therefore in this study the vertical holding capacities of different torpedo anchors embedded in underwater cohesive soils were experimentally investigated in a laboratory accordingly 240 tests were conducted with 11 differently shaped model anchors these model anchors with three slenderness ratios and three fin length were tested in underwater soils with nine different strength and three median particle diameters based on the force balance analysis and experimental data an experimental formula was derived to calculate the vertical pullout capacity of the anchor the formula was validated using other laboratory data and field tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 model anchors the model anchors in this study were fabricated according to the geometric shape of the full scaled t 98 torpedo with dimensional scales from 1 65 to 1 180 the t 98 torpedo weighed 98 tons de araujo et al 2004 with a diameter of 1 07 m length of 17 m and four fins of dimensions 0 9 m 10 m width length three slenderness ratios of length to diameter were adopted eleven model anchors of three different diameters and fin sizes were tested the geometric dimensions are shown in fig 2 and the real model anchors are presented in fig 3 the anchor type and anchor physical parameters such as the anchor mass and diameter are listed in table 1 model anchors with not only four fins but also no fins were employed and they all had a conical nose with a taper angle of 30 2 2 soil properties soils obtained from the bottom deposit at different locations of the jangsu yangcheng lake shanghai huangpu river and shanghai jinshan port were used in this study and their median particle diameters d 50 were 10 14 μm 19 49 μm and 29 31 μm respectively each soil sample was contained in a stainless steel bucket with a 35 cm inner diameter and 60 cm depth and was thoroughly mixed using a muddler installed on an electric drill before the tests started soils of different water contents from 27 to 77 were used during the experiments the mechanical properties of a wet soft soil bed such as the undrained shear strength yield stress and porosity are influenced by characteristics such as the grain size distribution and effective stress history these properties are typically nonlinear functions of the strain amplitude and must be evaluated separately for each test the strengths of very soft soils usually cannot be measured directly in tests using uniform strain and strain rate conditions intrusive test methods such as rheometry vane shear and t bar and cone penetration are required a vane shear tester szb 1 0 was used to test the soil shear strength and sensitivity the characteristic parameters of the experimental soils are listed in table 2 2 3 test setup and procedure all the pullout tests of the model anchors were conducted in the experimental setup system illustrated in fig 4 comprising a 1 2 m long shelf two fixed pulleys a steel string stepper motor with a frequency converter stainless steel cylindrical bucket filled with well stirred wet soft soil load cell computer and the model anchors each model anchor was connected to the load cell measuring range 50 kg with the steel string passing over the two fixed pulleys using acquisition software in the computer the variations in the anchor pullout load were recorded directly at a sampling rate of 4 hz as the capacity data measured during the pullout of the anchor are assessed relative to the undrained shear strength the velocity of the anchor shearing the adjacent soil during the pullout process i e the shearing velocity should be comparable to that associated with the test used to quantify the soil strength using the vane shear tester as the angular speed was controlled at 5 s the stepper motor maximum tension 100 kg was used to pull the steel string at a speed v pull of 0 2 cm s with the help of the frequency converter the stepper motor was a brushless dc electric motor that divided a full rotation into a number of equal steps the rotation speed remained constant for different tensile loads the anchor was inserted into the soil slowly and vertically using a slender stainless steel rod connected to the anchor tail after it was inserted to the requested experimental depth the verticality of the slender stainless steel rod was checked using a surveyor s level when the bubble was at the center of the circle the anchor was regarded in a vertical posture and subsequently the steel rod was lightly screwed out of the anchor in order to avoid disturbing the soil surrounding the anchor the anchor was installed very carefully to avoid disturbance to the surrounding soils and the soil properties around the anchor were ensured to be the same as far as possible at the other places in the cylindrical bucket each test was repeated three times and the data with errors greater than 20 were considered invalid and retested after being left to stand for 10 min the stepper motor was switched on to pull the anchor out simultaneously the load cell with the acquisition software began to record the pullout load the soil shear strength and sensitivity were measured by using szb 1 0 vane shear tester immediately before the pullout of the anchor each test was repeated three times and the averaged value of the holding capacity was used it should be stressed that the careful installation and delay pullout of the anchor were carried out to guarantee that the measured soil properties can represent the properties of the soil tightly around the anchor while the soil initially stirred up thoroughly using the muddler might be still unconsolidated the influence of the anchor installation on the soil properties was regarded to be eliminated after a delay of 10 min which was demonstrated by preliminary trial tests further whether the soil was consolidated or not is unimportant provided the measured soil properties can represent the properties of the soil around the anchor at the pullout moment in order to simplify the experimental conditions all the tests were conducted under the conditions of a thin layer of water covering the soil surface as the water pressure acting on the soil would increase the soil undrained strength the soil undrained shear strength was measured immediately before the pullout for each group of tests notably s u varies with the soil depth generally the static undrained shear strength increases linearly with the penetration depth in the soil wang et al 2016 under the experimental conditions it may be possible to use an averaged s u for the calculation if the penetration is not deep and the soil is thoroughly stirred up the frictional resistance of the pulleys and the stretch of the steel string were very small and were thus neglected in engineering practice an installation is regarded as a failure if its penetration depth is less than the length of the anchor thus the anchor was inserted into the soil to a depth of 1 3 6 0 times its length for each test fig 5 illustrates the status of the anchor pulled out from the soil in a test case some soil remained on top of the anchor whereas some of it adhered to its body the bed surface around the anchor was raised owing to the pullout 3 results 3 1 loading curves fig 6 shows the pullout load curves at a pullout speed of 0 20 cm s for the anchor a32 embedded at three different depths with embedded depth to length ratios l d of 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 it is evident that the load experienced three apparent stages of change first the load increased rapidly in a relatively short time reached a peak and subsequently decreased gradually thereafter the load curve fell sharply immediately after the top of the anchor emerged from the soil at 72 s 133 s and 187 s respectively until complete pullout the small fluctuation in the load curves might be a result of continuous extrusion and destruction of the soil surrounding the anchor and the development and destruction of the cavity around the anchor tip described in section 4 1 during the pullout similar trends were observed in the investigation of other model anchors 3 2 experimental pullout capacity data model anchors were tested in nine different soil samples with different embedment depths the anchor embedment depths and soil properties were measured precisely and recorded before conducting the pullout tests table 3 details all the experimental data by sequence of anchor type 4 theoretical analysis and discussion 4 1 forces on the anchor on referring to the force analysis performed bydas et al 1994 it is observed that the forces acting on the plate anchor may contain the effective self weight of the anchor net ultimate vertical breakout capacity and suction force generated between the base of the anchor and the soil beneath the anchor the net ultimate vertical breakout in terms of the soil weight and shear force on the anchor vesic 1971 singh and ramaswamy 2008 adopted the same forces to calculate the vertical pullout capacity of the plate anchor for a cylindrical anchor datta and kumar 1996 considered that the pullout capacity consisted of the submerged weight of the anchor skin friction along the sides and suction force generated between the base of the anchor and the soil beneath the anchor the soil weight and shear force were not considered as the anchor was not completely buried in the soil in general as shown in fig 7 the pullout force during the monotonic pullout process of the torpedo anchor in the saturated soil can be expressed as follows 1 f p u f s u f a d f s h w s w a s where f pu f su f ad f sh w s and w as represent the pullout force suction force side adhesion force soil shear force in the vertical direction weight of the upward soil and the net weight of the anchor in the soil respectively the value of the suction force generated varies during the pullout process when the anchor starts to move upward a cavity would be formed between the base of the anchor and the soil beneath the anchor the pressure inside the cavity would be negative which is presumably similar to the observations made in ali 1969 tests with a plate anchor of diameter 7 62 cm the cavity would be continuously refilled with water and soil owing to the negative pressure the filled material could be more water in the case of low permeability soils as the pore water may not seep into this cavity sufficiently quickly this negative pressure would result in a suction force that acts against the pullout similar to that for the plate anchor by singh and ramaswamy 2008 during the pullout the soil refilling may be unsteady as the failure of the cavity can be caused by the negative pressure for the suction force of the plate anchor das et al 1994 determined a linear relationship between f su and h d which was presented as 2 f s u a f s u 5 25 0 734 h d where a f s u h and d represent the anchor frontal area static undrained shear strength of soil distance from the anchor tail to the soil surface h tip embedment depth d anchor length l and anchor diameter respectively eq 2 indicates that the suction force generally decreases with an increase in the embedment ratio however the opposite trend is observed for cylindrical anchors as illustrated by datta and kumar 1996 the present tests demonstrated a trend similar to that observed by datta and kumar 1996 as shown in figs 8 and 9 but did not reflect the relationship described by eq 2 the anchor length l should also affect the suction force of the torpedo anchor in some way thus the parameter d l is used hence a more generalized equation for the suction force may be expressed as follows 3 f s u a f s u f h d d l when the anchor moves upward the soil surrounding the anchor shaft provides frictional resistance which results in the adhesion force f ad as shown in fig 7 a conventional formula may be employed for the side adhesion force as proposed by terzaghi and peck 1968 and true 1976 4 f a d δ s t a s s u where δ represents the side adhesion factor which can be assumed as 1 for cohesive soil blake et al 2015 s t and a s represent soil sensitivity and penetrator lateral area respectively the soil above the anchor is compressed in the pullout process and provides a downward resistant force f sh as illustrated in fig 7 which increases to a certain critical value and thereafter reduces gradually when the force on the soil approaches the bearing capacity of the soil an internal crack slip appears at such a critical moment the formation of a continuous internal crack slip along the interface of separation may appear as described by mariupol skii 1965 subsequently the raised soil does not totally resist the arising bending moments and break down into individual parts or disintegrate if the soil is sufficiently soft with a lower bearing capacity cracks do not occur but soil slipping occurs the sliding interface between the soil above the tail of the anchor and the surrounding soil should be dynamically changed in a complex manner as the anchor rises the sliding interface may not be able to extend upward to the soil surface when the anchor embedment is relatively deep in contrast to the scenarios presented by das et al 1994 singh et al 2016 and singh and ramaswamy 2008 the combination of the weight of the soil above w s and the shear stress on the sliding interface f sh provides a resistance that acts vertically on the anchor tail the weight of the soil above and the shear strength of the sliding interface together comprise the resistance forces against the pullout on the anchor tail it is very difficult to estimate the shape of the soil sliding interface and the weight of the soil above the anchor depends on the shape of the sliding interface therefore for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that the sliding interface extends upward as a spherical shape and the spherical soil body attached to the anchor tail provides the resistance therefore the shear force acting on the sliding interface may be expressed as follows 5 f s h π s u d h m where h m is the height of the sliding interface the weight of the soil above the anchor can be represented as follows 6 w s a f h ρ s g where ρ s and g represent the soil density and acceleration of gravity respectively the net weight of the anchor can be expressed as follows 7 w a m a g where m a is anchor mass the weight of the anchor in soil can be expressed as follows 8 w a s m a m s g where m s is the mass of the soil that would occupy the volume of the anchor 4 2 empirical formula for estimating pullout capacity each term in eq 1 reached its maximum at different moments during the pullout the contribution of the suction force term increased sharply to a maximum and thereafter slowly decreased furthermore the other terms reached their respective maxima at the beginning and thereafter decreased during the process of raising the anchor the pullout capacity was reached after a certain extent of dislodgement of the anchor as illustrated in fig 6 in this case the pullout force reached the maximum value when approximately one third of the anchor was dislodged the dislodged length may depend on the soil properties such as sediment size and water content and anchor geometry on substituting eqs 3 7 into eq 1 the pullout capacity i e the maximum pullout force during the pullout process of the torpedo anchor in the bed becomes 9 f p u a f s u f h d d l π s u d h m δ s t a s s u a f ρ g h m a m s g which can be expressed as 10 f h d d l 4 h m d f p u δ s t a s s u a f ρ g h m a m s g π s u d 2 as discussed above it can be assumed that 11 h m d f ρ g h s u h d δ s t furthermore let ξ f h d d l 4 h m d 12 ξ f ρ g h s u h d d l δ s t based on the experimental data listed in table 3 the following is obtained by regression 13 ξ 20 64 0 2163 ρ g h s u 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t therefore the pullout capacity of the torpedo anchor can be expressed by the following relationship 14 f p u 20 64 0 2163 ρ g h s u 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t π s u d 2 δ s t a s s u a f ρ g h m a m s g which was based on the test data of the anchors embedded to 1 3 to 6 0 times their lengths fig 10 shows the comparison between the experimental and calculated pullout capacity values it can be observed that 90 4 of the 240 test data points fall within the band with a relative error of 20 notably eq 14 may not be applicable for torpedo anchors embedded to 1 0 times or less of their length notably there are two important variables in eq 14 that affect the prediction value of the vertical holding capacity the variables s u and s t have to be accurately measured via geotechnical instruments such as a vane shear tester supposing that the absolute error of s u is δ the corresponding vertical holding capacity f pu can expressed as 15 f p u 20 64 0 2163 ρ g h s u δ 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t π s u δ d 2 δ s t a s s u δ a f ρ g h m a m s g subsequently the relative error of the vertical holding capacity caused by an inaccurate value s u δ can be expressed as 16 δ f p u f p u f p u f p u f p u 20 64 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t π d 2 δ a s s t δ f p u for the present tests the relative error of the vertical holding capacity ranged from 3 4 to 17 9 when the relative error of s u was 10 i e over predicted 10 it varied from 3 4 to 17 9 when the relative error of s t was 10 i e under predicted 10 as shown in fig 11 it demonstrates that when the estimation of s u had a 10 error 81 6 data points had the relative errors of the vertical holding capacity less than 10 0 and when the estimation of s u had a 10 error 81 6 data points had the relative errors of f pu less than 10 0 moreover the relative error of f pu was approaching almost the same as the relative error of the s u estimation with the increase of f pu supposing that the error of the correct data s t is δ the corresponding vertical holding capacity f pu can be expressed as 17 f p u 20 64 0 2163 ρ g h s u 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t δ π s u d 2 δ s t δ a s s u a f ρ g h m a m s g subsequently the relative error of the vertical holding capacity f pu caused by an inaccurate s t measurement can be expressed as 18 δ f p u f p u f p u f p u f p u δ 28 11 π s u d 2 a s s u δ s t s t δ f p u for the present tests the relative error of the vertical holding capacity ranged from 2 2 to 23 6 when the relative error of s t was 10 and 2 0 to 28 8 when the relative error of s t was 10 as shown in fig 12 when the estimation of s t had a 10 error 79 2 data points had the relative errors of the vertical holding capacity less than 10 0 and when the estimation of s t had a 10 error 72 5 data points had the relative errors of f pu less than 10 0 furthermore the relative error of f pu was approaching 2 4 or 2 to 4 as increase of f pu from eq 13 it is further noted that the influence of relative error of either s u or s t estimation on the vertical holding capacity would be relatively higher when the weight of the upward soil and the net weight of the anchor in the soil occupies less of f pu this occurred when the anchor had no fin or very short fins overall both s u and s t have a certain degree of sensitivity to the calculation of the vertical holding capacity therefore they should be determined as accurately as possible before using the formula 4 3 validation 4 3 1 data from medeiros jr 2002 according to medeiros jr s data medeiros 2002 full scale field tests were performed in the campos basin by petrobras brazilian petroleum corporation where the water depth ranged from 200 m to 2000 m the load tests were conducted in barracuda marllim and espadarte fields in normally consolidated clay of shear strength s u 5 2z kpa where z is the anchor embedment depth in meters and the value of s u was considered to be that at the anchor center at z d 0 5l two finless torpedo piles with outer diameters of 30 in 30 od and 43 in 43 od respectively were tested the ultimate averaged resistances of the two piles were 1000 kn and 3950 kn respectively however the soil density was not specified in medeiros paper herein the density of the seabed clay is assumed as 1700 kg m3 the soil sensitivity was measured to be 2 0 2 5 in the field tests by o beirne et al 2014 and blake et al 2015 thus the value of s t can be assumed as 2 25 for the present calculation the pullout capacities calculated using eq 13 are listed in table 4 which were overestimated by 4 3 and underestimated by 4 6 compared to the field values 4 3 2 data from de araujo et al 2004 using de araujo et al s data brandão et al 2006 petrobras started to develop the well known t 98 torpedoes in october 2000 two t 98 torpedo piles were completed on february 2002 each of which had a weight of 961 kn diameter of 1 07 m and length of 17 m with four fins that were 0 9 m wide and 10 m long in april 2002 the t 98 piles were loaded aboard to start field tests at albacora leste field located in campos basin the properties of the soil in campos basin were introduced by medeiros 2002 the vertical load of the t 98 torpedo was 7450 kn according to the simulation by de araujo et al 2004 using the numerical program aeepec3d see brandão et al 2006 the maximum vertical pullout force of the t 98 calculated using eq 13 is presented in table 4 the vertical pullout capacity calculated using eq 13 was 7837 kn which is 5 2 greater than the value of the numerical simulation presented by de araujo et al 2004 4 3 3 data from lieng et al 2010 in august 2009 two full sized 80 t deep penetrating anchors pda were successfully installed at the gjøa field in the north sea off the western coast of norway for the purpose of acquiring technological qualifications lieng et al 2010 dpa 1 was the first anchor dropped at a north location where the seabed consisted of stiffer soil and dpa 2 was released subsequently at approximately 1500 m southeast of dpa 1 into a relatively stiffer seabed the anchors were installed with tip penetrations of 24 m and 31 m in a water depth of 360 m using the ahts vessel m s island vanguard the values of s u were estimated from the undrained shear strength profiles presented in lieng et al 2010 the maximum vertical holding capacity was approximately 700 tons for both dpa 1 and dpa 2 as presented in table 4 the calculated vertical pullout capacity for dpa 1 and dpa 2 is only 0 3 and 2 5 less than the measured values respectively 4 3 4 data from o beirne et al 2014 o beirne et al 2014 conducted 61 sets of vertical monotonic loading tests with a reduced scale torpedo anchor in lower lough erne a glacial lake located in northern ireland at water depths of 3 8 m where the lake bed was made of soft normally consolidated clay with a constant unit weight of 10 8 kn m3 the anchors were installed through free fall in water achieving a tip embedment of 1 1 2 0 m the shear strength gradient of the undrained soil k was 1 5 kpa m over the initial 1 5 m and k 0 8 kpa m beyond 1 5 m the soil sensitivity s t was in the range of 2 2 5 herein an averaged s t 2 25 was used for the present calculation of the pullout capacity fig 13 shows the comparison between the field and calculated pullout capacity values all the 61 test data points fall within the band with a relative error of 20 notably the in situ strength was measured using the average strain rate at approximately 0 18 s 1 which was slightly higher than the pullout rate of the anchor at 0 11 0 13 s 1 presumably the values of s u presented by o beirne et al were slightly higher therefore the values calculated using eq 13 were slightly overestimated 4 3 5 data from large laboratory test a test was conducted in our open field sediment tank of length 10 m width 3 m and depth 2 5 m the tank was completely filled with cohesive soil collected from the north hangzhou bay the soil was saturated and settled for months the sediment size d 50 was 28 75 μm a 1 m long torpedo anchor fig 14 weighing 0 75 kn was embedded in the tank with a tip penetration depth of 2 1 m seven days after embedment the anchor was pulled out by a motor hoist at a speed of 0 2 cm s fig 15 shows the load curve recorded by the load cell the maximum vertical pullout load was 9 49 kn table 4 lists the detailed parametric values of the test the vertical pullout capacity calculated using eq 13 is 2 8 higher than the measured value 4 4 comparison with the api method the vertical holding capacity of torpedo anchors can be calculated using the alpha method i e api method as proposed in api rp 2geo 2011 which may be expressed as 19 f p u w a s f b e f a d w a s n c s u a f α s u a s where f be n c and α represent the bearing resistance at the top and bottom of the anchor empirical bearing capacity factor and shaft friction factor respectively n c 9 is used for the pile tip in cohesive soils for under consolidated clays clays with excess pore pressures undergoing active consolidation α can usually be considered as 1 0 the pullout capacities were calculated using eq 19 assuming α 1 and nc 9 for the present experiments fig 16 shows the comparison between the pullout forces of the alpha method and measured data only 60 4 of the 240 test data points fall within the band with a relative error of 20 however 90 4 of the 240 test data points fall within the band with a relative error of 20 when eq 13 was used to calculate the vertical holding capacities which is shown in fig 10 furthermore the model uncertainty u u measured predicted is an important information for assessing the reliability of a given design using this type of anchor as shown in fig 17 the deviations between the measured data and the data predicted by api model are large as most of the uncertainties u api in the former 50 sets of tests are more than 1 5 and the mean and standard deviation are 1 243 and 0 606 respectively as shown in fig 18 it is obvious that the uncertainty of the present model is smaller than that of the api model and the dispersion degree of uncertainty of the present model is relatively low that the mean and standard deviation are 0 977 and 0 158 respectively hence the present model achieved much better prediction results than the api model it is necessary to explain further that the results calculated using eq 19 did not exhibit an overall underestimation although the suction force at the tip was not considered by the alpha method this is because the effect of suction force was considered in the empirical factors n c and α higher scatters relative to the present method may be attributed to the simplicity of the alpha method and constant values of the empirical factors n c and α 4 5 discussion it is very important to eliminate the effect of the setup on the experimental results the different consolidation times would present the rheological curves shown in fig 19 in other words the consolidation time affects the soil properties directly in terms of time and space the parameters in eq 13 should be synthetically obtained if possible in order to reduce the experimental errors the soil properties such as s u and s t were measured immediately before the pullout the time from the start of the pullout to the moment when the pullout force reaches the pullout capacity is generally less than 1 min as shown in fig 6 the changes in soil properties were assumed to be negligible and the measured pullout capacity corresponded to the real time in situ soil properties such as s u the setup effect on the experimental results was neglected in order to achieve this the soil in the barrel was fully stirred and well mixed the soil properties in the barrel were uniform in the vertical direction as the anchor penetrated into the soil down to the designed depth the hollow was gently filled up using the same soil it can be assumed that the anchor was completed embedded and surrounded by the soil with uniform properties in the vertical direction natural recovery may include the recovery of the soil properties adjacent to the anchor and the filling up of the hollow by sediment deposition and or the adjacent soil deformation the effects of the shear strength increase owing to soil consolidation on the pullout capacity resulted in soil property differences at the real time installation and a certain period thereafter therefore the pullout capacity eq 13 can be used for the estimation of the present pullout capacity if the corresponding soil properties are measured the curves of shear stress against shear rate in fig 20 revealed that the pullout speed would affect the pullout force the pullout capacity would be larger if the pullout speed is significantly large this is because the greater the shear rate the greater the shear stress yielded in general the pullout speeds are sufficiently small such that the effect of the pullout speed on the pullout capacity is insignificant this study only focuses on the vertical pullout capability of torpedo anchors embedded vertically in underwater cohesive soils in practice the anchor may be embedded in the soil in a manner of tilt the torpedo anchors may be pulled at an angle to the soil surface different manner of the anchor in the soils or different pullout angles would yield different pullout capacity further investigations into the pullout capability of torpedo anchors embedded at an angle in an undrained soft sedimentary bed and the inclined pullout capacity have been undertaken in this laboratory by our colleagues another issue that must be stressed is the effect of the intermittent pull forces on the pullout capacity the unstrained soils silts in particular may be fluidized when bearing a vibrational or intermittent force as long as the magnitude and frequency of the vibrational or intermittent force holds certain values the soil adjacent to the anchor starts to become fluidized once the soil adjacent to the anchor is fluidized the soil properties will be significantly changed this may include a significant reduction of the undrained shear strength and viscosity leading to a reduction in the anchor frictional resistance hence the frequency of the intermittent force has to be controlled this should be considered when determining the safety factor of anchoring a higher safety factor may be necessary to ensure the safety of the anchoring further investigation may be necessary on this subject 5 conclusion in this study 240 sets of laboratory tests were performed to examine the pullout capability of torpedo anchors vertically embedded in a wet soft sedimentary bed eleven model torpedo anchors and nine different types of soils were tested the vertical pullout capability was demonstrated to depend mainly on the undrained shear strength of soil soil density soil sensitivity embedded depth net weight and geometric parameters of the anchor the characteristics of the torpedo anchor pullout process in cohesive soils with a vertical load and the influence of both anchor shape and soil properties on the vertical holding capacity were discussed in this study the soil properties were measured using precision instruments and the pullout capacity was recorded using a high speed data acquisition system the corresponding anchor embedment depth was approximately one to five times the length of the anchor whereas the undrained soil shear strength was measured immediately before the pullout during each test the experimental results showed that the variation in the stress on the torpedo anchor is quite complex owing to the continuous soil deformation such as the occurrence of cracks and slipping and the cavity at the tip of the anchor furthermore the extrusion and destruction of the soil around the anchor and the deformation of the cavity under the anchor tip cause a continuous fluctuation in the loading curve during the pullout procedure based on the experimental data and force analysis an empirical formula for estimating the vertical holding capacity of the torpedo anchor was proposed the calculated vertical holding capacities were consistent with not only the experimental data but also the field data the undrained shear strength of the soil is quite sensitive and has to be measured precisely for the estimation of the pullout capacity different types of instruments may have their own technical standards and provide various s u results hence a set of validation tests is suggested before using the formula furthermore a vibrational or intermittent force may be able to significantly reduce the pullout capacity a higher safety factor may be necessary to ensure the safety of the anchoring further investigation may be necessary into the pullout capability of torpedo anchors embedded at an angle in an undrained soft sedimentary bed and the inclined pullout capacity and vibrational or intermittent force effects acknowledgment this

23313,torpedo anchors are regarded as one of the most efficient mooring solutions for taut mooring systems and can withstand vertical loads the estimation of the undrained pullout capacity of the anchors is vital for the design of offshore floating facilities there have been some achievements obtained for the calculation of the holding capacity of a torpedo anchor via field tests conventional model tests under one gravity centrifuge tests with a high value of gravity acceleration and numerical tests however a simple and reliable formula is still required to calculate the holding capacity of a torpedo anchor in this study 240 sets of laboratory tests were performed and 11 differently shaped model anchors vertically embedded in a soft sedimentary bed were pulled out vertically from different types of cohesive soils and different embedment depths the characteristics of the loading curves were analyzed and the relationship between the pullout capacities and properties of the anchors and types of soils were investigated based on force analysis and the laboratory data a formula was proposed for the calculation of the undrained monotonic holding capacity of a torpedo anchor which mainly depends on the embedded depth of the anchor net weight geometry and in situ soil properties the calculated vertical holding capacities were consistent with the laboratory and field data obtained by the authors and other scientists keywords torpedo anchor pullout force vertical pullout capacity cohesive soil embedded depth 1 introduction wind and wave pressure have a significant effect on the stability of tower and ocean structures thus the foundation of ocean structures must provide sufficient holding power to maintain its stability torpedo anchor is an effective solution to provide sufficient holding power as a consequence of the immense global demand for oil and gas the offshore exploitation frontier is moving fast to water depths of approximately 3000 m de aguiar et al 2009 the greater the water depth the larger the mooring space would be in order to reduce the length of the mooring line and mooring space a taut mooring system tms including a torpedo anchor deeply penetrated into the seabed and a fairly straight mooring line connected to the vessel as illustrated in fig 1 is preferred to the catenary mooring system torpedo anchors or the so called torpedo piles are regarded as one of the most efficient mooring solutions for tmss and can withstand vertical loads while circumventing problems associated with other types of anchors this type of anchor has a rocket shape with a varying number of fins embedded into the seabed by free fall using its own weight as driven energy de aguiar et al 2009 wang et al 2016 such an anchoring system with torpedo anchors at brazil offshore has already been field proven by petrobras a brazilian oil company fernandes et al 2011 torpedo anchors can provide the required dynamic penetration force which makes them considerably more practical and cost effective than conventional anchors such as suction driven drilled and grouted piles and drag embedment anchors sabetamal et al 2013 owing to these advantages they have several practical applications in 2003 a high holding capacity torpedo anchor was designed to sustain loads imposed by the mooring lines of petrobras floating production storage and offloading fpso p 50 de araujo et al 2004 subsequently more floating production systems have been anchored using the torpedo concept brandão et al 2006 two deep penetration torpedo anchors of weight 80 tons each were installed in august 2009 at the gjøa field in the north sea off the western coast of norway lieng et al 2010 their maximum pullout capacity was approximately 700 tons a hybrid mooring system with weights and buoys may provide a performance superior to that of the tms yuan et al 2014 these successful applications further established this type of anchor as a viable alternative solution to the anchorage of fpsos and similar structures in a soft sedimentary seabed in the existing oil and gas industry an accurate estimation of the holding capacity of the anchor is not only crucial for the safety and stability of vessels and other marine facilities but also necessary for an economical design many studies have been conducted on the vertical holding capacity of a torpedo anchor via field tests medeiros 2002 brandão et al 2006 lieng et al 2010 o beirne et al 2014 conventional model tests under one gravity gilbert et al 2008 and centrifuge tests with a high value of gravity acceleration o loughlin et al 2004 richardson et al 2009 hossain et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2014 based on force analysis and test data several methods have been proposed for the calculation of the vertical holding capacity of a torpedo anchor embedded in soft soils simplified pile capacity calculation procedures was published by the api in 2002 api rp 2a wsd 2002 and modified in 2014 api rp 2geo 2011 this api method api rp 2a wsd 2002 was adopted for the prediction of the vertical capacity of dynamic installed anchors by o loughlin et al 2004 and gilbert et al 2008 the predicted capacity matched the measured capacity by the model tests of o loughlin et al 2004 when the empirical side shear factor i e side friction factor α equaled 0 8 for torpedo anchors with and without fins whereas gilbert et al 2008 regarded the side friction factor to be 0 5for a torpedo anchor without fins however this factor may have different values for a torpedo anchor with fins because the rheological change of the soil immediately adjacent to the anchor would be different if the torpedo anchor has fins richardson et al 2009 conducted a series of centrifuge model tests at 200 g where the installation and pullout of various anchor configurations were tested the theoretical anchor capacity for zero fin dynamic anchors was defined as the sum of the submerged weight and frictional and bearing resistances a more general torpedo model with four fins was proposed by assuming a constant bearing capacity value n c of 12 for the anchor tip and pad eye based on cone resistance and 7 5 for the fins embedded strip foundation based on their tests the back calculated friction ratio α was demonstrated to increase with the increasing in consolidation time thus reflecting the increase in shear strength of the soil with dissipation of the excess pore pressures their analyses indicated that the friction ratio against non dimensional consolidation time followed the same relationship as that for a torpedo anchor with or without fins moreover o beirne et al 2014 completed a series of experimental field tests in a glacial lake lower lough erne located in northern ireland using a 1 20 reduced scale anchor to assess the capacity of dynamically installed anchors under both vertical and inclined monotonic loading the best fit between the measurements and predictions was obtained using α 0 5 which was close to the inverse of the soil sensitivity i e 1 s t however various types of soil may exhibit different soil sensitivities hossain et al 2013 carried out several laboratory tests in a drum centrifuge at 200 g by varying the drop height the pullout angles at the mudline were 0 45 and 80 two torpedo anchor geometries were explored by varying the fin and tip geometry hossain et al 2015 further presented 20 tests including 11 tests with kaolin clay and 9 tests with calcareous silt it was demonstrated that the normalized vertical holding capacities versus non dimensional time in their tests significantly deviated from the trend of the tests conducted by richardson et al 2009 see their fig 16 liu et al 2014 presented a series of model centrifuge tests simulating the dynamic installation and monotonic pullout of dynamically installed torpedo anchors in normally consolidated clay it was demonstrated that for models without fins irrespective of the angle at which the model penetrated the soil the lowest value of holding capacity was obtained when the pullout and penetration directions were the same by examining the api approaches including api rp 2geo 2011 it can be observed that the suction force at the tip was not considered which may be an important factor furthermore although the calculation method for the side friction factor α is provided accurately determining the vertical effective stress at that depth is still a challenge owing to the shortage of pile load tests in soils when calculating the side friction factor considerable care should be taken for the application of this method particularly when the ratio of the soil undrained shear strength to the vertical effective stress is greater than three furthermore the empirical factor n c is assumed to be 9 api rp 2geo 2011 whereas o loughlin et al 2004 and gilbert et al 2008 regarded this bearing capacity factor n c as 12 and 17 for the ellipsoidal tip respectively it can be observed that the bearing capacity factor depends on the local soil properties at the anchor position which requires further investigation many investigations on the vertical holding capacity of torpedo anchors were performed in recent years brandão et al 2006 de aguiar et al 2009 de sousa et al 2011 sagrilo et al 2012 hossain et al 2013 liu et al 2014 raie and tassoulas 2016 it is still a challenge to incorporate the combined effect of the strain rate and softening of the soil immediately adjacent to the anchor during the pullout process hence these numerical models should be developed further although commercial computer software programs such as abaqus and ansys are often used to estimate the holding capacity the calibration and validation should be carefully performed therefore as the geometry of torpedo anchors is generally complex further physical tests are necessary for the validation of the numerical models moreover fast estimation of the vertical holding capacity of the anchor and the recognition of the interactions between the in situ surrounding soil and anchor during the pullout process should be explored some investigations on the holding capacity of objects of other shapes embedded in marine soils were conducted which may provide referable clues and analytical methods for the study on the holding capacity of torpedo anchors for horizontal anchors vesic 1971 proposed an analytical solution for the pullout capacity based on the cavity expansion theory in a rigid plastic material das 1980 presented a more versatile approach for the estimation of the pullout capacity of shallow and deep horizontal anchors with an empirical expression derived from model tests das et al 1985 further determined that the ultimate pullout load of shallow rectangular vertical anchor plates could be expressed in the form of a nondimensional breakout factor an empirical equation for the determination of the ultimate pullout load was proposed for this kind of anchor subsequently das et al 1994 performed many laboratory model tests for the estimation of the short term short time consolidation of soil ultimate uplift capacity of a circular plate anchor embedded in saturated soft kaolinite and montmorillonite beds they observed that for a given clay and moisture content the suction force generally decreased with an increase in the embedment ratio merifield et al 2001 presented simple empirical equations for predicting the pullout capacity of strip anchors in clay singh and ramaswamy 2008 explored the effect of the shape of anchor plates on their breakout capacity an empirical relationship to determine the shape factor and holding capacity of plate anchors buried in saturated cohesive soils was proposed charlton et al 2016 introduced an advanced constitutive model formulated within the kinematic hardening framework to predict the degradation of a structure e g while loading a plate anchor embedded in a natural soft clay deposit to its pullout capacity koh et al 2016 explored the shear resistance method and a direct piezocone based design method to obtain theoretical solutions for the vertical pullout capacity of the caisson singh et al 2016 proposed a generalized design approach for inclined strip anchors in clay however the formulae for the pullout capacity of pile anchors or plate anchors are not suitable for direct application to torpedo anchors from the above literature review it can be concluded that although the numerical method can provide reasonable results for the prediction of holding capacity provided model calibrations are carefully conducted using test data the modeling process is quite complex and time consuming further physical tests are required to extend the experimental ranges and understand the load displacement behavior and failure mechanism of interactions between torpedo anchors and the surrounding soil during pullout more importantly a simple and general method for the calculation of vertical holding capacity remains to be established therefore in this study the vertical holding capacities of different torpedo anchors embedded in underwater cohesive soils were experimentally investigated in a laboratory accordingly 240 tests were conducted with 11 differently shaped model anchors these model anchors with three slenderness ratios and three fin length were tested in underwater soils with nine different strength and three median particle diameters based on the force balance analysis and experimental data an experimental formula was derived to calculate the vertical pullout capacity of the anchor the formula was validated using other laboratory data and field tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 model anchors the model anchors in this study were fabricated according to the geometric shape of the full scaled t 98 torpedo with dimensional scales from 1 65 to 1 180 the t 98 torpedo weighed 98 tons de araujo et al 2004 with a diameter of 1 07 m length of 17 m and four fins of dimensions 0 9 m 10 m width length three slenderness ratios of length to diameter were adopted eleven model anchors of three different diameters and fin sizes were tested the geometric dimensions are shown in fig 2 and the real model anchors are presented in fig 3 the anchor type and anchor physical parameters such as the anchor mass and diameter are listed in table 1 model anchors with not only four fins but also no fins were employed and they all had a conical nose with a taper angle of 30 2 2 soil properties soils obtained from the bottom deposit at different locations of the jangsu yangcheng lake shanghai huangpu river and shanghai jinshan port were used in this study and their median particle diameters d 50 were 10 14 μm 19 49 μm and 29 31 μm respectively each soil sample was contained in a stainless steel bucket with a 35 cm inner diameter and 60 cm depth and was thoroughly mixed using a muddler installed on an electric drill before the tests started soils of different water contents from 27 to 77 were used during the experiments the mechanical properties of a wet soft soil bed such as the undrained shear strength yield stress and porosity are influenced by characteristics such as the grain size distribution and effective stress history these properties are typically nonlinear functions of the strain amplitude and must be evaluated separately for each test the strengths of very soft soils usually cannot be measured directly in tests using uniform strain and strain rate conditions intrusive test methods such as rheometry vane shear and t bar and cone penetration are required a vane shear tester szb 1 0 was used to test the soil shear strength and sensitivity the characteristic parameters of the experimental soils are listed in table 2 2 3 test setup and procedure all the pullout tests of the model anchors were conducted in the experimental setup system illustrated in fig 4 comprising a 1 2 m long shelf two fixed pulleys a steel string stepper motor with a frequency converter stainless steel cylindrical bucket filled with well stirred wet soft soil load cell computer and the model anchors each model anchor was connected to the load cell measuring range 50 kg with the steel string passing over the two fixed pulleys using acquisition software in the computer the variations in the anchor pullout load were recorded directly at a sampling rate of 4 hz as the capacity data measured during the pullout of the anchor are assessed relative to the undrained shear strength the velocity of the anchor shearing the adjacent soil during the pullout process i e the shearing velocity should be comparable to that associated with the test used to quantify the soil strength using the vane shear tester as the angular speed was controlled at 5 s the stepper motor maximum tension 100 kg was used to pull the steel string at a speed v pull of 0 2 cm s with the help of the frequency converter the stepper motor was a brushless dc electric motor that divided a full rotation into a number of equal steps the rotation speed remained constant for different tensile loads the anchor was inserted into the soil slowly and vertically using a slender stainless steel rod connected to the anchor tail after it was inserted to the requested experimental depth the verticality of the slender stainless steel rod was checked using a surveyor s level when the bubble was at the center of the circle the anchor was regarded in a vertical posture and subsequently the steel rod was lightly screwed out of the anchor in order to avoid disturbing the soil surrounding the anchor the anchor was installed very carefully to avoid disturbance to the surrounding soils and the soil properties around the anchor were ensured to be the same as far as possible at the other places in the cylindrical bucket each test was repeated three times and the data with errors greater than 20 were considered invalid and retested after being left to stand for 10 min the stepper motor was switched on to pull the anchor out simultaneously the load cell with the acquisition software began to record the pullout load the soil shear strength and sensitivity were measured by using szb 1 0 vane shear tester immediately before the pullout of the anchor each test was repeated three times and the averaged value of the holding capacity was used it should be stressed that the careful installation and delay pullout of the anchor were carried out to guarantee that the measured soil properties can represent the properties of the soil tightly around the anchor while the soil initially stirred up thoroughly using the muddler might be still unconsolidated the influence of the anchor installation on the soil properties was regarded to be eliminated after a delay of 10 min which was demonstrated by preliminary trial tests further whether the soil was consolidated or not is unimportant provided the measured soil properties can represent the properties of the soil around the anchor at the pullout moment in order to simplify the experimental conditions all the tests were conducted under the conditions of a thin layer of water covering the soil surface as the water pressure acting on the soil would increase the soil undrained strength the soil undrained shear strength was measured immediately before the pullout for each group of tests notably s u varies with the soil depth generally the static undrained shear strength increases linearly with the penetration depth in the soil wang et al 2016 under the experimental conditions it may be possible to use an averaged s u for the calculation if the penetration is not deep and the soil is thoroughly stirred up the frictional resistance of the pulleys and the stretch of the steel string were very small and were thus neglected in engineering practice an installation is regarded as a failure if its penetration depth is less than the length of the anchor thus the anchor was inserted into the soil to a depth of 1 3 6 0 times its length for each test fig 5 illustrates the status of the anchor pulled out from the soil in a test case some soil remained on top of the anchor whereas some of it adhered to its body the bed surface around the anchor was raised owing to the pullout 3 results 3 1 loading curves fig 6 shows the pullout load curves at a pullout speed of 0 20 cm s for the anchor a32 embedded at three different depths with embedded depth to length ratios l d of 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 it is evident that the load experienced three apparent stages of change first the load increased rapidly in a relatively short time reached a peak and subsequently decreased gradually thereafter the load curve fell sharply immediately after the top of the anchor emerged from the soil at 72 s 133 s and 187 s respectively until complete pullout the small fluctuation in the load curves might be a result of continuous extrusion and destruction of the soil surrounding the anchor and the development and destruction of the cavity around the anchor tip described in section 4 1 during the pullout similar trends were observed in the investigation of other model anchors 3 2 experimental pullout capacity data model anchors were tested in nine different soil samples with different embedment depths the anchor embedment depths and soil properties were measured precisely and recorded before conducting the pullout tests table 3 details all the experimental data by sequence of anchor type 4 theoretical analysis and discussion 4 1 forces on the anchor on referring to the force analysis performed bydas et al 1994 it is observed that the forces acting on the plate anchor may contain the effective self weight of the anchor net ultimate vertical breakout capacity and suction force generated between the base of the anchor and the soil beneath the anchor the net ultimate vertical breakout in terms of the soil weight and shear force on the anchor vesic 1971 singh and ramaswamy 2008 adopted the same forces to calculate the vertical pullout capacity of the plate anchor for a cylindrical anchor datta and kumar 1996 considered that the pullout capacity consisted of the submerged weight of the anchor skin friction along the sides and suction force generated between the base of the anchor and the soil beneath the anchor the soil weight and shear force were not considered as the anchor was not completely buried in the soil in general as shown in fig 7 the pullout force during the monotonic pullout process of the torpedo anchor in the saturated soil can be expressed as follows 1 f p u f s u f a d f s h w s w a s where f pu f su f ad f sh w s and w as represent the pullout force suction force side adhesion force soil shear force in the vertical direction weight of the upward soil and the net weight of the anchor in the soil respectively the value of the suction force generated varies during the pullout process when the anchor starts to move upward a cavity would be formed between the base of the anchor and the soil beneath the anchor the pressure inside the cavity would be negative which is presumably similar to the observations made in ali 1969 tests with a plate anchor of diameter 7 62 cm the cavity would be continuously refilled with water and soil owing to the negative pressure the filled material could be more water in the case of low permeability soils as the pore water may not seep into this cavity sufficiently quickly this negative pressure would result in a suction force that acts against the pullout similar to that for the plate anchor by singh and ramaswamy 2008 during the pullout the soil refilling may be unsteady as the failure of the cavity can be caused by the negative pressure for the suction force of the plate anchor das et al 1994 determined a linear relationship between f su and h d which was presented as 2 f s u a f s u 5 25 0 734 h d where a f s u h and d represent the anchor frontal area static undrained shear strength of soil distance from the anchor tail to the soil surface h tip embedment depth d anchor length l and anchor diameter respectively eq 2 indicates that the suction force generally decreases with an increase in the embedment ratio however the opposite trend is observed for cylindrical anchors as illustrated by datta and kumar 1996 the present tests demonstrated a trend similar to that observed by datta and kumar 1996 as shown in figs 8 and 9 but did not reflect the relationship described by eq 2 the anchor length l should also affect the suction force of the torpedo anchor in some way thus the parameter d l is used hence a more generalized equation for the suction force may be expressed as follows 3 f s u a f s u f h d d l when the anchor moves upward the soil surrounding the anchor shaft provides frictional resistance which results in the adhesion force f ad as shown in fig 7 a conventional formula may be employed for the side adhesion force as proposed by terzaghi and peck 1968 and true 1976 4 f a d δ s t a s s u where δ represents the side adhesion factor which can be assumed as 1 for cohesive soil blake et al 2015 s t and a s represent soil sensitivity and penetrator lateral area respectively the soil above the anchor is compressed in the pullout process and provides a downward resistant force f sh as illustrated in fig 7 which increases to a certain critical value and thereafter reduces gradually when the force on the soil approaches the bearing capacity of the soil an internal crack slip appears at such a critical moment the formation of a continuous internal crack slip along the interface of separation may appear as described by mariupol skii 1965 subsequently the raised soil does not totally resist the arising bending moments and break down into individual parts or disintegrate if the soil is sufficiently soft with a lower bearing capacity cracks do not occur but soil slipping occurs the sliding interface between the soil above the tail of the anchor and the surrounding soil should be dynamically changed in a complex manner as the anchor rises the sliding interface may not be able to extend upward to the soil surface when the anchor embedment is relatively deep in contrast to the scenarios presented by das et al 1994 singh et al 2016 and singh and ramaswamy 2008 the combination of the weight of the soil above w s and the shear stress on the sliding interface f sh provides a resistance that acts vertically on the anchor tail the weight of the soil above and the shear strength of the sliding interface together comprise the resistance forces against the pullout on the anchor tail it is very difficult to estimate the shape of the soil sliding interface and the weight of the soil above the anchor depends on the shape of the sliding interface therefore for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that the sliding interface extends upward as a spherical shape and the spherical soil body attached to the anchor tail provides the resistance therefore the shear force acting on the sliding interface may be expressed as follows 5 f s h π s u d h m where h m is the height of the sliding interface the weight of the soil above the anchor can be represented as follows 6 w s a f h ρ s g where ρ s and g represent the soil density and acceleration of gravity respectively the net weight of the anchor can be expressed as follows 7 w a m a g where m a is anchor mass the weight of the anchor in soil can be expressed as follows 8 w a s m a m s g where m s is the mass of the soil that would occupy the volume of the anchor 4 2 empirical formula for estimating pullout capacity each term in eq 1 reached its maximum at different moments during the pullout the contribution of the suction force term increased sharply to a maximum and thereafter slowly decreased furthermore the other terms reached their respective maxima at the beginning and thereafter decreased during the process of raising the anchor the pullout capacity was reached after a certain extent of dislodgement of the anchor as illustrated in fig 6 in this case the pullout force reached the maximum value when approximately one third of the anchor was dislodged the dislodged length may depend on the soil properties such as sediment size and water content and anchor geometry on substituting eqs 3 7 into eq 1 the pullout capacity i e the maximum pullout force during the pullout process of the torpedo anchor in the bed becomes 9 f p u a f s u f h d d l π s u d h m δ s t a s s u a f ρ g h m a m s g which can be expressed as 10 f h d d l 4 h m d f p u δ s t a s s u a f ρ g h m a m s g π s u d 2 as discussed above it can be assumed that 11 h m d f ρ g h s u h d δ s t furthermore let ξ f h d d l 4 h m d 12 ξ f ρ g h s u h d d l δ s t based on the experimental data listed in table 3 the following is obtained by regression 13 ξ 20 64 0 2163 ρ g h s u 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t therefore the pullout capacity of the torpedo anchor can be expressed by the following relationship 14 f p u 20 64 0 2163 ρ g h s u 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t π s u d 2 δ s t a s s u a f ρ g h m a m s g which was based on the test data of the anchors embedded to 1 3 to 6 0 times their lengths fig 10 shows the comparison between the experimental and calculated pullout capacity values it can be observed that 90 4 of the 240 test data points fall within the band with a relative error of 20 notably eq 14 may not be applicable for torpedo anchors embedded to 1 0 times or less of their length notably there are two important variables in eq 14 that affect the prediction value of the vertical holding capacity the variables s u and s t have to be accurately measured via geotechnical instruments such as a vane shear tester supposing that the absolute error of s u is δ the corresponding vertical holding capacity f pu can expressed as 15 f p u 20 64 0 2163 ρ g h s u δ 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t π s u δ d 2 δ s t a s s u δ a f ρ g h m a m s g subsequently the relative error of the vertical holding capacity caused by an inaccurate value s u δ can be expressed as 16 δ f p u f p u f p u f p u f p u 20 64 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t π d 2 δ a s s t δ f p u for the present tests the relative error of the vertical holding capacity ranged from 3 4 to 17 9 when the relative error of s u was 10 i e over predicted 10 it varied from 3 4 to 17 9 when the relative error of s t was 10 i e under predicted 10 as shown in fig 11 it demonstrates that when the estimation of s u had a 10 error 81 6 data points had the relative errors of the vertical holding capacity less than 10 0 and when the estimation of s u had a 10 error 81 6 data points had the relative errors of f pu less than 10 0 moreover the relative error of f pu was approaching almost the same as the relative error of the s u estimation with the increase of f pu supposing that the error of the correct data s t is δ the corresponding vertical holding capacity f pu can be expressed as 17 f p u 20 64 0 2163 ρ g h s u 0 6652 h d 1 943 d l 28 11 δ s t δ π s u d 2 δ s t δ a s s u a f ρ g h m a m s g subsequently the relative error of the vertical holding capacity f pu caused by an inaccurate s t measurement can be expressed as 18 δ f p u f p u f p u f p u f p u δ 28 11 π s u d 2 a s s u δ s t s t δ f p u for the present tests the relative error of the vertical holding capacity ranged from 2 2 to 23 6 when the relative error of s t was 10 and 2 0 to 28 8 when the relative error of s t was 10 as shown in fig 12 when the estimation of s t had a 10 error 79 2 data points had the relative errors of the vertical holding capacity less than 10 0 and when the estimation of s t had a 10 error 72 5 data points had the relative errors of f pu less than 10 0 furthermore the relative error of f pu was approaching 2 4 or 2 to 4 as increase of f pu from eq 13 it is further noted that the influence of relative error of either s u or s t estimation on the vertical holding capacity would be relatively higher when the weight of the upward soil and the net weight of the anchor in the soil occupies less of f pu this occurred when the anchor had no fin or very short fins overall both s u and s t have a certain degree of sensitivity to the calculation of the vertical holding capacity therefore they should be determined as accurately as possible before using the formula 4 3 validation 4 3 1 data from medeiros jr 2002 according to medeiros jr s data medeiros 2002 full scale field tests were performed in the campos basin by petrobras brazilian petroleum corporation where the water depth ranged from 200 m to 2000 m the load tests were conducted in barracuda marllim and espadarte fields in normally consolidated clay of shear strength s u 5 2z kpa where z is the anchor embedment depth in meters and the value of s u was considered to be that at the anchor center at z d 0 5l two finless torpedo piles with outer diameters of 30 in 30 od and 43 in 43 od respectively were tested the ultimate averaged resistances of the two piles were 1000 kn and 3950 kn respectively however the soil density was not specified in medeiros paper herein the density of the seabed clay is assumed as 1700 kg m3 the soil sensitivity was measured to be 2 0 2 5 in the field tests by o beirne et al 2014 and blake et al 2015 thus the value of s t can be assumed as 2 25 for the present calculation the pullout capacities calculated using eq 13 are listed in table 4 which were overestimated by 4 3 and underestimated by 4 6 compared to the field values 4 3 2 data from de araujo et al 2004 using de araujo et al s data brandão et al 2006 petrobras started to develop the well known t 98 torpedoes in october 2000 two t 98 torpedo piles were completed on february 2002 each of which had a weight of 961 kn diameter of 1 07 m and length of 17 m with four fins that were 0 9 m wide and 10 m long in april 2002 the t 98 piles were loaded aboard to start field tests at albacora leste field located in campos basin the properties of the soil in campos basin were introduced by medeiros 2002 the vertical load of the t 98 torpedo was 7450 kn according to the simulation by de araujo et al 2004 using the numerical program aeepec3d see brandão et al 2006 the maximum vertical pullout force of the t 98 calculated using eq 13 is presented in table 4 the vertical pullout capacity calculated using eq 13 was 7837 kn which is 5 2 greater than the value of the numerical simulation presented by de araujo et al 2004 4 3 3 data from lieng et al 2010 in august 2009 two full sized 80 t deep penetrating anchors pda were successfully installed at the gjøa field in the north sea off the western coast of norway for the purpose of acquiring technological qualifications lieng et al 2010 dpa 1 was the first anchor dropped at a north location where the seabed consisted of stiffer soil and dpa 2 was released subsequently at approximately 1500 m southeast of dpa 1 into a relatively stiffer seabed the anchors were installed with tip penetrations of 24 m and 31 m in a water depth of 360 m using the ahts vessel m s island vanguard the values of s u were estimated from the undrained shear strength profiles presented in lieng et al 2010 the maximum vertical holding capacity was approximately 700 tons for both dpa 1 and dpa 2 as presented in table 4 the calculated vertical pullout capacity for dpa 1 and dpa 2 is only 0 3 and 2 5 less than the measured values respectively 4 3 4 data from o beirne et al 2014 o beirne et al 2014 conducted 61 sets of vertical monotonic loading tests with a reduced scale torpedo anchor in lower lough erne a glacial lake located in northern ireland at water depths of 3 8 m where the lake bed was made of soft normally consolidated clay with a constant unit weight of 10 8 kn m3 the anchors were installed through free fall in water achieving a tip embedment of 1 1 2 0 m the shear strength gradient of the undrained soil k was 1 5 kpa m over the initial 1 5 m and k 0 8 kpa m beyond 1 5 m the soil sensitivity s t was in the range of 2 2 5 herein an averaged s t 2 25 was used for the present calculation of the pullout capacity fig 13 shows the comparison between the field and calculated pullout capacity values all the 61 test data points fall within the band with a relative error of 20 notably the in situ strength was measured using the average strain rate at approximately 0 18 s 1 which was slightly higher than the pullout rate of the anchor at 0 11 0 13 s 1 presumably the values of s u presented by o beirne et al were slightly higher therefore the values calculated using eq 13 were slightly overestimated 4 3 5 data from large laboratory test a test was conducted in our open field sediment tank of length 10 m width 3 m and depth 2 5 m the tank was completely filled with cohesive soil collected from the north hangzhou bay the soil was saturated and settled for months the sediment size d 50 was 28 75 μm a 1 m long torpedo anchor fig 14 weighing 0 75 kn was embedded in the tank with a tip penetration depth of 2 1 m seven days after embedment the anchor was pulled out by a motor hoist at a speed of 0 2 cm s fig 15 shows the load curve recorded by the load cell the maximum vertical pullout load was 9 49 kn table 4 lists the detailed parametric values of the test the vertical pullout capacity calculated using eq 13 is 2 8 higher than the measured value 4 4 comparison with the api method the vertical holding capacity of torpedo anchors can be calculated using the alpha method i e api method as proposed in api rp 2geo 2011 which may be expressed as 19 f p u w a s f b e f a d w a s n c s u a f α s u a s where f be n c and α represent the bearing resistance at the top and bottom of the anchor empirical bearing capacity factor and shaft friction factor respectively n c 9 is used for the pile tip in cohesive soils for under consolidated clays clays with excess pore pressures undergoing active consolidation α can usually be considered as 1 0 the pullout capacities were calculated using eq 19 assuming α 1 and nc 9 for the present experiments fig 16 shows the comparison between the pullout forces of the alpha method and measured data only 60 4 of the 240 test data points fall within the band with a relative error of 20 however 90 4 of the 240 test data points fall within the band with a relative error of 20 when eq 13 was used to calculate the vertical holding capacities which is shown in fig 10 furthermore the model uncertainty u u measured predicted is an important information for assessing the reliability of a given design using this type of anchor as shown in fig 17 the deviations between the measured data and the data predicted by api model are large as most of the uncertainties u api in the former 50 sets of tests are more than 1 5 and the mean and standard deviation are 1 243 and 0 606 respectively as shown in fig 18 it is obvious that the uncertainty of the present model is smaller than that of the api model and the dispersion degree of uncertainty of the present model is relatively low that the mean and standard deviation are 0 977 and 0 158 respectively hence the present model achieved much better prediction results than the api model it is necessary to explain further that the results calculated using eq 19 did not exhibit an overall underestimation although the suction force at the tip was not considered by the alpha method this is because the effect of suction force was considered in the empirical factors n c and α higher scatters relative to the present method may be attributed to the simplicity of the alpha method and constant values of the empirical factors n c and α 4 5 discussion it is very important to eliminate the effect of the setup on the experimental results the different consolidation times would present the rheological curves shown in fig 19 in other words the consolidation time affects the soil properties directly in terms of time and space the parameters in eq 13 should be synthetically obtained if possible in order to reduce the experimental errors the soil properties such as s u and s t were measured immediately before the pullout the time from the start of the pullout to the moment when the pullout force reaches the pullout capacity is generally less than 1 min as shown in fig 6 the changes in soil properties were assumed to be negligible and the measured pullout capacity corresponded to the real time in situ soil properties such as s u the setup effect on the experimental results was neglected in order to achieve this the soil in the barrel was fully stirred and well mixed the soil properties in the barrel were uniform in the vertical direction as the anchor penetrated into the soil down to the designed depth the hollow was gently filled up using the same soil it can be assumed that the anchor was completed embedded and surrounded by the soil with uniform properties in the vertical direction natural recovery may include the recovery of the soil properties adjacent to the anchor and the filling up of the hollow by sediment deposition and or the adjacent soil deformation the effects of the shear strength increase owing to soil consolidation on the pullout capacity resulted in soil property differences at the real time installation and a certain period thereafter therefore the pullout capacity eq 13 can be used for the estimation of the present pullout capacity if the corresponding soil properties are measured the curves of shear stress against shear rate in fig 20 revealed that the pullout speed would affect the pullout force the pullout capacity would be larger if the pullout speed is significantly large this is because the greater the shear rate the greater the shear stress yielded in general the pullout speeds are sufficiently small such that the effect of the pullout speed on the pullout capacity is insignificant this study only focuses on the vertical pullout capability of torpedo anchors embedded vertically in underwater cohesive soils in practice the anchor may be embedded in the soil in a manner of tilt the torpedo anchors may be pulled at an angle to the soil surface different manner of the anchor in the soils or different pullout angles would yield different pullout capacity further investigations into the pullout capability of torpedo anchors embedded at an angle in an undrained soft sedimentary bed and the inclined pullout capacity have been undertaken in this laboratory by our colleagues another issue that must be stressed is the effect of the intermittent pull forces on the pullout capacity the unstrained soils silts in particular may be fluidized when bearing a vibrational or intermittent force as long as the magnitude and frequency of the vibrational or intermittent force holds certain values the soil adjacent to the anchor starts to become fluidized once the soil adjacent to the anchor is fluidized the soil properties will be significantly changed this may include a significant reduction of the undrained shear strength and viscosity leading to a reduction in the anchor frictional resistance hence the frequency of the intermittent force has to be controlled this should be considered when determining the safety factor of anchoring a higher safety factor may be necessary to ensure the safety of the anchoring further investigation may be necessary on this subject 5 conclusion in this study 240 sets of laboratory tests were performed to examine the pullout capability of torpedo anchors vertically embedded in a wet soft sedimentary bed eleven model torpedo anchors and nine different types of soils were tested the vertical pullout capability was demonstrated to depend mainly on the undrained shear strength of soil soil density soil sensitivity embedded depth net weight and geometric parameters of the anchor the characteristics of the torpedo anchor pullout process in cohesive soils with a vertical load and the influence of both anchor shape and soil properties on the vertical holding capacity were discussed in this study the soil properties were measured using precision instruments and the pullout capacity was recorded using a high speed data acquisition system the corresponding anchor embedment depth was approximately one to five times the length of the anchor whereas the undrained soil shear strength was measured immediately before the pullout during each test the experimental results showed that the variation in the stress on the torpedo anchor is quite complex owing to the continuous soil deformation such as the occurrence of cracks and slipping and the cavity at the tip of the anchor furthermore the extrusion and destruction of the soil around the anchor and the deformation of the cavity under the anchor tip cause a continuous fluctuation in the loading curve during the pullout procedure based on the experimental data and force analysis an empirical formula for estimating the vertical holding capacity of the torpedo anchor was proposed the calculated vertical holding capacities were consistent with not only the experimental data but also the field data the undrained shear strength of the soil is quite sensitive and has to be measured precisely for the estimation of the pullout capacity different types of instruments may have their own technical standards and provide various s u results hence a set of validation tests is suggested before using the formula furthermore a vibrational or intermittent force may be able to significantly reduce the pullout capacity a higher safety factor may be necessary to ensure the safety of the anchoring further investigation may be necessary into the pullout capability of torpedo anchors embedded at an angle in an undrained soft sedimentary bed and the inclined pullout capacity and vibrational or intermittent force effects acknowledgment this

23314,an alternative metric for assessing nearshore hydrodynamic impact due to wave energy converter wec arrays is presented that is based on the modeled changes in alongshore radiation stress gradients in the lee of the array the metric is developed using a previously observed relationship between measured radiation stresses and alongshore current magnitudes next a parametric study is conducted using the spectral model swan to analyze the nearshore impact of different wec array designs a realistic range of array configurations locations and incident wave conditions are examined and conditions that generate alongshore radiation stress gradients exceeding a chosen impact threshold on a uniform beach are identified finally the methodology is applied to two permitted wec test sites to assess the applicability of the results to sites with more realistic bathymetries for these sites the overall trends seen in the changes in wave height direction and radiation stress gradients in the lee of the array are similar to those seen in the parametric study however interactions between the wave field and real bathymetry induce additional alongshore variability in wave induced forcing results indicate that array induced changes can exceed the natural variability up to 15 of the time with certain array designs and locations keywords wave energy wave farm nearshore impact swan radiation stress 1 introduction for wave energy extraction to be commercially viable at utility scales wave energy converters wecs will need to be deployed in arrays that include several to hundreds of devices understanding the potential impacts of wec arrays on marine ecosystems and the coastal environment is crucial in order to ensure the sustainability and success of the nascent marine energy industry for wecs designed for offshore sites depth 35 m nearshore effects primarily arrive via the modified wave field created in the lee of a wec array interactions between wec devices and the incident wave field can be separated into interactions that modify the wave field within the array near field interactions and those that alter the wave climate in the lee of the array far field effects özkan haller et al 2017 the far field effects of wec arrays include a redirection of waves and a reduction in wave height in the lee of the array referred to as the wave shadow the extent and significance of the far field effects of wec arrays are a function of the array design its location and the incident wave conditions quantifying the changes in the far field wave conditions as a result of wec arrays is the first step in determining whether the wec arrays will influence nearshore processes the far field effects of wec arrays have been investigated using spectral models primarily the wave model swan booij et al 1999 in past studies although spectral models of this type do not capture the near field scattering processes that occur in wec arrays and handle diffraction in an approximate fashion they are less computationally expensive than phase resolving models and thus can be applied to large domains a necessity when studying far field effects özkan haller et al 2017 compared the results of model simulations of wec arrays using both a phase resolving model wamit and swan their results showed that swan can be effective at modeling the wave shadows in the lee of wec arrays when the majority of wave energy lies at periods near or above the peak period of wec energy extraction most past studies conducted using spectral models have represented an array as a single or multiple partially transmissible objects with a frequency independent transmission coefficient millar et al 2007 rusu and soares 2013 carballo and iglesias 2013 abanades et al 2014a 2014b 2015a 2015b and iglesias and carballo 2014 however use of a frequency independent transmission coefficient fails to capture the frequency dependent energy extraction characteristics that are inherent to wec devices the amount of energy that wec devices extract is a function of the device s power transfer function ptf defined as the proportion of available wave power extracted at each frequency by a particular device smith et al 2012 altered the swan source code to allow for a frequency dependent extraction of energy using a theoretical ptf to assess the far field effects of wec arrays in the uk in the present work wec devices are represented in swan through the external modification of the wave spectra at individual device locations within a wec array using an experimentally determined frequency dependent ptf established in an earlier laboratory study that utilized an array of point absorber wecs operating mostly in heave rhinefrank et al 2013 özkan haller et al 2017 changes in wave height and direction in the lee of wec arrays imply a change in nearshore forcing yet the forcing terms in the nearshore hydrodynamic balances are more directly quantified through the spatial gradients in radiation stress svendsen 2006 these gradients in radiation stress drive alongshore currents rip currents and nearshore sediment transport although some recent studies on far field effects of wec arrays have coupled spectral wave models with current or sediment transport morphologic models rusu and soares 2013 gonzalez santamaria et al 2013 mendoza et al 2014 abanades et al 2014a abanades et al 2014b abanades et al 2015a abanades et al 2015b many studies have only focused on the differences in wave height or wave power and direction in the lee of the array millar et al 2007 carballo and iglesias 2013 palha et al 2010 smith et al 2012 and iglesias and carballo 2014 in order to assess nearshore impact iglesias and carballo 2014 used indicators based on relative and absolute changes in wave power at the 10 m depth contour such an approach depends on changes in wave height but does not include changes in wave induced nearshore forcing directly in a follow on approach abanades et al 2014a 2014b 2015a 2015b modeled the response of a beach in cornwall england to storm conditions both with and without a wec array using a wave propagation model swan and a coupled coastal processes model xbeach to interpret the observed differences in predicted beach response they defined impact indicators based on changes in the sea bed level and net erosion rates 2014a 2014b 2015a and the reduction in wave heights at fixed distances 2 4 and 6 km in the lee of the array 2015a or change in wave power along a given contour and changes to the morphological classification of the beach due to the presence of the array 2015b in all such applications the designer must choose a particular threshold for impact that is representative of something useful or relevant to the study area changes in wave parameters are an obvious choice additionally coupling wave and coastal process models can provide detailed information of the potential changes to nearshore currents and sediment transport due to wec arrays however this is a more computational expensive approach in the present study we propose an alternative threshold for hydrodynamic impact based on changes in nearshore hydrodynamic forcing parameters since these parameters are calculated directly from the wave information this is a computationally inexpensive method for characterizing nearshore impact that is directly focused on the driver of physical change in the nearshore independent of the specific criterion the impact of wec arrays will ultimately depend on the characteristics of the array number of devices array configuration and distance from shore and the characteristics of the site wave climate bathymetry however the use of generalized descriptions of the impacts of wec arrays as a basic guideline in the design process would allow for a more rapid assessment of candidate sites one goal of this study is to assess nearshore impacts of wec arrays on a generic nearshore environment in order to draw general conclusions that could be used to facilitate the preliminary design and development of future arrays this study can be separated into three parts the objective of the first part is to develop and test a threshold metric for alongshore force f y that would link changes in the wave climate to meaningful changes in nearshore processes using this proposed threshold for alongshore force the objective of the second part is to determine how array spacing and distance from shore influence the nearshore forcing and to determine which array designs and incident wave conditions generate alongshore forces that exceed the f y threshold established in the previous section as a final objective we ask the question as to whether natural bathymetric and climatologic variability at actual field test sites will exceed the variability induced by the wec array in the final part we conduct a similar assessment of two existing wave energy sites in order to determine whether the general conclusions made in the idealized study are valid at field sites with realistic bathymetries 2 methodology for assessing nearshore impact changes in wave parameters such as wave height and direction induced by the energy extraction of wec arrays will alter the wave induced radiation stresses which are defined as the excess flux of momentum due to the presence of waves longuet higgins and stewart 1964 here the swan wave model is used to simulate wave transformation in the lee of wec arrays and to calculate the cross shore and alongshore wave radiation stress gradients 2 1 model overview swan is a third generation spectral wave model and uses the spectral action balance equation to calculate the transformation of wave spectra across realistic bathymetry the spectral action balance is shown in equation 1 1 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t where n is the wave action c x and c y are the velocity components of n in geographical space θ is the wave direction σ is the relative frequency and c σ and c θ are the propagation velocities of n in σ and θ space in this study the coordinate system is defined such that the positive x axis is pointing onshore and the y axis is parallel to the shoreline with the origin located at the offshore edge of the model domain the term s tot represents the sum of the physical processes that result in the generation redistribution and dissipation of wave energy the physical processes represented in swan include the processes of wave growth through energy transfer from wind energy generation nonlinear transfer of wave energy through quadruplet and triad interactions energy redistribution as well as the loss of energy through wave breaking bottom friction and white capping energy dissipation garcía medina et al 2013 previously demonstrated that neither bottom friction nor wind input are dominant processes for swan simulations over the shelf in the pacific northwest hence following their lead we only include depth induced breaking in our swan simulations as it is the most relevant physical dissipation mechanism and the primary process leading to wave induced currents although diffraction can be approximated by swan with a phase decoupled refraction diffraction approximation holthuijsen et al 2003 the spatial resolution used in this model was significantly finer 9 m smallest nested grid than the suggested resolution for the activation of diffraction swan team 2006a and the model did not converge when diffraction was activated in order to use the swan diffraction approximation it would have been necessary to coarsen the spatial resolution of the domain which essentially requires treating the wec array as a single object similar to past studies previous studies have demonstrated that diffraction is much less important when the input wave spectrum contains realistic directional spreading özkan haller et al 2017 as was done here for these reasons the swan diffraction approximation was not utilized in this study 2 2 wave forcing spatial gradients in radiation stresses result in cross shore and alongshore forces that generate changes in the mean water level wave setup and setdown and nearshore currents svendsen 2006 the depth averaged steady state formulations for wave induced forces in the cross shore f x and the alongshore f y direction used in swan are shown in equations 2 and 3 respectively 2 f x d s x x d x d s x y d y 3 f y d s y x d x d s y y d y where s xx s xy s yx and s yy are components of the radiation stress tensor swan team 2006b which are functions of wave energy and therefore the square of the wave height wave direction wave number and water depth as shown in equations 4 6 4 s x x e n cos 2 θ 1 1 2 5 s y y e n sin 2 θ 1 1 2 6 s x y s y x e n 2 s i n 2 θ where e is the wave energy θ is the wave direction and n is the ratio of group velocity to phase speed given by n 1 2 1 2 k h s i n h 2 k h with k as the wave number and h is the water depth we begin with the alongshore force balance since the wave driven alongshore current is easily one of the best understood nearshore processes the term d s x y d x results from the breaking of waves obliquely incident to the shoreline and it is the predominant driver of alongshore currents it is generally accepted that the primary dynamical balance is between the cross shore gradient in s xy and the frictional bottom stress acting on the alongshore current the net alongshore force across the surf zone is then given by the cross shore integral from the shoreline to the breaker line 7 x x s h o r e l i n e x x b r e a k i n g d s x y d x d x s x y x x b r e a k i n g s x y x x s h o r e l i n e s x y x x b r e a k i n g where x breaking is the cross shore position of the initiation of wave breaking and x shoreline is the shoreline where s xy 0 because s xy is a conserved quantity when energy is not lost to wave breaking i e offshore the s xy measured at any given point outside of the surf zone will therefore be representative of the total alongshore forcing in the surf zone for beaches with limited alongshore variability guza et al 1986 and feddersen et al 1998 have empirically validated this correlation in field studies and showed an approximately linear relationship between s xy ρg measured outside the surf zone at approximately the 6 5 m depth contour and 8 m depth contour respectively and the observed alongshore current velocity see guza et al 1986 fig 12 and feddersen et al 1998 fig 4 here we define 20 cm s as a threshold alongshore current magnitude with currents above 20 cm s considered significant this threshold is of course arbitrary but is a reasonable bound the initiation of sediment mobility for example a simple critical shields stress calculation suggests that a steady current of 20 cm s would begin to mobilize very fine sands e g reeve et al 2012 including wave induced motions would begin to mobilize even coarser sediment using the guza et al 1986 data set this alongshore current value translates to a threshold s xy ρg value of approximately 31 2 cm2 at the 6 5 m contour line or a s xy ρ value of 0 0306 m3 s2 in order to relate the alongshore current of this magnitude to value of the local alongshore forcing f y we ran a set of simulations using swan over a generic planar beach and compared the resulting s xy and f y values the beach had a slope of 1 25 chosen to roughly match the average measured slope of the field site in guza et al 1986 the simulations use a range of significant wave heights 0 5 m 6 m and dominant wave directions 0 45 the radiation stress was calculated using equations 4 6 at the 6 5 m contour line chosen to match the location of the s xy observations using the significant wave height calculated in swan and the remaining parameters determined using linear wave theory the alongshore force f y was calculated by swan and was assessed at the point of interest defined in this study as the location of maximum dissipation the resulting radiation stress s xy and alongshore force f y were plotted as a function of root mean square wave height h rms and the mean wave direction θ m fig 1 as expected both s xy and f y showed an increase in magnitude with increasing h rms and θ m by finding the f y contour that most closely matches the s xy ρ 0 0314 m3 s2 contour line we were able to map the chosen s xy ρ threshold value to an equivalent f y value which was found to be 0 44 n m2 to determine whether the alongshore force value at the location of maximum dissipation is dependent on the slope of the surf zone the same process was repeated using the feddersen et al 1998 data set taken from a field site near duck north carolina with this data set an alongshore current velocity of 20 cm s translated to a threshold s xy ρ of approximately 0 08 m3 s2 at the 8 m contour line the same input conditions were then used in swan simulations on a planar beach with a slope of 1 100 which roughly matched the average beach slope to the 8 m contour at the field site following the methodology described above the threshold f y value was found to be 0 42 n m2 which is very similar to the f y value of 0 44 n m2 determined from the guza et al 1986 data set suggesting that this threshold forcing value is applicable on a range of beach slopes using f y 0 44 n m2 as a threshold for impact we examined which wec array configurations lead to changes in f y δf y that exceed this threshold 3 parametric study of impact 3 1 model domain for the parametric study on the nearshore impacts of wec arrays we used a 24 km by 70 km model domain discretized into a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 200 m within this domain four smaller higher resolution grids were nested the bathymetry was an alongshore uniform generic shelf and planar beach with wave propagation starting in deep water the offshore section was a constant 400 m depth with a cross shore length of 2 km followed by a 2 km shelf break section of 1 10 slope and a 20 km nearshore section with slope of 1 100 the idealized bathymetry with the location and size of the nested grids is shown in fig 2 within the outer 200 m resolution grid there was nested a 20 km square grid at 50 m resolution centered in the alongshore grid 1 wec devices could only be represented at the outer edge of nested grids because the array configurations included two rows two high resolution 9 m grid were used 2 7 km 9 km and 2 2 km 8 6 km grids 2 and 3 respectively which varied in distance from the shore wec arrays were either 5 10 or 15 km offshore shoreward of the wec array grid was a nested nearshore grid of 18 m resolution grid 4 in swan the wave action density spectrum is discretized into a given number of frequency and directional bins as defined by the user trials were run with 180 directional bins over a 360 directional range the wave action density spectrum was discretized logarithmically into 40 frequency bins 0 04118 0 5 hz which is consistent with the frequency spread and resolution used in other similar studies using swan 3 2 input conditions all trials in the parametric study were initiated with jonswap spectra hasselmann et al 1973 at the offshore boundary trials were conducted with two input significant wave heights 2 m and 6 m and nine input peak periods 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 16 and 18 s all trials were conducted with a directional wave field with shore normal as the dominant direction and two levels of directional spreading were assessed 14 and 35 a total of 36 sets of wave conditions were simulated trials were conducted with these input conditions using two array configurations closely spaced and widely spaced and with arrays located at three distances from shore 5 10 and 15 km simulations were also made without an array for each set of input conditions a total of 252 trials were conducted 3 3 representation of wecs in swan the ptf versus frequency as specified for the array of point absorber wecs employed in the swan modeling is shown in fig 3 as shown the laboratory ptf was scaled to have a peak period of extraction at 9 s which is the average annual energy period on the oregon coast lenee bluhm et al 2011 the ptf represents the proportion of wave energy extracted across the diameter of a device as a function of frequency subtracting the ptf from 1 at each frequency therefore gives the proportion of wave energy not captured by the device as is evident from fig 3 the ptf measured in the laboratory work exceeds one for a narrow range of frequencies this is indicative of increased energy capture efficiency and is made possible through the process of wave diffraction in the laboratory tests in order to capture this behavior in the model it would be necessary to artificially increase the device diameter so it could capture more energy instead where the experimental ptf was greater than 1 0 we chose to cap the ptf at a value of 1 0 meaning the simulated field scale wecs are slightly less efficient than the lab scale wecs wec devices were incorporated in the model domain using the following method first swan was used to propagate waves from the offshore boundary to the edge of nest 2 where the first row of the wec array is located see fig 2 the swan produced spectra were externally modified at the location of each wec device in row 1 using 8 s a f t e r f s b e f o r e f 1 p t f f where s before is the spectral energy density in the wave field just offshore of the device and s after is the spectral energy density in the wave field just onshore of the device swan was then used to propagate these modified waves through nest 2 to the edge of nest 3 where the second row of wec devices is located the wave spectra were then externally modified using the same method at the locations of each wec device in the second row the resulting alongshore varying wave field was then propagated through nests 3 and 4 to the shoreline here we study large scale wec arrays that included 60 devices in two staggered rows each device had a diameter of 18 m to assess the importance of spacing between devices both closely spaced and widely spaced arrays were simulated for each set of input wave conditions closely spaced arrays had a distance of 72 m 4 times the wec diameter between devices and rows and widely spaced arrays had a distance of 180 m 10 times the wec diameter between devices and rows array spacing and configuration were selected based on past studies on optimal wec array configurations beels et al 2009 2010a 2010b babarit 2013 palha et al 2010 the array configurations used in the swan simulations are shown in fig 4 3 4 model outputs for each trial the significant wave height h s mean wave direction θ m peak period t p and the wave induced forces f x and f y were calculated at each grid point across the domain spatially periodic variations in h s θ m f x and f y were seen in the lee of the arrays the short scale device scale variations were dependent on model directional resolution and did not appear to converge even with directional resolution as high as 720 bins since our focus here is on the changes caused by the presence of the wec array over surf zone length scales and since wave diffraction becomes much more important at short length scales a resolution of 180 direction bins was selected and the output forcing parameters were lowpass filtered in the forward and reverse alongshore direction with a 270 m cutoff this filter removed much of the differences in the output parameters as a function of directional resolution and meant that model results were converged even in the absence of diffraction in order to best characterize the changes in the surf zone where nearshore forcing is strongest the cross shore location of maximum dissipation was chosen for the analysis the model was run both with and without the wec array and the net difference δf y at the location of maximum dissipation in the direct lee of the array was determined and demeaned for each trial trials generating δf y above the defined threshold were then identified the net difference δf x was similarly found at the location of maximum dissipation and both the total change and the percent change were calculated as an additional indication of the changes in wave field due to the presence of the wec array the changes in significant wave height h s and mean wave direction θ m due to the wec array were determined 3 5 model results 3 5 1 changes in significant wave height hs and mean wave direction θm the modeled changes in h s and θ m were used to broadly assess how input conditions array configurations and distance between the wec array and the shoreline affected the nearshore wave conditions figs 5 and 6 show the differences in h s 5a and 5c and θ m 5b and 5d between simulations with and without a wec array in the lee of both widely spaced 5a and 5b and closely spaced 5c and 5d wec arrays across the domain for trials with h s 6 m t p 12 s directional spread of 14⁰ fig 5 and 35 fig 6 and the array located 15 km from shore the differences were found by subtracting the model results across the domain for each parameter from simulations with a wec array from simulations without a wec array the reduction in h s δh s and the change in the mean wave direction δθ m due to the wec array are clearly visible in figs 5 and 6 the alongshore gradients in wave height are reduced within the shadow in the lee of the array because the effect of directional spreading allows wave energy to propagate into the lee of the array as the waves proceed toward shore both directional spreading and the distance between the wec and the shore were important factors in the magnitude of the changes in wave parameters seen in the nearshore when the wec arrays were located closer to shore the wave field had less distance to recover and the wave shadow essentially impinged on the nearshore zone leading to the largest differences in the surf zone between cases with and without arrays see figs 7 10 high directional spreading leads to faster reduction of the wave shadow in the lee of the array this resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of δh s but an increase in the alongshore extent of the wec shadow the changes in θ m in the direct lee of the array were more significant in cases with high directional spreading the impact of low versus high directional spread is evident in the plots of δh s and δθ m shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively with an input h s 6 m an input t p 12 s and an array located 15 km from shore wec array spacing also played a significant role in the magnitude of δh s and δθ m in the lee of the array when devices were closer together more significant reductions in both h s and θ m were seen in the immediate lee of the array see figs 5 and 6 as directional spreading increases or array distance from shore increases the effect of array spacing is less evident in the nearshore see figs 8 and 10 the maximum percent reduction in significant wave height at the edge of the surf zone defined as the nearshore location of maximum wave height was 8 3 and the maximum change in mean wave direction at the same location was less than 1 0 25 both maxima occurred in the lee of a closely spaced array located 5 km from shore the smallest changes in wave parameters in the nearshore occurred with a widely spaced array located 15 km from shore with a less than 0 1 reduction in wave height for some input conditions 3 5 2 changes in cross shore force fx cross shore force f x and alongshore force f y are dependent on the gradient of the wave induced radiation stresses and are strongest in the surf zone due to wave breaking the decrease in h s in the lee of the array demonstrated in the previous section resulted in a similar decrease in the magnitude of f x at the location of maximum dissipation to visualize the decrease in f x in the surf zone alongshore f x transects were plotted at the location of maximum dissipation for trials with an input h s 6 m an input t p 12 s low directional spread 14⁰ and with arrays located 5 and 10 km from shore fig 7 the maximum decrease and percent decrease in f x at the location of interest in the direct lee of the array were found for all trials the maximum percent change for all cases was 17 1 which occurred in the lee of a closely spaced array located 5 km from shore in trials with low directional spread the maximum decrease in f x at the location of interest for each trial can be seen in fig 8 the impact of this reduction in forcing would be a reduction in shoreline water elevations wave setup due to the shadowing effect of the array 3 5 3 changes in alongshore force fy alongshore variability in f x and f y both contribute to the formation of rip currents in a complex balance alongshore currents and thus alongshore sediment transport are driven by f y fy is similar to f x in that it is a function of the spatial gradient of the wave induced radiation stresses and is also strongest in the outer portion of the surf zone also because f y depends on the radiation stress component s xy its magnitude and direction are highly dependent on the incident wave angle close to shore to visualize the spatial variability in f y in the surf zone alongshore f y transects were plotted at the location of maximum dissipation for trials with an input h s 6 m an input t p 12 s and low directional spread 14⁰ fig 9 the δθ m on either side of the array results in a spatial variability in the sign of f y the wave induced forcing on either side of the array is therefore directed toward the area directly behind the array from all trials the maximum change in the magnitude of f y δf y at the location of maximum dissipation in the direct lee of the array were found larger input h s and t p values were found to result in larger δf y values in the surf zone only trials with an input h s 6 m and an input t p greater than 8 s resulted in δf y values over the chosen threshold the trials that met the threshold δf y value are shown in fig 10 similar to the previously discussed parameters the distance between the wec array and the shore was found to have a significant impact on the magnitude the f y generated in the surf zone only trials with an array located 5 km from shore result in δf y values over the established threshold shown in fig 10 although an increase in directional spread resulted in a decrease in δh s significant changes in f y in the surf zone were still seen in trials with high directional spread with an array located 5 km from shore a total of 11 trials were found to meet the threshold δf y value six of which are from cases with low directional spread and the remaining five from cases with high directional spread fig 10 wec array spacing had an effect on both the magnitude and the extent of the far field changes closely spaced arrays resulted in a significantly larger change in wave parameters in the direct lee of the array fig 10 the magnitude of δf y at the location of maximum dissipation was found to be larger in the lee of closely spaced arrays in all trials but the differences between cases based on wec spacing decreased with increasing distance from the array and with increasing directional spread no trials with a widely spaced array resulted in δf y values above the established threshold 4 nearshore impact at field sites 4 1 model domain to assess the applicability of the conclusions made in the parametric study to sites with more realistic bathymetries the same methodology was applied to two northwest national marine renewable energy center nnmrec test sites off the coast of newport oregon usa the north energy test site nets located north of yaquina head approximately 5 km offshore and the south energy test site sets located south of newport approximately 11 km offshore the domain bathymetry was generated using the 1 3 arc second central oregon coast digital elevation map from the national geophysical data center carignan et al 2009 the same 17 km by 75 km local domain was used for both the nets and sets sites fig 11 the domain was rotated 5 so the coastline was approximately parallel to the offshore domain boundary and the bathymetry was filtered using a 54 m low pass filter representing three grid points in both the cross shore and alongshore direction similar to the parametric study the domain was discretized into a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 200 m within the domain two sets of five smaller higher resolution grids were nested one for each site the spatial resolution increased from 200 m in the largest grid to 50 m in the first nested grid grid 1 followed by 30 m in the second nested grid grid 2 similar to the parametric study a spatial resolution of 9 m was used in the vicinity of the wec array grids 3 and 4 followed by a spatial resolution of 18 m in the nearshore zone grid 5 fig 11 shows these five nested grids for each of the study sites the wave action density spectra were discretized into 180 directional bins over a 360 directional range and discretized logarithmically into 40 frequency bins 0 04118 0 5 hz model wec arrays were located approximately equidistantly from the east and west boundaries of the permitted test sites but the arrays extended beyond the north and south boundaries of the test sites fig 11 4 2 model validation the swan model was first validated using existing data from an acoustic wave and current meter awac previously deployed within the model domain vardaro et al 2011 the awac was deployed from march to august 2011 at a location just south of yaquina head shown in fig 11 model validation runs used input wave spectra derived from a wavewatch iii hindcast for the pacific northwest garcía medina et al 2014 model runs were conducted for each hour of the deployment period the significant wave height measured by the awac was compared with the significant wave height calculated by swan at the device location the awac collected wave height measurements every 80 min and swan was run using hourly wave spectra so the swan results were interpolated to the awac sampling interval and the error statistics were calculated using the interpolated values fig 12 shows a time series of modeled and measured significant wave height for the duration of the awac deployment the model achieved a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 82 a root mean square error rmse of 0 32 m and an average percent error of 15 8 which is very comparable to similar studies for example by abanades et al 2014a and 2014b swan was run in stationary mode without active wind generation which may explain some of the difference between the modeled and measured data however the goal of the study was not to replicate the hindcast conditions as accurately as possible but instead to ensure that the nested modeled domains and bathymetry functioned appropriately 4 3 input conditions the input directional wave spectra for the nets and sets simulations were obtained from a 2005 2011 coupled wavewatch iii and swan hindcast for the pacific northwest the low resolution swan domain extended from northern california to washington and covered the entire continental shelf garcía medina et al 2014 our local higher resolution 17 km 75 km swan domain that includes the nets and sets sites was then nested into this coupled system along with the additional 5 nested grids for each site the wave processes included in these swan runs are the same as were included in our parametric study and in the previous studies of this site garcía medina et al 2013 2014 input conditions for the nets and sets trials were selected to be representative of the normal range of wave conditions experienced on the oregon coast hourly wave spectra from 2005 to 2011 at the offshore boundary of the low resolution swan domain of garcía medina et al 2014 were sorted based on their probability of occurrence first the peak period t p significant wave height h s and mean wave direction θ m were extracted at each point along the offshore boundary of the swan domain for each hour in the seven year hindcast each parameter was averaged across the offshore boundary to generate a single set triplet of peak parameters for each hour the triplets were then separated into 120 bins each with the same number of triplets and therefore the same probability of occurring using a 3 dimensional probability density function with 6 frequency bins 4 wave direction bins and 5 significant wave height bins in each group the centroid of the set of triplets was computed and the hindcast hour with the wave parameters closest to the parameters of the centroid was found the 120 h selected using this method were then used as the input conditions in the final trials the t p used in the final trials ranged from 7 75 s to 17 77s the h s ranged from 0 93 m to 6 26 m and θ m ranged from 52 to 82 the directional spread ranged from 17 5 to 54 5 wecs were represented in swan using the same technique as in the parametric study each wec array included 60 devices each with a diameter of 18 m positioned in two staggered rows both closely spaced and widely spaced arrays were simulated at each test site for each set of input wave conditions see section 3 3 for each set of input conditions trials were conducted twice with a wec array in the nets site once with a closely spaced array and once with a widely spaced array twice with an array in the sets site and finally a single time without an array for a total of five model runs similar to the parametric study all model outputs were lowpass filtered in the forward and reverse alongshore direction with a 270 m cutoff see section 3 4 4 4 model results 4 4 1 real sites the point of interest in the nets and sets trials was defined as the mean location of maximum dissipation in the direct lee of the array the alongshore averaged location of the maximum dissipation in the direct lee of the array was determined for each trial and δf y were assessed at this cross shore location nonrealistic force values were seen directly adjacent to coastal features extending into the surf zone to address this the areas directly adjacent to the newport jetties and yaquina head the two major coastal features in the domain were removed from the domain and only open coastal regions were included in the analysis the area removed was the same in both the sets and nets domains and can be seen in figs 13 and 15 plots of h s at the sets site are shown in fig 13 from a trial with input conditions t p h s θ m 12 61s 5 45 m 27 11⁰ a total of seven trials with a closely spaced array at the sets site resulted in a change in alongshore force magnitude δf y above the threshold impact value δf y 0 44 n m2 at the point of interest along with three trials with a widely spaced array all seven trials that met the threshold δf y value had an input h s over 5 m and four had an hs over 5 5 m and all had a t p of over 13 s of the seven sets of input conditions that met the threshold with a closely spaced array three of those sets also met the threshold δf y in trials with a widely space array the previously discussed analysis identified 10 trials that generated significant δf y values at the location of maximum dissipation at some alongshore location however this analysis did not give any indication of the alongshore extent of these changes to address this the exceedance length was calculated for each of the trials that resulted in δf y above the impact threshold the exceedance length defined as the total length of coastline where the threshold was exceeded at the location of maximum dissipation was determined by multiplying the number of points where the threshold was exceeded by the grid resolution the exceedance length for trials at the sets field site ranged from 126 m to 2988 m with a mean of 1148 m and a standard deviation of 851 m the exceedance length for each trial that exceeded the δf y threshold is shown in fig 14 plots of the difference in significant wave height hs at the nets site can be seen in fig 15 from trials with t p h s θ m 12 61s 5 45 m 27 11⁰ similar to the sets site the area adjacent to yaquina head and the newport jetties were excluded from the analysis slightly more than half of the trials 65 out of 120 with a closely spaced array at the nets site led to δf y above the threshold of the 120 trials with a widely spaced array 38 resulted in a significant δf y at the location of maximum dissipation input conditions that result in δf y over the threshold value can be seen in fig 14c and d colored dots similar to the sets site the exceedance length was calculated for each of the 103 trials that exceeded the impact threshold the maximum exceedance length was found to be 3762 m and the minimum length was 18 m with a mean of 656 m and a standard deviation of 743 m although significantly more trials met the threshold δf y at the nets site the mean exceedance length for these trials was much smaller 1148 m at the sets site versus 656 m at the nets site these results suggest that arrays close to shore have a greater chance of influencing nearshore processes but in many cases will affect a shorter distance along the coastline exceedance lengths for each trial are shown in fig 14 4 4 2 comparison between real sites and parametric study the results of the sets and nets trials were compared to the results of the parametric study with the array located 10 km and 5 km from shore respectively similar trends were seen in the changes in wave parameters in both the parametric study and at the real sites including a decrease in the h s and f x in the lee of the array and a redirection of waves on either side of the array the wec array designs that resulted in the largest δf y at the field sites were consistent with those found in the parametric study with the largest changes occurring in the lee of a closely spaced array located close to shore in all cases the threshold value was much more likely to be exceeded in trials with large t p and h s values however a much wider range of conditions were found to generate δf y that exceeded the threshold at the real sites with wave heights as small as 2 m and wave periods as low as 8 s resulting in δf y over the threshold in some cases fig 14 although the wave conditions large h s and t p and array configurations closely spaced that led to larger δf y values were consistent with the parameterized study the spatial variability of δf y appears to be heavily influenced by local bathymetry alongshore δf y transects can be seen in fig 16 from trials with t p h s θ m 12 61s 5 45 m 27 11⁰ coastal features that extended out beyond the surf zone primarily yaquina head the newport jetties and a series of small islands resulted in discontinuities in the alongshore δf y transect these transects contain significantly more alongshore variability in δf y when compared to the alongshore δf y transects from the parameterized study and the δf y variability at the scale of individual bathymetric features was found to be of similar magnitude to any observed variability at the scale of the entire wec array this increase in the spatial variability of alongshore forcing could have significant implications for nearshore circulation 4 5 analysis of real sites the standard deviation in f y was determined at each point across the domain using the filtered results for all 120 trials and was seen as an indicator of the natural variability in f y at each the two test sites in addition to determining whether wec arrays induce δf y over the established threshold at the location of maximum dissipation we also assessed whether the wec arrays induce δf y that exceed the natural variability in these regions to do this the number of wave conditions out of the climatology of 120 where the δf y exceeds the standard deviation was determined for each point across the surf zone because the input conditions in the trials were selected to be representative of the annual wave climate at the site the percent of trials with δf y exceeding the standard deviation at each location was considered to be the percent of time that the standard deviation was exceeded at this location the percent exceedance was assessed in the surf zone only because the location of maximum dissipation varies between trials the percent exceedance was assessed from the maximum dissipation line the farthest offshore up to the shoreline fig 17 shows the percent exceedance across this area at the nets site certain locations in the domain experience δf y due to the wec array that exceed the standard deviation at that location up to 15 8 of the time in the lee of a closely spaced array and up to 3 3 of the time in the lee of a widely spaced array at the sets site the δf y due to the wec array exceeded the standard deviation up to 4 2 in some locations modeling sediment transport in the lee of an array would be an important step in order to determine whether the aggregate nearshore effects of these changes in alongshore forcing due to wec arrays could significantly impact long term sediment transport and coastal processes in order to test the sensitivity of our results to the chosen alongshore current threshold of 20 cm s see section 2 2 we compared the number of trials that exceeded the δf y threshold using the δf y thresholds associated with current velocities of 10 cm s and 30 cm s as well at the nets site we found that the number of trials that exceed the δf y thresholds associated with current velocities 10 20 30 cm s were 81 38 11 for a widely spaced array and 90 65 35 for a closely spaced array at the sets site we found that the number of trials that exceed the δf y thresholds were 21 3 2 for a widely spaced array and 17 7 6 for a closely spaced array this gives some perspective as to how sensitive the results are to the chosen design impact threshold 5 conclusions a new methodology for assessing the potential nearshore impact of wec arrays was developed based on the net change in hydrodynamic forcing in the alongshore direction induced by the array a metric for impact was established based on the linkage between alongshore radiation stress and alongshore current magnitude as demonstrated in field observations using the new indicator of impact a parametric study was conducted using the swan model wec arrays were incorporated in the swan domain through the external modification of the wave spectra at the device locations using an experimentally determined ptf that allows for a realistic representation of energy extraction by wec devices larger maximum changes in the magnitude of the alongshore forcing δf y induced by wec arrays corresponded to larger input significant wave heights and larger input peak periods changes in wave parameters in the nearshore were found to increase with a decrease in the distance between the array and the shore and with a decrease in directional spreading implying that the largest differences in the nearshore forcing due to wec arrays will occur in high energy swell seas with a wec array located close to shore closely spaced arrays had a much larger impact on wave height and direction in the direct lee of the array but the differences between cases due to wec spacing decreased with increasing distance from the array the same methodology was then applied to two permitted nnmrec test sites after first validating the wave model for the region and developing a representative wave climatology results from the parametric trials were compared to the field trials to assess the validity of the conclusions made in the parametric study when applied to sites with more realistic bathymetries similar trends were seen in the wave conditions and array configurations that resulted in δf y values above the established threshold however the alongshore variability of the δf y due to the arrays was also significantly influenced by the local bathymetry additionally a larger number of trials were found to result in significant δf y when the array was closer to shore but the average exceedance length for these trials was shorter with a mean exceedance length of 1148 m when the array was 11 km offshore versus 656 m when the array was 5 km offshore finally as an additional measure of nearshore impact the induced δf y were compared to the existing natural variability without the array based on the wave climatology it was demonstrated that for the analyzed wec array configurations array induced changes could exceed the natural variability as much as 15 of the time more research is necessary to determine how the δf y at the shoreline could influence long term sediment transport and other coastal processes acknowledgements this material is

23314,an alternative metric for assessing nearshore hydrodynamic impact due to wave energy converter wec arrays is presented that is based on the modeled changes in alongshore radiation stress gradients in the lee of the array the metric is developed using a previously observed relationship between measured radiation stresses and alongshore current magnitudes next a parametric study is conducted using the spectral model swan to analyze the nearshore impact of different wec array designs a realistic range of array configurations locations and incident wave conditions are examined and conditions that generate alongshore radiation stress gradients exceeding a chosen impact threshold on a uniform beach are identified finally the methodology is applied to two permitted wec test sites to assess the applicability of the results to sites with more realistic bathymetries for these sites the overall trends seen in the changes in wave height direction and radiation stress gradients in the lee of the array are similar to those seen in the parametric study however interactions between the wave field and real bathymetry induce additional alongshore variability in wave induced forcing results indicate that array induced changes can exceed the natural variability up to 15 of the time with certain array designs and locations keywords wave energy wave farm nearshore impact swan radiation stress 1 introduction for wave energy extraction to be commercially viable at utility scales wave energy converters wecs will need to be deployed in arrays that include several to hundreds of devices understanding the potential impacts of wec arrays on marine ecosystems and the coastal environment is crucial in order to ensure the sustainability and success of the nascent marine energy industry for wecs designed for offshore sites depth 35 m nearshore effects primarily arrive via the modified wave field created in the lee of a wec array interactions between wec devices and the incident wave field can be separated into interactions that modify the wave field within the array near field interactions and those that alter the wave climate in the lee of the array far field effects özkan haller et al 2017 the far field effects of wec arrays include a redirection of waves and a reduction in wave height in the lee of the array referred to as the wave shadow the extent and significance of the far field effects of wec arrays are a function of the array design its location and the incident wave conditions quantifying the changes in the far field wave conditions as a result of wec arrays is the first step in determining whether the wec arrays will influence nearshore processes the far field effects of wec arrays have been investigated using spectral models primarily the wave model swan booij et al 1999 in past studies although spectral models of this type do not capture the near field scattering processes that occur in wec arrays and handle diffraction in an approximate fashion they are less computationally expensive than phase resolving models and thus can be applied to large domains a necessity when studying far field effects özkan haller et al 2017 compared the results of model simulations of wec arrays using both a phase resolving model wamit and swan their results showed that swan can be effective at modeling the wave shadows in the lee of wec arrays when the majority of wave energy lies at periods near or above the peak period of wec energy extraction most past studies conducted using spectral models have represented an array as a single or multiple partially transmissible objects with a frequency independent transmission coefficient millar et al 2007 rusu and soares 2013 carballo and iglesias 2013 abanades et al 2014a 2014b 2015a 2015b and iglesias and carballo 2014 however use of a frequency independent transmission coefficient fails to capture the frequency dependent energy extraction characteristics that are inherent to wec devices the amount of energy that wec devices extract is a function of the device s power transfer function ptf defined as the proportion of available wave power extracted at each frequency by a particular device smith et al 2012 altered the swan source code to allow for a frequency dependent extraction of energy using a theoretical ptf to assess the far field effects of wec arrays in the uk in the present work wec devices are represented in swan through the external modification of the wave spectra at individual device locations within a wec array using an experimentally determined frequency dependent ptf established in an earlier laboratory study that utilized an array of point absorber wecs operating mostly in heave rhinefrank et al 2013 özkan haller et al 2017 changes in wave height and direction in the lee of wec arrays imply a change in nearshore forcing yet the forcing terms in the nearshore hydrodynamic balances are more directly quantified through the spatial gradients in radiation stress svendsen 2006 these gradients in radiation stress drive alongshore currents rip currents and nearshore sediment transport although some recent studies on far field effects of wec arrays have coupled spectral wave models with current or sediment transport morphologic models rusu and soares 2013 gonzalez santamaria et al 2013 mendoza et al 2014 abanades et al 2014a abanades et al 2014b abanades et al 2015a abanades et al 2015b many studies have only focused on the differences in wave height or wave power and direction in the lee of the array millar et al 2007 carballo and iglesias 2013 palha et al 2010 smith et al 2012 and iglesias and carballo 2014 in order to assess nearshore impact iglesias and carballo 2014 used indicators based on relative and absolute changes in wave power at the 10 m depth contour such an approach depends on changes in wave height but does not include changes in wave induced nearshore forcing directly in a follow on approach abanades et al 2014a 2014b 2015a 2015b modeled the response of a beach in cornwall england to storm conditions both with and without a wec array using a wave propagation model swan and a coupled coastal processes model xbeach to interpret the observed differences in predicted beach response they defined impact indicators based on changes in the sea bed level and net erosion rates 2014a 2014b 2015a and the reduction in wave heights at fixed distances 2 4 and 6 km in the lee of the array 2015a or change in wave power along a given contour and changes to the morphological classification of the beach due to the presence of the array 2015b in all such applications the designer must choose a particular threshold for impact that is representative of something useful or relevant to the study area changes in wave parameters are an obvious choice additionally coupling wave and coastal process models can provide detailed information of the potential changes to nearshore currents and sediment transport due to wec arrays however this is a more computational expensive approach in the present study we propose an alternative threshold for hydrodynamic impact based on changes in nearshore hydrodynamic forcing parameters since these parameters are calculated directly from the wave information this is a computationally inexpensive method for characterizing nearshore impact that is directly focused on the driver of physical change in the nearshore independent of the specific criterion the impact of wec arrays will ultimately depend on the characteristics of the array number of devices array configuration and distance from shore and the characteristics of the site wave climate bathymetry however the use of generalized descriptions of the impacts of wec arrays as a basic guideline in the design process would allow for a more rapid assessment of candidate sites one goal of this study is to assess nearshore impacts of wec arrays on a generic nearshore environment in order to draw general conclusions that could be used to facilitate the preliminary design and development of future arrays this study can be separated into three parts the objective of the first part is to develop and test a threshold metric for alongshore force f y that would link changes in the wave climate to meaningful changes in nearshore processes using this proposed threshold for alongshore force the objective of the second part is to determine how array spacing and distance from shore influence the nearshore forcing and to determine which array designs and incident wave conditions generate alongshore forces that exceed the f y threshold established in the previous section as a final objective we ask the question as to whether natural bathymetric and climatologic variability at actual field test sites will exceed the variability induced by the wec array in the final part we conduct a similar assessment of two existing wave energy sites in order to determine whether the general conclusions made in the idealized study are valid at field sites with realistic bathymetries 2 methodology for assessing nearshore impact changes in wave parameters such as wave height and direction induced by the energy extraction of wec arrays will alter the wave induced radiation stresses which are defined as the excess flux of momentum due to the presence of waves longuet higgins and stewart 1964 here the swan wave model is used to simulate wave transformation in the lee of wec arrays and to calculate the cross shore and alongshore wave radiation stress gradients 2 1 model overview swan is a third generation spectral wave model and uses the spectral action balance equation to calculate the transformation of wave spectra across realistic bathymetry the spectral action balance is shown in equation 1 1 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t where n is the wave action c x and c y are the velocity components of n in geographical space θ is the wave direction σ is the relative frequency and c σ and c θ are the propagation velocities of n in σ and θ space in this study the coordinate system is defined such that the positive x axis is pointing onshore and the y axis is parallel to the shoreline with the origin located at the offshore edge of the model domain the term s tot represents the sum of the physical processes that result in the generation redistribution and dissipation of wave energy the physical processes represented in swan include the processes of wave growth through energy transfer from wind energy generation nonlinear transfer of wave energy through quadruplet and triad interactions energy redistribution as well as the loss of energy through wave breaking bottom friction and white capping energy dissipation garcía medina et al 2013 previously demonstrated that neither bottom friction nor wind input are dominant processes for swan simulations over the shelf in the pacific northwest hence following their lead we only include depth induced breaking in our swan simulations as it is the most relevant physical dissipation mechanism and the primary process leading to wave induced currents although diffraction can be approximated by swan with a phase decoupled refraction diffraction approximation holthuijsen et al 2003 the spatial resolution used in this model was significantly finer 9 m smallest nested grid than the suggested resolution for the activation of diffraction swan team 2006a and the model did not converge when diffraction was activated in order to use the swan diffraction approximation it would have been necessary to coarsen the spatial resolution of the domain which essentially requires treating the wec array as a single object similar to past studies previous studies have demonstrated that diffraction is much less important when the input wave spectrum contains realistic directional spreading özkan haller et al 2017 as was done here for these reasons the swan diffraction approximation was not utilized in this study 2 2 wave forcing spatial gradients in radiation stresses result in cross shore and alongshore forces that generate changes in the mean water level wave setup and setdown and nearshore currents svendsen 2006 the depth averaged steady state formulations for wave induced forces in the cross shore f x and the alongshore f y direction used in swan are shown in equations 2 and 3 respectively 2 f x d s x x d x d s x y d y 3 f y d s y x d x d s y y d y where s xx s xy s yx and s yy are components of the radiation stress tensor swan team 2006b which are functions of wave energy and therefore the square of the wave height wave direction wave number and water depth as shown in equations 4 6 4 s x x e n cos 2 θ 1 1 2 5 s y y e n sin 2 θ 1 1 2 6 s x y s y x e n 2 s i n 2 θ where e is the wave energy θ is the wave direction and n is the ratio of group velocity to phase speed given by n 1 2 1 2 k h s i n h 2 k h with k as the wave number and h is the water depth we begin with the alongshore force balance since the wave driven alongshore current is easily one of the best understood nearshore processes the term d s x y d x results from the breaking of waves obliquely incident to the shoreline and it is the predominant driver of alongshore currents it is generally accepted that the primary dynamical balance is between the cross shore gradient in s xy and the frictional bottom stress acting on the alongshore current the net alongshore force across the surf zone is then given by the cross shore integral from the shoreline to the breaker line 7 x x s h o r e l i n e x x b r e a k i n g d s x y d x d x s x y x x b r e a k i n g s x y x x s h o r e l i n e s x y x x b r e a k i n g where x breaking is the cross shore position of the initiation of wave breaking and x shoreline is the shoreline where s xy 0 because s xy is a conserved quantity when energy is not lost to wave breaking i e offshore the s xy measured at any given point outside of the surf zone will therefore be representative of the total alongshore forcing in the surf zone for beaches with limited alongshore variability guza et al 1986 and feddersen et al 1998 have empirically validated this correlation in field studies and showed an approximately linear relationship between s xy ρg measured outside the surf zone at approximately the 6 5 m depth contour and 8 m depth contour respectively and the observed alongshore current velocity see guza et al 1986 fig 12 and feddersen et al 1998 fig 4 here we define 20 cm s as a threshold alongshore current magnitude with currents above 20 cm s considered significant this threshold is of course arbitrary but is a reasonable bound the initiation of sediment mobility for example a simple critical shields stress calculation suggests that a steady current of 20 cm s would begin to mobilize very fine sands e g reeve et al 2012 including wave induced motions would begin to mobilize even coarser sediment using the guza et al 1986 data set this alongshore current value translates to a threshold s xy ρg value of approximately 31 2 cm2 at the 6 5 m contour line or a s xy ρ value of 0 0306 m3 s2 in order to relate the alongshore current of this magnitude to value of the local alongshore forcing f y we ran a set of simulations using swan over a generic planar beach and compared the resulting s xy and f y values the beach had a slope of 1 25 chosen to roughly match the average measured slope of the field site in guza et al 1986 the simulations use a range of significant wave heights 0 5 m 6 m and dominant wave directions 0 45 the radiation stress was calculated using equations 4 6 at the 6 5 m contour line chosen to match the location of the s xy observations using the significant wave height calculated in swan and the remaining parameters determined using linear wave theory the alongshore force f y was calculated by swan and was assessed at the point of interest defined in this study as the location of maximum dissipation the resulting radiation stress s xy and alongshore force f y were plotted as a function of root mean square wave height h rms and the mean wave direction θ m fig 1 as expected both s xy and f y showed an increase in magnitude with increasing h rms and θ m by finding the f y contour that most closely matches the s xy ρ 0 0314 m3 s2 contour line we were able to map the chosen s xy ρ threshold value to an equivalent f y value which was found to be 0 44 n m2 to determine whether the alongshore force value at the location of maximum dissipation is dependent on the slope of the surf zone the same process was repeated using the feddersen et al 1998 data set taken from a field site near duck north carolina with this data set an alongshore current velocity of 20 cm s translated to a threshold s xy ρ of approximately 0 08 m3 s2 at the 8 m contour line the same input conditions were then used in swan simulations on a planar beach with a slope of 1 100 which roughly matched the average beach slope to the 8 m contour at the field site following the methodology described above the threshold f y value was found to be 0 42 n m2 which is very similar to the f y value of 0 44 n m2 determined from the guza et al 1986 data set suggesting that this threshold forcing value is applicable on a range of beach slopes using f y 0 44 n m2 as a threshold for impact we examined which wec array configurations lead to changes in f y δf y that exceed this threshold 3 parametric study of impact 3 1 model domain for the parametric study on the nearshore impacts of wec arrays we used a 24 km by 70 km model domain discretized into a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 200 m within this domain four smaller higher resolution grids were nested the bathymetry was an alongshore uniform generic shelf and planar beach with wave propagation starting in deep water the offshore section was a constant 400 m depth with a cross shore length of 2 km followed by a 2 km shelf break section of 1 10 slope and a 20 km nearshore section with slope of 1 100 the idealized bathymetry with the location and size of the nested grids is shown in fig 2 within the outer 200 m resolution grid there was nested a 20 km square grid at 50 m resolution centered in the alongshore grid 1 wec devices could only be represented at the outer edge of nested grids because the array configurations included two rows two high resolution 9 m grid were used 2 7 km 9 km and 2 2 km 8 6 km grids 2 and 3 respectively which varied in distance from the shore wec arrays were either 5 10 or 15 km offshore shoreward of the wec array grid was a nested nearshore grid of 18 m resolution grid 4 in swan the wave action density spectrum is discretized into a given number of frequency and directional bins as defined by the user trials were run with 180 directional bins over a 360 directional range the wave action density spectrum was discretized logarithmically into 40 frequency bins 0 04118 0 5 hz which is consistent with the frequency spread and resolution used in other similar studies using swan 3 2 input conditions all trials in the parametric study were initiated with jonswap spectra hasselmann et al 1973 at the offshore boundary trials were conducted with two input significant wave heights 2 m and 6 m and nine input peak periods 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 16 and 18 s all trials were conducted with a directional wave field with shore normal as the dominant direction and two levels of directional spreading were assessed 14 and 35 a total of 36 sets of wave conditions were simulated trials were conducted with these input conditions using two array configurations closely spaced and widely spaced and with arrays located at three distances from shore 5 10 and 15 km simulations were also made without an array for each set of input conditions a total of 252 trials were conducted 3 3 representation of wecs in swan the ptf versus frequency as specified for the array of point absorber wecs employed in the swan modeling is shown in fig 3 as shown the laboratory ptf was scaled to have a peak period of extraction at 9 s which is the average annual energy period on the oregon coast lenee bluhm et al 2011 the ptf represents the proportion of wave energy extracted across the diameter of a device as a function of frequency subtracting the ptf from 1 at each frequency therefore gives the proportion of wave energy not captured by the device as is evident from fig 3 the ptf measured in the laboratory work exceeds one for a narrow range of frequencies this is indicative of increased energy capture efficiency and is made possible through the process of wave diffraction in the laboratory tests in order to capture this behavior in the model it would be necessary to artificially increase the device diameter so it could capture more energy instead where the experimental ptf was greater than 1 0 we chose to cap the ptf at a value of 1 0 meaning the simulated field scale wecs are slightly less efficient than the lab scale wecs wec devices were incorporated in the model domain using the following method first swan was used to propagate waves from the offshore boundary to the edge of nest 2 where the first row of the wec array is located see fig 2 the swan produced spectra were externally modified at the location of each wec device in row 1 using 8 s a f t e r f s b e f o r e f 1 p t f f where s before is the spectral energy density in the wave field just offshore of the device and s after is the spectral energy density in the wave field just onshore of the device swan was then used to propagate these modified waves through nest 2 to the edge of nest 3 where the second row of wec devices is located the wave spectra were then externally modified using the same method at the locations of each wec device in the second row the resulting alongshore varying wave field was then propagated through nests 3 and 4 to the shoreline here we study large scale wec arrays that included 60 devices in two staggered rows each device had a diameter of 18 m to assess the importance of spacing between devices both closely spaced and widely spaced arrays were simulated for each set of input wave conditions closely spaced arrays had a distance of 72 m 4 times the wec diameter between devices and rows and widely spaced arrays had a distance of 180 m 10 times the wec diameter between devices and rows array spacing and configuration were selected based on past studies on optimal wec array configurations beels et al 2009 2010a 2010b babarit 2013 palha et al 2010 the array configurations used in the swan simulations are shown in fig 4 3 4 model outputs for each trial the significant wave height h s mean wave direction θ m peak period t p and the wave induced forces f x and f y were calculated at each grid point across the domain spatially periodic variations in h s θ m f x and f y were seen in the lee of the arrays the short scale device scale variations were dependent on model directional resolution and did not appear to converge even with directional resolution as high as 720 bins since our focus here is on the changes caused by the presence of the wec array over surf zone length scales and since wave diffraction becomes much more important at short length scales a resolution of 180 direction bins was selected and the output forcing parameters were lowpass filtered in the forward and reverse alongshore direction with a 270 m cutoff this filter removed much of the differences in the output parameters as a function of directional resolution and meant that model results were converged even in the absence of diffraction in order to best characterize the changes in the surf zone where nearshore forcing is strongest the cross shore location of maximum dissipation was chosen for the analysis the model was run both with and without the wec array and the net difference δf y at the location of maximum dissipation in the direct lee of the array was determined and demeaned for each trial trials generating δf y above the defined threshold were then identified the net difference δf x was similarly found at the location of maximum dissipation and both the total change and the percent change were calculated as an additional indication of the changes in wave field due to the presence of the wec array the changes in significant wave height h s and mean wave direction θ m due to the wec array were determined 3 5 model results 3 5 1 changes in significant wave height hs and mean wave direction θm the modeled changes in h s and θ m were used to broadly assess how input conditions array configurations and distance between the wec array and the shoreline affected the nearshore wave conditions figs 5 and 6 show the differences in h s 5a and 5c and θ m 5b and 5d between simulations with and without a wec array in the lee of both widely spaced 5a and 5b and closely spaced 5c and 5d wec arrays across the domain for trials with h s 6 m t p 12 s directional spread of 14⁰ fig 5 and 35 fig 6 and the array located 15 km from shore the differences were found by subtracting the model results across the domain for each parameter from simulations with a wec array from simulations without a wec array the reduction in h s δh s and the change in the mean wave direction δθ m due to the wec array are clearly visible in figs 5 and 6 the alongshore gradients in wave height are reduced within the shadow in the lee of the array because the effect of directional spreading allows wave energy to propagate into the lee of the array as the waves proceed toward shore both directional spreading and the distance between the wec and the shore were important factors in the magnitude of the changes in wave parameters seen in the nearshore when the wec arrays were located closer to shore the wave field had less distance to recover and the wave shadow essentially impinged on the nearshore zone leading to the largest differences in the surf zone between cases with and without arrays see figs 7 10 high directional spreading leads to faster reduction of the wave shadow in the lee of the array this resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of δh s but an increase in the alongshore extent of the wec shadow the changes in θ m in the direct lee of the array were more significant in cases with high directional spreading the impact of low versus high directional spread is evident in the plots of δh s and δθ m shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively with an input h s 6 m an input t p 12 s and an array located 15 km from shore wec array spacing also played a significant role in the magnitude of δh s and δθ m in the lee of the array when devices were closer together more significant reductions in both h s and θ m were seen in the immediate lee of the array see figs 5 and 6 as directional spreading increases or array distance from shore increases the effect of array spacing is less evident in the nearshore see figs 8 and 10 the maximum percent reduction in significant wave height at the edge of the surf zone defined as the nearshore location of maximum wave height was 8 3 and the maximum change in mean wave direction at the same location was less than 1 0 25 both maxima occurred in the lee of a closely spaced array located 5 km from shore the smallest changes in wave parameters in the nearshore occurred with a widely spaced array located 15 km from shore with a less than 0 1 reduction in wave height for some input conditions 3 5 2 changes in cross shore force fx cross shore force f x and alongshore force f y are dependent on the gradient of the wave induced radiation stresses and are strongest in the surf zone due to wave breaking the decrease in h s in the lee of the array demonstrated in the previous section resulted in a similar decrease in the magnitude of f x at the location of maximum dissipation to visualize the decrease in f x in the surf zone alongshore f x transects were plotted at the location of maximum dissipation for trials with an input h s 6 m an input t p 12 s low directional spread 14⁰ and with arrays located 5 and 10 km from shore fig 7 the maximum decrease and percent decrease in f x at the location of interest in the direct lee of the array were found for all trials the maximum percent change for all cases was 17 1 which occurred in the lee of a closely spaced array located 5 km from shore in trials with low directional spread the maximum decrease in f x at the location of interest for each trial can be seen in fig 8 the impact of this reduction in forcing would be a reduction in shoreline water elevations wave setup due to the shadowing effect of the array 3 5 3 changes in alongshore force fy alongshore variability in f x and f y both contribute to the formation of rip currents in a complex balance alongshore currents and thus alongshore sediment transport are driven by f y fy is similar to f x in that it is a function of the spatial gradient of the wave induced radiation stresses and is also strongest in the outer portion of the surf zone also because f y depends on the radiation stress component s xy its magnitude and direction are highly dependent on the incident wave angle close to shore to visualize the spatial variability in f y in the surf zone alongshore f y transects were plotted at the location of maximum dissipation for trials with an input h s 6 m an input t p 12 s and low directional spread 14⁰ fig 9 the δθ m on either side of the array results in a spatial variability in the sign of f y the wave induced forcing on either side of the array is therefore directed toward the area directly behind the array from all trials the maximum change in the magnitude of f y δf y at the location of maximum dissipation in the direct lee of the array were found larger input h s and t p values were found to result in larger δf y values in the surf zone only trials with an input h s 6 m and an input t p greater than 8 s resulted in δf y values over the chosen threshold the trials that met the threshold δf y value are shown in fig 10 similar to the previously discussed parameters the distance between the wec array and the shore was found to have a significant impact on the magnitude the f y generated in the surf zone only trials with an array located 5 km from shore result in δf y values over the established threshold shown in fig 10 although an increase in directional spread resulted in a decrease in δh s significant changes in f y in the surf zone were still seen in trials with high directional spread with an array located 5 km from shore a total of 11 trials were found to meet the threshold δf y value six of which are from cases with low directional spread and the remaining five from cases with high directional spread fig 10 wec array spacing had an effect on both the magnitude and the extent of the far field changes closely spaced arrays resulted in a significantly larger change in wave parameters in the direct lee of the array fig 10 the magnitude of δf y at the location of maximum dissipation was found to be larger in the lee of closely spaced arrays in all trials but the differences between cases based on wec spacing decreased with increasing distance from the array and with increasing directional spread no trials with a widely spaced array resulted in δf y values above the established threshold 4 nearshore impact at field sites 4 1 model domain to assess the applicability of the conclusions made in the parametric study to sites with more realistic bathymetries the same methodology was applied to two northwest national marine renewable energy center nnmrec test sites off the coast of newport oregon usa the north energy test site nets located north of yaquina head approximately 5 km offshore and the south energy test site sets located south of newport approximately 11 km offshore the domain bathymetry was generated using the 1 3 arc second central oregon coast digital elevation map from the national geophysical data center carignan et al 2009 the same 17 km by 75 km local domain was used for both the nets and sets sites fig 11 the domain was rotated 5 so the coastline was approximately parallel to the offshore domain boundary and the bathymetry was filtered using a 54 m low pass filter representing three grid points in both the cross shore and alongshore direction similar to the parametric study the domain was discretized into a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 200 m within the domain two sets of five smaller higher resolution grids were nested one for each site the spatial resolution increased from 200 m in the largest grid to 50 m in the first nested grid grid 1 followed by 30 m in the second nested grid grid 2 similar to the parametric study a spatial resolution of 9 m was used in the vicinity of the wec array grids 3 and 4 followed by a spatial resolution of 18 m in the nearshore zone grid 5 fig 11 shows these five nested grids for each of the study sites the wave action density spectra were discretized into 180 directional bins over a 360 directional range and discretized logarithmically into 40 frequency bins 0 04118 0 5 hz model wec arrays were located approximately equidistantly from the east and west boundaries of the permitted test sites but the arrays extended beyond the north and south boundaries of the test sites fig 11 4 2 model validation the swan model was first validated using existing data from an acoustic wave and current meter awac previously deployed within the model domain vardaro et al 2011 the awac was deployed from march to august 2011 at a location just south of yaquina head shown in fig 11 model validation runs used input wave spectra derived from a wavewatch iii hindcast for the pacific northwest garcía medina et al 2014 model runs were conducted for each hour of the deployment period the significant wave height measured by the awac was compared with the significant wave height calculated by swan at the device location the awac collected wave height measurements every 80 min and swan was run using hourly wave spectra so the swan results were interpolated to the awac sampling interval and the error statistics were calculated using the interpolated values fig 12 shows a time series of modeled and measured significant wave height for the duration of the awac deployment the model achieved a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 82 a root mean square error rmse of 0 32 m and an average percent error of 15 8 which is very comparable to similar studies for example by abanades et al 2014a and 2014b swan was run in stationary mode without active wind generation which may explain some of the difference between the modeled and measured data however the goal of the study was not to replicate the hindcast conditions as accurately as possible but instead to ensure that the nested modeled domains and bathymetry functioned appropriately 4 3 input conditions the input directional wave spectra for the nets and sets simulations were obtained from a 2005 2011 coupled wavewatch iii and swan hindcast for the pacific northwest the low resolution swan domain extended from northern california to washington and covered the entire continental shelf garcía medina et al 2014 our local higher resolution 17 km 75 km swan domain that includes the nets and sets sites was then nested into this coupled system along with the additional 5 nested grids for each site the wave processes included in these swan runs are the same as were included in our parametric study and in the previous studies of this site garcía medina et al 2013 2014 input conditions for the nets and sets trials were selected to be representative of the normal range of wave conditions experienced on the oregon coast hourly wave spectra from 2005 to 2011 at the offshore boundary of the low resolution swan domain of garcía medina et al 2014 were sorted based on their probability of occurrence first the peak period t p significant wave height h s and mean wave direction θ m were extracted at each point along the offshore boundary of the swan domain for each hour in the seven year hindcast each parameter was averaged across the offshore boundary to generate a single set triplet of peak parameters for each hour the triplets were then separated into 120 bins each with the same number of triplets and therefore the same probability of occurring using a 3 dimensional probability density function with 6 frequency bins 4 wave direction bins and 5 significant wave height bins in each group the centroid of the set of triplets was computed and the hindcast hour with the wave parameters closest to the parameters of the centroid was found the 120 h selected using this method were then used as the input conditions in the final trials the t p used in the final trials ranged from 7 75 s to 17 77s the h s ranged from 0 93 m to 6 26 m and θ m ranged from 52 to 82 the directional spread ranged from 17 5 to 54 5 wecs were represented in swan using the same technique as in the parametric study each wec array included 60 devices each with a diameter of 18 m positioned in two staggered rows both closely spaced and widely spaced arrays were simulated at each test site for each set of input wave conditions see section 3 3 for each set of input conditions trials were conducted twice with a wec array in the nets site once with a closely spaced array and once with a widely spaced array twice with an array in the sets site and finally a single time without an array for a total of five model runs similar to the parametric study all model outputs were lowpass filtered in the forward and reverse alongshore direction with a 270 m cutoff see section 3 4 4 4 model results 4 4 1 real sites the point of interest in the nets and sets trials was defined as the mean location of maximum dissipation in the direct lee of the array the alongshore averaged location of the maximum dissipation in the direct lee of the array was determined for each trial and δf y were assessed at this cross shore location nonrealistic force values were seen directly adjacent to coastal features extending into the surf zone to address this the areas directly adjacent to the newport jetties and yaquina head the two major coastal features in the domain were removed from the domain and only open coastal regions were included in the analysis the area removed was the same in both the sets and nets domains and can be seen in figs 13 and 15 plots of h s at the sets site are shown in fig 13 from a trial with input conditions t p h s θ m 12 61s 5 45 m 27 11⁰ a total of seven trials with a closely spaced array at the sets site resulted in a change in alongshore force magnitude δf y above the threshold impact value δf y 0 44 n m2 at the point of interest along with three trials with a widely spaced array all seven trials that met the threshold δf y value had an input h s over 5 m and four had an hs over 5 5 m and all had a t p of over 13 s of the seven sets of input conditions that met the threshold with a closely spaced array three of those sets also met the threshold δf y in trials with a widely space array the previously discussed analysis identified 10 trials that generated significant δf y values at the location of maximum dissipation at some alongshore location however this analysis did not give any indication of the alongshore extent of these changes to address this the exceedance length was calculated for each of the trials that resulted in δf y above the impact threshold the exceedance length defined as the total length of coastline where the threshold was exceeded at the location of maximum dissipation was determined by multiplying the number of points where the threshold was exceeded by the grid resolution the exceedance length for trials at the sets field site ranged from 126 m to 2988 m with a mean of 1148 m and a standard deviation of 851 m the exceedance length for each trial that exceeded the δf y threshold is shown in fig 14 plots of the difference in significant wave height hs at the nets site can be seen in fig 15 from trials with t p h s θ m 12 61s 5 45 m 27 11⁰ similar to the sets site the area adjacent to yaquina head and the newport jetties were excluded from the analysis slightly more than half of the trials 65 out of 120 with a closely spaced array at the nets site led to δf y above the threshold of the 120 trials with a widely spaced array 38 resulted in a significant δf y at the location of maximum dissipation input conditions that result in δf y over the threshold value can be seen in fig 14c and d colored dots similar to the sets site the exceedance length was calculated for each of the 103 trials that exceeded the impact threshold the maximum exceedance length was found to be 3762 m and the minimum length was 18 m with a mean of 656 m and a standard deviation of 743 m although significantly more trials met the threshold δf y at the nets site the mean exceedance length for these trials was much smaller 1148 m at the sets site versus 656 m at the nets site these results suggest that arrays close to shore have a greater chance of influencing nearshore processes but in many cases will affect a shorter distance along the coastline exceedance lengths for each trial are shown in fig 14 4 4 2 comparison between real sites and parametric study the results of the sets and nets trials were compared to the results of the parametric study with the array located 10 km and 5 km from shore respectively similar trends were seen in the changes in wave parameters in both the parametric study and at the real sites including a decrease in the h s and f x in the lee of the array and a redirection of waves on either side of the array the wec array designs that resulted in the largest δf y at the field sites were consistent with those found in the parametric study with the largest changes occurring in the lee of a closely spaced array located close to shore in all cases the threshold value was much more likely to be exceeded in trials with large t p and h s values however a much wider range of conditions were found to generate δf y that exceeded the threshold at the real sites with wave heights as small as 2 m and wave periods as low as 8 s resulting in δf y over the threshold in some cases fig 14 although the wave conditions large h s and t p and array configurations closely spaced that led to larger δf y values were consistent with the parameterized study the spatial variability of δf y appears to be heavily influenced by local bathymetry alongshore δf y transects can be seen in fig 16 from trials with t p h s θ m 12 61s 5 45 m 27 11⁰ coastal features that extended out beyond the surf zone primarily yaquina head the newport jetties and a series of small islands resulted in discontinuities in the alongshore δf y transect these transects contain significantly more alongshore variability in δf y when compared to the alongshore δf y transects from the parameterized study and the δf y variability at the scale of individual bathymetric features was found to be of similar magnitude to any observed variability at the scale of the entire wec array this increase in the spatial variability of alongshore forcing could have significant implications for nearshore circulation 4 5 analysis of real sites the standard deviation in f y was determined at each point across the domain using the filtered results for all 120 trials and was seen as an indicator of the natural variability in f y at each the two test sites in addition to determining whether wec arrays induce δf y over the established threshold at the location of maximum dissipation we also assessed whether the wec arrays induce δf y that exceed the natural variability in these regions to do this the number of wave conditions out of the climatology of 120 where the δf y exceeds the standard deviation was determined for each point across the surf zone because the input conditions in the trials were selected to be representative of the annual wave climate at the site the percent of trials with δf y exceeding the standard deviation at each location was considered to be the percent of time that the standard deviation was exceeded at this location the percent exceedance was assessed in the surf zone only because the location of maximum dissipation varies between trials the percent exceedance was assessed from the maximum dissipation line the farthest offshore up to the shoreline fig 17 shows the percent exceedance across this area at the nets site certain locations in the domain experience δf y due to the wec array that exceed the standard deviation at that location up to 15 8 of the time in the lee of a closely spaced array and up to 3 3 of the time in the lee of a widely spaced array at the sets site the δf y due to the wec array exceeded the standard deviation up to 4 2 in some locations modeling sediment transport in the lee of an array would be an important step in order to determine whether the aggregate nearshore effects of these changes in alongshore forcing due to wec arrays could significantly impact long term sediment transport and coastal processes in order to test the sensitivity of our results to the chosen alongshore current threshold of 20 cm s see section 2 2 we compared the number of trials that exceeded the δf y threshold using the δf y thresholds associated with current velocities of 10 cm s and 30 cm s as well at the nets site we found that the number of trials that exceed the δf y thresholds associated with current velocities 10 20 30 cm s were 81 38 11 for a widely spaced array and 90 65 35 for a closely spaced array at the sets site we found that the number of trials that exceed the δf y thresholds were 21 3 2 for a widely spaced array and 17 7 6 for a closely spaced array this gives some perspective as to how sensitive the results are to the chosen design impact threshold 5 conclusions a new methodology for assessing the potential nearshore impact of wec arrays was developed based on the net change in hydrodynamic forcing in the alongshore direction induced by the array a metric for impact was established based on the linkage between alongshore radiation stress and alongshore current magnitude as demonstrated in field observations using the new indicator of impact a parametric study was conducted using the swan model wec arrays were incorporated in the swan domain through the external modification of the wave spectra at the device locations using an experimentally determined ptf that allows for a realistic representation of energy extraction by wec devices larger maximum changes in the magnitude of the alongshore forcing δf y induced by wec arrays corresponded to larger input significant wave heights and larger input peak periods changes in wave parameters in the nearshore were found to increase with a decrease in the distance between the array and the shore and with a decrease in directional spreading implying that the largest differences in the nearshore forcing due to wec arrays will occur in high energy swell seas with a wec array located close to shore closely spaced arrays had a much larger impact on wave height and direction in the direct lee of the array but the differences between cases due to wec spacing decreased with increasing distance from the array the same methodology was then applied to two permitted nnmrec test sites after first validating the wave model for the region and developing a representative wave climatology results from the parametric trials were compared to the field trials to assess the validity of the conclusions made in the parametric study when applied to sites with more realistic bathymetries similar trends were seen in the wave conditions and array configurations that resulted in δf y values above the established threshold however the alongshore variability of the δf y due to the arrays was also significantly influenced by the local bathymetry additionally a larger number of trials were found to result in significant δf y when the array was closer to shore but the average exceedance length for these trials was shorter with a mean exceedance length of 1148 m when the array was 11 km offshore versus 656 m when the array was 5 km offshore finally as an additional measure of nearshore impact the induced δf y were compared to the existing natural variability without the array based on the wave climatology it was demonstrated that for the analyzed wec array configurations array induced changes could exceed the natural variability as much as 15 of the time more research is necessary to determine how the δf y at the shoreline could influence long term sediment transport and other coastal processes acknowledgements this material is
