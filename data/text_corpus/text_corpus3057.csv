15285,the processes combining biological treatment with membrane separation technologies have been widely adopted for leachate treatment however dissolved organic matter dom of leachate membrane concentrates generated from various membrane separation technologies has not been systematically investigated in field scale therefore substance flow analysis based on dom molecular information of leachate membrane concentrates from primary membrane systems i e nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro and secondary membrane systems i e disk tube reverse osmosis dtro and humic substance filtration system hsf in five engineering scale leachate treatment facilities obtained via ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry was given and simultaneously compared in nf concentrates nfc 45 1 98 5 of dom originated from raw leachate l dom was concentrated showing poor biodegradability the l dom interception characteristics of nfc fed hsf were mainly based on volume reduction but concentration effect l dom in ro concentrates roc showed a higher proportion of peak intensity reduced components accounting for 50 3 96 8 and organic composition changes were more dependent on water quality characteristics than membrane types roc fed dtro intercepted 49 3 72 6 of l dom but dtro may be less effective at intercepting dom molecules in landfill leachate with higher oxidation levels considering risks from feasible treatment technologies the difficulty for the treatment of leachate membrane concentrates followed the order of dtro concentrates roc nfc this study suggests that roc fed dtro need to be controlled to avoid amplifying the treatment difficulty besides treatment technologies for ro and dtro concentrates with low concentrated but refractory dom and high salts should be explored graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter leachate concentrate solid waste orbitrap mass spectrometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the processes combining biological treatment with various membrane separation technologies are widely used for leachate treatment the mainstream membrane separation technologies for leachate including nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and nf ro are well modular with the reasonable market price chen et al 2021 and relatively simple to manage nevertheless the generation of high amounts of membrane concentrates has become the toughest challenge except for periodic replacement of the membranes typically at 2 3 year intervals especially for the treatment of mature landfill leachate with poor biodegradability as indicated by low value of biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days bod5 to chemical oxygen demand cod ratio being less than 0 1 kjeldsen et al 2002 renou et al 2008 and the accumulated ammonia and salts leachate membrane concentrates lcs can account for approximately 13 30 of the treated leachate in volume van der bruggen et al 2003 zhang et al 2013 the characteristics of lcs are influenced by the nature of the leachate the membrane type and the node position in the treatment process generally lcs are rich in salts and metal ions and organics as indicated by high cod dissolved organic carbon doc and other organic indicators but with lower value of the ratio of bod5 to cod yuan et al 2017 therefore it is important to know what dissolved organic matter dom was for lcs meanwhile novel membrane system is being developed to provide a cost efficient way of further reducing the volume of the generated lcs e g humic substance filtration system hsf combining ultrafiltration uf with nf for recovering humic substances hs from nf concentrate nfc xu et al 2017 and disk tube reverse osmosis dtro for the reduction of ro concentrate roc such membrane systems all exacerbate the complexity of lcs characteristics fractionation analysis by xad resin adsorption christensen et al 1998 he et al 2006 ultraviolet visible zhang et al 2009 and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis ren et al 2018 shi et al 2019 indicate that the crucial component dom in lcs seems to be more refractory than leachate itself but its characterization was still limited to simple bulky classification into humic like and fulvic like components etc zhang et al 2013 and therefore highlighted the necessity to characterize lcs in depth especially at the molecular level in the last five years there emerged some studies about the molecular information of lcs via high resolution mass spectrometry hrms these studies were mainly applied to two areas laboratory scale validation of lcs treatment methods yuan et al 2017 and engineering scale evaluation of leachate treatment processes chen et al 2020 shao et al 2021 wang et al 2020a wu and li 2021 however there exist huge challenges in data comparison and interpretation among different hrms instruments hawkes et al 2020 therefore it is impossible to compare the molecular results of different membrane treatment processes solely across literature survey on the other hand the above studies focus on molecular abundance along the membrane treatment mainly relying on data analysis method of venn diagram based visualization i e defining as the shared dom existing before and after membrane treatment and the removed dom disappearing after membrane treatment zhang et al 2019 or other variants coupled with element or van krevelen classification xiang et al 2022 peak intensity change is rarely considered such qualitative studies ignored the accumulation of different lcs dom molecules keyikoglu et al 2021 and are then insufficient for the optimization of membrane treatment hence semi quantitative analysis on lcs dom molecules is increasingly critical as leachate origin dom with higher peak intensities in lcs than leachates is likely to be the culprit for the greater environmental risks furthermore as to the molecular information of multi stage membrane systems as far as we know only one published study traced dom behavior in nfc fed uf nf i e hsf xiang et al 2022 while few studies were conducted on that in roc fed dtro to sum up the current studies involve the limited types of leachate treatment processes mainly membrane bioreactor mbr nf chen et al 2020 shao et al 2021 wang et al 2020a two stage dtro as the leachate treatment at emergent cases wu and li 2021 and nfc fed hsf treatment xiang et al 2022 and each paper only introduced one process hence this study aimed to simultaneously compare the molecular information of the lcs from different primary membrane systems i e nf and ro and secondary membrane systems i e roc fed dtro and nfc fed hsf that were applied in five leachate treatment plants additionally the study focused on peak intensity change apart from abundance and composition analysis along various membrane units so as to reveal the comprehensive characteristics of dom originated from leachate the concentrated dom in lcs would be specially focused with concern that it would make lcs treatment more complicated due to the continuous accumulation of micropollution and thereby potentially amplifying the environmental risks the present study could provide a better knowledge on lcs organic matter to help the development of lcs treatment technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and physicochemical analysis leachate samples were collected from five municipal solid waste leachate treatment plants in east china from may to december in 2021 marked as plant a b c d and e raw leachates involved two ones from the incineration plant a and c sampled as a il and c il and four from landfill leachate treatment plant b c d and e sampled as b ll c ll d ll and e ll all plants adopted the joint treatment processes of biological treatment and membrane separation technologies the detailed treatment processes are shown in fig 1 the lcs samples were collected from various membrane units e g nf ro dtro the first stage of hsf hsf1 and the second stage of hsf hsf2 units the sampling units were named after treatment plant name membrane unit abbreviation while the letter c was tightly added at the end of the above naming structure to represent the corresponding membrane concentrate samples totally there were six leachate samples and fifteen lcs samples the sample information is listed in table s1 after site survey and further investigation both leachate treatment plants and membrane units were under efficient and steady operation membrane units at all sampling sites were within their normal service life more specifically nf ro and hsf membranes have been used for no more than 3 years and dtro membranes have been used for 3 5 years cleaning intervals were usually less than 2 months with 1 2 weeks being more common triplicate blanks milli q water were collected for each sampling event and all samples were stored at 40 c in the dark until analysis the

li et al 2017 dom was pretreated in triplicate by solid phase extraction spe supelco usa using bond elut ppl cartridges 100 mg 3 ml agilent samples were acidified to ph 2 with formic acid to increase the extraction efficiency for organic acids and phenols dittmar et al 2008 the spe procedure was modified from qiu et al 2020b but again the formic acid was used instead of hcl to avoid the introduction of chloride ion affecting the annotation and analysis of molecular formulae boutegrabet et al 2012 gonsior et al 2014 the molecular information was acquired with an ultra performance

al 2017 miyake et al 2018 the exploration of dom molecular fingerprints via lc orbitrap ms in both natural waters hawkes et al 2016 li et al 2021 and leachate matrix samples he et al 2021 qiu et al 2020a 2020b shao et al 2021 has been achieved humic substances could be supramolecular associations of organic compounds with low molecular mass and chemodiversity linked by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions sutton and sposito 2005 esi could remove such intermolecular interactions allowing the true molecular weight of leachate dom to be resolved instrument parameters referred to leon et al 2019 and qiu et al 2020b details are described in supporting information si orbitrap ms was externally calibrated by standard solutions pierce ltq velos esi positive and pierce esi negative qiu et al 2020b capillary temperature of orbitrap ms had effect on the degree of ionization so 375 c was adopted based on the published studies of our group he et al 2021 qiu et al 2020a 2020b shao et al 2021 and others leon et al 2019 2 3 data mining deconvolution peak alignment and annotation of molecular formulae achieved via an established software package compound discoverer 3 2 thermo fisher scientific inc usa were used to obtain dom information the above methodology followed previous studies he et al 2021 qiu et al 2020a 2020b shao et al 2021 and the criteria of data mining was recommended by veenaas et al 2018 and qiu et al 2020b the elemental range of molecular formulae was set as 12c2 50 1h2 100 16o0 30 14n0 2 32s0 1 chen et al 2018 and the mass tolerance of annotation was 5 ppm the calculation of molecular indexes i e molecular weight mw h c o c n c double bond equivalence dbe modified aromaticity index aimod nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc was described in the si the value of dbe minus o was limited to range from 10 to 10 herzsprung et al 2014 elemental ratios of 0 3 h c 2 25 and 0 o c 1 2 were employed to further restrict the formula calculation chance et al 2018 hawkes et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the above molecular indexes were calculated based on weighted peak intensities under esi mode and esi mode respectively in the table s3 and s4 the detailed cutoff restrictions of the subcategories in the van krevelen diagram were summarized in the si besides the relationship between dom molecular information and bulk indicators of lcs was carried out by redundancy analysis and spearman correlation analysis the obtained molecular mass peak intensities were corrected by the loading volume and eluting volume of the solid phase extraction qiu et al 2020a eq 1 the term concentration characteristics herein referred to concentration factor cf calculated in eq 2 representing the ratio of the peak intensities of dom molecules in the primary membrane concentrates to ones in the raw leachate or ones in the secondary concentrates to ones in the influent herein the volume reduction is based on water volume described in engineering scale treatment plants as freshwater recovery rate while the concentration effect is based on relative peak change linked to the various molecular formulae obtained from non target analysis of dom 1 a a v e l u t e v l o a d 2 c f a r a 0 100 where a and a are the actual peak intensity and the corrected peak intensity velute and vload indicate the eluting volume and the loading volume of spe ar is the corrected peak intensity of the molecule in the lcs while a0 is the one in the raw leachate when the lcs are from primary membrane units or in the influent when the lcs are from secondary membrane units the peak intensities mentioned below are all corrected ones to be noticed if dom molecules in lcs can be also recognized in the raw leachate they are considered to be of leachate origin and recorded as l dom while those unrecognized in the raw leachate are considered to be of other origin e g they are produced by mbr and recorded as mbrp dom or they are additionally added for membrane maintenance therefore within a certain margin of error if the cf is greater than 130 the molecule is considered to be well concentrated by the membrane unit subscripted as concentrated if the cf is equal to 70 130 the molecule is considered to be unchanged from the influent subscripted as unchanged if the cf is less than 70 the molecule is considered to be partially retained subscripted as partially retained cortés francisco and caixach 2013 phungsai et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular characterization of dom in the lcs 3 1 1 molecular indexes totally there were fifteen samples from primary membrane units including six raw leachates rw four nanofiltration concentrates nfc and five reverse osmosis concentrates roc their physicochemical properties are shown in table s2 cod concentrations of nfc and roc varied from 4428 to 39 573 mg l and from 525 to 37 600 mg l respectively while the ratios of bod5 cod were lower than 0 020 0 029 significantly lower than that of rw 0 042 0 546 indicating lcs low biodegradability nh 4 n concentrations of nfc and roc varied from 0 to 103 mg l and from 0 to 60 0 mg l dramatically lower than rw 1066 4750 mg l too as shown in fig 2 the median h cwa of dom in both nfc and roc was 1 34 significantly lower than 1 47 in rw p 0 05 under esi mode since biological treatment could preferentially remove dom with h cwa more than 1 5 shao et al 2021 however nfc dom and roc dom had significantly higher dbewa 5 67 6 17 4 99 5 88 p 0 05 noscwa 0 49 0 3 0 60 0 36 p 0 05 and aimodwa 0 23 0 32 0 21 0 35 p 0 05 than those in rw dom under esi mode implying that nfc and roc comprised of more unsaturated and aromatized dom roc dom had a significantly higher n cwa p 0 05 than rw dom under both esi and esi modes indicating the existence of abundant nitrogen functional groups in roc besides dom with lower nosc was considered to be potentially biodegradable primarily contributed by protein like and lipid like fractions zhou et al 2019 as fig s1 however there was no significant difference between the molecular indexes of nfc and roc considering the flexible application of ro in leachate treatment processes the range of molecular indexes of roc was broader than that of nfc the relationship between bulk indicators and dom molecular indexes was determined by spearman correlation fig 3 the results under esi mode showed that lcs owa and o cwa were positively correlated with cod bod5 doc and don r 0 693 p 0 01 supporting that lcs were rich in organic matter containing oxygen functional groups xiang et al 2022 specifically under esi mode lcs mwwa r 0 571 0 846 p 0 05 and dbewa r 0 659 0 757 p 0 05 was positively correlated with cod bod5 doc and don and cwa was positively correlated with cod doc and don r 0 714 0 743 p 0 01 it could be assumed that lcs dom was occupied by recalcitrant compounds with high condensation and a high degree of unsaturation shao et al 2021 wu and li 2021 while the low mw dom was dominated in most of lcs besides under esi mode lcs noscwa was positively correlated with cod bod5 doc and don r 0 802 0 875 p 0 001 indicating that especially when the don was relatively low an oxidation process was recommended to reduce the organic fractions in lcs with low organic content e g lcs from membrane units treating mbr effluent swa and s cwa were negatively correlated with cod doc and don r 0 639 p 0 05 additionally under esi mode fig 3b bod5 had significantly positive correlation with dbewa and noscwa r 0 568 and 0 582 p 0 05 implying that compounds with low oxidation degree zhou et al 2019 and low unsaturation degree accounting for less than 5 in the light value of bod5 cod 0 029 could be potentially utilized by microorganisms taking the covariance and representativeness of the indicators into consideration ec nh 4 n no 3 n and bod5 were used as environmental factors for redundancy analysis rda fig 3c and 3d besides the partitioning of rda results reflected the similarity of the samples in particular a roc and a dtroc were divided into areas different from the other samples indicating that lcs from incineration leachate alone were different from other processes dom in roc and roc fed dtroc was uniformed plant b and e both treated landfill leachate and adopted the similar treatment process leading to similar lcs characteristics in the same process ec had greater effect on dtroc samples then roc and nfc in order 3 1 2 elemental composition and van krevelen classification the cho type molecules in all lcs were less than those in rw fig 4 under esi mode fig 4a and 4c rw and lcs were dominated by chon type 50 molecules followed by cho chons and chos while lignins carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram like organics 41 9 66 2 were the dominated subcategory followed by proteins 13 4 27 5 and lipids 5 43 13 9 under esi mode the proportion of chos type molecules in both nfc 7 72 9 30 and hsfc 7 77 12 0 was reduced compared with the corresponding rw 9 67 12 3 fig 4b in addition the proportion of chons type molecules in roc esi 11 9 18 5 esi 7 31 20 9 was increased compared with rw esi 4 13 12 7 esi 4 52 8 55 both the elemental composition and van krevelen classification showed little change between a dtroc and a roc less than 1 08 under esi mode and less than 0 66 under esi mode it was suggested that these two types of lcs were likely suitable for the same treatment and chon cho and chons type molecules should be more focused on similarly the composition of c roc and c dtroc satisfied a uniform pattern with values of less than 0 40 and 0 88 variation under esi mode and esi mode respectively among lcs b nfc was closer to the molecular composition ratio characteristics of rw indicating that b nfc might present similar property of b ll and be suitable to adopt similar treatment technology in the mbr unit lipids and proteins were relatively simple in structure and biodegradable to be well removed and transformed so that the contents of lipids and proteins in lcs were less than ones in rw however roc in plant a b c and e was retained by ro unit fed on mbr effluent microfiltration mf effluent or nf effluent containing a higher ratio of aromatic organics than rw of the same plant under esi mode xiang et al 2022 while the proportion of such components in roc of plant b c and e except d roc fed on lcs was higher than nfc of the same process it could be explained that residual aromatic organics with low mw and low biodegradation potential in the mbr effluent wang et al 2020a were not easily retained by membrane units and were more likely to flow into effluent shao et al 2021 the recalcitrant lipids and proteins were probably comprised of long chain saturated sphingolipids usually with 16 24 carbon atoms in the acyl portion sandhoff 2010 3 2 characteristics of dom in primary membrane systems 3 2 1 flow analysis of dom molecule composition as shown in fig s2 100 400 da dom molecules were the most abundant in leachate and lcs accounting for 88 6 99 2 under esi mode and 91 4 98 5 under esi mode the relative proportion of 300 400 da dom molecules in a roc increased relative to a il esi from 14 1 to 24 7 esi from 16 8 to 18 6 for plant b and e the proportion of 200 300 da nfc dom increased compared with rw but the proportion of 100 300 da nfc dom differed little from rw there was an increased proportion of 100 300 da dom molecules in roc relative to rw which was the main component of the nf effluent there was no difference in the proportion of molecules with different mw between c nfc and c roc implying that c nf had no diversion at the mw level in the newly produced concentrates from hsf1 unit fed on nfc in plant c and d the proportion of 100 300 da molecules decreased and the proportion of 300 500 da molecules increased in contrast the hsf1 effluent was treated by hsf2 and the molecular ratio characteristics of hsf2c were closer to those of roc i e c roc generated from c nf effluent as well as d roc generated from d hsf1c and d hsf2c in plant a and c the ratio of molecules of various mw did not change significantly after dtro unit indicating that mw was not the main limiting factor in the treatment of roc by dtro the retention characteristics of dom in rw via membrane treatment were not simply physical that is it cannot be explained solely on the basis of molecular weight cutoff mwco braeken et al 2005 cortes francisco et al 2014 wang et al 2020a the value of mwco was often defined by the retention test of hydrophilic better hydrated polar molecules such as polyethylene glycols or sugars hydrophobic compounds had a low retention effect due to the absence of hydration especially when mw was near to or slightly higher than mwco however when the mw gap between mw and mwco was enough the effect of hydrophobicity weakened as the molecular size increased braeken et al 2005 in this study depending on the venn classification the elemental composition classification and van krevelen classification the comprehensive dom molecular flow was obtained under esi mode as shown in fig 5 as well as table s5 and s6 in terms of elemental composition mbr derived dom usually consisted of more n containing compounds 3 2 2 relative peak intensity characteristics of l dom in nfc in terms of the degree of aggregation fig 6 l dom concentrated molecules were the most abundant in nfc accounting for 45 1 97 7 of l dom under esi mode and 50 9 98 5 under esi mode distribution characteristics of l dom concentrated in nfc were similar to those of the leachate streams wang et al 2020a mostly concentrated in carbon atomic numbers of 10 20 and dbe of 0 10 see as fig s3 moreover l dom concentrated in nfc comprised mainly of lignins cram like organics and the proportions of other components were in order protein like and lipid like components under esi mode while protein like and tannin like components were at the second place under esi mode indicating the poor biodegradation potential wang et al 2020a the proportion of molecules with great amounts of carbon atoms and a higher dbe in l dom concentrated in nfc was usually slightly higher than the other two i e l dom unchanged and l dom partially retained as shown in fig s3 indicating that the unsaturated component of l dom was more easily trapped by nf compared with rw l dom in lcs exhibiting peak intensity increased characteristics was hard to remove further by membrane units so that l dom concentrated should be paid more attention under esi mode fig 7 a d nfc l dom concentrated was divided by elemental composition in order of magnitude in relative proportions as follows chon 65 9 76 2 cho 8 46 21 4 chons 10 5 15 2 among nfc l dom concentrated cho3 5 accounted for the highest proportion of cho type molecules while cho2 6n1 and cho2 4n2 accounted for the highest proportion of chon type molecules and cho4n1s1 accounted for the highest proportion of chons type molecules under esi mode fig 7e h nfc l dom concentrated was divided by elemental composition in order of magnitude in relative proportions as follows cho 39 8 54 9 chon 31 6 45 4 chos 6 79 9 73 chons 4 82 7 96 among nfc l dom concentrated cho3 5 accounted for the highest proportion of cho type molecules while cho3n1 and cho5n2 accounted for the highest proportion of chon type molecules cho5s1 accounted for the highest proportion of chos type molecules besides cho4 5n1s1 and cho3n2s1 accounted for the highest proportion of chons type molecules the abundance of l dom molecules concentrated by nf was similar with a higher proportion of cho type and chon type molecules followed by chons type and chos type molecules the characteristics of cho type dom reflected the difference in leachates chos type molecules in lcs came from anti sludge agents i e small molecule alcohols and alkyl benzene sulfonic acid added to ensure the proper functioning of the membrane system wu and li 2021 other s containing substances were likely to be derived from sulphonates sulphonamides and their metabolites yu et al 2016 biodegradation was the main removal pathway but there was a high risk of halogenated disinfection by products dbp formation if present in saline wastewater gong et al 2016 l dom concentrated in nfc assumed the risk of rw and was concentrated to some extent and should be the focus of attention for lcs treatment 3 2 3 relative peak intensity characteristics of l dom in roc unlike nfc roc showed a higher proportion of l dom with peak intensity reduction accounting for 55 2 92 8 of l dom under esi mode and 50 3 96 8 under esi mode as shown in fig 6 under esi mode c nf and e nf concentrated only around 50 of l dom but c ro and e ro concentrated or maintained the l dom more than a ro and b ro fig 6a indicating that ro had a complementary effect on the concentration of l dom in addition c ro treated a certain percentage of fresh leachate and had a relatively high working pressure table s1 which in combination affected the concentration characteristics of c ro fig s4 l dom partially retained of roc was recorded under esi and esi modes fig s5 representing l dom removed by bio treatment or poorly intercepted by ro so as to flow into the effluent under esi mode the proportion of cho type l dom partially retained in a roc was 70 3 higher than that in roc from other processes 35 1 53 8 besides such proportion in roc was correlated positively to the leachate age it was assumed that the cho type molecules might be a key fraction in measuring the aging degree of leachate and that their content varied more by water quality characteristics than by membrane types 3 3 characteristics of dom in secondary membrane systems dom in a dtroc accounted for more than 50 of the components in dtro influent i e roc to be more specific the retention rate was 69 5 74 0 esi and 66 3 71 9 esi in regard to the elemental composition subcategories while the retention rate was 57 1 76 9 and 60 3 79 2 respectively in regard to the van krevelen subcategories it was inferred that dtro intercepted most of fractions in roc unsaturated hydrocarbons aromatic organics and lignins cram like organics were more readily retained by a dtro on the whole herein almost all subcategories of l dom were more effectively retained than those of mbrp dom the retention rate of dom fraction in the c dtroc to the influent c roc was slightly greater under esi mode 59 5 than that in the esi mode 49 3 unsaturated hydrocarbons were better retained by c dtro with retention rate of 78 6 esi and 83 3 esi on the whole the number of molecules in roc cannot be retained by dtro that is they had a high probability of entering the dtro effluent for plant a these molecules were approximately 27 4 and 31 4 of roc under esi mode and esi mode respectively however the number of molecules in roc not retained by dtro in plant c was approximately 40 5 and 50 7 of roc under esi mode and esi mode respectively around 45 of l dom in c roc was remained in the dtro effluent higher than the residue in the effluent when treating the incineration leachate alone only around 30 under esi mode lipids and proteins of landfill leachate source in c roc with retention rate less than 40 were more likely to enter the c dtro effluent while proteins and carbohydrates of mbrp source were more likely to enter the c dtro effluent besides c dtro had better retention of aromatic organics from both landfill leachate and mbrp sources additionally for cho type l dom a dtro intercepted around 90 of a roc while c dtro intercepted around 50 of c roc dtro units i e a dtro and c dtro were fed by roc generated from leachates with two distinct oxidation levels in the engineering scale leachate treatment facilities more specifically the influent of a dtro was roc fed on incineration leachate while the one of c dtro was roc fed on a mixture of incineration leachate and landfill leachate mature landfill leachate was more oxidized and its dom fraction was more complex under long term microbial degradation chen et al 2020 besides membrane treatment processes such as nf and ro could retain dom with relatively high dbe and abundant oxygen functional groups cortés francisco and caixach 2013 cortes francisco et al 2014 shao et al 2021 therefore dtro was relatively ineffective in retaining dom molecules from more oxidized landfill leachate the number of molecules in nfc not retained by hsf1 in plant c was approximately 36 8 and 41 2 of nfc under esi mode and esi mode the number of molecules not retained by hsf2 accounted for 45 2 and 58 6 under esi mode and esi mode respectively however the number of molecules in nfc not retained by hsf1 in plant d was approximately 27 6 and 33 9 of nfc under esi mode and esi mode respectively the number of molecules not retained by hsf2 accounted for 57 5 and 63 7 under esi mode and esi mode respectively hsf1 retained 60 70 of the dom molecules in nfc and hsf2 retained 35 55 of dom in the hsf1 effluent from an effluent perspective it was highly likely that the number of molecules entering hsf2 effluent was around 15 25 of nfc suggesting that hsf1 and hsf2 were complementary in controlling the abundance of molecules in the final hsf2 effluent as shown in fig 8 a and 8b under esi mode the ratio of l dom unchanged to l dom in dtroc was 57 8 for plant a and 81 2 for plant c verifying that peak intensities of l dom in dtroc were similar to those of roc in addition roc and dtroc in plant a and c had similar proportion characteristics of subcategories divided from elemental classification and van krevelen classification fig 4 hence dom reduction of dtro units depended more on the volume reduction the overall reduction in the amount of l dom retained in the dtroc resulted in a much higher environmental risk to the dtro effluent a dtroc had 36 5 of l dom concentrated relative to c dtroc 10 5 suggesting that the biodegradability degree was valued for dom concentration effect of subsequent dtro units c hsf1 and d hsf1 had completely different concentration characteristics for l dom in nfc in fig 8c and 8d it was related to the nf concentration characteristics in fig 6 d nf concentrated more than 95 of l dom while c nf only showed a concentration effect on around 50 of l dom in contrast the proportion of l dom concentrated in d hsf1c was larger than that in c hsf1c it indicated that most of l dom concentrated in nfc was hardly concentrated by hsf1 and that hsf1 could retained some nfc l dom in terms of volume reduction but did not show concentration effect on peak intensities the results provided a theoretical basis at the dom level for the assessment of membrane performance and the frequency suggestion of membrane replacement providing a potential new direction for the scientific study of membrane retention and contamination 4 implications and suggestions the present study showed that nf concentrated close to 50 100 l dom in the studied plants and these concentrated components were less biodegradable as indicated by high condensation and unsaturation i e high values of dbe nosc and aimod but low value of h c and rich protein like and tannin like components due to the high content of organic components in these concentrates it was meaningful to recycle some of them as a kind of resource i e hsf1c when it was not severely limited by salt content however roc was more difficult to treat due to high salt and low organic matter characteristics that is the interference of inorganic components made it difficult to remove organic matter nevertheless ro had a higher micropollutant retention than nf wuensch et al 2022 then roc fed dtroc intercepted and concentrated most of components in roc exacerbating the challenge to treat dtroc the attempt and exploration of treatment technologies for such concentrates should be enhanced overall considering derivative risks arising from different feasible treatment technologies the difficulty level for lcs treatment was showed in following orders dtroc roc nfc considering the high content of lignins cram like organics protein like components tannin like components unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatic organics with low molecular weight in lcs electrolysis coagulation or fenton reaction combined with powdered activated carbon pac adsorption he et al 2021 is likely to be the most effective way to treat various subcategories of l dom in lcs besides electrolysis combined with ozonation can serve as effective treatment of lcs with abundant lignin cram like organics other refractory chon s type dom and rich chorine ions wang et al 2020b comparatively biological treatment and specific membrane separation technologies i e uf and nf might not be efficient since they have a limited removal of the bulk lignins cram like organics and protein like components retained in lcs besides additional heteroatomic substances were potentially generated in conjunction with biological treatment more et al 2014 the selection of leachate treatment process should also take economic practicality and carbon emission into account membrane separation technologies have been widely applied as advanced treatment of both incineration leachate and landfill leachate however membrane advanced treatment could increase the direct and indirect environmental impacts by an average of 146 despite of the reduction of 59 eutrophication potential on average zhang et al 2021 therefore it is suggested that relatively early stage leachates such as incineration leachate do not always need membrane advanced treatment to fulfill the stringent regulations instead optimizing biochemical treatment can reduce the economic pressure and negative environmental impacts brought by membrane treatment besides there is no significant difference in the treatment of pollutants between nf ro and ro alone but nf can reduce the pressure on ro and extend the service life of ro units zhang et al 2021 therefore it is recommended that ro units should be set after nf units so as to ensure treatment stability and reasonable lifespan of membranes especially when treating mature landfill leachate whether to choose membrane separation technology as a bottom up technology for leachate treatment and give full play to its superiority is an issue with two sides wuensch et al 2022 on one hand when the membrane unit is operated ideally the effluent can easily meet the standard but the concentrate is usually riskier and there is a bottleneck in how to treat it effectively on the other hand when the membrane unit is operated poorly it is difficult to meet effluent standard but it may be less bothered and less expensive to treat the concentrate even in the treatment of stabilized leachate different types of membrane units for various leachates do not work as a guaranteed technology and the retention characteristics in practice fluctuate greatly in addition new membrane treatment technologies require additional consideration it is suggested that membrane units that intercept and concentrate more l dom may be more suitable for use as leachate emergency treatment processes in the short term 5 conclusions this study compared five typical membrane advanced treatment processes on the same benchmark from the point of molecular information with aim to identify the origin and characteristics of different leachate concentrates in nfc 45 1 98 5 of l dom showed concentrated characteristics with the increase of peak intensities higher than 30 of that in leachate and molecular abundance of nfc l dom concentrated was similar the proportion of cho type and chon type dom was relatively higher and the unsaturated components in l dom were more easily trapped by nf whereas hsf1 the typical secondary membrane system treating nfc intercepted l dom in nfc mainly based on volume reduction but concentration effect hsf1 retained 60 70 of the dom molecules in nfc and hsf2 retained 35 55 of dom in the hsf1 effluent from an effluent perspective it was highly likely that the number of molecules entering hsf2 effluent was around 15 25 of nfc suggesting that hsf1 and hsf2 were complementary in controlling the abundance of molecules in the final hsf2 effluent unlike nfc l dom roc l dom showed a higher proportion of peak intensity reduced components accounting for 50 3 96 8 and organic composition changes were more dependent on water quality characteristics than membrane types dtro the typical secondary membrane system treating roc intercepted 49 3 72 6 of l dom the water quality characteristics of dtroc were similar to roc however dtro may be less effective at intercepting dom molecules in landfill leachate with higher oxidation levels above information would be useful for the treatment or valorization of leachate concentrates and for recognizing the performance and optimization measures of membrane treatment systems nevertheless the effluent samples from the mbr unit were not collected in this study so that it seems inappropriate to assess the peak intensity change of bioderived dom during subsequent membrane treatment follow up studies are suggested to focus on the characteristics of derived dom at different biological treatment stages during various membrane treatment processes in order to better refine the understanding of lcs dom at the molecular level credit authorship contribution statement tianqi li investigation resources data curation

15285,the processes combining biological treatment with membrane separation technologies have been widely adopted for leachate treatment however dissolved organic matter dom of leachate membrane concentrates generated from various membrane separation technologies has not been systematically investigated in field scale therefore substance flow analysis based on dom molecular information of leachate membrane concentrates from primary membrane systems i e nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro and secondary membrane systems i e disk tube reverse osmosis dtro and humic substance filtration system hsf in five engineering scale leachate treatment facilities obtained via ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry was given and simultaneously compared in nf concentrates nfc 45 1 98 5 of dom originated from raw leachate l dom was concentrated showing poor biodegradability the l dom interception characteristics of nfc fed hsf were mainly based on volume reduction but concentration effect l dom in ro concentrates roc showed a higher proportion of peak intensity reduced components accounting for 50 3 96 8 and organic composition changes were more dependent on water quality characteristics than membrane types roc fed dtro intercepted 49 3 72 6 of l dom but dtro may be less effective at intercepting dom molecules in landfill leachate with higher oxidation levels considering risks from feasible treatment technologies the difficulty for the treatment of leachate membrane concentrates followed the order of dtro concentrates roc nfc this study suggests that roc fed dtro need to be controlled to avoid amplifying the treatment difficulty besides treatment technologies for ro and dtro concentrates with low concentrated but refractory dom and high salts should be explored graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter leachate concentrate solid waste orbitrap mass spectrometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the processes combining biological treatment with various membrane separation technologies are widely used for leachate treatment the mainstream membrane separation technologies for leachate including nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and nf ro are well modular with the reasonable market price chen et al 2021 and relatively simple to manage nevertheless the generation of high amounts of membrane concentrates has become the toughest challenge except for periodic replacement of the membranes typically at 2 3 year intervals especially for the treatment of mature landfill leachate with poor biodegradability as indicated by low value of biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days bod5 to chemical oxygen demand cod ratio being less than 0 1 kjeldsen et al 2002 renou et al 2008 and the accumulated ammonia and salts leachate membrane concentrates lcs can account for approximately 13 30 of the treated leachate in volume van der bruggen et al 2003 zhang et al 2013 the characteristics of lcs are influenced by the nature of the leachate the membrane type and the node position in the treatment process generally lcs are rich in salts and metal ions and organics as indicated by high cod dissolved organic carbon doc and other organic indicators but with lower value of the ratio of bod5 to cod yuan et al 2017 therefore it is important to know what dissolved organic matter dom was for lcs meanwhile novel membrane system is being developed to provide a cost efficient way of further reducing the volume of the generated lcs e g humic substance filtration system hsf combining ultrafiltration uf with nf for recovering humic substances hs from nf concentrate nfc xu et al 2017 and disk tube reverse osmosis dtro for the reduction of ro concentrate roc such membrane systems all exacerbate the complexity of lcs characteristics fractionation analysis by xad resin adsorption christensen et al 1998 he et al 2006 ultraviolet visible zhang et al 2009 and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis ren et al 2018 shi et al 2019 indicate that the crucial component dom in lcs seems to be more refractory than leachate itself but its characterization was still limited to simple bulky classification into humic like and fulvic like components etc zhang et al 2013 and therefore highlighted the necessity to characterize lcs in depth especially at the molecular level in the last five years there emerged some studies about the molecular information of lcs via high resolution mass spectrometry hrms these studies were mainly applied to two areas laboratory scale validation of lcs treatment methods yuan et al 2017 and engineering scale evaluation of leachate treatment processes chen et al 2020 shao et al 2021 wang et al 2020a wu and li 2021 however there exist huge challenges in data comparison and interpretation among different hrms instruments hawkes et al 2020 therefore it is impossible to compare the molecular results of different membrane treatment processes solely across literature survey on the other hand the above studies focus on molecular abundance along the membrane treatment mainly relying on data analysis method of venn diagram based visualization i e defining as the shared dom existing before and after membrane treatment and the removed dom disappearing after membrane treatment zhang et al 2019 or other variants coupled with element or van krevelen classification xiang et al 2022 peak intensity change is rarely considered such qualitative studies ignored the accumulation of different lcs dom molecules keyikoglu et al 2021 and are then insufficient for the optimization of membrane treatment hence semi quantitative analysis on lcs dom molecules is increasingly critical as leachate origin dom with higher peak intensities in lcs than leachates is likely to be the culprit for the greater environmental risks furthermore as to the molecular information of multi stage membrane systems as far as we know only one published study traced dom behavior in nfc fed uf nf i e hsf xiang et al 2022 while few studies were conducted on that in roc fed dtro to sum up the current studies involve the limited types of leachate treatment processes mainly membrane bioreactor mbr nf chen et al 2020 shao et al 2021 wang et al 2020a two stage dtro as the leachate treatment at emergent cases wu and li 2021 and nfc fed hsf treatment xiang et al 2022 and each paper only introduced one process hence this study aimed to simultaneously compare the molecular information of the lcs from different primary membrane systems i e nf and ro and secondary membrane systems i e roc fed dtro and nfc fed hsf that were applied in five leachate treatment plants additionally the study focused on peak intensity change apart from abundance and composition analysis along various membrane units so as to reveal the comprehensive characteristics of dom originated from leachate the concentrated dom in lcs would be specially focused with concern that it would make lcs treatment more complicated due to the continuous accumulation of micropollution and thereby potentially amplifying the environmental risks the present study could provide a better knowledge on lcs organic matter to help the development of lcs treatment technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and physicochemical analysis leachate samples were collected from five municipal solid waste leachate treatment plants in east china from may to december in 2021 marked as plant a b c d and

membrane units e g nf ro dtro the first stage of hsf hsf1 and the second stage of hsf hsf2 units the sampling units were named after treatment plant name membrane unit abbreviation while the letter c was tightly added at the end of the above naming structure to represent the corresponding membrane concentrate samples totally there were six leachate samples and fifteen lcs samples the sample information is listed in table s1 after site survey and further investigation both leachate treatment plants and membrane units were under efficient and steady operation membrane units at all sampling sites were within their normal service life more specifically nf ro and hsf membranes have been used for no more than 3 years and dtro membranes have been used for 3 5 years cleaning intervals were

the extraction efficiency for organic acids and phenols dittmar et al 2008 the spe procedure was modified from qiu et al 2020b but again the formic acid was used instead of hcl to avoid the introduction of chloride ion affecting the annotation and analysis of molecular formulae boutegrabet et al 2012 gonsior et al 2014 the molecular information was acquired with an ultra performance

2020a 2020b shao et al 2021 has been achieved humic substances could be supramolecular associations of organic compounds with low molecular mass and chemodiversity linked by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions sutton and sposito 2005 esi could remove such intermolecular interactions allowing the true molecular weight of leachate dom to be resolved instrument parameters referred to leon et al 2019 and qiu et al 2020b details are described in supporting information si orbitrap ms was externally calibrated by standard solutions pierce ltq velos esi positive and pierce esi negative qiu et al 2020b capillary temperature of orbitrap ms had effect on the degree of ionization so 375 c was adopted based on the published studies of our group he et al 2021 qiu et al 2020a 2020b shao et al 2021 and others leon et al 2019 2 3 data mining deconvolution peak alignment and annotation of molecular formulae achieved via an established software package compound discoverer 3 2 thermo fisher scientific inc usa were used to obtain dom information the above methodology followed previous studies he et al 2021 qiu et al 2020a 2020b shao et al 2021 and the criteria of data mining was recommended by veenaas et al 2018 and qiu et al 2020b the elemental range of molecular formulae was set as 12c2 50 1h2 100 16o0 30 14n0 2 32s0 1 chen et al 2018 and the mass tolerance of annotation was 5 ppm the calculation of molecular indexes i e molecular weight mw h c o c n c double bond equivalence dbe modified aromaticity index aimod nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc was described in the si the value of dbe minus o was limited to range from 10 to 10 herzsprung et al 2014 elemental ratios of 0 3 h c 2 25 and 0 o c 1 2 were employed to further restrict the formula calculation chance et al 2018 hawkes et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the above molecular indexes were calculated based on weighted peak intensities under esi mode and esi mode respectively in the table s3 and s4 the detailed cutoff restrictions of the subcategories in the van krevelen diagram were summarized in the si besides the relationship between dom molecular information and bulk indicators of lcs was carried out by redundancy analysis and spearman correlation analysis the obtained molecular mass peak intensities were corrected by the loading volume and eluting volume of the solid phase extraction qiu et al 2020a eq 1 the term concentration characteristics herein referred to concentration factor cf calculated in eq 2 representing the ratio of the peak intensities of dom molecules in the primary membrane concentrates to ones in the raw leachate or ones in the secondary concentrates to ones in the influent herein the volume reduction is based on water volume described in engineering scale treatment plants as freshwater recovery rate while the concentration effect is based on relative peak change linked to the various molecular formulae obtained from non target analysis of dom 1 a a v e l u t e v l o a d 2 c f a r a 0 100 where a and a are the actual peak intensity and the corrected peak intensity velute and vload indicate the eluting volume and the loading volume of spe ar is the corrected peak intensity of the molecule in the lcs while a0 is the one in the raw leachate when the lcs are from primary membrane units or in the influent when the lcs are from secondary membrane units the peak intensities mentioned below are all corrected ones to be noticed if dom molecules in lcs can be also recognized in the raw leachate they are considered to be of leachate origin and recorded as l dom while those unrecognized in the raw leachate are considered to be of other origin e g they are produced by mbr and recorded as mbrp dom or they are additionally added for membrane maintenance therefore within a certain margin of error if the cf is greater than 130 the molecule is considered to be well concentrated by the membrane unit subscripted as concentrated if the cf is equal to 70 130 the molecule is considered to be unchanged from the influent subscripted as unchanged if the cf is less than 70 the molecule is considered to be partially retained subscripted as partially retained cortés francisco and caixach 2013 phungsai et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular characterization of dom in the lcs 3 1 1 molecular indexes totally there were fifteen samples from primary membrane units including six raw leachates rw four nanofiltration concentrates nfc and five reverse osmosis concentrates roc their physicochemical properties are shown in table s2 cod concentrations of nfc and roc varied from 4428 to 39 573 mg l and from 525 to 37 600 mg l respectively while the ratios of bod5 cod were lower than 0 020 0 029 significantly lower than that of rw 0 042 0 546 indicating lcs low biodegradability nh 4 n concentrations of nfc and roc varied from 0 to 103 mg l and from 0 to 60 0 mg l dramatically lower than rw 1066 4750 mg l too as shown in fig 2 the median h cwa of dom in both nfc and roc was 1 34 significantly lower than 1 47 in rw p 0 05 under esi mode since biological treatment could preferentially remove dom with h cwa more than 1 5 shao et al 2021 however nfc dom and roc dom had significantly higher dbewa 5 67 6 17 4 99 5 88 p 0 05 noscwa 0 49 0 3 0 60 0 36 p 0 05 and aimodwa 0 23 0 32 0 21 0 35 p 0 05 than those in rw dom under esi mode implying that nfc and roc comprised of more unsaturated and aromatized dom roc dom had a significantly higher n cwa p 0 05 than rw dom under both esi and esi modes indicating the existence of abundant nitrogen functional groups in roc besides dom with lower nosc was considered to be potentially biodegradable primarily contributed by protein like and lipid like fractions zhou et al 2019 as fig s1 however there was no significant difference between the molecular indexes of nfc and roc considering the flexible application of ro in leachate treatment processes the range of molecular indexes of roc was broader than that of nfc the relationship between bulk indicators and dom molecular indexes was determined by spearman correlation fig 3 the results under esi mode showed that lcs owa and o cwa were positively correlated with cod bod5 doc and don r 0 693 p 0 01 supporting that lcs were rich in organic matter containing oxygen functional groups xiang et al 2022 specifically under esi mode lcs mwwa r 0 571 0 846 p 0 05 and dbewa r 0 659 0 757 p 0 05 was positively correlated with cod bod5 doc and don and cwa was positively correlated with cod doc and don r 0 714 0 743 p 0 01 it could be assumed that lcs dom was occupied by recalcitrant compounds with high condensation and a high degree of unsaturation shao et al 2021 wu and li 2021 while the low mw dom was dominated in most of lcs besides under esi mode lcs noscwa was positively correlated with cod bod5 doc and don r 0 802 0 875 p 0 001 indicating that especially when the don was relatively low an oxidation process was recommended to reduce the organic fractions in lcs with low organic content e g lcs from membrane units treating mbr effluent swa and s cwa were negatively correlated with cod doc and don r 0 639 p 0 05 additionally under esi mode fig 3b bod5 had significantly positive correlation with dbewa and noscwa r 0 568 and 0 582 p 0 05 implying that compounds with low oxidation degree zhou et al 2019 and low unsaturation degree accounting for less than 5 in the light value of bod5 cod 0 029 could be potentially utilized by microorganisms taking the covariance and representativeness of the indicators into consideration ec nh 4 n no 3 n and bod5 were used as environmental factors for redundancy analysis rda fig 3c and 3d besides the partitioning of rda results reflected the similarity of the samples in particular a roc and a dtroc were divided into areas different from the other samples indicating that lcs from incineration leachate alone were different from other processes dom in roc and roc fed dtroc was uniformed plant b and e both treated landfill leachate and adopted the similar treatment process leading to similar lcs characteristics in the same process ec had greater effect on dtroc samples then roc and nfc in order 3 1 2 elemental composition and van krevelen classification the cho type molecules in all lcs were less than those in rw fig 4 under esi mode fig 4a and 4c rw and lcs were dominated by chon type 50 molecules followed by cho chons and chos while lignins carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules cram like organics 41 9 66 2 were the dominated subcategory followed by proteins 13 4 27 5 and lipids 5 43 13 9 under esi mode the proportion of chos type molecules in both nfc 7 72 9 30 and hsfc 7 77 12 0 was reduced compared with the corresponding rw 9 67 12 3 fig 4b in addition the proportion of chons type molecules in roc esi 11 9 18 5 esi 7 31 20 9 was increased compared with rw esi 4 13 12 7 esi 4 52 8 55 both the elemental composition and van krevelen classification showed little change between a dtroc and a roc less than 1 08 under esi mode and less than 0 66 under esi mode it was suggested that these two types of lcs were likely suitable for the same treatment and chon cho and chons type molecules should be more focused on similarly the composition of c roc and c dtroc satisfied a uniform pattern with values of less than 0 40 and 0 88 variation under esi mode and esi mode respectively among lcs b nfc was closer to the molecular composition ratio characteristics of rw indicating that b nfc might present similar property of b ll and be suitable to adopt similar treatment technology in the mbr unit lipids and proteins were relatively simple in structure and biodegradable to be well removed and transformed so that the contents of lipids and proteins in lcs were less than ones in rw however roc in plant a b c and e was retained by ro unit fed on mbr effluent microfiltration mf effluent or nf effluent containing a higher ratio of aromatic organics than rw of the same plant under esi mode xiang et al 2022 while the proportion of such components in roc of plant b c and e except d roc fed on lcs was higher than nfc of the same process it could be explained that residual aromatic organics with low mw and low biodegradation potential in the mbr effluent wang et al 2020a were not easily retained by membrane units and were more likely to flow into effluent shao et al 2021 the recalcitrant lipids and proteins were probably comprised of long chain saturated sphingolipids usually with 16 24 carbon atoms in the acyl portion sandhoff 2010 3 2 characteristics of dom in primary membrane systems 3 2 1 flow analysis of dom molecule composition as shown in fig s2 100 400 da dom molecules were the most abundant in leachate and lcs accounting for 88 6 99 2 under esi mode and 91 4 98 5 under esi mode the relative proportion of 300 400 da dom molecules in a roc increased relative to a il esi from 14 1 to 24 7 esi from 16 8 to 18 6 for plant b and e the proportion of 200 300 da nfc dom increased compared with rw but the proportion of 100 300 da nfc dom differed little from rw there was an increased proportion of 100 300 da dom molecules in roc relative to rw which was the main component of the nf effluent there was no difference in the proportion of molecules with different mw between c nfc and c roc implying that c nf had no diversion at the mw level in the newly produced concentrates from hsf1 unit fed on nfc in plant c and d the proportion of 100 300 da molecules decreased and the proportion of 300 500 da molecules increased in contrast the hsf1 effluent was treated by hsf2 and the molecular ratio characteristics of hsf2c were closer to those of roc i e c roc generated from c nf effluent as well as d roc generated from d hsf1c and d hsf2c in plant a and c the ratio of molecules of various mw did not change significantly after dtro unit indicating that mw was not the main limiting factor in the treatment of roc by dtro the retention characteristics of dom in rw via membrane treatment were not simply physical that is it cannot be explained solely on the basis of molecular weight cutoff mwco braeken et al 2005 cortes francisco et al 2014 wang et al 2020a the value of mwco was often defined by the retention test of hydrophilic better hydrated polar molecules such as polyethylene glycols or sugars hydrophobic compounds had a low retention effect due to the absence of hydration especially when mw was near to or slightly higher than mwco however when the mw gap between mw and mwco was enough the effect of hydrophobicity weakened as the molecular size increased braeken et al 2005 in this study depending on the venn classification the elemental composition classification and van krevelen classification the comprehensive dom molecular flow was obtained under esi mode as shown in fig 5 as well as table s5 and s6 in terms of elemental composition mbr derived dom usually consisted of more n containing compounds 3 2 2 relative peak intensity characteristics of l dom in nfc in terms of the degree of aggregation fig 6 l dom concentrated molecules were the most abundant in nfc accounting for 45 1 97 7 of l dom under esi mode and 50 9 98 5 under esi mode distribution characteristics of l dom concentrated in nfc were similar to those of the leachate streams wang et al 2020a mostly concentrated in carbon atomic numbers of 10 20 and dbe of 0 10 see as fig s3 moreover l dom concentrated in nfc comprised mainly of lignins cram like organics and the proportions of other components were in order protein like and lipid like components under esi mode while protein like and tannin like components were at the second place under esi mode indicating the poor biodegradation potential wang et al 2020a the proportion of molecules with great amounts of carbon atoms and a higher dbe in l dom concentrated in nfc was usually slightly higher than the other two i e l dom unchanged and l dom partially retained as shown in fig s3 indicating that the unsaturated component of l dom was more easily trapped by nf compared with rw l dom in lcs exhibiting peak intensity increased characteristics was hard to remove further by membrane units so that l dom concentrated should be paid more attention under esi mode fig 7 a d nfc l dom concentrated was divided by elemental composition in order of magnitude in relative proportions as follows chon 65 9 76 2 cho 8 46 21 4 chons 10 5 15 2 among nfc l dom concentrated cho3 5 accounted for the highest proportion of cho type molecules while cho2 6n1 and cho2 4n2 accounted for the highest proportion of chon type molecules and cho4n1s1 accounted for the highest proportion of chons type molecules under esi mode fig 7e h nfc l dom concentrated was divided by elemental composition in order of magnitude in relative proportions as follows cho 39 8 54 9 chon 31 6 45 4 chos 6 79 9 73 chons 4 82 7 96 among nfc l dom concentrated cho3 5 accounted for the highest proportion of cho type molecules while cho3n1 and cho5n2 accounted for the highest proportion of chon type molecules cho5s1 accounted for the highest proportion of chos type molecules besides cho4 5n1s1 and cho3n2s1 accounted for the highest proportion of chons type molecules the abundance of l dom molecules concentrated by nf was similar with a higher proportion of cho type and chon type molecules followed by chons type and chos type molecules the characteristics of cho type dom reflected the difference in leachates chos type molecules in lcs came from anti sludge agents i e small molecule alcohols and alkyl benzene sulfonic acid added to ensure the proper functioning of the membrane system wu and li 2021 other s containing substances were likely to be derived from sulphonates sulphonamides and their metabolites yu et al 2016 biodegradation was the main removal pathway but there was a high risk of halogenated disinfection by products dbp formation if present in saline wastewater gong et al 2016 l dom concentrated in nfc assumed the risk of rw and was concentrated to some extent and should be the focus of attention for lcs treatment 3 2 3 relative peak intensity characteristics of l dom in roc unlike nfc roc showed a higher proportion of l dom with peak intensity reduction accounting for 55 2 92 8 of l dom under esi mode and 50 3 96 8 under esi mode as shown in fig 6 under esi mode c nf and e nf concentrated only around 50 of l dom but c ro and e ro concentrated or maintained the l dom more than a ro and b ro fig 6a indicating that ro had a complementary effect on the concentration of l dom in addition c ro treated a certain percentage of fresh leachate and had a relatively high working pressure table s1 which in combination affected the concentration characteristics of c ro fig s4 l dom partially retained of roc was recorded under esi and esi modes fig s5 representing l dom removed by bio treatment or poorly intercepted by ro so as to flow into the effluent under esi mode the proportion of cho type l dom partially retained in a roc was 70 3 higher than that in roc from other processes 35 1 53 8 besides such proportion in roc was correlated positively to the leachate age it was assumed that the cho type molecules might be a key fraction in measuring the aging degree of leachate and that their content varied more by water quality characteristics than by membrane types 3 3 characteristics of dom in secondary membrane systems dom in a dtroc accounted for more than 50 of the components in dtro influent i e roc to be more specific the retention rate was 69 5 74 0 esi and 66 3 71 9 esi in regard to the elemental composition subcategories while the retention rate was 57 1 76 9 and 60 3 79 2 respectively in regard to the van krevelen subcategories it was inferred that dtro intercepted most of fractions in roc unsaturated hydrocarbons aromatic organics and lignins cram like organics were more readily retained by a dtro on the whole herein almost all subcategories of l dom were more effectively retained than those of mbrp dom the retention rate of dom fraction in the c dtroc to the influent c roc was slightly greater under esi mode 59 5 than that in the esi mode 49 3 unsaturated hydrocarbons were better retained by c dtro with retention rate of 78 6 esi and 83 3 esi on the whole the number of molecules in roc cannot be retained by dtro that is they had a high probability of entering the dtro effluent for plant a these molecules were approximately 27 4 and 31 4 of roc under esi mode and esi mode respectively however the number of molecules in roc not retained by dtro in plant c was approximately 40 5 and 50 7 of roc under esi mode and esi mode respectively around 45 of l dom in c roc was remained in the dtro effluent higher than the residue in the effluent when treating the incineration leachate alone only around 30 under esi mode lipids and proteins of landfill leachate source in c roc with retention rate less than 40 were more likely to enter the c dtro effluent while proteins and carbohydrates of mbrp source were more likely to enter the c dtro effluent besides c dtro had better retention of aromatic organics from both landfill leachate and mbrp sources additionally for cho type l dom a dtro intercepted around 90 of a roc while c dtro intercepted around 50 of c roc dtro units i e a dtro and c dtro were fed by roc generated from leachates with two distinct oxidation levels in the engineering scale leachate treatment facilities more specifically the influent of a dtro was roc fed on incineration leachate while the one of c dtro was roc fed on a mixture of incineration leachate and landfill leachate mature landfill leachate was more oxidized and its dom fraction was more complex under long term microbial degradation chen et al 2020 besides membrane treatment processes such as nf and ro could retain dom with relatively high dbe and abundant oxygen functional groups cortés francisco and caixach 2013 cortes francisco et al 2014 shao et al 2021 therefore dtro was relatively ineffective in retaining dom molecules from more oxidized landfill leachate the number of molecules in nfc not retained by hsf1 in plant c was approximately 36 8 and 41 2 of nfc under esi mode and esi mode the number of molecules not retained by hsf2 accounted for 45 2 and 58 6 under esi mode and esi mode respectively however the number of molecules in nfc not retained by hsf1 in plant d was approximately 27 6 and 33 9 of nfc under esi mode and esi mode respectively the number of molecules not retained by hsf2 accounted for 57 5 and 63 7 under esi mode and esi mode respectively hsf1 retained 60 70 of the dom molecules in nfc and hsf2 retained 35 55 of dom in the hsf1 effluent from an effluent perspective it was highly likely that the number of molecules entering hsf2 effluent was around 15 25 of nfc suggesting that hsf1 and hsf2 were complementary in controlling the abundance of molecules in the final hsf2 effluent as shown in fig 8 a and 8b under esi mode the ratio of l dom unchanged to l dom in dtroc was 57 8 for plant a and 81 2 for plant c verifying that peak intensities of l dom in dtroc were similar to those of roc in addition roc and dtroc in plant a and c had similar proportion characteristics of subcategories divided from elemental classification and van krevelen classification fig 4 hence dom reduction of dtro units depended more on the volume reduction the overall reduction in the amount of l dom retained in the dtroc resulted in a much higher environmental risk to the dtro effluent a dtroc had 36 5 of l dom concentrated relative to c dtroc 10 5 suggesting that the biodegradability degree was valued for dom concentration effect of subsequent dtro units c hsf1 and d hsf1 had completely different concentration characteristics for l dom in nfc in fig 8c and 8d it was related to the nf concentration characteristics in fig 6 d nf concentrated more than 95 of l dom while c nf only showed a concentration effect on around 50 of l dom in contrast the proportion of l dom concentrated in d hsf1c was larger than that in c hsf1c it indicated that most of l dom concentrated in nfc was hardly concentrated by hsf1 and that hsf1 could retained some nfc l dom in terms of volume reduction but did not show concentration effect on peak intensities the results provided a theoretical basis at the dom level for the assessment of membrane performance and the frequency suggestion of membrane replacement providing a potential new direction for the scientific study of membrane retention and contamination 4 implications and suggestions the present study showed that nf concentrated close to 50 100 l dom in the studied plants and these concentrated components were less biodegradable as indicated by high condensation and unsaturation i e high values of dbe nosc and aimod but low value of h c and rich protein like and tannin like components due to the high content of organic components in these concentrates it was meaningful to recycle some of them as a kind of resource i e hsf1c when it was not severely limited by salt content however roc was more difficult to treat due to high salt and low organic matter characteristics that is the interference of inorganic components made it difficult to remove organic matter nevertheless ro had a higher micropollutant retention than nf wuensch et al 2022 then roc fed dtroc intercepted and concentrated most of components in roc exacerbating the challenge to treat dtroc the attempt and exploration of treatment technologies for such concentrates should be enhanced overall considering derivative risks arising from different feasible treatment technologies the difficulty level for lcs treatment was showed in following orders dtroc roc nfc considering the high content of lignins cram like organics protein like components tannin like components unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatic organics with low molecular weight in lcs electrolysis coagulation or fenton reaction combined with powdered activated carbon pac adsorption he et al 2021 is likely to be the most effective way to treat various subcategories of l dom in lcs besides electrolysis combined with ozonation can serve as effective treatment of lcs with abundant lignin cram like organics other refractory chon s type dom and rich chorine ions wang et al 2020b comparatively biological treatment and specific membrane separation technologies i e uf and nf might not be efficient since they have a limited removal of the bulk lignins cram like organics and protein like components retained in lcs besides additional heteroatomic substances were potentially generated in conjunction with biological treatment more et al 2014 the selection of leachate treatment process should also take economic practicality and carbon emission into account membrane separation technologies have been widely applied as advanced treatment of both incineration leachate and landfill leachate however membrane advanced treatment could increase the direct and indirect environmental impacts by an average of 146 despite of the reduction of 59 eutrophication potential on average zhang et al 2021 therefore it is suggested that relatively early stage leachates such as incineration leachate do not always need membrane advanced treatment to fulfill the stringent regulations instead optimizing biochemical treatment can reduce the economic pressure and negative environmental impacts brought by membrane treatment besides there is no significant difference in the treatment of pollutants between nf ro and ro alone but nf can reduce the pressure on ro and extend the service life of ro units zhang et al 2021 therefore it is recommended that ro units should be set after nf units so as to ensure treatment stability and reasonable lifespan of membranes especially when treating mature landfill leachate whether to choose membrane separation technology as a bottom up technology for leachate treatment and give full play to its superiority is an issue with two sides wuensch et al 2022 on one hand when the membrane unit is operated ideally the effluent can easily meet the standard but the concentrate is usually riskier and there is a bottleneck in how to treat it effectively on the other hand when the membrane unit is operated poorly it is difficult to meet effluent standard but it may be less bothered and less expensive to treat the concentrate even in the treatment of stabilized leachate different types of membrane units for various leachates do not work as a guaranteed technology and the retention characteristics in practice fluctuate greatly in addition new membrane treatment technologies require additional consideration it is suggested that membrane units that intercept and concentrate more l dom may be more suitable for use as leachate emergency treatment processes in the short term 5 conclusions this study compared five typical membrane advanced treatment processes on the same benchmark from the point of molecular information with aim to identify the origin and characteristics of different leachate concentrates in nfc 45 1 98 5 of l dom showed concentrated characteristics with the increase of peak intensities higher than 30 of that in leachate and molecular abundance of nfc l dom concentrated was similar the proportion of cho type and chon type dom was relatively higher and the unsaturated components in l dom were more easily trapped by nf whereas hsf1 the typical secondary membrane system treating nfc intercepted l dom in nfc mainly based on volume reduction but concentration effect hsf1 retained 60 70 of the dom molecules in nfc and hsf2 retained 35 55 of dom in the hsf1 effluent from an effluent perspective it was highly likely that the number of molecules entering hsf2 effluent was around 15 25 of nfc suggesting that hsf1 and hsf2 were complementary in controlling the abundance of molecules in the final hsf2 effluent unlike nfc l dom roc l dom showed a higher proportion of peak intensity reduced components accounting for 50 3 96 8 and organic composition changes were more dependent on water quality characteristics than membrane types dtro the typical secondary membrane system treating roc intercepted 49 3 72 6 of l dom the water quality characteristics of dtroc were similar to roc however dtro may be less effective at intercepting dom molecules in landfill leachate with higher oxidation levels above information would be useful for the treatment or valorization of leachate concentrates and for recognizing the performance and optimization measures of membrane treatment systems nevertheless the effluent samples from the mbr unit were not collected in this study so that it seems inappropriate to assess the peak intensity change of bioderived dom during subsequent membrane treatment follow up studies are suggested to focus on the characteristics of derived dom at different biological treatment stages during various membrane treatment processes in order to better refine the understanding of lcs dom at the molecular level credit authorship contribution statement tianqi li investigation resources data curation

15286,in recent years graphene oxide go as a new carbon material has been widely investigated as adsorbent and catalyst however effects of go on the micro pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps under sunlight remains unclear in this study the degradation of ppcps in a simulated sunlight go photocatalytic system was systematically investigated specifically go rapidly degrade 95 of acetaminophen apap within 10 min under simulated sunlight irradiation λ 350 nm the influencing factors such as apap concentration ph go dosage water matrixes cl no3 hco3 so4 2 ca2 fe3 and fulvic acid were investigated at a go dosage of 100 mg l 1 and an initial ph of 7 the apap 5 μm photodegradation kinetic constant k obs was calculated to be 0 4547 min 1 in practical applications the go photocatalysis system still degrade over 90 apap within 60 min in real surface water the electron spin resonance and radical scavenging experiments revealed that the dominated active species for degrading apap was photogenerated holes h while other mechanisms 1o2 and o2 ho2 played a minor role furthermore the photochemical transformation of some other typical ppcps were comparatively studied to reveal the relationship between degradation kinetics and molecular structure based on descriptive variables including molar refractive index parameter octanol water partition coefficient dissociation constant and dipole moment a quantitative structural activity relationship qsar model for predicting pseudo first order rate constants was established with a high significance r2 0 996 p 0 05 this study helps to understand the interaction between go and ppcps and its effects on the photochemical transformation of ppcps in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords graphene oxide simulated sunlight photooxidation of ppcps photochemical transformation qsar data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction graphene oxide go consists of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice with oxygen containing functional groups ofgs are situated in the base defects hydroxyl and epoxy groups and edges carboxyl groups han et al 2021 pedrosa et al 2020 the hydrophobic sp2 domains and hydrophilic sp3 oxygen containing functional domains of go make it semiconducting like properties resulting in a significant band gap which can be controlled by adjusting the content and composition of ofgs jiang et al 2013 putri et al 2016 in view of its unique physicochemical and photoelectronic properties go has been studied in micro supercapacitors kumar et al 2019 precision device assembly chu et al 2014 microcapsules modified for solar energy storage liu et al 2018 novel drug carrier design pooresmaeil and namazi 2018 and other fields moreover the π conjugated structure of go makes it photosensitive matsumoto et al 2011 while its strong hydrophilicity derives from the abundance of polar ofgs on the surface bansal et al 2017 these signified that go may able to exhibit photochemical reactivity in an aqueous environment several studies have indicated that go can be induced transformed by light with its environmental behavior and toxicity changes chowdhury et al 2015 hou et al 2015 2017 kuang et al 2020 proposed the different photochemical environmental behaviors of go were obtained under various light sources gao et al 2019 proved that uv irradiation was more effective than visible light irradiation in modifying the physicochemical properties and increasing the toxicity of go therefore more researches have aimed at developing visible light based catalytic methods in recent years which would reduce energy consumption and eliminate the reliance on fragile uv lamps containing hazardous mercury cheng et al 2020 go has been extensively used as wastewater treatment membrane materials and catalysts with its excellent physicochemical properties e g abundant adsorption sites biocompatibility cao et al 2021 the aquatic toxicity of go could be weakened after co irradiation with other ions e g cu2 and go was stable in the natural water environment thus the significant aqueous transport of go was possible chowdhury et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 over the last decade two dimensional graphene has brought new impetus to environmental photocatalysis while go was mainly used as metallic and non metallic support flexible substrate or co catalyst to improve photocatalytic efficiency zhang et al 2020 cruz et al 2017 prepared go tio2 composites which could oxidize the mixture solution of four pesticides diquat alachlor isoproturon and atrazine with 300 min uv vis irradiation tong et al 2015 proposed a three dimensional porous g c3n4 graphene oxide aerogel to degrade 92 of methyl orange 20 mg ml 1 under visible light within 4 h herein go could contribute to the nanoparticle dispersion and separation efficiency of photogenerated e h through its electron acceptor properties however most of these studies ignored that go can be used as sole photocatalyst and transformed during irradiation several studies have reported that the light exposure of go can change its physicochemical properties resulting in a significant degree of fragmentation and the production of lmw species mainly hydroxylated and or carboxylated pah compounds chowdhury et al 2015 shams et al 2019 meanwhile some researchers have applied only go for light mediated energy conversion kuang et al 2020 used go with simulated sunlight and uv irradiation to achieve the photocatalytic reduction of co2 and eliminate the formation of the by product co yeh et al 2011 constructed a methodology that go with different oxygen levels can be excited to split water under visible light irradiation as per above studies the photoactivation reaction of go has been demonstrated to be feasible and the phototransformation of go has been confirmed but go was not applied to photodegrade the organic pollutants therefore this study investigated the environmental behavior of go during organic pollutants degradation and opened up new possibilities for using go as a photocatalyst in environmental remediation pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps represent important emerging contaminants of global concern bu et al 2013 currently ppcps cannot be effectively removed by traditional wastewater treatment plants due to their toxic and recalcitrant properties wang and wang 2016 furthermore they are considered as pseudo persistent because of their continuous discharge from wastewater treatment plants agricultural runoff aquaculture and ppcps manufacturing sites liu et al 2020 therefore finding a cost effective method for removing ppcps from aqueous environment is necessary while the above mentioned economical go can be employed due to its photosensitive potential in principle go undergoes a series of phototransformation when exposed to sunlight in surface water but the interaction between go during the phototransformation process and ppcps in aqueous environments has not been thoroughly explored this study systematically investigated the differences in apap degradation under different conditions and the structure activity relationship in the simulated sunlight activated go system the physicochemical properties of go were characterized to verify the microscopic morphology material crystal property elemental chemical state and electrochemical property the oxidative degradation mechanism was explored by the electron spin resonance and radical scavenging experiments additionally six other ppcps such as sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol degradation experiments were conducted by same go light system and their pseudo first order rate constants were also calculated finally the qsar model was developed to reveal the selectivity of different ppcps and their structure activity relationship in the go light system which provided a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the go light system and environmental pollutants 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals the detailed information of chemical reagents such as target ppcps radical quenching agents and reagents controlling different reaction conditions are provided in text s1 real water samples were collected from east lake el wuhan china and xing lake xl wuhan china and filtered by 0 22 μm micropore polyethersulfone pes membrane before use the water quality parameters of these samples are listed in table s1 all the reagents were ar grade and were used as received without further purification ultrapure water with an 18 25 mω cm resistivity from a youpu water purification system chengdu china was used throughout this work 2 2 preparation and characterizations of go the go used in the catalytic experiments was synthesized with graphite as the precursor by the modified hummers method saleem et al 2018 and the detailed procedure is supplied in text s2 the characterization methods of go such as physical phase morphology crystal property elemental chemical state and photoelectrochemistry property are presented in text s3 2 3 photodegradation procedures the degradation experiments were carried out in the photocatalytic device as shown in fig s1 specifically a 500 ml glass jacketed beaker connected to a constant temperature water circulation 25 2 c was used as the reaction vessel the simulated sunlight source was composed of two xenon lamps 35 w λ 350 nm irradiating vertically through the reactor the irradiance spectrum was shown in fig s2 which shows that the substantial irradiation range is mainly in the 400 700 nm and the uv intensity is relatively weak for a typical go photocatalytic process 40 mg go catalyst was added in 400 ml apap 5 μm and the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 0 after igniting the xenon lamps on both sides 1 ml sample was collected through a 0 45 μm pes filter at a specific time interval for subsequent analysis a ph meter sin ph6 3 sinomeasure china and a dissolved oxygen do meter sin dy3000 sinomeasure china were used to online monitor the ph and do variations during the reaction 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of apap was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc ultimate 3000 thermo scientific usa the hplc analytical methods for apap and other ppcps are given in text s4 and table s2 reactive oxygen species were captured on an electron spin resonance esr spectrometer jes fa200 jeol japan using dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agents the test conditions for oh 1o2 and o2 are given in text s5 in the quenching experiment a certain amount of tba sod ffa edta 2na or a nitrogen environment was introduced to scavenge oh o2 1o2 h and oxygen respectively in addition the steady state concentration of oh o2 ho2 and h2o2 were investigated the benzene capture method was used to determine the oh the concentration of o2 ho2 was determined in a spectrophotometer using xtt sodium salt as a probe dpd pod spectrophotometry was used to quantify the h2o2 concentration photodegradation intermediates of apap were detected using a liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometer lc hrms tripleqtof5600 absciex usa and gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 450 gc 320 ms varian usa the detailed information for the lc hrms and gc ms analysis are given in text s6 and text s7 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization in the xrd patterns fig 1 a graphite exhibits a strong and sharp diffraction peak at 2θ 25 2 corresponding to a d spacing of 0 35 nm which is attributed to the 0 0 2 crystal plane fathy et al 2016 the diffraction peak of go at 25 2 is significantly weaker than that of graphite and a new diffraction peak appears at 9 5 with an increased layer spacing of 0 92 nm this observation indicated that the water molecule and ofgs such as carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy groups were inserted within layers of graphite during the oxidation process thus destroying the sp2 π conjugated structure supplementary analysis on go layer spacing is given in fig s3 as shown in the sem image fig 1a inset the oxidation treatment resulted in the thin and multilayer overlapping go sheets in addition go sheets were found to curl in the physical state and the folded structure was apparent the tem image fig 1a inset shows a thin and convoluted layer structure of go on the micrometer scale while larger size stacked structure of the precursor graphite was observed in the sem and tem images fig s4 compared to graphite the characteristic peaks in ftir spectra fig 1b of water adsorbed on the go surface were significantly strengthened and various ofgs were introduced meanwhile the presence of ofgs in go can also be confirmed with the significant enhancement of c o and c o characteristic peaks in the xps pattern fig 1c and table s3 as given in the raman spectra fig 1d the strong and sharp g bands and insignificant d bands were found in the graphite sample as a feature of highly graphitized materials with fewer defects as a result of the significant rise in id ig values from 0 06 to 0 97 after oxidation it could be concluded that the insertion of oxygen atoms induced disorder in the lattice structure of graphene the bet bjh parameters of go table s4 showed a slight increase in the specific surface area after oxidation and the surface zeta potential of go was highly negative in the ph 2 10 range fig s9 the specific characterization analysis of ftir xps raman n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and zeta potential are proposed in figs s5 9 the band gap of go was evaluated by the tauc plot fig s10b that was derived from the uv vis drs spectra fig s10a and the band gap was calculated to be approximately 2 3 3 7 ev additionally the results of eis transient photocurrent mott schottky and associated schematic energy level diagrams figs s11 and 12 revealed semiconductor like properties of go based on the above results and supplementary analysis in figs s3 12 it was confirmed that the go material with abundant ofgs and unique photoelectronic properties was synthesized 3 2 photodegradation of apap the degradation efficiency of apap under different conditions are shown in fig 2 a apap was not degraded under only light conditions the natural graphite as the precursor of go has no adsorption and photodegradation effect on apap because of the zero band gap characteristic of graphite thus photogenerated e h can be easily recombined in addition the adsorption and photolytic effects on apap were negligible because of the low specific surface area of go for comparison the simulated light could effectively activate go to degrade 95 apap 5 μm under neutral conditions within 10 min while the adsorption level was only 16 9 within 60 min under dark reaction conditions indicating that the go light system performed superior photocatalytic performance on the other hand tio2 as the traditional photocatalyst could be excited by sunlight malato et al 2009 which was used to compare with go under the same conditions there was almost no adsorption of apap using tio2 which was able to degrade 90 5 apap within 60 min under same experimental conditions in terms of reaction rate constants go k obs 0 4547 min 1 degraded apap is about 6 9 times more efficiently than tio2 k obs 0 0661 min 1 which was due to the ofgs on the go surface forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules therefore the solventization of the go sheets in an aqueous solution spontaneously peeled off to form stable dispersions bansal et al 2017 thus facilitating the interaction between go and pollutants and improving the utilization of light furthermore according to the xrd sem tem ftir xps raman results and analysis of go before and after photoreaction figs s3 7 it can be inferred that a slow reduction trend of go happened during the irradiation and the incomplete removal of abundant ofgs can maintain the relatively stable state of go the real time monitoring of ph and do in the go light system during the reaction are shown in fig s13 the ph of the solution decreased to an acidic level following the reaction while the do content did not change significantly in 60 min in addition there was an insignificant effect of irradiation energy intensity on the final degradation efficiency of apap but it had a positive effect on the initial degradation rate fig s14 which indicated that increasing the light irradiation energy in the appropriate range facilitated the activation of go fig 2b shows the changes in toc during the different reactions during go light processes toc showed an increasing trend in the later period so the toc changes of go suspension under light conditions were studied individually the difference between the two groups of experimental data showed that the removal rate of toc could reach 60 within 240 min in addition light would cause unstable go sheets to decompose to small organic molecules thus the toc of filtered go aqueous solution showed an upward trend as presented in fig 2c the uv absorption of the dispersion was proportional to the number of go sheets dispersed in water bansal et al 2017 a significant increase in the characteristic peak absorbance of go suspension was observed during exposure to light suggesting that light irradiation changed the chemical structure of go and produced absorbing substances which corresponding to the decrease in oxygen content and the partial recovery of the sp2 π conjugated network of go eda et al 2010 gengler et al 2013 however the uv vis comparison results of go filtrate did not show the characteristic peak of go and the increase in absorbance during the irradiation process was not remarkable fig s15a in addition the uv vis spectrum of apap solution did not change with the irradiation time increased fig s15b which is consistent with the hplc results fig 2d shows the photoluminescence pl intensities of go filtrate as a function of excitation and emission wavelength with an inhomogeneous pl band at 350 450 nm the fluorescence of go is composed of an excited state protonation of the cooh group and an excitation wavelength dependent fluorescence from the polar groups such as the oh moiety in go cushing et al 2014 and the enhancement of pl peak fluorescence at 400 nm was observed after irradiation which was in agreement with the increased absorbance results which was attributed to the increase in the proportion of local sp2 sites during the reduction process eda et al 2010 hou et al 2015 additionally photoluminescence spectra was used to analyze the changes in apap during the reaction fig 2e with the irradiation a significant fluorescence enhancement at 430 nm was observed and the pl peak showed red shifted and enhanced intensity compared with the go suspension which may contribute to the ofgs of go changed during the interaction with apap in conclusion the photochemical behavior of both go and apap could change under coexistence conditions 3 3 influence factors in go light process 3 3 1 effect of initial apap concentration under dark conditions there was no obvious adsorption effect of go on apap however 1 50 μm apap could be effectively degraded in the go light system fig s16 furthermore in the low concentration range of 1 10 μm apap in each experimental process could be completely degraded in go light system within 60 min based on text s9 and fig 3 a the fitting parameters of kr β and klh of langmuir hinshelwood model were 4 9595 μm min 1 0 0388 l μmol 1 and 0 1924 min 1 respectively the high correlation coefficient r2 0 9894 implied that the photocatalytic degradation of apap in the go light system followed the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model meanwhile the kinetics of apap degradation in low concentrations 1 10 μm followed the pseudo first order equation while the inflection point appeared in the linear equation in high concentrations 10 50 μm which was due to the limited reactive active sites fig s17 therefore the concentration of apap was set as 5 μm in the following research and the pseudo first order rate constant k obs text s10 is used for the subsequent discussion 3 3 2 effect of ph the effect of ph on apap degradation is shown in fig 3b adsorption of apap by go was found to be relatively low 20 at different ph levels fig s18a and the adsorption capacity did not change significantly at ph 3 7 the molecular form of apap remains predominantly in neutral fig s19 showing the ph independent mechanism apap mainly exists as negative ions under alkaline conditions fig s19 and go has a negative surface charge fig s19 thus there should be adsorption inhibition occurring through stronger electrostatic repulsion weaker π π interactions and stronger water mediated steric hindrance at high ph values tang et al 2020 but there was no remarkable change in the adsorption capacity of apap on go at different solution ph values due to the presence of the various compensation mechanisms e g van der waals and h bond interaction chen and chen 2015 however the changes of go apap interaction were exhibited in photolysis with k obs decreased by 19 0 ph 9 and 33 3 ph 10 fig 3b while the system could still maintain 100 degradation within 60 min fig s18c the fastest photolysis k obs was obtained at ph 3 which was 29 1 higher than that of ph 7 fig 3b indicating the degradation of apap was favorable under acidic conditions in the go light system due to the deprotonation of ofgs on the go surface h was released into the solution during the adsorption process zhang et al 2021 then the ph showed a downward trend under dark conditions and an obvious trend could be observed with the increase in initial ph value fig s18b by observing the real time monitoring changes of ph fig s18b and d the rate of ph decrease under light conditions was faster than in dark conditions combined with the ph changes of go alone in fig s18b and d it is evident that the rapid decrease in ph under light is mainly attributed to go which may result in the photoactivation of go leading to deoxygenation to produce small molecules of acid as well as rgo ji et al 2013 while promoting the photodegradation of apap 3 3 3 effect of go dosage the effects of go dosage 10 30 50 70 100 and 200 mg l 1 on apap degradation efficiency were evaluated at an initial apap concentration of 5 μm ph 7 fig s20 as go dosage increased under dark reaction conditions apap adsorption increased slightly but reached only 21 at a dosage of 200 mg l 1 suggesting that the adsorption effect of go itself was not significant the higher go dosage resulted in the faster reaction rate in the go light system fig 3c apap degradation k obs increased by 65 9 from 70 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 and the difference between 200 mg l 1 and 100 mg l 1 was 27 9 nevertheless the difference between 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 dosage was not evident in the photodegradation of apap fig s20b which indicated that the efficiency of light utilization had reached saturation thus 100 mg l 1 was selected as the optimal dosage 3 3 4 reusability the reusability performance of the material in practical applications was evaluated under optimal conditions with recycled go by ethanol and water washing fig s21 after three cycles although the initial reaction rate decreased from 0 4763 to 0 0665 min 1 go still maintained a high photocatalytic activity to degrade 92 9 apap within 30 min which indicated that the go light system has potential in practical production applications the images of the go aqueous solution were taken during the cycling experiments fig s21 inset it could be observed that the color of the go aqueous solutions changed from light brown to black with the increase of the irradiation time this is because the light irradiation may alter the ofgs on go surfaces and sp2 π conjugated structures which was consistent with our speculation in the characterization results that go reduction would happen during the irradiation process more detailed analysis of the color change of the reaction solution is available in fig s21 in conclusion the photochemical behavior of go is altered when it undergoes photoreduction with color change 3 3 5 effect of sunlight in the real sunlight experiment fig 3d the reaction volume expanded to 800 ml under optimal conditions and was supplemented with 5 μm apap five times during the first 3 h as comparison apap was not photodegraded without go under sunlight while the initial 1 h irradiation period with the presence of go resulted in the complete degradation of the apap furthermore within 6 h the degradation rate decreased with the increase of irradiation time and go continued to degrade apap as shown in fig 3d the intensity of sunlight increased and reached the peak at noon then decreased with time the intensity of light could also influence the apap degradation rate by go which is consistent with the results of irradiation energy effect experiment 3 4 mechanistic insights 3 4 1 formation and role of ros radical scavenging experiments were employed to further reveal the mechanism of go activation by simulated sunlight fig 4 a ffa serves as a trapping agent for 1o2 k ffa 1 o 2 1 4 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 gottfried and kimel 1991 edta 2na was used to scavenge photogenerated h yuan et al 2022 tba serves as oh scavenger k tba oh 7 6 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 gordon et al 1977 and sod was used as a scavenger agent for o2 k sod o 2 1 6 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 bertini et al 1989 in fig s22a the addition of tba and sod inhibited the initial reaction rate of go photocatalytic apap degradation 42 8 and 36 9 respectively but did not deactivate the system the results indicated that both oh and o2 could be the active species in the go light system yeh et al 2011 demonstrated that go had similar conduction band cb edge levels thus the oxidation capacity of go was primarily determined by its valence band vb potential as shown in fig s12b go had an e vb value of 1 03 v which was lower than the redox potential of oh oh 2 38 v vs nhe liu et al 2018 indicating that go was not capable of oxidizing oh to produce oh via h the redox potential of o2 o2 was 0 33 v vs nhe wang et al 2015 and the e cb value of go was 1 27 v thus do could generate o2 ho2 by the single electron reduction k o 2 e 1 6 1010 m 1 s 1 zepp et al 1987 nevertheless zhang et al 2017 proved the direct oxidation effect of o2 for apap could be neglected by the xanthine xanthine oxide o2 generator reaction so o2 should be assumed to mainly react with the intermediate products of apap moreover e could also be strongly trapped by the ofgs on go surface hou et al 2015 as the do was not significantly consumed in the water fig s13 the role of do in the reaction was further investigated the experiments conducted under n2 atmosphere resulted in the decrease of k obs by 28 5 fig s22a which had no effect on the final degradation rate indicating that the do content only affected the initial reaction rate while the degradation of apap in the go light system was inhibited by 5 mm ffa and 100 mm edta 2na effectively fig s22b and the k obs was reduced by 94 0 and 94 6 respectively fig 4a the result indicated that 1o2 and photogenerated h played a major role in apap degradation as shown in fig s22b the addition of 5 mm ffa under n2 atmosphere also resulted in a 93 0 decrease of k obs there was a similar inhibition effect with either ffa with without n2 or edta 2na and whether 1o2 was responsible for this inhibition is still controversial ffa may not inhibit apap degradation by 1o2 quenching but by adsorption inhibition or competitive oxidation via electron transfer on the catalyst surface duan et al 2021 ffa can also capture oh k ffa oh 1 5 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 but it is impossible for this system to generate oh according to the energy level of go the addition of temp also inhibited apap degradation with an 84 1 decrease in k obs fig 4a however temp can not only scavenge 1o2 but also act as an electron donor that could be deprotonated to generate temp and then react with o2 to show tempo signal in esr spectrum that is not associated with 1o2 production nardi et al 2014 meanwhile the addition of ffa temp and edta 2na reduce of apap adsorption efficiency from 16 94 to 3 90 4 79 and 8 39 respectively indicating that the trapping agent inhibited the apap adsorption on go fig s23 a controlled study was conducted using ffa as the model substrate to identify the production of 1o2 further fig 4b it was found that ffa was not consumed under dark conditions the go light system can degrade 20 and 10 μm ffa under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively which indicated 1o2 and h participated in the degradation of ffa thus ffa could inhibit apap degradation even under n2 atmosphere li et al 2017 used rose bengal as photosensitizer and furfuraldehyde as reference compound at ph 7 to obtain the k apap 1 o 2 value of 3 35 105 m 1 s 1 which is three orders lower than k ffa 1 o 2 meanwhile the d2o experiment was used for further verification which specifically extends the half life of 1o2 and the results showed that the k obs was only increased by 4 8 fig 4a in conclusion 1o2 shows minor contribution to apap degradation according to the inhibition experiment results the contribution of each mechanism to the initial reaction rate was evaluated photogenerated h 71 5 as major while o2 ho2 1o2 and adsorption 20 4 4 8 and 3 3 respectively played a minor role detailed calculation in text s11 the primary ros in the go light system were identified by esr spectroscopy fig s24 the relevant signals of oh and o2 were not detected using dmpo as the spin trap agent moreover the steady state concentrations of oh o2 ho2 and h2o2 were measured during go light process by using benzene trapping xtt sodium salt and dpd pod spectroscopy respectively the absence of phenol production and no increase in absorbance proved that oh and h2o2 were not generated in go light system respectively however the contribution of o2 ho2 was considered in the analysis of quenching experiment but no increase in absorbance at 470 nm was observed the same phenomenon has occurred in previous study that the competition between go k go o 2 0 108 mg c 1 l s 1 and xtt sodium salt for o2 ho2 could inhibit the generation of xtt formazan which indicate the formation of chemical bonding or one electron reduction of go hsieh and zepp 2019 the reaction between o2 ho2 and go also affect the esr detection the weak tempo signal spectrum was detected under n2 atmosphere that is not associated with 1o2 production but possible direct electron transfer mechanism duan et al 2021 however a triple spectrum peak ratio 1 1 1 was detected in the natural atmosphere confirming the production of 1o2 in the go light system 3 4 2 photodegradation pathways and mechanism a positive ion mode lc hrms was used to detect apap degradation intermediates in the go light system to investigate apap degradation pathways samples of 0 10 and 60 min were selected for analysis and apap m z 152 was rapidly degraded within 10 min fig s25 accompanied by increasing concentrations of degradation intermediates as shown in figs s26 and s27 salicylaldehyde m z 122 and acetamide m z 60 were identified as intermediates of apap photodegradation induced by go meanwhile the intermediates were also analyzed by gc ms techniques and the samples were treated with bstfa tmcs and converted into the more volatile trimethylsilyl derivatives the results showed that the characteristic gc ms spectra of mono and di trimethylsilyl derivatives of apap m z 223 and 295 and photodegradation intermediates phenol and hydroquinon were identified figs s28 and 29 the apap photodegradation pathway is an electron transfer process essentially scheme s1 according to frontier molecular orbital theory the first reaction site is predicted based on the 2fed2 homo value fukui et al 1952 for apap c4 and c9 had the higher 2fed2 homo value which should be the first sites for electron donation zhang et al 2008 then the formed cationic radical ion experienced the attack of o2 ho2 the attachment of h2o molecules and hydrolysis to generate acetamide and hydroquinone path i moreover acetamide could molecularly rearrange with phenol to form salicylaldehyde fan et al 2018 path ii eventually apap was mineralized into co2 and h2o as no other small molecule acids were observed which is because non radicals could rapidly transform functional groups but their energy was insufficient to break the benzene ring for mineralization in a short time while the decomposition should combine with radicals duan et al 2018 liao et al 2022 in addition no related go products were found after irradiation in the go blank experiment while the dissolved lmw species in go suspensions were detected after irradiated 1 kw 280 1100 nm 72 h zhao et al 2020 therefore it s attributed to the weak light intensity and short irradiation time the photocatalytic mechanism for the go light system based on the above results and discussions was proposed as a semiconductor like material go could generate photogenerated e h pairs when exposed to sunlight which allowed it to be disproportionated to reduce partially and produce hydroxylated or carboxylated pah compounds eq 1 hou et al 2015 in addition go could be generated by photoexcitation of go while 1o2 was formed through the energy transfer between go and ground state molecular oxygen eq 2 chong et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 the abundant ofgs rapidly captured the photogenerated e on the go surface and produce o2 ho2 du et al 2018 eqs 3 5 which could improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated e h pairs and enhanced the h dominated direct oxidation on apap reaction eq 6 qutob et al 2022 furthermore o2 ho2 could produce 1o2 through disproportionation reaction eq 7 and h oxidation eq 8 respectively nosaka and nosaka 2017 however 1o2 and o2 ho2 play minor roles in photooxidation of apap in the presence of go 1 go h v go h e rgo pahs 2 go o 2 go 1 o 2 3 e go g o 4 g o o 2 go o 2 5 o 2 h ho 2 6 h apap products 7 o 2 ho 2 h 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 8 o 2 h 1 o 2 3 5 effect of matrixes and applications to real water as shown in figs 5 a and s30 we tested the effect of four common anions cl no3 hco3 and so4 2 two metal ions ca2 and fe3 and a natural organic matter fulvic acid fa on apap degradation in the go light system the matrixes could competitively adsorb to surface active sites scavenge reactive species or react with catalysts directly which has a negative impact on the removal of pollutants chong et al 2010 20 mm cl no3 and hco3 inhibited the initial rate of the reaction decreased by 36 5 45 5 and 42 8 respectively but the effect on apap degradation was negligible figs 5a and s30a c in addition 20 mm so4 2 0 4161 min 1 have no obvious influence on the apap photodegradation figs 5a and s30d cl could react with photogenerated h to form cl and cl2 eqs 9 and 10 and they were strongly oxidizing properties e she 0 cl cl 2 41 v e she 0 cl2 2cl 2 09 v and could oxidize various pollutants which probably accounts for the negligible effect of cl on apap degradation sayed et al 2016 sirtori et al 2009 ziegmann et al 2006 similarly no3 could also scavenge h to generate no3 eq 11 saleh et al 2019 besides competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface hco3 could also trap h to generate hco3 eq 12 shi et al 2015 furthermore o2 could also react with anions to produce less reactive species eq 13 and the reaction kinetics between 1o2 and anions was retarded duan et al 2020 gao et al 2020 the effect of metal ions ca2 and fe3 was also investigated figs 5a and s30e f and the k obs were reduced by 83 and 90 with 20 mm ca2 0 0769 min 1 and fe3 0 0435 min 1 respectively the abundant ofgs and negative surface charges on go surface were involved in metal ions adsorption onto go via electron attraction and surface complexation wang et al 2022 which would produce competitive adsorption for reactive sites on go surface the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups available on go surfaces could be combined with ca2 thereby inducing go aggregation and destabilization chowdhury et al 2013 the interaction between go and apap was hindered by the soluble hydroxyl complex formed from fe3 at ph 7 in addition the color of the reaction solution changed to reddish brown in the presence of fe3 thus the light utilization by the system was weakened as for the expriment using fa the apap degradation was significantly inhibitied figs 5a and s30g when the initial concentration of fa was 20 mg l 1 k obs decreased from 0 4547 to 0 0689 min 1 probably due to the inhibition caused by the competitive adsorption and oxidation between fa and apap on the go surface where the photodegradation of fa also consumed photogenerated h and radicals duan et al 2021 9 h c l cl 10 cl c l cl 2 11 h no 3 no 3 12 h hco 3 hco 3 13 o 2 anions less reactive species considering the negative effects of matrix components in the go light system it is necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the go light system in apap degradation in real water specific water quality parameters are listed in table s1 similar to the results in pure water more than 90 apap degradation was achieved in two real water samples fig 5b which revealed that the go light system still has good catalytic performance in real water however the reaction rate was significantly lower compared to that in ultrapure water k obs el 0 0045 min 1 k obs xl 0 0049 min 1 during the reaction probably because the inhibitory effect of complex aqueous matrix components e g anions metal ions fa protein and microbial polymers in the actual water body according to the result the go light system could efficiently photodegrade apap despite the coexistence of complex components 3 6 photodegradation of different ppcps seven typical ppcps were selected to investigate the degradation effects of this system on other organic pollutants fig 6 a except for ampicillin the degradation efficiency of ppcps was significantly improved under the light condition compared to the dark reaction which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the go light system however the photodegradation efficiency of different types of ppcps varies significantly the correlation between the degradation rate and the structure of ppcps is given in the subsequent construction of the qsar model according to the mechanistic study the main active species of the go light system is photogenerated h the reaction rate constants of each ppcps with 1o2 are listed in table s5 and there was no significant linear relationship with lgk obs fig s31 indicating that the contribution of 1o2 in the go light system was negligible to verify the relationship between molecular structure and reactivity molar refractive index parameter mr octanol water partition coefficient lgk ow dissociation constant pka and dipole moment µ were selected as descriptor variables for performing multiple linear regression mlr with the proposed first order reaction rate constants lgk obs to construct qsar model mr and lgk ow were calculated by chembiodraw 18 1 software pka and µ were calculated by chemaxon software and the values of each descriptor were listed in table s6 finally mlr was conducted using spss 22 0 software to build the qsar model the qsar model based on the above method is as follows 14 lg k obs 2 625 0 903 0 360 0 127 lg k ow 0 129 0 038 p k a 0 041 0 009 mr 0 086 0 037 μ n 7 r 2 0 996 f 121 202 p 0 008 values in parentheses are 95 confidence intervals high r2 values r2 0 996 and low p values p 0 05 were obtained by fitting the equation the relationship between the experimental and model calculated values for the seven ppcps lgk obs is shown in fig 6b the fitted linear over the origin tended to be the best prediction y x with an r2 value of 0 999 and a p value far below 0 05 which indicated that the proposed qsar model has a superior fitting ability the corresponding parameters of the t tests for the four molecular descriptors are listed in table s7 it was evident from the statistical parameters that the variance inflation factors vif of all these descriptors were less than 10 indicating there is no multicollinearity among these descriptors norusis 1997 about these descriptors mr is a comprehensive parameter that reflects the electronic and steric structure characteristics of the molecules as the variable with the highest t test value t 20 278 it was the most statistically significant predictor variable with a negative coefficient the commonly used physicochemical property descriptor pka t 14 805 is the second statistically significant parameter ph affects the degradation kinetic rate by influencing the interactions between the catalyst and the ppcps e g electrostatic attraction repulsion and the intensity of these reactions can be quantified based on the pka value of the target organic pollutants liu et al 2020 when the ph of the solution is higher than the pka value of the target organic pollutants the organics exist mainly in deprotonated form and organics with lower pka value tend to have higher reactivity in the go light system lgk ow is a hydrophobic parameter with a higher value corresponding to the stronger hydrophobicity of the molecule there is a positive correlation between lgk ow and lgk obs in this qsar model µ is a vector quantity encoded in the displacement of positive and negative charges relative to the center of gravity in a molecule zhu et al 2018 in the model low µ values correspond to high reactivity compounds with high µ values are more electronegative and are more likely to accept electrons from the oxidant cheng et al 2018 therefore high values are not favorable for the reaction between organics and h in conclusion the reactivity of ppcps in the go light system is mainly determined by the combination of electrostatic steric and hydrophobic effects of the molecules by comparing the multiplications of each ppcps descriptor value with the corresponding coefficients fig 6c the values of k1 mr and k4 µ for apap were larger combining the negative correlation of these two parameters with lgk obs it is concluded that the rapid degradation of apap in the go light system can be attributed to its weaker steric effect and electronegativity 4 conclusions a highly efficient method of simulate sunlight activated go to degrade various ppcps was proposed while the photochemical behavior of go and its structure activity relationship with ppcps were also systematically studied in this work a complete degradation of apap 5 μm within 60 min can be achieved by 100 mg l 1 go at neutral ph further studies using radical scavengers and electro spin resonance assays demonstrated that h 1o2 and o2 ho2 are responsible for apap degradation based on the intermediates identified by the lc hrms and gc ms technique and the possible degradation pathway which is essentially electron transfer is proposed so4 2 had no significant influence and different degrees of inhibition occurred in the presence of other water matrix components in practical applications the go light system also exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance in surface real waters and different ppcps degradation the qsar model reveals that the rapid degradation of apap in go light system is primarily due to its small mr and µ values the establishment of the qsar model provided new insights into the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds

15286,in recent years graphene oxide go as a new carbon material has been widely investigated as adsorbent and catalyst however effects of go on the micro pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps under sunlight remains unclear in this study the degradation of ppcps in a simulated sunlight go photocatalytic system was systematically investigated specifically go rapidly degrade 95 of acetaminophen apap within 10 min under simulated sunlight irradiation λ 350 nm the influencing factors such as apap concentration ph go dosage water matrixes cl no3 hco3 so4 2 ca2 fe3 and fulvic acid were investigated at a go dosage of 100 mg l 1 and an initial ph of 7 the apap 5 μm photodegradation kinetic constant k obs was calculated to be 0 4547 min 1 in practical applications the go photocatalysis system still degrade over 90 apap within 60 min in real surface water the electron spin resonance and radical scavenging experiments revealed that the dominated active species for degrading apap was photogenerated holes h while other mechanisms 1o2 and o2 ho2 played a minor role furthermore the photochemical transformation of some other typical ppcps were comparatively studied to reveal the relationship between degradation kinetics and molecular structure based on descriptive variables including molar refractive index parameter octanol water partition coefficient dissociation constant and dipole moment a quantitative structural activity relationship qsar model for predicting pseudo first order rate constants was established with a high significance r2 0 996 p 0 05 this study helps to understand the interaction between go and ppcps and its effects on the photochemical transformation of ppcps in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords graphene oxide simulated sunlight photooxidation of ppcps photochemical transformation qsar data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction graphene oxide go consists of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice with oxygen containing functional groups ofgs are situated in the base defects hydroxyl and epoxy groups and edges carboxyl groups han et al 2021 pedrosa et al 2020 the hydrophobic sp2 domains and hydrophilic sp3 oxygen containing functional domains of go make it semiconducting like properties resulting in a significant band gap which can be controlled by adjusting the content and composition of ofgs jiang et al 2013 putri et al 2016 in view of its unique physicochemical and photoelectronic properties go has been studied in micro supercapacitors kumar et al 2019 precision device assembly chu et al 2014 microcapsules modified for solar energy storage liu et al 2018 novel drug carrier design pooresmaeil and namazi 2018 and other fields moreover the π conjugated structure of go makes it photosensitive matsumoto et al 2011 while its strong hydrophilicity derives from the abundance of polar ofgs on the surface bansal et al 2017 these signified that go may able to exhibit photochemical reactivity in an aqueous environment several studies have indicated that go can be induced transformed by light with its environmental behavior and toxicity changes chowdhury et al 2015 hou et al 2015 2017 kuang et al 2020 proposed the different photochemical environmental behaviors of go were obtained under various light sources gao et al 2019 proved that uv irradiation was more effective than visible light irradiation in modifying the physicochemical properties and increasing the toxicity of go therefore more researches have aimed at developing visible light based catalytic methods in recent years which would reduce energy consumption and eliminate the reliance on fragile uv lamps containing hazardous mercury cheng et al 2020 go has been extensively used as wastewater treatment membrane materials and catalysts with its excellent physicochemical properties e g abundant adsorption sites biocompatibility cao et al 2021 the aquatic toxicity of go could be weakened after co irradiation with other ions e g cu2 and go was stable in the natural water environment thus the significant aqueous transport of go was possible chowdhury et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 over the last decade two dimensional graphene has brought new impetus to environmental photocatalysis while go was mainly used as metallic and non metallic support flexible substrate or co catalyst to improve photocatalytic efficiency zhang et al 2020 cruz et al 2017 prepared go tio2 composites which could oxidize the mixture solution of four pesticides diquat alachlor isoproturon and atrazine with 300 min uv vis irradiation tong et al 2015 proposed a three dimensional porous g c3n4 graphene oxide aerogel to degrade 92 of methyl orange 20 mg ml 1 under visible light within 4 h herein go could contribute to the nanoparticle dispersion and separation efficiency of photogenerated e h through its electron acceptor properties however most of these studies ignored that go can be used as sole photocatalyst and transformed during irradiation several studies have reported that the light exposure of go can change its physicochemical properties resulting in a significant degree of fragmentation and the production of lmw species mainly hydroxylated and or carboxylated pah compounds chowdhury et al 2015 shams et al 2019 meanwhile some researchers have applied only go for light mediated energy conversion kuang et al 2020 used go with simulated sunlight and uv irradiation to achieve the photocatalytic reduction of co2 and eliminate the formation of the by product co yeh et al 2011 constructed a methodology that go with different oxygen levels can be excited to split water under visible light irradiation as per above studies the photoactivation reaction of go has been demonstrated to be feasible and the phototransformation of go has been confirmed but go was not applied to photodegrade the organic pollutants therefore this study investigated the environmental behavior of go during organic pollutants degradation and opened up new possibilities for using go as a photocatalyst in environmental remediation pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps represent important emerging contaminants of global concern bu et al 2013 currently ppcps cannot be effectively removed by traditional wastewater treatment plants due to their toxic and recalcitrant properties wang and wang 2016 furthermore they are considered as pseudo persistent because of their continuous discharge from wastewater treatment plants agricultural runoff aquaculture and ppcps manufacturing sites liu et al 2020 therefore finding a cost effective method for removing ppcps from aqueous environment is necessary while the above mentioned economical go can be employed due to its photosensitive potential in principle go undergoes a series of phototransformation when exposed to sunlight in surface water but the interaction between go during the phototransformation process and ppcps in aqueous environments has not been thoroughly explored this study systematically investigated the differences in apap degradation under different conditions and the structure activity relationship in the simulated sunlight activated go system the physicochemical properties of go were characterized to verify the microscopic morphology material crystal property elemental chemical state and electrochemical property the oxidative degradation mechanism was explored by the electron spin resonance and radical scavenging experiments additionally six other ppcps such as sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol degradation experiments were conducted by same go light system and their pseudo first order rate constants were also calculated finally the qsar model was developed to reveal the selectivity of different ppcps and their structure activity relationship in the go light system which provided a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the go light system and environmental pollutants 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals the detailed information of chemical reagents such as target ppcps radical quenching agents and reagents controlling different reaction conditions are provided in text s1 real water samples were collected from east lake el wuhan china and xing lake xl wuhan china and filtered by 0 22 μm micropore polyethersulfone pes membrane before use the water quality parameters of these samples are listed in table s1 all the reagents were ar grade and were used as received without further purification ultrapure water with an 18 25 mω cm resistivity from a youpu water purification system chengdu china was used throughout this work 2 2 preparation and characterizations of go the go used in the catalytic experiments was synthesized with graphite as the precursor by the modified hummers method saleem et al 2018 and the detailed procedure is supplied in text s2 the characterization methods of go such as physical phase morphology crystal property elemental chemical state and photoelectrochemistry property are presented in text s3 2 3 photodegradation procedures the degradation experiments were carried out in the photocatalytic device as shown in fig s1 specifically a 500 ml glass jacketed beaker connected to a constant temperature water circulation 25 2 c was used as the reaction vessel the simulated sunlight source was composed of two xenon lamps 35 w λ 350 nm irradiating vertically through the reactor the irradiance spectrum was shown in fig s2 which shows that the substantial irradiation range is mainly in the 400 700 nm and the uv intensity is relatively weak for a typical go photocatalytic process 40 mg go catalyst was added in 400 ml apap 5 μm and the ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 0 after igniting the xenon lamps on both sides 1 ml sample was collected through a 0 45 μm pes filter at a specific time interval for subsequent analysis a ph meter sin ph6 3 sinomeasure china and a dissolved oxygen do meter sin dy3000 sinomeasure china were used to online monitor the ph and do variations during the reaction 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of apap was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc ultimate 3000 thermo scientific usa the hplc analytical methods for apap and other ppcps are given in text s4 and table s2 reactive oxygen species were captured on an electron spin resonance esr spectrometer jes fa200 jeol japan using dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agents the test conditions for oh 1o2 and o2 are given in text s5 in the quenching experiment a certain amount of tba sod ffa edta 2na or a nitrogen environment was introduced to scavenge oh o2 1o2 h and oxygen respectively in addition the steady state concentration of oh o2 ho2 and h2o2 were investigated the benzene capture method was used to determine the oh the concentration of o2 ho2 was determined in a spectrophotometer using xtt sodium salt as a probe dpd pod spectrophotometry was used to quantify the h2o2 concentration photodegradation intermediates of apap were detected using a liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometer lc hrms tripleqtof5600 absciex usa and gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 450 gc 320 ms varian usa the detailed information for the lc hrms and gc ms analysis are given in text s6 and text s7 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization in the xrd patterns fig 1 a graphite exhibits a strong and sharp diffraction peak at 2θ 25 2 corresponding to a d spacing of 0 35 nm which is attributed to the 0 0 2 crystal plane fathy et al 2016 the diffraction peak of go at 25 2 is significantly weaker than that of graphite and a new diffraction peak appears at 9 5 with an increased layer spacing of 0 92 nm this observation indicated that the water molecule and ofgs such as carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy groups were inserted within layers of graphite during the oxidation process thus destroying the sp2 π conjugated structure supplementary analysis on go layer spacing is given in fig s3 as shown in the sem image fig 1a inset the oxidation treatment resulted in the thin and multilayer overlapping go sheets in addition go sheets were found to curl in the physical state and the folded structure was apparent the tem image fig 1a inset shows a thin and convoluted layer structure of go on the micrometer scale while larger size stacked structure of the precursor graphite was observed in the sem and tem images fig s4 compared to graphite the characteristic peaks in ftir spectra fig 1b of water adsorbed on the go surface were significantly strengthened and various ofgs were introduced meanwhile the presence of ofgs in go can also be confirmed with the significant enhancement of c o and c o characteristic peaks in the xps pattern fig 1c and table s3 as given in the raman spectra fig 1d the strong and sharp g bands and insignificant d bands were found in the graphite sample as a feature of highly graphitized materials with fewer defects as a result of the significant rise in id ig values from 0 06 to 0 97 after oxidation it could be concluded that the insertion of oxygen atoms induced disorder in the lattice structure of graphene the bet bjh parameters of go table s4 showed a slight increase in the specific surface area after oxidation and the surface zeta potential of go was highly negative in the ph 2 10 range fig s9 the specific characterization analysis of ftir xps raman n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and zeta potential are proposed in figs s5 9 the band gap of go was evaluated by the tauc plot fig s10b that was derived from the uv vis drs spectra fig s10a and the band gap was calculated to be approximately 2 3 3 7 ev additionally the results of eis transient photocurrent mott schottky and associated schematic energy level diagrams figs s11 and 12 revealed semiconductor like properties of go based on the above results and supplementary analysis in figs s3 12 it was confirmed that the go material with abundant ofgs and unique photoelectronic properties was synthesized 3 2 photodegradation of apap the degradation efficiency of apap under different conditions are shown in fig 2 a apap was not degraded under only light conditions the natural graphite as the precursor of go has no adsorption and photodegradation effect on apap because of the zero band gap characteristic of graphite thus photogenerated e h can be easily recombined in addition the adsorption and photolytic effects on apap were negligible because of the low specific surface area of go for comparison the simulated light could effectively activate go to degrade 95 apap 5 μm under neutral conditions within 10 min while the adsorption level was only 16 9 within 60 min under dark reaction conditions indicating that the go light system performed superior photocatalytic performance on the other hand tio2 as the traditional photocatalyst could be excited by sunlight malato et al 2009 which was used to compare with go under the same conditions there was almost no adsorption of apap using tio2 which was able to degrade 90 5 apap within 60 min under same experimental conditions in terms of reaction rate constants go k obs 0 4547 min 1 degraded apap is about 6 9 times more efficiently than tio2 k obs 0 0661 min 1 which was due to the ofgs on the go surface forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules therefore the solventization of the go sheets in an aqueous solution spontaneously peeled off to form stable dispersions bansal et al 2017 thus facilitating the interaction between go and pollutants and improving the utilization of light furthermore according to the xrd sem tem ftir xps raman results and analysis of go before and after photoreaction figs s3 7 it can be inferred that a slow reduction trend of go happened during the irradiation and the incomplete removal of abundant ofgs can maintain the relatively stable state of go the real time monitoring of ph and do in the go light system during the reaction are shown in fig s13 the ph of the solution decreased to an acidic level following the reaction while the do content did not change significantly in 60 min in addition there was an insignificant effect of irradiation energy intensity on the final degradation efficiency of apap but it had a positive effect on the initial degradation rate fig s14 which indicated that increasing the light irradiation energy in the appropriate range facilitated the activation of go fig 2b shows the changes in toc during the different reactions during go light processes toc showed an increasing trend in the later period so the toc changes of go suspension under light conditions were studied individually the difference between the two groups of experimental data showed that the removal rate of toc could reach 60 within 240 min in addition light would cause unstable go sheets to decompose to small organic molecules thus the toc of filtered go aqueous solution showed an upward trend as presented in fig 2c the uv absorption of the dispersion was proportional to the number of go sheets dispersed in water bansal et al 2017 a significant increase in the characteristic peak absorbance of go suspension was observed during exposure to light suggesting that light irradiation changed the chemical structure of go and produced absorbing substances which corresponding to the decrease in oxygen content and the partial recovery of the sp2 π conjugated network of go eda et al 2010 gengler et al 2013 however the uv vis comparison results of go filtrate did not show the characteristic peak of go and the increase in absorbance during the irradiation process was not remarkable fig s15a in addition the uv vis spectrum of apap solution did not change with the irradiation time increased fig s15b which is consistent with the hplc results fig 2d shows the photoluminescence pl intensities of go filtrate as a function of excitation and emission wavelength with an inhomogeneous pl band at 350 450 nm the fluorescence of go is composed of an excited state protonation of the cooh group and an excitation wavelength dependent fluorescence from the polar groups such as the oh moiety in go cushing et al 2014 and the enhancement of pl peak fluorescence at 400 nm was observed after irradiation which was in agreement with the increased absorbance results which was attributed to the increase in the proportion of local sp2 sites during the reduction process eda et al 2010 hou et al 2015 additionally photoluminescence spectra was used to analyze the changes in apap during the reaction fig 2e with the irradiation a significant fluorescence enhancement at 430 nm was observed and the pl peak showed red shifted and enhanced intensity compared with the go suspension which may contribute to the ofgs of go changed during the interaction with apap in conclusion the photochemical behavior of both go and apap could change under coexistence conditions 3 3 influence factors in go light process 3 3 1 effect of initial apap concentration under dark conditions there was no obvious adsorption effect of go on apap however 1 50 μm apap could be effectively degraded in the go light system fig s16 furthermore in the low concentration range of 1 10 μm apap in each experimental process could be completely degraded in go light system within 60 min based on text s9 and fig 3 a the fitting parameters of kr β and klh of langmuir hinshelwood model were 4 9595 μm min 1 0 0388 l μmol 1 and 0 1924 min 1 respectively the high correlation coefficient r2 0 9894 implied that the photocatalytic degradation of apap in the go light system followed the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model meanwhile the kinetics of apap degradation in low concentrations 1 10 μm followed the pseudo first order equation while the inflection point appeared in the linear equation in high concentrations 10 50 μm which was due to the limited reactive active sites fig s17 therefore the concentration of apap was set as 5 μm in the following research and the pseudo first order rate constant k obs text s10 is used for the subsequent discussion 3 3 2 effect of ph the effect of ph on apap degradation is shown in fig 3b adsorption of apap by go was found to be relatively low 20 at different ph levels fig s18a and the adsorption capacity did not change significantly at ph 3 7 the molecular form of apap remains predominantly in neutral fig s19 showing the ph independent mechanism apap mainly exists as negative ions under alkaline conditions fig s19 and go has a negative surface charge fig s19 thus there should be adsorption inhibition occurring through stronger electrostatic repulsion weaker π π interactions and stronger water mediated steric hindrance at high ph values tang et al 2020 but there was no remarkable change in the adsorption capacity of apap on go at different solution ph values due to the presence of the various compensation mechanisms e g van der waals and h bond interaction chen and chen 2015 however the changes of go apap interaction were exhibited in photolysis with k obs decreased by 19 0 ph 9 and 33 3 ph 10 fig 3b while the system could still maintain 100 degradation within 60 min fig s18c the fastest photolysis k obs was obtained at ph 3 which was 29 1 higher than that of ph 7 fig 3b indicating the degradation of apap was favorable under acidic conditions in the go light system due to the deprotonation of ofgs on the go surface h was released into the solution during the adsorption process zhang et al 2021 then the ph showed a downward trend under dark conditions and an obvious trend could be observed with the increase in initial ph value fig s18b by observing the real time monitoring changes of ph fig s18b and d the rate of ph decrease under light conditions was faster than in dark conditions combined with the ph changes of go alone in fig s18b and d it is evident that the rapid decrease in ph under light is mainly attributed to go which may result in the photoactivation of go leading to deoxygenation to produce small molecules of acid as well as rgo ji et al 2013 while promoting the photodegradation of apap 3 3 3 effect of go dosage the effects of go dosage 10 30 50 70 100 and 200 mg l 1 on apap degradation efficiency were evaluated at an initial apap concentration of 5 μm ph 7 fig s20 as go dosage increased under dark reaction conditions apap adsorption increased slightly but reached only 21 at a dosage of 200 mg l 1 suggesting that the adsorption effect of go itself was not significant the higher go dosage resulted in the faster reaction rate in the go light system fig 3c apap degradation k obs increased by 65 9 from 70 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 and the difference between 200 mg l 1 and 100 mg l 1 was 27 9 nevertheless the difference between 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 dosage was not evident in the photodegradation of apap fig s20b which indicated that the efficiency of light utilization had reached saturation thus 100 mg l 1 was selected as the optimal dosage 3 3 4 reusability the reusability performance of the material in practical applications was evaluated under optimal conditions with recycled go by ethanol and water washing fig s21 after three cycles although the initial reaction rate decreased from 0 4763 to 0 0665 min 1 go still maintained a high photocatalytic activity to degrade 92 9 apap within 30 min which indicated that the go light system has potential in practical production applications the images of the go aqueous solution were taken during the cycling experiments fig s21 inset it could be observed that the color of the go aqueous solutions changed from light brown to black with the increase of the irradiation time this is because the light irradiation may alter the ofgs on go surfaces and sp2 π conjugated structures which was consistent with our speculation in the characterization results that go reduction would happen during the irradiation process more detailed analysis of the color change of the reaction solution is available in fig s21 in conclusion the photochemical behavior of go is altered when it undergoes photoreduction with color change 3 3 5 effect of sunlight in the real sunlight experiment fig 3d the reaction volume expanded to 800 ml under optimal conditions and was supplemented with 5 μm apap five times during the first 3 h as comparison apap was not photodegraded without go under sunlight while the initial 1 h irradiation period with the presence of go resulted in the complete degradation of the apap furthermore within 6 h the degradation rate decreased with the increase of irradiation time and go continued to degrade apap as shown in fig 3d the intensity of sunlight increased and reached the peak at noon then decreased with time the intensity of light could also influence the apap degradation rate by go which is consistent with the results of irradiation energy effect experiment 3 4 mechanistic insights 3 4 1 formation and role of ros radical scavenging experiments were employed to further reveal the mechanism of go activation by simulated sunlight fig 4 a ffa serves as a trapping agent for 1o2 k ffa 1 o 2 1 4 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 gottfried and kimel 1991 edta 2na was used to scavenge photogenerated h yuan et al 2022 tba serves as oh scavenger k tba oh 7 6 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 gordon et al 1977 and sod was used as a scavenger agent for o2 k sod o 2 1 6 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 bertini et al 1989 in fig s22a the addition of tba and sod inhibited the initial reaction rate of go photocatalytic apap degradation 42 8 and 36 9 respectively but did not deactivate the system the results indicated that both oh and o2 could be the active species in the go light system yeh et al 2011 demonstrated that go had similar conduction band cb edge levels thus the oxidation capacity of go was primarily determined by its valence band vb potential as shown in fig s12b go had an e vb value of 1 03 v which was lower than the redox potential of oh oh 2 38 v vs nhe liu et al 2018 indicating that go was not capable of oxidizing oh to produce oh via h the redox potential of o2 o2 was 0 33 v vs nhe wang et al 2015 and the e cb value of go was 1 27 v thus do could generate o2 ho2 by the single electron reduction k o 2 e 1 6 1010 m 1 s 1 zepp et al 1987 nevertheless zhang et al 2017 proved the direct oxidation effect of o2 for apap could be neglected by the xanthine xanthine oxide o2 generator reaction so o2 should be assumed to mainly react with the intermediate products of apap moreover e could also be strongly trapped by the ofgs on go surface hou et al 2015 as the do was not significantly consumed in the water fig s13 the role of do in the reaction was further investigated the experiments conducted under n2 atmosphere resulted in the decrease of k obs by 28 5 fig s22a which had no effect on the final degradation rate indicating that the do content only affected the initial reaction rate while the degradation of apap in the go light system was inhibited by 5 mm ffa and 100 mm edta 2na effectively fig s22b and the k obs was reduced by 94 0 and 94 6 respectively fig 4a the result indicated that 1o2 and photogenerated h played a major role in apap degradation as shown in fig s22b the addition of 5 mm ffa under n2 atmosphere also resulted in a 93 0 decrease of k obs there was a similar inhibition effect with either ffa with without n2 or edta 2na and whether 1o2 was responsible for this inhibition is still controversial ffa may not inhibit apap degradation by 1o2 quenching but by adsorption inhibition or competitive oxidation via electron transfer on the catalyst surface duan et al 2021 ffa can also capture oh k ffa oh 1 5 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 but it is impossible for this system to generate oh according to the energy level of go the addition of temp also inhibited apap degradation with an 84 1 decrease in k obs fig 4a however temp can not only scavenge 1o2 but also act as an electron donor that could be deprotonated to generate temp and then react with o2 to show tempo signal in esr spectrum that is not associated with 1o2 production nardi et al 2014 meanwhile the addition of ffa temp and edta 2na reduce of apap adsorption efficiency from 16 94 to 3 90 4 79 and 8 39 respectively indicating that the trapping agent inhibited the apap adsorption on go fig s23 a controlled study was conducted using ffa as the model substrate to identify the production of 1o2 further fig 4b it was found that ffa was not consumed under dark conditions the go light system can degrade 20 and 10 μm ffa under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively which indicated 1o2 and h participated in the degradation of ffa thus ffa could inhibit apap degradation even under n2 atmosphere li et al 2017 used rose bengal as photosensitizer and furfuraldehyde as reference compound at ph 7 to obtain the k apap 1 o 2 value of 3 35 105 m 1 s 1 which is three orders lower than k ffa 1 o 2 meanwhile the d2o experiment was used for further verification which specifically extends the half life of 1o2 and the results showed that the k obs was only increased by 4 8 fig 4a in conclusion 1o2 shows minor contribution to apap degradation according to the inhibition experiment results the contribution of each mechanism to the initial reaction rate was evaluated photogenerated h 71 5 as major while o2 ho2 1o2 and adsorption 20 4 4 8 and 3 3 respectively played a minor role detailed calculation in text s11 the primary ros in the go light system were identified by esr spectroscopy fig s24 the relevant signals of oh and o2 were not detected using dmpo as the spin trap agent moreover the steady state concentrations of oh o2 ho2 and h2o2 were measured during go light process by using benzene trapping xtt sodium salt and dpd pod spectroscopy respectively the absence of phenol production and no increase in absorbance proved that oh and h2o2 were not generated in go light system respectively however the contribution of o2 ho2 was considered in the analysis of quenching experiment but no increase in absorbance at 470 nm was observed the same phenomenon has occurred in previous study that the competition between go k go o 2 0 108 mg c 1 l s 1 and xtt sodium salt for o2 ho2 could inhibit the generation of xtt formazan which indicate the formation of chemical bonding or one electron reduction of go hsieh and zepp 2019 the reaction between o2 ho2 and go also affect the esr detection the weak tempo signal spectrum was detected under n2 atmosphere that is not associated with 1o2 production but possible direct electron transfer mechanism duan et al 2021 however a triple spectrum peak ratio 1 1 1 was detected in the natural atmosphere confirming the production of 1o2 in the go light system 3 4 2 photodegradation pathways and mechanism a positive ion mode lc hrms was used to detect apap degradation intermediates in the go light system to investigate apap degradation pathways samples of 0 10 and 60 min were selected for analysis and apap m z 152 was rapidly degraded within 10 min fig s25 accompanied by increasing concentrations of degradation intermediates as shown in figs s26 and s27 salicylaldehyde m z 122 and acetamide m z 60 were identified as intermediates of apap photodegradation induced by go meanwhile the intermediates were also analyzed by gc ms techniques and the samples were treated with bstfa tmcs and converted into the more volatile trimethylsilyl derivatives the results showed that the characteristic gc ms spectra of mono and di trimethylsilyl derivatives of apap m z 223 and 295 and photodegradation intermediates phenol and hydroquinon were identified figs s28 and 29 the apap photodegradation pathway is an electron transfer process essentially scheme s1 according to frontier molecular orbital theory the first reaction site is predicted based on the 2fed2 homo value fukui et al 1952 for apap c4 and c9 had the higher 2fed2 homo value which should be the first sites for electron donation zhang et al 2008 then the formed cationic radical ion experienced the attack of o2 ho2 the attachment of h2o molecules and hydrolysis to generate acetamide and hydroquinone path i moreover acetamide could molecularly rearrange with phenol to form salicylaldehyde fan et al 2018 path ii eventually apap was mineralized into co2 and h2o as no other small molecule acids were observed which is because non radicals could rapidly transform functional groups but their energy was insufficient to break the benzene ring for mineralization in a short time while the decomposition should combine with radicals duan et al 2018 liao et al 2022 in addition no related go products were found after irradiation in the go blank experiment while the dissolved lmw species in go suspensions were detected after irradiated 1 kw 280 1100 nm 72 h zhao et al 2020 therefore it s attributed to the weak light intensity and short irradiation time the photocatalytic mechanism for the go light system based on the above results and discussions was proposed as a semiconductor like material go could generate photogenerated e h pairs when exposed to sunlight which allowed it to be disproportionated to reduce partially and produce hydroxylated or carboxylated pah compounds eq 1 hou et al 2015 in addition go could be generated by photoexcitation of go while 1o2 was formed through the energy transfer between go and ground state molecular oxygen eq 2 chong et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 the abundant ofgs rapidly captured the photogenerated e on the go surface and produce o2 ho2 du et al 2018 eqs 3 5 which could improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated e h pairs and enhanced the h dominated direct oxidation on apap reaction eq 6 qutob et al 2022 furthermore o2 ho2 could produce 1o2 through disproportionation reaction eq 7 and h oxidation eq 8 respectively nosaka and nosaka 2017 however 1o2 and o2 ho2 play minor roles in photooxidation of apap in the presence of go 1 go h v go h e rgo pahs 2 go o 2 go 1 o 2 3 e go g o 4 g o o 2 go o 2 5 o 2 h ho 2 6 h apap products 7 o 2 ho 2 h 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 8 o 2 h 1 o 2 3 5 effect of matrixes and applications to real water as shown in figs 5 a and s30 we tested the effect of four common anions cl no3 hco3 and so4 2 two metal ions ca2 and fe3 and a natural organic matter fulvic acid fa on apap degradation in the go light system the matrixes could competitively adsorb to surface active sites scavenge reactive species or react with catalysts directly which has a negative impact on the removal of pollutants chong et al 2010 20 mm cl no3 and hco3 inhibited the initial rate of the reaction decreased by 36 5 45 5 and 42 8 respectively but the effect on apap degradation was negligible figs 5a and s30a c in addition 20 mm so4 2 0 4161 min 1 have no obvious influence on the apap photodegradation figs 5a and s30d cl could react with photogenerated h to form cl and cl2 eqs 9 and 10 and they were strongly oxidizing properties e she 0 cl cl 2 41 v e she 0 cl2 2cl 2 09 v and could oxidize various pollutants which probably accounts for the negligible effect of cl on apap degradation sayed et al 2016 sirtori et al 2009 ziegmann et al 2006 similarly no3 could also scavenge h to generate no3 eq 11 saleh et al 2019 besides competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface hco3 could also trap h to generate hco3 eq 12 shi et al 2015 furthermore o2 could also react with anions to produce less reactive species eq 13 and the reaction kinetics between 1o2 and anions was retarded duan et al 2020 gao et al 2020 the effect of metal ions ca2 and fe3 was also investigated figs 5a and s30e f and the k obs were reduced by 83 and 90 with 20 mm ca2 0 0769 min 1 and fe3 0 0435 min 1 respectively the abundant ofgs and negative surface charges on go surface were involved in metal ions adsorption onto go via electron attraction and surface complexation wang et al 2022 which would produce competitive adsorption for reactive sites on go surface the hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups available on go surfaces could be combined with ca2 thereby inducing go aggregation and destabilization chowdhury et al 2013 the interaction between go and apap was hindered by the soluble hydroxyl complex formed from fe3 at ph 7 in addition the color of the reaction solution changed to reddish brown in the presence of fe3 thus the light utilization by the system was weakened as for the expriment using fa the apap degradation was significantly inhibitied figs 5a and s30g when the initial concentration of fa was 20 mg l 1 k obs decreased from 0 4547 to 0 0689 min 1 probably due to the inhibition caused by the competitive adsorption and oxidation between fa and apap on the go surface where the photodegradation of fa also consumed photogenerated h and radicals duan et al 2021 9 h c l cl 10 cl c l cl 2 11 h no 3 no 3 12 h hco 3 hco 3 13 o 2 anions less reactive species considering the negative effects of matrix components in the go light system it is necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the go light system in apap degradation in real water specific water quality parameters are listed in table s1 similar to the results in pure water more than 90 apap degradation was achieved in two real water samples fig 5b which revealed that the go light system still has good catalytic performance in real water however the reaction rate was significantly lower compared to that in ultrapure water k obs el 0 0045 min 1 k obs xl 0 0049 min 1 during the reaction probably because the inhibitory effect of complex aqueous matrix components e g anions metal ions fa protein and microbial polymers in the actual water body according to the result the go light system could efficiently photodegrade apap despite the coexistence of complex components 3 6 photodegradation of different ppcps seven typical ppcps were selected to investigate the degradation effects of this system on other organic pollutants fig 6 a except for ampicillin the degradation efficiency of ppcps was significantly improved under the light condition compared to the dark reaction which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the go light system however the photodegradation efficiency of different types of ppcps varies significantly the correlation between the degradation rate and the structure of ppcps is given in the subsequent construction of the qsar model according to the mechanistic study the main active species of the go light system is photogenerated h the reaction rate constants of each ppcps with 1o2 are listed in table s5 and there was no significant linear relationship with lgk obs fig s31 indicating that the contribution of 1o2 in the go light system was negligible to verify the relationship between molecular structure and reactivity molar refractive index parameter mr octanol water partition coefficient lgk ow dissociation constant pka and dipole moment µ were selected as descriptor variables for performing multiple linear regression mlr with the proposed first order reaction rate constants lgk obs to construct qsar model mr and lgk ow were calculated by chembiodraw 18 1 software pka and µ were calculated by chemaxon software and the values of each descriptor were listed in table s6 finally mlr was conducted using spss 22 0 software to build the qsar model the qsar model based on the above method is as follows 14 lg k obs 2 625 0 903 0 360 0 127 lg k ow 0 129 0 038 p k a 0 041 0 009 mr 0 086 0 037 μ n 7 r 2 0 996 f 121 202 p 0 008 values in parentheses are 95 confidence intervals high r2 values r2 0 996 and low p values p 0 05 were obtained by fitting the equation the relationship between the experimental and model calculated values for the seven ppcps lgk obs is shown in fig 6b the fitted linear over the origin tended to be the best prediction y x with an r2 value of 0 999 and a p value far below 0 05 which indicated that the proposed qsar model has a superior fitting ability the corresponding parameters of the t tests for the four molecular descriptors are listed in table s7 it was evident from the statistical parameters that the variance inflation factors vif of all these descriptors were less than 10 indicating there is no multicollinearity among these descriptors norusis 1997 about these descriptors mr is a comprehensive parameter that reflects the electronic and steric structure characteristics of the molecules as the variable with the highest t test value t 20 278 it was the most statistically significant predictor variable with a negative coefficient the commonly used physicochemical property descriptor pka t 14 805 is the second statistically significant parameter ph affects the degradation kinetic rate by influencing the interactions between the catalyst and the ppcps e g electrostatic attraction repulsion and the intensity of these reactions can be quantified based on the pka value of the target organic pollutants liu et al 2020 when the ph of the solution is higher than the pka value of the target organic pollutants the organics exist mainly in deprotonated form and organics with lower pka value tend to have higher reactivity in the go light system lgk ow is a hydrophobic parameter with a higher value corresponding to the stronger hydrophobicity of the molecule there is a positive correlation between lgk ow and lgk obs in this qsar model µ is a vector quantity encoded in the displacement of positive and negative charges relative to the center of gravity in a molecule zhu et al 2018 in the model low µ values correspond to high reactivity compounds with high µ values are more electronegative and are more likely to accept electrons from the oxidant cheng et al 2018 therefore high values are not favorable for the reaction between organics and h in conclusion the reactivity of ppcps in the go light system is mainly determined by the combination of electrostatic steric and hydrophobic effects of the molecules by comparing the multiplications of each ppcps descriptor value with the corresponding coefficients fig 6c the values of k1 mr and k4 µ for apap were larger combining the negative correlation of these two parameters with lgk obs it is concluded that the rapid degradation of apap in the go light system can be attributed to its weaker steric effect and electronegativity 4 conclusions a highly efficient method of simulate sunlight activated go to degrade various ppcps was proposed while the photochemical behavior of go and its structure activity relationship with ppcps were also systematically studied in this work a complete degradation of apap 5 μm within 60 min can be achieved by 100 mg l 1 go at neutral ph further studies using radical scavengers and electro spin resonance assays demonstrated that h 1o2 and o2 ho2 are responsible for apap degradation based on the intermediates identified by the lc hrms and gc ms technique and the possible degradation pathway which is essentially electron transfer is proposed so4 2 had no significant influence and different degrees of inhibition occurred in the presence of other water matrix components in practical applications the go light system also exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance in surface real waters and different ppcps degradation the qsar model reveals that the rapid degradation of apap in go light system is primarily due to its small mr and µ values the establishment of the qsar model provided new insights into the photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds

15287,the understanding of microbial communities and the biological regulation of its members is crucial for implementation of novel technologies using microbial ecology one poorly understood metabolic principle of microbial communities is resource allocation and biosynthesis resource allocation theory in polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos is limited as a result of their slow imposed growth rate typical sludge retention times of at least 4 days and limitations to quantify changes in biomass components over a 6 hours cycle less than 10 of their growth as a result there is no direct evidence supporting that biosynthesis is an exclusive aerobic process in paos that alternate continuously between anaerobic and aerobic phases here we apply resource allocation metabolic flux analysis to study the optimal phenotype of paos over a temperature range of 4 c to 20 c the model applied in this research allowed to identify optimal metabolic strategies in a core metabolic model with limited constraints based on biological principles the addition of a constraint limiting biomass synthesis to be an exclusive aerobic process changed the metabolic behaviour and improved the predictability of the model over the studied temperature range by closing the gap between prediction and experimental findings the results validate the assumption of limited anaerobic biosynthesis in paos specifically candidatus accumulibacter related species interestingly the predicted growth yield was lower suggesting that there are mechanistic barriers for anaerobic growth not yet understood nor reflected in the current models of paos moreover we identified strategies of resource allocation applied by paos at different temperatures as a result of the decreased catalytic efficiencies of their biochemical reactions understanding resource allocation is paramount in the study of paos and their currently unknown complex metabolic regulation and metabolic modelling based on biological first principles provides a useful tool to develop a mechanistic understanding graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polyphosphate accumulating organisms biosynthesis resource

effect of putative pao competitors lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 fermentative paos varga et al 2018 storage levels effects santos et al 2020 etc nevertheless most current models rely on pre defined metabolic strategies and consequently reflect the already existing though not necessarily complete scientific knowledge on metabolic functions of this ecosystem although useful these features limit the mechanistic understanding of the biological principles governing microbial communities under dynamic conditions one of the pre defined microbial strategy commonly applied in the ebpr models is the assumption of growth being limited to the aerobic phase already very early pao studies suggested that biosynthesis occurs only in the aerobic phase of ebpr systems at expenses of pha degradation comeau et al 1986 smolders et al 1994 throughout the years this assumption has been adopted into metabolic models interestingly this assumption has not been verified in depth besides the observations on the consumption of certain nutrients e g nh4 linked to aerobic growth camejo et al 2019 many bacterial species that survive under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions grow anaerobically while fermenting substrate sawers 1999 ribes et al 2004 hence the validity of this assumption aerobic biosynthesis in paos is yet to be confirmed due to the slow growth of organisms in ebpr processes it has been difficult to estimate protein turnover rates and to precisely calculate protein synthesis in different phases of a cycle a typical ebpr lab scale setting consist of daily cycles of 6 h with an imposed srt of 8 days thus theoretically the biomass in the system should renew its proteome in the range of around 32 cycles meaning that in one cycle the newly produced proteins would account for only 3 of the proteome and the putative contribution of anaerobic biosynthesis would be even lower measuring such small differences in microbial communities is technically challenging considering the inhomogeneity of the culture as well as current limitations such as number of mass spectra acquisition per time kleiner 2019 biased extraction methods to soluble proteins sievers 2018 helbig et al 2010 amongst others proteomics studies on ebpr sludge from wilmes et al 2008 and wexler et al 2009 fell short on quantitatively identifying these changes exemplifying the complications of studying protein synthesis in slow growing systems such as paos data from transcriptomic studies however seem to indicate a major trend towards aerobic protein biosynthesis time series metatranscriptomic data from a highly enriched accumulibacter culture showed different clusters of expression throughout the ebpr cycle oyserman et al 2016 the largest number of transcripts from their study showed trends of transcription during the aerobic phase identified as aerobic pattern redox transition and low phosphate patterns although the link from transcription to protein synthesis is not always direct these results highly suggest that there is a regulation favouring protein synthesis to occur in the aerobic phase this hypothesis could be further explored experimentally with the use of isotopically labelled acetate fed to a paos enrichment such as the experiments done by hesselmann et al 2000 to identify the fate of 13c anaerobically and aerobically over one or multiple cycles however up to date such evidence is lacking with no final experimental evidence model based studies considering biosynthesis and resource allocation could be applied to develop an understanding of a putative synthesis of biomass components and furthermore quantify the putative benefit of anaerobic growth constraint based models such as flux balance analysis fba integrating principles from resource allocation represent an opportunity to test a hypothesis regarding biosynthesis during a cyclic dynamic system orth et al 2010 rügen et al 2015 conditional flux balance analysis cfba is a metabolic modelling tool that was originally developed to predict the metabolism of cyanobacteria under dynamic day night cycles with strong dependency on resource allocation rügen et al 2015 the characteristics of the cfba framework and the similarities of these cyclic conditions with those of ebpr make cfba a suitable method to apply in the context of studying paos recently the cfba method was applied to predict optimal strategies under dynamic environmental conditions encountered during ebpr guedes da silva et al 2019 depending on the environmental constraints different optimal strategies i e organisms accumulating polyphosphate paos glycogen gaos polyhydroxyalkanoates pha os and heterotrophs were predicted the optimizations resulted in metabolic strategies comparable to those typically observed for accumulibacter while the general behaviour was correctly predicted there were quantitative mismatches suggesting the need for further model development probably beyond parameter calibration because the model is strongly shaped by the relation between enzymatic activities and resource allocation there is potential for expansion in this front enzymatic activities are strongly influenced by temperature and consequently temperature plays a crucial role in shaping the metabolism of microorganisms russell 1990 implementation of temperature dependencies on metabolic models have shed light on basic biological principles such as a linear relationship between growth rate and ribosome content bosdriesz et al 2015 metzl raz et al 2017 and optimal proteome allocation as a function of temperature mairet et al 2021 however these principles result from models for organisms such as escherichia coli at steady state and may not apply to microbial communities under dynamic conditions on the other hand there are extensive experimental studies on the effect of temperature on paos metabolism brdjanovic et al 1997 1998a 1998b the current mechanistic understanding of paos metabolism with relation to temperatures could be combined with metabolic models such as cfba to identify metabolic principles governing growth and resource allocation especially at low temperatures the efficient use of available resources like enzyme capacity are assumed to be crucial for evolutionary competitiveness in the current study we combined the cfba modelling framework with temperature dependency for paos to identify metabolic principles regarding resource allocation we compared the complete model with and without a constraint on anaerobic biomass synthesis our results further validate the assumption on biomass being limited to the aerobic sector of ebpr and shed light on previously unexplored putative regulation on protein biosynthesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description for modelling the metabolism and energy allocation of paos a constrained based approach named conditional flux balance analysis cfba was used rügen et al 2015 the model and parameters for paos was obtained from guedes da silva et al 2019 the model consists of 29 metabolites connected by 36 reactions represented in a stoichiometric matrix s all network reactions and stoichiometry are detailed in table s1 different to conventional approaches only a subset of metabolites 7 metabolites are considered in steady state by the relation s v t 0 where s denotes the stoichiometric matrix subset of steady state metabolites and v t denotes the fluxes of each reaction at time interval t the remaining 22 metabolites are dynamic i e are allowed to accumulate or deplete over time polymers enzymes and biomass precursors and their molar amount is updated at each time point by the following relation m t s v t m t 1 m t is a vector that indicates the molar amount of the non steady state metabolites at time interval t and s denotes the stoichiometric matrix subset of the dynamic metabolites not in steady state 2 1 1 biomass growth and composition growth of the system at the end of the simulation is described as the overall fold change α of the initial metabolite composition m0 m e n d α m 0 this relation introduces the possibility to simulate a system in a cycle as the proportions of non steady state metabolites need to be maintained only at the end of the simulation the values of m0 are an outcome of the simulation in order to achieve maximal growth but limited to the total sum of 1 gram dry weight gdw by the relation w t m 0 1 where wt is a transposed vector containing the weights that different components have on 1 gdw of biomass the values in wt were defined by guedes da silva et al 2019 for glycogen polyphosphate and pha levels based on data published by acevedo et al 2012 data published by acevedo et al 2012 belong to a reactor performing 99 phosphate removal with a defined population of 85 paos and show clearly identified cycling of polyphosphate glycogen phb and phv protein content was based on the work of yücesoy et al 2012 2 1 2 quota definition of compounds the metabolites that are not in steady state consist of storage polymers glycogen polyphosphate phb and ph2mv catalytic metabolites enzymes and ribosomes and non catalytic metabolites named here as biomass precursors and other proteins because some of these metabolites do not reinforce the autocatalytic behaviour of the system their values in the vector m0 will tend to be 0 as this vector is an outcome of the simulation to optimize growth to enforce the synthesis of these compounds rügen et al 2015 introduced the concept of quota compounds following the relation b q u o t a t m t c q u o t a t w t m t in this relation b q u a t a t is a matrix containing the index positions in the m vector of the metabolites for which the quota is being defined at time point t c q u a t a t is a vector containing the values for the said quotas the indicated relation was used to define minimal quota levels at time 0 for glycogen polyphosphate and phas based on data published by acevedo et al 2012 it was also used to define an all time minimal level of biomass precursors and non catalytic proteins for this research the concept of quota compounds was slightly modified to include specific and maximum quota compounds at indicated time points b q u a t a e q t m t c q u a t a e q t w t m t b q u o t a max t m t c q u o t a max t w t m t these additional concepts were used to define a set initial amount of substrate acetate at time 0 hours and to enforce its uptake by setting a maximum quota of 0 at 0 5 h of the cycle 2 1 3 catalytic and non catalytic constraints on fluxes comparable to conventional fba each reaction can be limited according to pre assigned values in a lower lb and upper bound ub vector at each time point l b t v t u b t the lower and upper bounds were used to specify environmental limits on reactions e g during the anaerobic period oxygen consuming had an ub of 0 mmol gdw h otherwise the upper bounds were defined by the amount of a specific catalyst and the turnover rate of this catalyst kcat e values by v t m t e k c a t e where mt e denotes a subsection of mt containing the molar amount of enzymes at time t and kcat e a vector with the catalytic turnover number kcat e of each enzyme all reactions from the system except for co2 diffusion are catalysed by enzymes or ribosomes the kcat e values for each reaction were adapted from the work from rügen et al 2015 and if not considered in their research it was obtained from the brenda database schomburg et al 2012 the molar cost of all the enzymes was the assumed to be the same based on the work from rügen et al 2015 2 1 4 maintenance requirements metabolic models commonly consider the expenditure of energy atp for basic maintenance purposes here a constant flux of 0 3980 mmol atp gdw h was used based on literature values for paos smolders et al 1995 this value is assumed for the anaerobic as well as aerobic phase and is independent of the amount of available substrate 2 1 5 simulation of dynamic conditions simulations were performed considering a typical ebpr cycle an anaerobic phase of 1 5 h followed by an aerobic phase of 3 5 h the anaerobic conditions were simulated by setting the upper bound for the electron transport chain etc reaction to 0 mmol o2 gdw h conversely during the aerobic phase the upper bound of this reaction was only limited by the capacity of the respective enzyme constraint the substrate acetate was available at the beginning of the anaerobic phase t 0h by setting an initial metabolite quota for the starting amount to enforce rapid consumption a maximum quota of 0 mmol gdw h was set at 30 min 2 1 6 optimization target and algorithm used the previously defined constraints equalities and inequalities of the model are discretized in defined time intervals throughout the cycle linear programming was then used to identify possible flux distributions at each time interval without an optimization objective thus the obtained flux distribution for each time point is not an optimal unique solution but rather a possible solution that fulfils the equality and inequality constraints mentioned so far steady state metabolites initial metabolite composition quotas and enzyme capacities the possible solutions can be further constrained for any given α value fold change of the system the overall optimal target maximum possible α value was set following the approach introduced by rügen et al 2015 and used by reimers et al 2017 and guedes da silva et al 2019 briefly a search for α values that fulfil the linear constraints is performed using an algorithm of binary search until the highest achievable α value is found with a defined accuracy minimal step size of 10 7 due to the presence of internal cycles in the metabolic model the solution obtained is not unique to further limit the solution space we identified and limited internal cycles from the available solutions with no effect on the outcome of the simulation 2 1 7 temperature dependencies temperature was implemented as a parameter affecting the turnover rates kcat of individual reactions following the simplified arrhenius equation from 4 to 20 c this relation has been used previously to describe temperature effect on the kinetics of paos using a black box kinetic model brdjanovic et al 1998a lopez vazquez et al 2009 and is expressed as k c a t t k c a t 20 θ t 20 c where kcat t represents the kcat value at temperature t kcat 20 the kcat value at 20 c defined as optimal temperature for paos and theta θ the temperature coefficient for the specific reaction in question the values for θ are reaction specific and were adapted from the previously determined θ values found in lopez vazquez et al 2009 and summarized in table s2 the values for θ of reactions that have not been determined were set within the range of estimated θ values for comparable bioconversions the effect of the set θ values on the model prediction was evaluated with a general parameter sweep 2 1 8 simulation with and without biomass synthesis constrains to evaluate the effect that biomass growth during the entire cycle or only during the aerobic phase two simulations were performed these simulations are referred to as the unconstrained growth no constrains on biosynthesis and the aerobic growth biosynthesis can only occur during the aerobic period models the only difference between both models lays on the upper bounds allowed for the reactions involved in protein and ribosomes production including enzymes and synthesis of biomass precursors bmp synthesis see table s1 for information on the stoichiometry of these reactions in the unconstrained growth model these bounds were constrained like all other reactions set by the catalytic limitations whereas in the aerobic growth model these upper bounds were set to 0 mmol gdw h during the anaerobic phase 2 2 software and model availability all simulations were performed in matlab version 9 4 r2019b using linprog as the linear optimization solver the original cfba model was retrieved from rügen et al 2015 and the paos specific model retrieved from guedes da silva et al 2019 the adapted model used in this study is available at gitlab project id 39202430 https gitlab com delft paos cfba temperature 3 results 3 1 reference simulation ebpr cycle with unconstrained growth at 20 c we first investigated the predicted metabolic response of the model with unconstrained growth fig 1a in a typical ebpr system at 20 c and used it as the reference simulation for further comparisons a total cycle length of 5 h was applied 1 5 h anaerobic and 3 5 h aerobic acetate was enforced to be consumed within 30 min of the anaerobic period to simulate the competition for substrate and obtain the competitive strategy of organisms enriched under this regime guedes da silva et al 2019 the minimal initial amounts quota of storage polymers polyphosphate glycogen and pha per biomass mol gdw were introduced in the model based on data published by acevedo et al 2012 using these conditions the reference metabolic response of paos simulated was obtained and compared to the experimental profiles from acevedo et al 2012 fig 1b the simulation reproduced complete acetate consumption and accumulation as pha fig 1b while polyphosphate was degraded to provide the required atp for the uptake and activation of acetate and anaerobic maintenance reducing equivalents modelled as nadh for pha accumulation were provided by glycogen degradation and a fraction of acetate being channelled through the tca cycle when oxygen became available aerobic phase with activated etc the intracellular phas were degraded and the resources from this degradation were used to restore the glycogen and polyphosphate pool such metabolic strategy observed in the cycling of polymers is typical of accumulibacter oehmen et al 2007 acevedo et al 2012 smolders et al 1995 although the model with unconstrained growth predicted typical profiles for accumulibacter there are some quantitative mismatches with the compared experimental data set fig 1b mainly regarding the amount of glycogen and pha used accumulated within a cycle this mismatch between prediction and experimental data results in part from a higher contribution of the nadh generated in the tca cycle leading to lower required flux through glycolysis fig 3 explored in the following subsections we additionally identified that biosynthesis was active anaerobically in this simulation mainly synthesising enzymes to evaluate if the observed mismatches were specific to the chosen condition ebpr at 20 c or based on a systematic feature of our modelling approach we explored a broad range of different temperatures 3 2 simulations for different temperatures reported experimentally determined values of temperature coefficients θ in paos range from 1 03 for polyphosphate synthesis to up to 1 13 for pha degradation see table s2 and fig s1 for other reactions of the metabolic model tca cycle etc protein biosynthesis ribosome synthesis etc no specific θ values for paos were found in literature therefore these were assumed to be the same for all uncharacterized reactions and we analysed the impact of this value varying within a range of the previous reported values a typical ebpr cycle was simulated ranging between 4 c and 20 c for all simulations a shift in the metabolic strategy towards lower temperatures was observed fig s2 the tested θ value of uncharacterized reactions did not affect the metabolic shift but affected the temperature at which the shift was observed fig s2 for example the simulations indicated a metabolic shift of the system towards colder temperatures below either 13 c or 18 c when assuming θ values for uncharacterized reactions with θ 1 05 or 1 15 respectively from here on a value of 1 05 was used for the reactions where no experimental value was available 3 3 influence of the growth constraint on simulations with temperature dependencies implemented in the metabolic model we simulated a typical ebpr cycle of paos over a temperature range from 4 c to 20 c with no constraints on growth the results show a decrease in growth yield with a decrease in temperature following two different exponential regions fig 2 a unconstrained growth in these simulations the model employed slightly a different metabolic strategy towards lower temperatures resulting in a larger use of glycogen and polyphosphate over the cycle fig 2b unconstrained growth we observed that in the studied temperature range resources were destined for growth in both the anaerobic and aerobic phases interestingly the lower the temperature the higher contribution anaerobic growth had on the system especially destined towards enzyme synthesis reactions reaching up to 25 of all biosynthesis at temperatures below 10 c although there is no conclusive proof that growth is an exclusive aerobic process in paos we analysed the impact of constraining growth to the aerobic phase only particularly a constraint was introduced to block biosynthesis reactions during anaerobic conditions the model with these new constraints was used to simulate the previous conditions typical ebpr cycle of paos over a temperature range from 4 c to 20 c the resulting growth yields were lower than those of the unconstrained growth model and similarly decreased towards lower temperatures fig 2a aerobic growth model this decrease however followed a distinct exponential arrhenius like curve additionally these simulations resulted in higher levels of glycogen use at 20 c then the model with no growth constraints 3 fold higher better replicating the results from acevedo et al 2012 towards lower temperatures less glycogen and more polyphosphate was used in these simulations fig 2b aerobic growth 3 4 comparison and analysis of resource allocation strategies the different predictions obtained over the studied temperature range are compared in terms of their resource allocation especially we focus on the allocation of electrons in form of nadh and energy in the form of atp by analysing reactions using or generating these metabolites for this we analysed the generation and consumption of nadh fig 3 and atp fig 4 during the anaerobic phase of each simulation with respect to the amount of acetate consumed note that the metabolism of paos is strongly constrained in the anaerobic phase hence we primarily focus on the anaerobic phase of each simulation the model with no constraints on anaerobic growth predicted that anaerobically nadh and atp were allocated towards biosynthesis of enzymes and this allocation grew larger at lower temperatures figs 3 and 4 unconstrained growth model the increased need for these resources for biosynthesis was met with an increased flux of glycogen degradation up to 280 more turnover supplying both the required atp and nadh in this model which fits the observations of a larger turnover of glycogen towards lower temperatures fig 2 unconstrained growth predictions of the model allowing only aerobic growth indicated an opposite trend than that of the unconstrained model namely the turnover of nadh was larger at higher temperatures fig 3 resulting in a larger turnover of glycogen as described in the previous section fig 2 interestingly the larger amounts of glycogen degraded at higher temperatures led to an overproduction of electrons than required only for acetate uptake leading to a higher accumulation of ph2mv as a sink of these electrons additionally the source of atp produced anaerobically in this model shifted from a nearly full contribution of polyphosphate at lower temperatures towards a shared contribution of polyphosphate degradation glycogen degradation and pepck at higher temperatures fig 4 aerobic growth model note that pepck is a reversible reaction and as such acts as both an atp sink and source at lower and higher temperatures respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the model with only aerobic growth predicts better polymer use of paos the metabolic shift predicted by the unconstrained growth model indicated that at lower temperatures larger amounts of glycogen were being degraded than at higher temperatures fig 2b unconstrained growth this result was surprising and opposite to what has been observed experimentally and described in literature brdjanovic et al 1997 exposed paos enrichments at short term temperature changes and observed that at lower temperatures less glycogen was used overall contradictory with the predictions of this model further brdjanovic et al 1998a confirmed the same experimental observations in paos enrichments on longer term temperature effects this same behaviour has been reproduced by using kinetic models lopez vazquez et al 2009 garcia usach et al 2006 and even proven to hold true for glycogen accumulating organisms gaos under similar conditions lopez vazquez et al 2008 on the other hand the constraint limiting biosynthesis to be an exclusive aerobic process resulted in predictions more in line with the described literature over the studied temperature range brdjanovic et al 1998a brdjanovic et al 1997 lopez vazquez et al 2009 whang and park 2006 i e the amount of glycogen used anaerobically in a cycle increased with an increase in temperature figs 2 3 and 4 aerobic growth further the overall amount of glycogen used and consequently pha accumulated at 20 c was also larger than in the unconstrained growth model resulting in improved model predictions when compared to the experimental dataset obtained by acevedo et al 2012 fig 1 not only the predictions of the aerobic growth model approximated better the results from acevedo et al 2012 but also the anaerobic stoichiometric yields for glycogen pha and polyphosphate fit better within the observed yields from multiple paos enrichments at 20 c summarized in welles et al 2015 fig 5 further supporting the validity of the added biological constraint of this model other than the direct effect observed on polymer cycling the model also improved in fulfilling a basic principle of systems biology linear relationship between growth rate and ribosome content fig s4 such a biological principle is paramount for biological systems at balanced growth bosdriesz et al 2015 metzl raz et al 2017 and should not be an exception for paos the simulations with no growth constraints at different temperatures showed no such linear relation fig s4 a b however once the constraint on limiting anaerobic biosynthesis was introduced a linear relation between growth rate and ribosome content emerged fig s4 c d we note that recently mairet et al 2021 showed that at higher temperatures this linear relationship breaks nevertheless the temperature range of this study is below such threshold the different predictions from both models arose as a consequence of resource limitation in a system that was tightly constrained by its catalytic capacities rügen et al 2015 at lower temperatures the decrease in catalytic efficiency of each metabolic process resulted in lower flux capacities that could only be resolved by either producing larger enzymatic levels or adopting a different metabolic strategy such limitations in energy metabolism are known to strongly shape the proteome and metabolic strategy of microorganisms chen and nielsen 2019 this was clearly observed in the unconstrained growth model when at lower temperatures there was an increased flux of biosynthesis during the anaerobic phase figs 3 and 4 in order to maintain metabolic fluxes high these higher fluxes also resulted in higher growth yields of the unconstrained growth model as compared to the growth constrained model such biosynthetic fluxes were balanced with increased glycogen degradation that generated the required nadh atp and metabolic precursors as these results strongly contradict what has been observed experimentally we conclude that indeed anaerobic biosynthesis is severely limited in paos the aforementioned discussed results highlight the validity of the newly introduced constraint as a general biological principle that could apply to paos such as accumulibacter but might even be generalized to organisms that are adapted to live under dynamic anaerobic aerobic environments such as those encountered in ebpr or estuary sediments next we attempt to give a biological meaning to the introduced constraint on limiting biomass synthesis and hypothesise on the possible regulation behind it 4 2 putative regulation of biosynthesis under dynamic conditions biomass synthesis in paos has been commonly assumed to be limited to only the aerobic phase comeau et al 1986 smolders et al 1994 however these assumptions have never been proven experimentally since anaerobic growth is very common among bacteria it cannot simply be assumed as non existing in paos we suggest that the limit on anaerobic biosynthesis is likely caused due to a dynamics shift in the energetic and redox state over an ebpr cycle the presence of an external electron acceptor i e oxygen has been proven to strongly affect the redox state of cells sun et al 2012 that is anaerobically the nadh nad ratio increases limiting reactions that are near equilibrium in the cell although not studied in depth during ebpr we hypothesise that this ratio is dynamically changing over a cycle zhao et al 2021 showed direct measurements of this ratio although this methodology has not been extensively proven similarly we hypothesise that polyphosphate degradation could be initiated anaerobically by thermodynamic control caused by a shift in the atp amp balance in the cell hypothesised in early paos research by comeau et al 1986 as a combined consequence of fast acetate uptake and the changed redox state however the synthesis and polymerization of proteins requires a relatively low atp amp ratio being opposite to that required for polyphosphate degradation urry 2011 making both physiological processes to be thermodynamically opposed more research is required in the dynamics of the redox and energetic state of paos to further understand physiological mechanisms of organisms living under ebpr like conditions 4 3 first principles modelling approach to predict paos metabolism the dynamic resource allocation modelling approach applied resulted in typical polymeric profiles that paos exhibit in a ebpr cycle fig 1 without the need of parameter calibration or predefinition of metabolic strategies thus the employed method could be used not only to understand the environmental selection on paos gaos and pha aos as was done by guedes da silva et al 2019 but to test basic metabolic principles shaping optimality in dynamic conditions this modelling approach represents an alternative to traditional used modelling approaches that rely on experimental yields and kinetics van loosdrecht et al 2015 lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 varga et al 2018 santos et al 2020 but is however not intended to be used as an indicator of ebpr process control or performance the applied model in this research could be used as a tool to expand our current understanding of redox and energetic state of bacterial cells under dynamic conditions for example here we identified a potential shift in the sources of nadh and atp figs 3 and 4 respectively as a function of temperature further studying these individual contributions this model could explain the reason behind the large variation in p c ratio obtained by different research groups when studying paos enrichments summarized in da silva et al 2020 this model is not intended to be used for monitoring waste water treatment plants but rather to gather fundamental knowledge that could help improve our mechanistic understanding of organisms commonly encountered in said processes 5 conclusions from this research we can conclude that resource allocation theory delivers a strong framework to analyse metabolic processes in microbial communities typically found in wastewater treatment systems integrating temperature into a fba models of organisms living in dynamic conditions allows for deeper understanding of resource allocation limitations of cells based on the resource allocation theory results the

15287,the understanding of microbial communities and the biological regulation of its members is crucial for implementation of novel technologies using microbial ecology one poorly understood metabolic principle of microbial communities is resource allocation and biosynthesis resource allocation theory in polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos is limited as a result of their slow imposed growth rate typical sludge retention times of at least 4 days and limitations to quantify changes in biomass components over a 6 hours cycle less than 10 of their growth as a result there is no direct evidence supporting that biosynthesis is an exclusive aerobic process in paos that alternate continuously between anaerobic and aerobic phases here we apply resource allocation metabolic flux analysis to study the optimal phenotype of paos over a temperature range of 4 c to 20 c the model applied in this research allowed to identify optimal metabolic strategies in a core metabolic model with limited constraints based on biological principles the addition of a constraint limiting biomass synthesis to be an exclusive aerobic process changed the metabolic behaviour and improved the predictability of the model over the studied temperature range by closing the gap between prediction and experimental findings the results validate the assumption of limited anaerobic biosynthesis in paos specifically candidatus accumulibacter related species interestingly the predicted growth yield was lower suggesting that there are mechanistic barriers for anaerobic growth not yet understood nor reflected in the current models of paos moreover we identified strategies of resource allocation applied by paos at different temperatures as a result of the decreased catalytic efficiencies of their biochemical reactions understanding resource allocation is paramount in the study of paos and their currently unknown complex metabolic regulation and metabolic modelling based on biological

translate well with process observations however require extensive recalibration depending on plant properties and environmental conditions for example more recent model developments include the effect of putative pao competitors lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 fermentative paos varga et al 2018 storage levels effects santos et al 2020 etc nevertheless most current models rely on pre defined metabolic strategies and consequently reflect the already existing though not necessarily complete scientific knowledge on metabolic functions of this ecosystem although useful these features limit the mechanistic understanding of the biological principles governing microbial communities under dynamic conditions one of the pre defined microbial strategy commonly applied in the ebpr models is the assumption of growth being limited to the aerobic phase already very early pao studies suggested that biosynthesis occurs only in the aerobic phase of ebpr systems at expenses of pha degradation comeau et al 1986 smolders et al 1994 throughout the years this assumption has been adopted into metabolic models interestingly this assumption has not been verified in depth besides the observations on the consumption of certain nutrients e g nh4 linked to aerobic growth camejo et al 2019 many bacterial species that survive under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions grow anaerobically while fermenting substrate sawers 1999 ribes et al 2004 hence the validity of this assumption aerobic biosynthesis in paos is yet to be confirmed due to the slow growth of organisms in ebpr processes it has been difficult to estimate protein turnover rates and to precisely calculate protein synthesis in different phases of a cycle a typical ebpr lab scale setting consist of daily cycles of 6 h with an imposed srt of 8 days thus theoretically the biomass in the system should renew its proteome in the range of around 32 cycles meaning that in one cycle the newly produced proteins would account for only 3 of the proteome and the putative contribution of anaerobic biosynthesis would be even lower measuring such small differences in microbial communities is technically challenging considering the inhomogeneity of the culture as well as current limitations such as number of mass spectra acquisition per time kleiner 2019 biased extraction methods to soluble proteins sievers 2018 helbig et al 2010 amongst others proteomics studies on ebpr sludge from wilmes et al 2008 and wexler et al 2009 fell short on quantitatively identifying these changes exemplifying the complications of studying protein synthesis in slow growing systems such as paos data from transcriptomic studies however seem to indicate a major trend towards aerobic protein biosynthesis time series metatranscriptomic data from a highly enriched accumulibacter culture showed different clusters of expression throughout the ebpr cycle oyserman et al 2016 the largest number of transcripts from their study showed trends of transcription during the aerobic phase identified as aerobic pattern redox transition and low phosphate patterns although the link from transcription to protein synthesis is not always direct these results highly suggest that there is a regulation favouring protein synthesis to occur in the aerobic phase this hypothesis could be further explored experimentally with the use of isotopically labelled acetate fed to a paos enrichment such as the experiments done by hesselmann et al 2000 to identify the fate of 13c anaerobically and aerobically over one or multiple cycles however up to date such evidence is lacking with no final experimental evidence model based studies considering biosynthesis and resource allocation could be applied to develop an understanding of a putative synthesis of biomass components and furthermore quantify the putative benefit of anaerobic growth constraint based models such as flux balance analysis fba integrating principles from resource allocation represent an opportunity to test a hypothesis regarding biosynthesis during a cyclic dynamic system orth et al 2010 rügen et al 2015 conditional flux balance analysis cfba is a metabolic modelling tool that was originally developed to predict the metabolism of cyanobacteria under dynamic day night cycles with strong dependency on resource allocation rügen et al 2015 the characteristics of the cfba framework and the similarities of these cyclic conditions with those of ebpr make cfba a suitable method to apply in the context of studying paos recently the cfba method was applied to predict optimal strategies under dynamic environmental conditions encountered during ebpr guedes da silva et al 2019 depending on the environmental constraints different optimal strategies i e organisms accumulating polyphosphate paos glycogen gaos polyhydroxyalkanoates pha os and heterotrophs were predicted the optimizations resulted in metabolic strategies comparable to those typically observed for accumulibacter while the general behaviour was correctly predicted there were quantitative mismatches suggesting the need for further model development probably beyond parameter calibration because the model is strongly shaped by the relation between enzymatic activities and resource allocation there is potential for expansion in this front enzymatic activities are strongly influenced by temperature and consequently temperature plays a crucial role in shaping the metabolism of microorganisms russell 1990 implementation of temperature dependencies on metabolic models have shed light on basic biological principles such as a linear relationship between growth rate and ribosome content bosdriesz et al 2015 metzl raz et al 2017 and optimal proteome allocation as a function of temperature mairet et al 2021 however these principles result from models for organisms such as escherichia coli at steady state and may not apply to microbial communities under dynamic conditions on the other hand there are extensive experimental studies on the effect of temperature on paos metabolism brdjanovic et al 1997 1998a 1998b the current mechanistic understanding of paos metabolism with relation to temperatures could be combined with metabolic models such as cfba to identify metabolic principles governing growth and resource allocation especially at low temperatures the efficient use of available resources like enzyme capacity are assumed to be crucial for evolutionary competitiveness in the current study we combined the cfba modelling framework with temperature dependency for paos to identify metabolic principles regarding resource allocation we compared the complete model with and without a constraint on anaerobic biomass synthesis our results further validate the assumption on biomass being limited to the aerobic sector of ebpr and shed light on previously unexplored putative regulation on protein biosynthesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description for modelling the metabolism and energy allocation of paos a constrained based approach named conditional flux balance analysis cfba was used rügen et al 2015 the model and parameters for paos was obtained from guedes da silva et al 2019 the model consists of 29 metabolites connected by 36 reactions represented in a stoichiometric matrix s all network reactions and stoichiometry are detailed in table s1 different to conventional approaches only a subset of metabolites 7 metabolites are considered in steady state by the relation s v t 0 where s denotes the stoichiometric matrix subset of steady state metabolites and v t denotes the fluxes of each reaction at time interval t the remaining 22 metabolites are dynamic i e are allowed to accumulate or deplete over time polymers enzymes and biomass precursors and their molar amount is updated at each time point by the following relation m t s v t m t 1 m t is a vector that indicates the molar amount of the non steady state metabolites at time interval t and s denotes the stoichiometric matrix subset of the dynamic metabolites not in steady state 2 1 1 biomass growth and composition growth of the system at the end of the simulation is described as the overall fold change α of the initial metabolite composition m0 m e n d α m 0 this relation introduces the possibility to simulate a system in a cycle as the proportions of non steady state metabolites need to be maintained only at the end of the simulation the values of m0 are an outcome of the simulation in order to achieve maximal growth but limited to the total sum of 1 gram dry weight gdw by the relation w t m 0 1 where wt is a transposed vector containing the weights that different components have on 1 gdw of biomass the values in wt were defined by guedes da silva et al 2019 for glycogen polyphosphate and pha levels based on data published by acevedo et al 2012 data published by acevedo et al 2012 belong to a reactor performing 99 phosphate removal with a defined population of 85 paos and show clearly identified cycling of polyphosphate glycogen phb and phv protein content was based on the work of yücesoy et al 2012 2 1 2 quota definition of compounds the metabolites that are not in steady state consist of storage polymers glycogen polyphosphate phb and ph2mv catalytic metabolites enzymes and ribosomes and non catalytic metabolites named here as biomass precursors and other proteins because some of these metabolites do not reinforce the autocatalytic behaviour of the system their values in the vector m0 will tend to be 0 as this vector is an outcome of the simulation to optimize growth to enforce the synthesis of these compounds rügen et al 2015 introduced the concept of quota compounds following the relation b q u o t a t m t c q u o t a t w t m t in this relation b q u a t a t is a matrix containing the index positions in the m vector of the metabolites for which the quota is being defined at time point t c q u a t a t is a vector containing the values for the said quotas the indicated relation was used to define minimal quota levels at time 0 for glycogen polyphosphate and phas based on data published by acevedo et al 2012 it was also used to define an all time minimal level of biomass precursors and non catalytic proteins for this research the concept of quota compounds was slightly modified to include specific and maximum quota compounds at indicated time points b q u a t a e q t m t c q u a t a e q t w t m t b q u o t a max t m t c q u o t a max t w t m t these additional concepts were used to define a set initial amount of substrate acetate at time 0 hours and to enforce its uptake by setting a maximum quota of 0 at 0 5 h of the cycle 2 1 3 catalytic and non catalytic constraints on fluxes comparable to conventional fba each reaction can be limited according to pre assigned values in a lower lb and upper bound ub vector at each time point l b t v t u b t the lower and upper bounds were used to specify environmental limits on reactions e g during the anaerobic period oxygen consuming had an ub of 0 mmol gdw h otherwise the upper bounds were defined by the amount of a specific catalyst and the turnover rate of this catalyst kcat e values by v t m t e k c a t e where mt e denotes a subsection of mt containing the molar amount of enzymes at time t and kcat e a vector with the catalytic turnover number kcat e of each enzyme all reactions from the system except for co2 diffusion are catalysed by enzymes or ribosomes the kcat e values for each reaction were adapted from the work from rügen et al 2015 and if not considered in their research it was obtained from the brenda database schomburg et al 2012 the molar cost of all the enzymes was the assumed to be the same based on the work from rügen et al 2015 2 1 4 maintenance requirements metabolic models commonly consider the expenditure of energy atp for basic maintenance purposes here a constant flux of 0 3980 mmol atp gdw h was used based on literature values for paos smolders et al 1995 this value is assumed for the anaerobic as well as aerobic phase and is independent of the amount of available substrate 2 1 5 simulation of dynamic conditions simulations were performed considering a typical ebpr cycle an anaerobic phase of 1 5 h followed by an aerobic phase of 3 5 h the anaerobic conditions were simulated by setting the upper bound for the electron transport chain etc reaction to 0 mmol o2 gdw h conversely during the aerobic phase the upper bound of this reaction was only limited by the capacity of the respective enzyme constraint the substrate acetate was available at the beginning of the anaerobic phase t 0h by setting an initial metabolite quota for the starting amount to enforce rapid consumption a maximum quota of 0 mmol gdw h was set at 30 min 2 1 6 optimization target and algorithm used the previously defined constraints equalities and inequalities of the model are discretized in defined time intervals throughout the cycle linear programming was then used to identify possible flux distributions at each time interval without an optimization objective thus the obtained flux distribution for each time point is not an optimal unique solution but rather a possible solution that fulfils the equality and inequality constraints mentioned so far steady state metabolites initial metabolite composition quotas and enzyme capacities the possible solutions can be further constrained for any given α value fold change of the system the overall optimal target maximum possible α value was set following the approach introduced by rügen et al 2015 and used by reimers et al 2017 and guedes da silva et al 2019 briefly a search for α values that fulfil the linear constraints is performed using an algorithm of binary search until the highest achievable α value is found with a defined accuracy minimal step size of 10 7 due to the presence of internal cycles in the metabolic model the solution obtained is not unique to further limit the solution space we identified and limited internal cycles from the available solutions with no effect on the outcome of the simulation 2 1 7 temperature dependencies temperature was implemented as a parameter affecting the turnover rates kcat of individual reactions following the simplified arrhenius equation from 4 to 20 c this relation has been used previously to describe temperature effect on the kinetics of paos using a black box kinetic model brdjanovic et al 1998a lopez vazquez et al 2009 and is expressed as k c a t t k c a t 20 θ t 20 c where kcat t represents the kcat value at temperature t kcat 20 the kcat value at 20 c defined as optimal temperature for paos and theta θ the temperature coefficient for the specific reaction in question the values for θ are reaction specific and were adapted from the previously determined θ values found in lopez vazquez et al 2009 and summarized in table s2 the values for θ of reactions that have not been determined were set within the range of estimated θ values for comparable bioconversions the effect of the set θ values on the model prediction was evaluated with a general parameter sweep 2 1 8 simulation with and without biomass synthesis constrains to evaluate the effect that biomass growth during the entire cycle or only during the aerobic phase two simulations were performed these simulations are referred to as the unconstrained growth no constrains on biosynthesis and the aerobic growth biosynthesis can only occur during the aerobic period models the only difference between both models lays on the upper bounds allowed for the reactions involved in protein and ribosomes production including enzymes and synthesis of biomass precursors bmp synthesis see table s1 for information on the stoichiometry of these reactions in the unconstrained growth model these bounds were constrained like all other reactions set by the catalytic limitations whereas in the aerobic growth model these upper bounds were set to 0 mmol gdw h during the anaerobic phase 2 2 software and model availability all simulations were performed in matlab version 9 4 r2019b using linprog as the linear optimization solver the original cfba model was retrieved from rügen et al 2015 and the paos specific model retrieved from guedes da silva et al 2019 the adapted model used in this study is available at gitlab project id 39202430 https gitlab com delft paos cfba temperature 3 results 3 1 reference simulation ebpr cycle with unconstrained growth at 20 c we first investigated the predicted metabolic response of the model with unconstrained growth fig 1a in a typical ebpr system at 20 c and used it as the reference simulation for further comparisons a total cycle length of 5 h was applied 1 5 h anaerobic and 3 5 h aerobic acetate was enforced to be consumed within 30 min of the anaerobic period to simulate the competition for substrate and obtain the competitive strategy of organisms enriched under this regime guedes da silva et al 2019 the minimal initial amounts quota of storage polymers polyphosphate glycogen and pha per biomass mol gdw were introduced in the model based on data published by acevedo et al 2012 using these conditions the reference metabolic response of paos simulated was obtained and compared to the experimental profiles from acevedo et al 2012 fig 1b the simulation reproduced complete acetate consumption and accumulation as pha fig 1b while polyphosphate was degraded to provide the required atp for the uptake and activation of acetate and anaerobic maintenance reducing equivalents modelled as nadh for pha accumulation were provided by glycogen degradation and a fraction of acetate being channelled through the tca cycle when oxygen became available aerobic phase with activated etc the intracellular phas were degraded and the resources from this degradation were used to restore the glycogen and polyphosphate pool such metabolic strategy observed in the cycling of polymers is typical of accumulibacter oehmen et al 2007 acevedo et al 2012 smolders et al 1995 although the model with unconstrained growth predicted typical profiles for accumulibacter there are some quantitative mismatches with the compared experimental data set fig 1b mainly regarding the amount of glycogen and pha used accumulated within a cycle this mismatch between prediction and experimental data results in part from a higher contribution of the nadh generated in the tca cycle leading to lower required flux through glycolysis fig 3 explored in the following subsections we additionally identified that biosynthesis was active anaerobically in this simulation mainly synthesising enzymes to evaluate if the observed mismatches were specific to the chosen condition ebpr at 20 c or based on a systematic feature of our modelling approach we explored a broad range of different temperatures 3 2 simulations for different temperatures reported experimentally determined values of temperature coefficients θ in paos range from 1 03 for polyphosphate synthesis to up to 1 13 for pha degradation see table s2 and fig s1 for other reactions of the metabolic model tca cycle etc protein biosynthesis ribosome synthesis etc no specific θ values for paos were found in literature therefore these were assumed to be the same for all uncharacterized reactions and we analysed the impact of this value varying within a range of the previous reported values a typical ebpr cycle was simulated ranging between 4 c and 20 c for all simulations a shift in the metabolic strategy towards lower temperatures was observed fig s2 the tested θ value of uncharacterized reactions did not affect the metabolic shift but affected the temperature at which the shift was observed fig s2 for example the simulations indicated a metabolic shift of the system towards colder temperatures below either 13 c or 18 c when assuming θ values for uncharacterized reactions with θ 1 05 or 1 15 respectively from here on a value of 1 05 was used for the reactions where no experimental value was available 3 3 influence of the growth constraint on simulations with temperature dependencies implemented in the metabolic model we simulated a typical ebpr cycle of paos over a temperature range from 4 c to 20 c with no constraints on growth the results show a decrease in growth yield with a decrease in temperature following two different exponential regions fig 2 a unconstrained growth in these simulations the model employed slightly a different metabolic strategy towards lower temperatures resulting in a larger use of glycogen and polyphosphate over the cycle fig 2b unconstrained growth we observed that in the studied temperature range resources were destined for growth in both the anaerobic and aerobic phases interestingly the lower the temperature the higher contribution anaerobic growth had on the system especially destined towards enzyme synthesis reactions reaching up to 25 of all biosynthesis at temperatures below 10 c although there is no conclusive proof that growth is an exclusive aerobic process in paos we analysed the impact of constraining growth to the aerobic phase only particularly a constraint was introduced to block biosynthesis reactions during anaerobic conditions the model with these new constraints was used to simulate the previous conditions typical ebpr cycle of paos over a temperature range from 4 c to 20 c the resulting growth yields were lower than those of the unconstrained growth model and similarly decreased towards lower temperatures fig 2a aerobic growth model this decrease however followed a distinct exponential arrhenius like curve additionally these simulations resulted in higher levels of glycogen use at 20 c then the model with no growth constraints 3 fold higher better replicating the results from acevedo et al 2012 towards lower temperatures less glycogen and more polyphosphate was used in these simulations fig 2b aerobic growth 3 4 comparison and analysis of resource allocation strategies the different predictions obtained over the studied temperature range are compared in terms of their resource allocation especially we focus on the allocation of electrons in form of nadh and energy in the form of atp by analysing reactions using or generating these metabolites for this we analysed the generation and consumption of nadh fig 3 and atp fig 4 during the anaerobic phase of each simulation with respect to the amount of acetate consumed note that the metabolism of paos is strongly constrained in the anaerobic phase hence we primarily focus on the anaerobic phase of each simulation the model with no constraints on anaerobic growth predicted that anaerobically nadh and atp were allocated towards biosynthesis of enzymes and this allocation grew larger at lower temperatures figs 3 and 4 unconstrained growth model the increased need for these resources for biosynthesis was met with an increased flux of glycogen degradation up to 280 more turnover supplying both the required atp and nadh in this model which fits the observations of a larger turnover of glycogen towards lower temperatures fig 2 unconstrained growth predictions of the model allowing only aerobic growth indicated an opposite trend than that of the unconstrained model namely the turnover of nadh was larger at higher temperatures fig 3 resulting in a larger turnover of glycogen as described in the previous section fig 2 interestingly the larger amounts of glycogen degraded at higher temperatures led to an overproduction of electrons than required only for acetate uptake leading to a higher accumulation of ph2mv as a sink of these electrons additionally the source of atp produced anaerobically in this model shifted from a nearly full contribution of polyphosphate at lower temperatures towards a shared contribution of polyphosphate degradation glycogen degradation and pepck at higher temperatures fig 4 aerobic growth model note that pepck is a reversible reaction and as such acts as both an atp sink and source at lower and higher temperatures respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the model with only aerobic growth predicts better polymer use of paos the metabolic shift predicted by the unconstrained growth model indicated that at lower temperatures larger amounts of glycogen were being degraded than at higher temperatures fig 2b unconstrained growth this result was surprising and opposite to what has been observed experimentally and described in literature brdjanovic et al 1997 exposed paos enrichments at short term temperature changes and observed that at lower temperatures less glycogen was used overall contradictory with the predictions of this model further brdjanovic et al 1998a confirmed the same experimental observations in paos enrichments on longer term temperature effects this same behaviour has been reproduced by using kinetic models lopez vazquez et al 2009 garcia usach et al 2006 and even proven to hold true for glycogen accumulating organisms gaos under similar conditions lopez vazquez et al 2008 on the other hand the constraint limiting biosynthesis to be an exclusive aerobic process resulted in predictions more in line with the described literature over the studied temperature range brdjanovic et al 1998a brdjanovic et al 1997 lopez vazquez et al 2009 whang and park 2006 i e the amount of glycogen used anaerobically in a cycle increased with an increase in temperature figs 2 3 and 4 aerobic growth further the overall amount of glycogen used and consequently pha accumulated at 20 c was also larger than in the unconstrained growth model resulting in improved model predictions when compared to the experimental dataset obtained by acevedo et al 2012 fig 1 not only the predictions of the aerobic growth model approximated better the results from acevedo et al 2012 but also the anaerobic stoichiometric yields for glycogen pha and polyphosphate fit better within the observed yields from multiple paos enrichments at 20 c summarized in welles et al 2015 fig 5 further supporting the validity of the added biological constraint of this model other than the direct effect observed on polymer cycling the model also improved in fulfilling a basic principle of systems biology linear relationship between growth rate and ribosome content fig s4 such a biological principle is paramount for biological systems at balanced growth bosdriesz et al 2015 metzl raz et al 2017 and should not be an exception for paos the simulations with no growth constraints at different temperatures showed no such linear relation fig s4 a b however once the constraint on limiting anaerobic biosynthesis was introduced a linear relation between growth rate and ribosome content emerged fig s4 c d we note that recently mairet et al 2021 showed that at higher temperatures this linear relationship breaks nevertheless the temperature range of this study is below such threshold the different predictions from both models arose as a consequence of resource limitation in a system that was tightly constrained by its catalytic capacities rügen et al 2015 at lower temperatures the decrease in catalytic efficiency of each metabolic process resulted in lower flux capacities that could only be resolved by either producing larger enzymatic levels or adopting a different metabolic strategy such limitations in energy metabolism are known to strongly shape the proteome and metabolic strategy of microorganisms chen and nielsen 2019 this was clearly observed in the unconstrained growth model when at lower temperatures there was an increased flux of biosynthesis during the anaerobic phase figs 3 and 4 in order to maintain metabolic fluxes high these higher fluxes also resulted in higher growth yields of the unconstrained growth model as compared to the growth constrained model such biosynthetic fluxes were balanced with increased glycogen degradation that generated the required nadh atp and metabolic precursors as these results strongly contradict what has been observed experimentally we conclude that indeed anaerobic biosynthesis is severely limited in paos the aforementioned discussed results highlight the validity of the newly introduced constraint as a general biological principle that could apply to paos such as accumulibacter but might even be generalized to organisms that are adapted to live under dynamic anaerobic aerobic environments such as those encountered in ebpr or estuary sediments next we attempt to give a biological meaning to the introduced constraint on limiting biomass synthesis and hypothesise on the possible regulation behind it 4 2 putative regulation of biosynthesis under dynamic conditions biomass synthesis in paos has been commonly assumed to be limited to only the aerobic phase comeau et al 1986 smolders et al 1994 however these assumptions have never been proven experimentally since anaerobic growth is very common among bacteria it cannot simply be assumed as non existing in paos we suggest that the limit on anaerobic biosynthesis is likely caused due to a dynamics shift in the energetic and redox state over an ebpr cycle the presence of an external electron acceptor i e oxygen has been proven to strongly affect the redox state of cells sun et al 2012 that is anaerobically the nadh nad ratio increases limiting reactions that are near equilibrium in the cell although not studied in depth during ebpr we hypothesise that this ratio is dynamically changing over a cycle zhao et al 2021 showed direct measurements of this ratio although this methodology has not been extensively proven similarly we hypothesise that polyphosphate degradation could be initiated anaerobically by thermodynamic control caused by a shift in the atp amp balance in the cell hypothesised in early paos research by comeau et al 1986 as a combined consequence of fast acetate uptake and the changed redox state however the synthesis and polymerization of proteins requires a relatively low atp amp ratio being opposite to that required for polyphosphate degradation urry 2011 making both physiological processes to be thermodynamically opposed more research is required in the dynamics of the redox and energetic state of paos to further understand physiological mechanisms of organisms living under ebpr like conditions 4 3 first principles modelling approach to predict paos metabolism the dynamic resource allocation modelling approach applied resulted in typical polymeric profiles that paos exhibit in a ebpr cycle fig 1 without the need of parameter calibration or predefinition of metabolic strategies thus the employed method could be used not only to understand the environmental selection on paos gaos and pha aos as was done by guedes da silva et al 2019 but to test basic metabolic principles shaping optimality in dynamic conditions this modelling approach represents an alternative to traditional used modelling approaches that rely on experimental yields and kinetics van loosdrecht et al 2015 lopez vazquez et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 varga et al 2018 santos et al 2020 but is however not intended to be used as an indicator of ebpr process control or performance the applied model in this research could be used as a tool to expand our current understanding of redox and energetic state of bacterial cells under dynamic conditions for example here we identified a potential shift in the sources of nadh and atp figs 3 and 4 respectively as a function of temperature further studying these individual contributions this model could explain the reason behind the large variation in p c ratio obtained by different research groups when studying paos enrichments summarized in da silva et al 2020 this model is not intended to be used for monitoring waste water treatment plants but rather to gather fundamental knowledge that could help improve our mechanistic understanding of organisms commonly encountered in said processes 5 conclusions from this research we can conclude that resource allocation theory delivers a strong framework to analyse metabolic processes in microbial communities typically found in wastewater treatment systems integrating temperature into a fba models of organisms living in dynamic conditions allows for deeper understanding of resource allocation limitations of cells based on the resource allocation theory results the

15288,pyrolysis of pharmaceutical sludge ps is a promising way of safe disposal and to recover energy and resources from waste the resulting ps biochar psbc is often used as adsorbent but has seldom been explored as catalyst herein we demonstrate that psbc 0 4 g l could efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate pms to 100 degrade 4 chlorophenol 4 cp with rate constants of 0 42 1 70 min 1 outperforming other reported catalysts interestingly the pms activation pathway highly depended on psbc pyrolysis temperature which produced dominantly high valent iron species e g feivo2 at low temperature but more sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical oh at higher temperature e g 0 17 0 23 0 12 mmol l of feivo2 and 0 009 0 038 0 102 mmol l of so4 oh were produced within 10 min by psbc 600 pms psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms respectively characterization density functional theory dft simulation and pearson correlation analysis revealed that along with the increase of pyrolysis temperatures the active sites of psbc gradually shifted from atomically dispersed n coordinated fe moieties fenx to iron nitrides fexn which activated pms to produce feivo2 and so4 oh respectively this study clarifies the structure activity relationships of psbc for pms activation and opens a new avenue for the treatment and utilization of ps as high value added resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceutical sludge pyrolysis biochar peroxymonosulfate reactive species organic pollutants degradation 1 introduction the treatment of wastewater from pharmaceutical industries by biological units and coagulation techniques has produced millions tons of pharmaceutical sludge ps per year hou et al 2016 which contains various harmful substances such as pathogens heavy metals and antibiotics residues thus the safe disposal of ps is obligatory to minimize its environmental risk martin et al 2012 liu et al 2012 wei et al 2018 conventional sludge disposal routes such as landfill and soil utilization are inadequate due to their potential adverse impacts on the soil or groundwater and the spreading of antimicrobial resistance caused by antibiotics residues in ps bengtsson palme et al 2019 therefore alternative disposal techniques are urgently desirable to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations more importantly it is of great significance to recover energy and resources from sludge amid the context of sustainability and carbon neutrality chen et al 2018 silva thomsen et al 2020 incineration of sludge for instance could recover renewable energy reduce the sludge volume and destruct organic pollutants simultaneously manara and zabaniotou 2012 nonetheless the ash residue and secondary pollutants such as dioxins generated during incineration restrain its wide application samolada and zabaniotou 2014 pyrolysis of sludge under an inert atmosphere is more promising because of the following merits 1 pyrolysis can remove hazardous substances effectively 2 pyrolysis is a zero waste technique since it produces bio gas and bio oil as the potential fuel with the remaining biochar as adsorbents or catalysts 3 pyrolysis might recover energy and resources without carbon emission 4 the estimated life cycle cost of pyrolysis 291 1000 kg dry sludge is more attractive than that 54 1000 kg of incineration chanaka udayanga et al 2019 devi and saroha 2017 tarpani and azapagic 2018 the pyrolysis of sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp paper mills and electroplating industries etc were extensively studied tang et al 2019 yoon et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 for instance ihsanullah et al 2022 reviewed the fabrication of biochar derived from sewage sludge which showed good performances in adsorbing antibiotics from water dong s group also prepared biochar from pyrolysis of sludge to activate percarbonate for removing persistent pollutants such as 4 nonylphenol polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phthalate esters from environmental matrices hung et al 2020 2021 2022 however the pyrolysis of ps and its products property are far less investigated in 2020 liu et al prepared biochar from ps for the adsorption of tetracycline liu et al 2020b recently wu et al reported that the levofloxacin adsorption capacity of zncl2 modified porous ps biochar could reach 159 26 mg g 1 wu et al 2022a 2022b however the ps pyrolyzed biochar psbc has never been used as environmental catalysts although this strategy can expand the scope and market of psbc and benefit the resource cycling from ps the use of psbc as catalysts is highly feasible because ps is rich in carbon nitrogen other heteroatoms and metals due to the abundance of nitrogen containing ingredients in pharmaceutical industries amino acids cyanides aromatic amines and nitrogen heterocycles and the coagulants used during wastewater treatment table s1 liu et al 2020b these abundant heteroatoms and metals remained in the psbc may probably serve as active sites of catalytic reactions moreover the plentiful organic n species may coordinate with metals like fe to form the fe n doped carbon matrix fe n c structures zhou et al 2020 which have been reported to exhibit remarkable catalytic activities arisen from their unique heme like fenx active moieties e g to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the oxidative removal of environmental pollutants xiong et al 2022 nevertheless the structure activity relationship of such biochar as psbc to catalyze pms decomposition is not elucidated yet regarding the structures of active sites and the production of reactive species herein we investigated the ability of psbc prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures of 400 1000 c to activate pms for the removal of typical organic pollutants including 4 chlorophenol 4 cp benzoic acid ba nitrobenzene nb p hydroxyl benzoic acid p hba bisphenol a bpa chlorophenols are a group of priority pollutants regulated by usepa regarding their poor biodegradability bioaccumulation and high toxicity abe et al 1997 ghanbari et al 2022 4 cp were widely detected at ca 150 200 mg l in the wastewater of industries such as petrochemicals refineries insecticides and pesticides ghanbari et al 2022 human exposure to 4 cp may cause diseases such as diarrhea fatigue coma tremors cancer and dysfunction of internal organs swain et al 2021 adeola 2018 shu et al 2019 besides 4 cp is one of the most frequently tested substrates of aops therefore we adopted 4 cp as the model pollutant to evaluate the performance of psbc pms reactions and to facilitate the comparison with other reports the influences of pyrolysis temperature on the catalytic performances of psbc and their active sites were carefully checked meanwhile the pms activation mechanism and the evolution of reactive species are also clarified aiming to reveal the structure activity relationship of psbc for the rational design of catalysts to regulate the pms activation and reactive species production so as to meet the removal need of different contaminants at various water treatment scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents details of chemicals and reagents are provided in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 preparation of the psbc samples the raw sludge used in this study was collected from a pharmaceutical wwtp in shijiazhuang china wastewater was treated with biological units and coagulation techniques and the sludge in the settling tank was dewatered using a plate and frame filter press dried at 105 c for 48 h crushed and screened with an 80 mesh sieve then 1 g of the sample was annealed at 400 1000 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 in a tube furnace under n2 atmosphere for

characterization in this study are shown in text s2 of the supplementary materials 2 4 batch experiments the batch experiments of pollutants removal were conducted in conical flasks 100 ml at room temperature with a magnetic stir psbc was dispersed in 50 ml of 0 1 mmol l pollutant solution and stirred to reach the equilibrium of adsorption then pms was added to initiate the catalytic oxidation at regular time intervals aliquots of the solution were sampled filtrated and added with ethanol to quench the reaction 4 cp was chosen as a probe to evaluate and optimize the performance of psbc pms reactions and other pollutants including ba nb p hba and bpa were also tested concentrations of the organic compounds were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc with the details described in text s3 the durability of catalysts was evaluated by recycling the used catalysts through filtration and washed with deionized water and dried at 30 c in a vacuum oven for further use the concentrations of pms were quantified following the method reported previously liang et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of psbc for pms activation the xrd pattern analysis revealed the amorphous nature of raw ps figure s1a which mainly contained inorganic elements including fe 31 2 p 8 4 al 7 1 ca 6 1 si 1 4 and na 1 1 table s1 notably its n c ratio 19 1 was higher than those of previously reported sludge from other sources figure s1b table s2 zhou et al 2020 haroun et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 2014 panepinto et al 2016 due to the abundant n containing organics in ps as depicted in the ftir spectrum figure s1c the bands at 3400 nh oh 1645 amide i band nc o 1550 amide ii band nh and 1410 cm 1 nc h were assigned to the proteins from fermentation solution and extracellular polymeric substances of microorganisms hong et al 1995 zhu et al 2016 besides the bands at 2096 and 1453 cm 1 were ascribed to c n and n o groups respectively zhu et al 2016 moreover the high resolution n 1 s xps of ps figure s1d revealed the abundant pyrrolic n 400 2 ev 55 6 and fe n species 399 3 ev 23 9 which was probably the c4h5n n fe complexes arisen from the coordination of pyrrolic n with fe ions artyushkova et al 2015 li et al 2020 subsequently tg dtg analysis was used to investigate the pyrolysis process of ps figure s2 the mass loss was composed of three stages namely the water evaporation 30 200 c organics decomposition 200 600 c and inorganics decomposition 600 1000 c processes magdziarz and werle 2014 according to the literatures xu et al 2018 most hazardous organic compounds decomposed in the range of 200 400 c followed by the aromatization and condensation of macromolecular compounds at higher temperatures therefore pyrolysis temperatures of 400 600 800 and 1000 c were adopted to prepare psbc in the following experiments the resulting psbc samples were then used to activate pms for the removal of 4 cp pms alone could not effectively degrade 4 cp figure s3a we measured the ph profiles of the psbc pms systems and similar trends were observed for all the psbc samples with the ph rapidly decreased from 6 5 to ca 3 0 3 5 within 2 min figure s3b therefore we investigated the adsorption of 4 cp by different psbc samples at ph 6 5 and ph 3 0 respectively the adsorption quickly reached equilibrium within 2 min for all the psbc samples and the amounts of 4 cp adsorbed at ph 6 5 were slightly higher than those at ph 3 0 but were all less than 20 figure s3c and s3d after the addition of pms the 4 cp removal by psbc was significantly accelerated and the complete 4 cp removal could be achieved within 10 min except for the psbc 400 pms system fig 1 a interestingly the rate constants of 4 cp removal increased along with elevated pyrolysis temperatures to 1 70 min 1 at 1000 c fig 1b which represented a remarkable improvement when compared with many reported heterogeneous catalysts table s3 the specific surface area and pore structure of the psbc samples were analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption method figure s4 and the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area ssa of psbc 400 psbc 600 psbc 800 and psbc 1000 were 104 2 78 4 106 8 and 59 0 m2 g 1 respectively table s4 the ssa normalized rate constants of 4 cp removal in the pure water were 0 0001 0 0054 0 0070 and 0 0288 g min 1 m 2 for psbc 400 psbc 600 psbc 800 and psbc 1000 respectively those in the lake water normalized by ssa were 0 0001 0 0019 0 0023 0 0022 g min 1 m 2 respectively obviously these activities still followed the similar pyrolysis temperature dependent trends with those before ssa normalization moreover the pore volume reduced from 0 28 to 0 13 cm3 g 1 with the increase of pyrolysis temperature inconsistent with the change profile of catalytic activities besides the average pore diameter first decreased from 12 3 400 c to 6 5 nm 800 c and decreased thereafter to 10 6 nm 1000 c therefore we concluded that the pms catalytic performance of the psbc was not dominantly controlled by the ssa or the pore structure more importantly the psbc catalysts possessed good reusability e g psbc 800 and psbc 1000 maintained 4 cp removal efficiencies of over 90 after five consecutive cycles of degradation reaction figure s5 the impact of solution ph on the performance of psbc pms systems were also investigated as illustrated by figure s6 the psbc 400 pms system showed poor 4 cp removal efficiencies at the ph range of 6 5 11 0 but its performance improved at lower ph with ca 50 4 cp removed at ph 3 0 other psbc pyrolyzed at higher temperatures showed good 4 cp degrading efficiencies across the wide ph range of 3 0 11 0 with slight decrease of reaction rate at higher ph these results revealed that psbc was a promising pms catalyst for organic pollutants removal to further evaluate the potential of psbc pms for environmental applications the impacts of common water constituents such as cl hco3 no3 and humic acid were checked figure s7 surprisingly 10 mmol l 1 cl hco3 and no3 significantly promoted the 4 cp removal by the psbc 600 pms but the enhancing effect attenuated along with the rising pyrolysis temperatures and no3 even inhibited the 4 cp removal in the psbc 1000 pms and psbc 800 pms reactions these results were inconsistent with previous reports which indicated the obvious inhibition effects of anions by scavenging the common so4 and oh to generate less reactive radicals such as cl co3 and no3 cao et al 2019 wu et al 2022b thus may suggest the presence of other reactive species in the psbc pms systems interestingly humic acid ha 10 mg l inhibited the degradation of 4 cp more significantly in the psbc 1000 pms than in the cases of psbc 800 pms and psbc 600 pms similar trends were further observed for the 4 cp removal experiments in an environmental water sample collected from a local lake with the dissolved total organic carbon toc concentration of 40 3 mg l table s5 in lake water matrices the rate constants of 4 cp degradation followed the order of psbc 800 0 25 min 1 psbc 600 0 15 min 1 psbc 1000 0 13 min 1 suggesting that the reactive species in the psbc 1000 pms might be less selective than those in the psbc 800 pms and psbc 600 pms fig 1c and 1d besides the degradation of 4 cp its mineralization also supported the different selectivity of these psbc pms systems i e their toc removal efficiencies increased along with the raised pyrolysis temperature in the stimulated waste water whereas increased first and then fell off in the lake water matrix figure s8 subsequently the performance of psbc pms for the oxidative removal of other aromatic pollutants including ba nb p hba and bpa were also evaluated as shown in figure s9a psbc 400 pms failed to degrade these pollutants psbc 600 pms could hardly remove ba and nb but preferred to degrade p hba and bpa figure s9b suggesting that its selective oxidation was greatly dependent on the ionization potential ip of the pollutants table s6 phenolic compounds 4 cp p hba and bpa with the electron donating hydroxyl group had lower ip and could be oxidized by various reactive species like so4 oh 1o2 and high valent metal oxo species whereas ba and nb with electron withdrawing carboxyl and nitro groups had higher ip and were only oxidized by strongly oxidizing species like so4 and oh li et al 2018 impressively all these pollutants could be non selectively degraded by psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms figure s9c d the above results suggested that the reactive species in the psbc pms systems might depend on the pyrolysis temperatures of psbc which were further investigated in the following experiments with using 4 cp as the target pollutant because its reactions with reactive species were well documented tian et al 2022 3 2 pyrolysis temperature dependent reactive species in psbc pms it is widely accepted that reactive species produced by pms activation include radicals such as so4 and oh and non radical species such as 1o2 and feivo2 lee et al 2020 liu et al 2021b gao et al 2020 wacławek et al 2017 while carbonaceous materials might also initiate the direct electron transfer det from organic pollutants to pms miao et al 2020 ren et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 to figure out the reactive species and mechanism responsible for 4 cp degradation in the psbc pms systems we first investigated the possible det mechanism by the electrochemical open circuit potential ocp tests text s4 gao et al 2020 with the successive addition of pms and 4 cp the ocp of the psbc coated glassy carbon electrodes showed similar trends to that of the uncoated glassy carbon control figure s10 ruling out the det mechanism we also constructed the galvanic oxidation process gop systems to verify the det mechanism 4 cp reductant and pms oxidant were added in separate cells and connected with the salt bridge glassy carbon electrode was coated with the tested psbc samples placed in the two cells and connected to the galvanometer no significant current was observed for psbc 600 800 or 1000 figure s11 meanwhile the concentrations of pms and 4 cp in the cells were detected and no change was found these results confirmed there was no det mechanism in the psbc pms reaction systems we thus carried out reactive species scavenging experiments to clarify the pms activation mechanism according to the second order rate constants k between scavengers and reactive species table s7 ethanol etoh was used to scavenge so4 oh dimethylsulfoxide dmso was used to quench so4 oh and feivo2 and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp was responsible for the trapping of 1o2 as shown in fig 2 a etoh suppressed 11 16 9 and 55 9 of 4 cp removal in psbc 600 pms psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms respectively suggesting that both radical and non radical species existed and the contribution of radicals increased along with the raised pyrolysis temperatures the contribution of 1o2 was ruled out because temp failed to inhibit the 4 cp degradation dmso led to over 70 of 4 cp degrading inhibition and the differences between dmso and etoh inhibition ratios may represented the contribution of feivo2 which decreased from 74 1 to 24 9 along with the increase of pyrolysis temperatures however we found that dmso could accelerate the decomposition of pms in the psbc pms systems figure s12 indicating the direct reaction between dmso and pms therefore the scavenging effects of dmso may partly stem from its competitive consumption of pms and cannot be completely attributed to the contribution of feivo2 to verify the role of feivo2 we performed epr tests using dmpo as the spin trapping agent as shown in fig 2b all the psbc pms systems produced the seven line peaks 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 assigned to 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidone 2 oxyl dmpox an 7 2 g ah r 4 1 g which might stem from the excessive oxidation of dmpo by so4 oh or the direct non radical oxidation of dmpo floyd and soong 1977 liu et al 2020a 2021a to determine the origin of dmpox we detected epr signals in the presence of etoh and dmso respectively etoh did not weaken the intensities of dmpox figure s13 but dmso caused the remarkable decay of the dmpox signals fig 2c suggesting that the dmpox was produced by the non radical feivo2 oxidation thus demonstrating the generation of feivo2 by psbc pms systems notably the addition of dmso to psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms resulted in the appearance of quadruple peaks of dmpooh adducts an ah 14 9 g dmpo so4 signals were not observed possibly due to its hydrolysis to dmpooh fagan et al 2022 wei et al 2017 these results demonstrated the production of oh or so4 radicals in the psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms systems methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was further used to quantify the feivo2 pmso can be oxidized by feivo2 to sulfone pmso2 through oxygen transfer reaction whereas to biphenyl and hydroxylated products by so4 and oh oxidation similar with dmso pmso could react with pms alone to produce pmso2 zong et al 2020 but the reaction was rather slow with less than 0 1 mol l pmso oxidized and ca 8 8 pms decomposed within 10 min figure s14a the psbc pms systems oxidized pmso to pmso2 more significantly figure s14b s14d the pmso oxidation and pmso2 production in the psbc pms systems were subtracted with those in the pmso pms counterpart and shown in fig 2d the pmso2 yield η pmso2 δpmso2 δpmso of 95 6 in psbc 600 pms indicated the dominant role of feivo2 the η pmso2 decreased to 87 6 in psbc 800 pms and to 60 1 in psbc 1000 pms respectively suggesting the drop of feivo2 and the rise of so4 oh radicals benzoic acid ba reacted readily with so4 oh but not feivo2 as expected ba inhibited the pmso oxidation but not the pmso2 production figure s15 resulting in the significantly increased η pmso2 in psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms fig 2e confirming their generation of so4 oh the accumulative generation of reactive species was also quantified text s5 with 0 17 0 23 0 12 mmol l of feivo2 and 0 009 0 038 0 102 mmol l of so4 oh radicals produced within 10 min by psbc 600 pms psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms respectively fig 2f these results clearly showed that the major active species in the psbc pms reactions gradually shift from feivo2 to so4 oh along with the raised pyrolysis temperature these results also help explain the different impact of anions on 4 cp removal figure s7 chloride may interact with pms to produce hclo eq 1 which probably contribute to the 4 cp degradation cao et al 2019 feng et al 2021 bicarbonate also reacted with pms to produce hco4 eq 2 moreover it was reported that could coordinate with high valent iron species improve its stability and prevent the self decay luo et al 2019 these may promote the 4 cp removal by psbc pms especially at lower pyrolysis temperature when high valent iron species were dominant however cl hco3 and no3 also scavenged so4 oh radicals eqs 3 8 thus their positive effects on 4 cp removal attenuated with the increasingly dominance of so4 oh radicals at higher pyrolysis temperatures 1 cl hso5 h hclo h cl so4 2 2 hco3 hso5 hco4 hso4 3 cl so4 so4 2 cl 4 cl oh cloh 5 hco3 2 so4 so4 2 hco3 6 hco3 2 oh oh hco3 7 no3 so4 so4 2 no3 8 no3 oh oh no3 subsequently we measured the degraded products of 4 cp by gc ms and lc ms ms after 5 min of reaction abundant quinone and hydroxylated compounds were found in the psbc 600 pms system figure s16a whereas the major byproducts were small molecular acids such as propionic acid and acetic acid in the psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms systems figure s16b consistent with the generation of more so4 oh radicals of higher oxidizing capacity in the psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms systems the degradation pathways of 4 cp in the psbc pms systems were thus proposed figure s16c these results confirmed that pyrolysis temperatures of psbc determined the pms activation mechanism and the generated reactive species of pyrolyzed products 3 3 identification of active sites the different reactive species profiles of psbc pms indicated the pyrolysis at different temperatures produced psbc with various active sites for pms activation therefore we carefully characterized the psbc samples to identify their active sites the xrd results revealed the amorphous structure of psbc 400 but graphitic carbon and al2o3 appeared in psbc 600 fe3o4 feal2o4 ca po3 2 and fe n composites fe2 4 n and fen0 095 were also detected in psbc 800 and psbc 1000 fig 3 a the existence of fe n species was confirmed by ftir and xps the ftir absorption bands at 490 and 929 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of fe n and fe n fe respectively sahin et al 2020 in contrast the organic n groups absorption bands 1650 1350 cm 1 in psbc 400 and psbc 600 obviously weakened and disappeared with increased pyrolysis temperatures suggesting their decomposition or conversion during pyrolysis fig 3b n 1 s xps also demonstrated that the pyrrole n 400 3 ev in the raw ps was converted into other n species such as pyridinic n 398 5 ev graphite n 401 4 ev and fe n 399 3 ev during the pyrolysis more importantly the loss of pyrrole n and the generation of other n species were pyrolysis temperature dependent fig 3c and figure s17 fe 2p xps confirmed the presence of fe oxides 711 4 713 2 ev and fe n species 709 8 ev on the surface of all the psbc samples and the fe n species gradually increased with the enhanced pyrolysis temperatures in accordance with the n 1 s xps notably a new peak at 705 9 ev emerged in psbc 1000 which was originated from the fe fe bonds of the fexn species fig 3d the above characterization results displayed that various c n and fe species coexisted in the psbc catalysts and all the species might be responsible for the pms activation according to previous reports huang et al 2022 liang et al 2021 miao et al 2020 xiong et al 2022 c species like graphitic and n doped carbon mainly mediated the det mechanism which was already ruled out in the psbc pms systems besides elemental analysis revealed the gradual decrease of c contents in psbc along with the increased pyrolysis temperatures table s8 moreover c 1 s xps analysis indicated that the contents of c species in psbc including the aromatic sp2 c c 284 6 ev aliphatic sp3 cc 285 2 ev cn co 286 3 ev c n c o 288 4 ev and oc o 290 5 ev did not follow the same pyrolysis temperature dependent patterns with the catalytic performances figure s18 and table s9 thus the c species were not likely the major active sites of pms activation interestingly the strong fe chelating reagent kscn completely deactivated all the psbc catalysts suggesting the predominant role of fe species in the pms activation figure s19 meanwhile the release of dissolved fe2 by the psbc pms was tiny with the maximum concentration of 4 3 μmol l after 10 min the homogeneous control experiment of fe2 pms with 4 3 μmol l fe2 could not significantly remove 4 cp figure s20 indicating that the solid phase fe species were major pms active sites 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy was further employed to collect detailed information on fe species in psbc pyrolyzed at different temperatures fig 4 a the fitting parameters and the assignment of fitted signals were summarized in table s10 the iron species basically included fe oxides fenx and fexn compounds x 1 corresponding to group 1 signals d1 d2 and d3 dyar et al 2014 jastrzębska et al 2015 group 2 signals d4 and d5 kramm et al 2014 and group 3 signals d6 sext1 and sext2 kramm 2013 kramm et al 2019 notably fenx usually formed atomically dispersed fenx c moieties whereas fexn mainly referred to iron nitride aggregates the areas of different spectra groups were integrated and used to calculate the proportions of different fe species fig 4b with the increase of pyrolysis temperatures the iron oxides species decreased while the fenx species increased to 48 5 at 800 c and decreased significantly to 20 9 at 1000 c and the fexn species increased constantly from 0 at 400 c to 41 6 at 1000 c to clarify the exact active sites for non radical and radical pms catalysis the relationship between fe species and reactive species in psbc pms reactions was assessed with pearson analysis in fig 4c the colors of the cells indicated the correlation coefficients 1 r 1 and the labeled numbers in the cells were p values the feivo2 generation was positively correlated with fenx d4 which was assigned to fen4 embedded in carbon fe n c feivo2 was not correlated with d5 the 5 fold coordinated fe sites i e fenx with x 4 possibly due to the steric repulsion of axial n ligand that hindered the adsorption of pms li et al 2021 on the contrary the generation of so4 oh was positively correlated with feal2o4 d3 and fexn sext1 sext2 with the pearson correlation coefficients of 0 88 0 80 and 0 94 however the generation of so4 oh was very minor by psbc 400 and psbc 600 although they contained high contents of feal2o4 ruling out its role in the radical activation of pms obviously these results reflected that fen4 and fexn were the key catalytic centers in psbc for the pms activation to produce non radical feivo2 as well as so4 and oh radicals respectively dft calculations were thus carried out to understand the catalytic mechanism of the fen4 and fexn active sites text s6 based on the characterization results we selected two possible structures as the representatives of fen4 and fexn sites namely the pyrrolic n coordinated fe embedded in carbon fen4 c atomically dispersed fe site and the fe3n carbon composite fe3n c agglomerate fe site respectively fig 5 a the charge density distributions revealed that fe atoms were the electron rich centers in both fen4 c and fe3n c sites figure s21 suggesting that fe sites could donate electrons and act as the catalytic centers for the pms activation which was demonstrated by the difference charge density results between the two fe sites and pms figure s22 the energy of adsorption and reaction transition states of pms on psbc were calculated to demonstrate the feasibility of pms activation by the catalytic sites of psbc strong adsorption between pms and the fen4 c site was revealed with the adsorption energy of 5 82 ev adsorbed pms dissociation on the fen4 c site to generate feivo2 was thermodynamically spontaneous e 0 92 ev with an activation barrier ebar of 1 17 ev fig 5b it was reported that ebar above 0 91 ev generally made the non radical mechanism of pms activation preferable jing et al 2022 consistent with the fact that heme like n coordinated metal sites tend to produce high valent metal oxo intermediates in aops xiong et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 on the contrary pms could be adsorbed on the fe3n c sites with energy of 1 21 ev and spontaneously dissociated to so4 oh e 0 66 ev through a barrierless pathway fig 5c which was well supported by the report that transition metal nitrides exhibited excellent fenton like catalytic activity to produce reactive radicals due to the strong electron transfer ability li et al 2016 based on the above results we could clarify the structure activity relationship sar of psbc for pms activation as follows the fen4 and fexn sites were responsible for the production of feivo2 and so4 oh respectively at pyrolysis temperature of 400 c the amounts of fe n active sites fen4 and fexn on psbc 400 were very limited resulting in its poor pms catalytic performance higher pyrolysis temperature produced more fe n sites to activate pms to be specific psbc 600 mainly contained fen4 and activated pms to feivo2 dominantly for the non radical oxidation of pollutants with the further increase of pyrolysis temperatures the fen4 sites gradually shifted to fexn and thus both feivo2 and radicals so4 oh were produced we believe that pharmaceutical sludge s pyrolysis temperature dependent active sites and reactive species of pms activation may find wide applications in pollutant control and environmental remediation limitations of this study and future perspectives mainly include 1 only one type of pharmaceutical sludge was tested in the present study and ps from different sources and with varied constituents are recommended to be studied to further confirm our conclusions 2 the psbc pms systems shall be evaluated for their performance to remove more water pollutants such as antibiotics persistent organic pollutants personal care products etc especially in real wastewater treatment scenarios 3 the fabrication of psbc deserves up scaling with the cost and benefit of psbc carefully evaluated 4 the potential toxicity of psbc toward the aqueous ecosystem and human must be assessed in the future to assure the safety of application 4 conclusions herein we demonstrated that 1 pharmaceutical sludge ps with abundant iron and nitrogen constituents could be pyrolyzed into functional biochar psbc to efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate pms for rapid pollutants degradation 2 the active sites of psbc for pms activation included the fenx and fexn species which decomposed pms to high valent iron feivo2 and so4 oh respectively 3 pyrolysis temperatures could facilely modulate the active sites of psbc and the resulting reactive species i e lower temperature 600 c favored the formation of fenx and feivo2 whereas higher temperatures 800 1000 c facilitated fexn and so4 oh radicals compared with previous methods to fabricate fenx and fexn catalysts from the topotactic pyrolysis of metal organic frameworks this study provides a cost effective method more importantly the easy regulated active sites and reactive species can match the removal requirements of different contaminants at various water treatment scenarios and may greatly broaden the market of psbc in polluted water and soil remediation etc therefore psbc offers a promising high value added resource recycling product of ps and may promote the sustainability of pharmaceutical

15288,pyrolysis of pharmaceutical sludge ps is a promising way of safe disposal and to recover energy and resources from waste the resulting ps biochar psbc is often used as adsorbent but has seldom been explored as catalyst herein we demonstrate that psbc 0 4 g l could efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate pms to 100 degrade 4 chlorophenol 4 cp with rate constants of 0 42 1 70 min 1 outperforming other reported catalysts interestingly the pms activation pathway highly depended on psbc pyrolysis temperature which produced dominantly high valent iron species e g feivo2 at low temperature but more sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical oh at higher temperature e g 0 17 0 23 0 12 mmol l of feivo2 and 0 009 0 038 0 102 mmol l of so4 oh were produced within 10 min by psbc 600 pms psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms respectively characterization density functional theory dft simulation and pearson correlation analysis revealed that along with the increase of pyrolysis temperatures the active sites of psbc gradually shifted from atomically dispersed n coordinated fe moieties fenx to iron nitrides fexn which activated pms to produce feivo2 and so4 oh respectively this study clarifies the structure activity relationships of psbc for pms activation and opens a new avenue for the treatment and utilization of ps as high value added resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceutical sludge pyrolysis biochar peroxymonosulfate reactive species organic pollutants degradation 1 introduction the treatment of wastewater from pharmaceutical industries by biological units and coagulation techniques has produced millions tons of pharmaceutical sludge ps per year hou et al 2016 which contains various harmful substances such as pathogens heavy metals and antibiotics residues thus the safe disposal of ps is obligatory to minimize its environmental risk martin et al 2012 liu et al 2012 wei et al 2018 conventional sludge disposal routes such as landfill and soil utilization are inadequate due to their potential adverse impacts on the soil or groundwater and the spreading of antimicrobial resistance caused by antibiotics residues in ps bengtsson palme et al 2019 therefore alternative disposal techniques are urgently desirable to meet the increasingly stringent environmental regulations more importantly it is of great significance to recover energy and resources from sludge amid the context of sustainability and carbon neutrality chen et al 2018 silva thomsen et al 2020 incineration of sludge for instance could recover renewable energy reduce the sludge volume and destruct organic pollutants simultaneously manara and zabaniotou 2012 nonetheless the ash residue and secondary pollutants such as dioxins generated during incineration restrain its wide application samolada and zabaniotou 2014 pyrolysis of sludge under an inert atmosphere is more promising because of the following merits 1 pyrolysis can remove hazardous substances effectively 2 pyrolysis is a zero waste technique since it produces bio gas and bio oil as the potential fuel with the remaining biochar as adsorbents or catalysts 3 pyrolysis might recover energy and resources without carbon emission 4 the estimated life cycle cost of pyrolysis 291 1000 kg dry sludge is more attractive than that 54 1000 kg of incineration chanaka udayanga et al 2019 devi and saroha 2017 tarpani and azapagic 2018 the pyrolysis of sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp paper mills and electroplating industries etc were extensively studied tang et al 2019 yoon et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 for instance ihsanullah et al 2022 reviewed the fabrication of biochar derived from sewage sludge which showed good performances in adsorbing antibiotics from water dong s group also prepared biochar from pyrolysis of sludge to activate percarbonate for removing persistent pollutants such as 4 nonylphenol polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phthalate esters from environmental matrices hung et al 2020 2021 2022 however the pyrolysis of ps and its products property are far less investigated in 2020 liu et al prepared biochar from ps for the adsorption of tetracycline liu et al 2020b recently wu et al reported that the levofloxacin adsorption capacity of zncl2 modified porous ps biochar could reach 159 26 mg g 1 wu et al 2022a 2022b however the ps pyrolyzed biochar psbc has never been used as environmental catalysts although this strategy can expand the scope and market of psbc and benefit the resource cycling from ps the use of psbc as catalysts is highly feasible because ps is rich in carbon nitrogen other heteroatoms and metals due to the abundance of nitrogen containing ingredients in pharmaceutical industries amino acids cyanides aromatic amines and nitrogen heterocycles and the coagulants used during wastewater treatment table s1 liu et al 2020b these abundant heteroatoms and metals remained in the psbc may probably serve as active sites of catalytic reactions moreover the plentiful organic n species may coordinate with metals like fe to form the fe n doped carbon matrix fe n c structures zhou et al 2020 which have been reported to exhibit remarkable catalytic activities arisen from their unique heme like fenx active moieties e g to activate peroxymonosulfate pms for the oxidative removal of environmental pollutants xiong et al 2022 nevertheless the structure activity relationship of such biochar as psbc to catalyze pms decomposition is not elucidated yet regarding the structures of active sites and the production of reactive species herein we investigated the ability of psbc prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures of 400 1000 c to activate pms for the removal of typical organic pollutants including 4 chlorophenol 4 cp benzoic acid ba nitrobenzene nb p hydroxyl benzoic acid p hba bisphenol a bpa chlorophenols are a group of priority pollutants regulated by usepa regarding their poor biodegradability bioaccumulation and high toxicity abe et al 1997 ghanbari et al 2022 4 cp were widely detected at ca 150 200 mg l in the wastewater of industries such as petrochemicals refineries insecticides and pesticides ghanbari et al 2022 human exposure to 4 cp may cause diseases such as diarrhea fatigue coma tremors cancer and dysfunction of internal organs swain et al 2021 adeola 2018 shu et al 2019 besides 4 cp is one of the most frequently tested substrates of aops therefore we adopted 4 cp as the model pollutant to evaluate the performance of psbc pms reactions and to facilitate the comparison with other reports the influences of pyrolysis temperature on the catalytic performances of psbc and their active sites were carefully checked meanwhile the pms activation mechanism and the evolution of reactive species are also clarified aiming to reveal the structure activity relationship of psbc for the rational design of catalysts to regulate the pms activation and reactive species production so as to meet the removal need of different contaminants at various water treatment scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents details of chemicals and reagents are provided in text s1 of the supporting information 2 2 preparation of the psbc samples the raw sludge used in this study was collected from a pharmaceutical wwtp in shijiazhuang china wastewater was treated with biological units and coagulation techniques and the sludge in the settling tank was dewatered using a plate and frame filter press dried at 105 c for 48 h crushed and screened with an 80 mesh sieve then 1 g of the sample was annealed at 400 1000 c with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 in a tube furnace under n2 atmosphere for 60 min and the obtained biochar was denoted as psbc t t represented the temperature of pyrolysis c including psbc 400 psbc 600 psbc 800 and psbc 1000 2 3 materials characterization the methods of characterization in this study are shown in text s2 of the supplementary materials 2 4 batch experiments the batch experiments of pollutants removal were conducted in conical flasks 100 ml at room temperature with a magnetic stir psbc was dispersed in 50 ml of 0 1 mmol l pollutant solution and stirred to reach the equilibrium of adsorption then pms was added to initiate the catalytic oxidation at regular time intervals aliquots of the solution were sampled filtrated and added with ethanol to quench the reaction 4 cp was chosen as a probe to evaluate and optimize the performance of psbc pms reactions and other pollutants including ba nb p hba and bpa were also tested concentrations of the organic compounds were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc with the details described in text s3 the durability of catalysts was evaluated by recycling the used catalysts through filtration and washed with deionized water and dried at 30 c in a vacuum oven for further use the concentrations of pms were quantified following the method reported previously liang et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of psbc for pms activation the xrd pattern analysis revealed the amorphous nature of raw ps figure s1a which mainly contained inorganic elements including fe 31 2 p 8 4 al 7 1 ca 6 1 si 1 4 and na 1 1 table s1 notably its n c ratio 19 1 was higher than those of previously reported sludge from other sources figure s1b table s2 zhou et al 2020 haroun et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 2014 panepinto et al 2016 due to the abundant n containing organics in ps as depicted in the ftir spectrum figure s1c the bands at 3400 nh oh 1645 amide i band nc o 1550 amide ii band nh and 1410 cm 1 nc h were assigned to the proteins from fermentation solution and extracellular polymeric substances of microorganisms hong et al 1995 zhu et al 2016 besides the bands at 2096 and 1453 cm 1 were ascribed to c n and n o groups respectively zhu et al 2016 moreover the high resolution n 1 s xps of ps figure s1d revealed the abundant pyrrolic n 400 2 ev 55 6 and fe n species 399 3 ev 23 9 which was probably the c4h5n n fe complexes arisen from the coordination of pyrrolic n with fe ions artyushkova et al 2015 li et al 2020 subsequently tg dtg analysis was used to investigate the pyrolysis process of ps figure s2 the mass loss was composed of three stages namely the water evaporation 30 200 c organics decomposition 200 600 c and inorganics decomposition 600 1000 c processes magdziarz and werle 2014 according to the literatures xu et al 2018 most hazardous organic compounds decomposed in the range of 200 400 c followed by the aromatization and condensation of macromolecular compounds at higher temperatures therefore pyrolysis temperatures of 400 600 800 and 1000 c were adopted to prepare psbc in the following experiments the resulting psbc samples were then used to activate pms for the removal of 4 cp pms alone could not effectively degrade 4 cp figure s3a we measured the ph profiles of the psbc pms systems and similar trends were observed for all the psbc samples with the ph rapidly decreased from 6 5 to ca 3 0 3 5 within 2 min figure s3b therefore we investigated the adsorption of 4 cp by different psbc samples at ph 6 5 and ph 3 0 respectively the adsorption quickly reached equilibrium within 2 min for all the psbc samples and the amounts of 4 cp adsorbed at ph 6 5 were slightly higher than those at ph 3 0 but were all less than 20 figure s3c and s3d after the addition of pms the 4 cp removal by psbc was significantly accelerated and the complete 4 cp removal could be achieved within 10 min except for the psbc 400 pms system fig 1 a interestingly the rate constants of 4 cp removal increased along with elevated pyrolysis temperatures to 1 70 min 1 at 1000 c fig 1b which represented a remarkable improvement when compared with many reported heterogeneous catalysts table s3 the specific surface area and pore structure of the psbc samples were analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption method figure s4 and the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area ssa of psbc 400 psbc 600 psbc 800 and psbc 1000 were 104 2 78 4 106 8 and 59 0 m2 g 1 respectively table s4 the ssa normalized rate constants of 4 cp removal in the pure water were 0 0001 0 0054 0 0070 and 0 0288 g min 1 m 2 for psbc 400 psbc 600 psbc 800 and psbc 1000 respectively those in the lake water normalized by ssa were 0 0001 0 0019 0 0023 0 0022 g min 1 m 2 respectively obviously these activities still followed the similar pyrolysis temperature dependent trends with those before ssa normalization moreover the pore volume reduced from 0 28 to 0 13 cm3 g 1 with the increase of pyrolysis temperature inconsistent with the change profile of catalytic activities besides the average pore diameter first decreased from 12 3 400 c to 6 5 nm 800 c and decreased thereafter to 10 6 nm 1000 c therefore we concluded that the pms catalytic performance of the psbc was not dominantly controlled by the ssa or the pore structure more importantly the psbc catalysts possessed good reusability e g psbc 800 and psbc 1000 maintained 4 cp removal efficiencies of over 90 after five consecutive cycles of degradation reaction figure s5 the impact of solution ph on the performance of psbc pms systems were also investigated as illustrated by figure s6 the psbc 400 pms system showed poor 4 cp removal efficiencies at the ph range of 6 5 11 0 but its performance improved at lower ph with ca 50 4 cp removed at ph 3 0 other psbc pyrolyzed at higher temperatures showed good 4 cp degrading efficiencies across the wide ph range of 3 0 11 0 with slight decrease of reaction rate at higher ph these results revealed that psbc was a promising pms catalyst for organic pollutants removal to further evaluate the potential of psbc pms for environmental applications the impacts of common water constituents such as cl hco3 no3 and humic acid were checked figure s7 surprisingly 10 mmol l 1 cl hco3 and no3 significantly promoted the 4 cp removal by the psbc 600 pms but the enhancing effect attenuated along with the rising pyrolysis temperatures and no3 even inhibited the 4 cp removal in the psbc 1000 pms and psbc 800 pms reactions these results were inconsistent with previous reports which indicated the obvious inhibition effects of anions by scavenging the common so4 and oh to generate less reactive radicals such as cl co3 and no3 cao et al 2019 wu et al 2022b thus may suggest the presence of other reactive species in the psbc pms systems interestingly humic acid ha 10 mg l inhibited the degradation of 4 cp more significantly in the psbc 1000 pms than in the cases of psbc 800 pms and psbc 600 pms similar trends were further observed for the 4 cp removal experiments in an environmental water sample collected from a local lake with the dissolved total organic carbon toc concentration of 40 3 mg l table s5 in lake water matrices the rate constants of 4 cp degradation followed the order of psbc 800 0 25 min 1 psbc 600 0 15 min 1 psbc 1000 0 13 min 1 suggesting that the reactive species in the psbc 1000 pms might be less selective than those in the psbc 800 pms and psbc 600 pms fig 1c and 1d besides the degradation of 4 cp its mineralization also supported the different selectivity of these psbc pms systems i e their toc removal efficiencies increased along with the raised pyrolysis temperature in the stimulated waste water whereas increased first and then fell off in the lake water matrix figure s8 subsequently the performance of psbc pms for the oxidative removal of other aromatic pollutants including ba nb p hba and bpa were also evaluated as shown in figure s9a psbc 400 pms failed to degrade these pollutants psbc 600 pms could hardly remove ba and nb but preferred to degrade p hba and bpa figure s9b suggesting that its selective oxidation was greatly dependent on the ionization potential ip of the pollutants table s6 phenolic compounds 4 cp p hba and bpa with the electron donating hydroxyl group had lower ip and could be oxidized by various reactive species like so4 oh 1o2 and high valent metal oxo species whereas ba and nb with electron withdrawing carboxyl and nitro groups had higher ip and were only oxidized by strongly oxidizing species like so4 and oh li et al 2018 impressively all these pollutants could be non selectively degraded by psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms figure s9c d the above results suggested that the reactive species in the psbc pms systems might depend on the pyrolysis temperatures of psbc which were further investigated in the following experiments with using 4 cp as the target pollutant because its reactions with reactive species were well documented tian et al 2022 3 2 pyrolysis temperature dependent reactive species in psbc pms it is widely accepted that reactive species produced by pms activation include radicals such as so4 and oh and non radical species such as 1o2 and feivo2 lee et al 2020 liu et al 2021b gao et al 2020 wacławek et al 2017 while carbonaceous materials might also initiate the direct electron transfer det from organic pollutants to pms miao et al 2020 ren et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 to figure out the reactive species and mechanism responsible for 4 cp degradation in the psbc pms systems we first investigated the possible det mechanism by the electrochemical open circuit potential ocp tests text s4 gao et al 2020 with the successive addition of pms and 4 cp the ocp of the psbc coated glassy carbon electrodes showed similar trends to that of the uncoated glassy carbon control figure s10 ruling out the det mechanism we also constructed the galvanic oxidation process gop systems to verify the det mechanism 4 cp reductant and pms oxidant were added in separate cells and connected with the salt bridge glassy carbon electrode was coated with the tested psbc samples placed in the two cells and connected to the galvanometer no significant current was observed for psbc 600 800 or 1000 figure s11 meanwhile the concentrations of pms and 4 cp in the cells were detected and no change was found these results confirmed there was no det mechanism in the psbc pms reaction systems we thus carried out reactive species scavenging experiments to clarify the pms activation mechanism according to the second order rate constants k between scavengers and reactive species table s7 ethanol etoh was used to scavenge so4 oh dimethylsulfoxide dmso was used to quench so4 oh and feivo2 and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp was responsible for the trapping of 1o2 as shown in fig 2 a etoh suppressed 11 16 9 and 55 9 of 4 cp removal in psbc 600 pms psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms respectively suggesting that both radical and non radical species existed and the contribution of radicals increased along with the raised pyrolysis temperatures the contribution of 1o2 was ruled out because temp failed to inhibit the 4 cp degradation dmso led to over 70 of 4 cp degrading inhibition and the differences between dmso and etoh inhibition ratios may represented the contribution of feivo2 which decreased from 74 1 to 24 9 along with the increase of pyrolysis temperatures however we found that dmso could accelerate the decomposition of pms in the psbc pms systems figure s12 indicating the direct reaction between dmso and pms therefore the scavenging effects of dmso may partly stem from its competitive consumption of pms and cannot be completely attributed to the contribution of feivo2 to verify the role of feivo2 we performed epr tests using dmpo as the spin trapping agent as shown in fig 2b all the psbc pms systems produced the seven line peaks 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 assigned to 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidone 2 oxyl dmpox an 7 2 g ah r 4 1 g which might stem from the excessive oxidation of dmpo by so4 oh or the direct non radical oxidation of dmpo floyd and soong 1977 liu et al 2020a 2021a to determine the origin of dmpox we detected epr signals in the presence of etoh and dmso respectively etoh did not weaken the intensities of dmpox figure s13 but dmso caused the remarkable decay of the dmpox signals fig 2c suggesting that the dmpox was produced by the non radical feivo2 oxidation thus demonstrating the generation of feivo2 by psbc pms systems notably the addition of dmso to psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms resulted in the appearance of quadruple peaks of dmpooh adducts an ah 14 9 g dmpo so4 signals were not observed possibly due to its hydrolysis to dmpooh fagan et al 2022 wei et al 2017 these results demonstrated the production of oh or so4 radicals in the psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms systems methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was further used to quantify the feivo2 pmso can be oxidized by feivo2 to sulfone pmso2 through oxygen transfer reaction whereas to biphenyl and hydroxylated products by so4 and oh oxidation similar with dmso pmso could react with pms alone to produce pmso2 zong et al 2020 but the reaction was rather slow with less than 0 1 mol l pmso oxidized and ca 8 8 pms decomposed within 10 min figure s14a the psbc pms systems oxidized pmso to pmso2 more significantly figure s14b s14d the pmso oxidation and pmso2 production in the psbc pms systems were subtracted with those in the pmso pms counterpart and shown in fig 2d the pmso2 yield η pmso2 δpmso2 δpmso of 95 6 in psbc 600 pms indicated the dominant role of feivo2 the η pmso2 decreased to 87 6 in psbc 800 pms and to 60 1 in psbc 1000 pms respectively suggesting the drop of feivo2 and the rise of so4 oh radicals benzoic acid ba reacted readily with so4 oh but not feivo2 as expected ba inhibited the pmso oxidation but not the pmso2 production figure s15 resulting in the significantly increased η pmso2 in psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms fig 2e confirming their generation of so4 oh the accumulative generation of reactive species was also quantified text s5 with 0 17 0 23 0 12 mmol l of feivo2 and 0 009 0 038 0 102 mmol l of so4 oh radicals produced within 10 min by psbc 600 pms psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms respectively fig 2f these results clearly showed that the major active species in the psbc pms reactions gradually shift from feivo2 to so4 oh along with the raised pyrolysis temperature these results also help explain the different impact of anions on 4 cp removal figure s7 chloride may interact with pms to produce hclo eq 1 which probably contribute to the 4 cp degradation cao et al 2019 feng et al 2021 bicarbonate also reacted with pms to produce hco4 eq 2 moreover it was reported that could coordinate with high valent iron species improve its stability and prevent the self decay luo et al 2019 these may promote the 4 cp removal by psbc pms especially at lower pyrolysis temperature when high valent iron species were dominant however cl hco3 and no3 also scavenged so4 oh radicals eqs 3 8 thus their positive effects on 4 cp removal attenuated with the increasingly dominance of so4 oh radicals at higher pyrolysis temperatures 1 cl hso5 h hclo h cl so4 2 2 hco3 hso5 hco4 hso4 3 cl so4 so4 2 cl 4 cl oh cloh 5 hco3 2 so4 so4 2 hco3 6 hco3 2 oh oh hco3 7 no3 so4 so4 2 no3 8 no3 oh oh no3 subsequently we measured the degraded products of 4 cp by gc ms and lc ms ms after 5 min of reaction abundant quinone and hydroxylated compounds were found in the psbc 600 pms system figure s16a whereas the major byproducts were small molecular acids such as propionic acid and acetic acid in the psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms systems figure s16b consistent with the generation of more so4 oh radicals of higher oxidizing capacity in the psbc 800 pms and psbc 1000 pms systems the degradation pathways of 4 cp in the psbc pms systems were thus proposed figure s16c these results confirmed that pyrolysis temperatures of psbc determined the pms activation mechanism and the generated reactive species of pyrolyzed products 3 3 identification of active sites the different reactive species profiles of psbc pms indicated the pyrolysis at different temperatures produced psbc with various active sites for pms activation therefore we carefully characterized the psbc samples to identify their active sites the xrd results revealed the amorphous structure of psbc 400 but graphitic carbon and al2o3 appeared in psbc 600 fe3o4 feal2o4 ca po3 2 and fe n composites fe2 4 n and fen0 095 were also detected in psbc 800 and psbc 1000 fig 3 a the existence of fe n species was confirmed by ftir and xps the ftir absorption bands at 490 and 929 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of fe n and fe n fe respectively sahin et al 2020 in contrast the organic n groups absorption bands 1650 1350 cm 1 in psbc 400 and psbc 600 obviously weakened and disappeared with increased pyrolysis temperatures suggesting their decomposition or conversion during pyrolysis fig 3b n 1 s xps also demonstrated that the pyrrole n 400 3 ev in the raw ps was converted into other n species such as pyridinic n 398 5 ev graphite n 401 4 ev and fe n 399 3 ev during the pyrolysis more importantly the loss of pyrrole n and the generation of other n species were pyrolysis temperature dependent fig 3c and figure s17 fe 2p xps confirmed the presence of fe oxides 711 4 713 2 ev and fe n species 709 8 ev on the surface of all the psbc samples and the fe n species gradually increased with the enhanced pyrolysis temperatures in accordance with the n 1 s xps notably a new peak at 705 9 ev emerged in psbc 1000 which was originated from the fe fe bonds of the fexn species fig 3d the above characterization results displayed that various c n and fe species coexisted in the psbc catalysts and all the species might be responsible for the pms activation according to previous reports huang et al 2022 liang et al 2021 miao et al 2020 xiong et al 2022 c species like graphitic and n doped carbon mainly mediated the det mechanism which was already ruled out in the psbc pms systems besides elemental analysis revealed the gradual decrease of c contents in psbc along with the increased pyrolysis temperatures table s8 moreover c 1 s xps analysis indicated that the contents of c species in psbc including the aromatic sp2 c c 284 6 ev aliphatic sp3 cc 285 2 ev cn co 286 3 ev c n c o 288 4 ev and oc o 290 5 ev did not follow the same pyrolysis temperature dependent patterns with the catalytic performances figure s18 and table s9 thus the c species were not likely the major active sites of pms activation interestingly the strong fe chelating reagent kscn completely deactivated all the psbc catalysts suggesting the predominant role of fe species in the pms activation figure s19 meanwhile the release of dissolved fe2 by the psbc pms was tiny with the maximum concentration of 4 3 μmol l after 10 min the homogeneous control experiment of fe2 pms with 4 3 μmol l fe2 could not significantly remove 4 cp figure s20 indicating that the solid phase fe species were major pms active sites 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy was further employed to collect detailed information on fe species in psbc pyrolyzed at different temperatures fig 4 a the fitting parameters and the assignment of fitted signals were summarized in table s10 the iron species basically included fe oxides fenx and fexn compounds x 1 corresponding to group 1 signals d1 d2 and d3 dyar et al 2014 jastrzębska et al 2015 group 2 signals d4 and d5 kramm et al 2014 and group 3 signals d6 sext1 and sext2 kramm 2013 kramm et al 2019 notably fenx usually formed atomically dispersed fenx c moieties whereas fexn mainly referred to iron nitride aggregates the areas of different spectra groups were integrated and used to calculate the proportions of different fe species fig 4b with the increase of pyrolysis temperatures the iron oxides species decreased while the fenx species increased to 48 5 at 800 c and decreased significantly to 20 9 at 1000 c and the fexn species increased constantly from 0 at 400 c to 41 6 at 1000 c to clarify the exact active sites for non radical and radical pms catalysis the relationship between fe species and reactive species in psbc pms reactions was assessed with pearson analysis in fig 4c the colors of the cells indicated the correlation coefficients 1 r 1 and the labeled numbers in the cells were p values the feivo2 generation was positively correlated with fenx d4 which was assigned to fen4 embedded in carbon fe n c feivo2 was not correlated with d5 the 5 fold coordinated fe sites i e fenx with x 4 possibly due to the steric repulsion of axial n ligand that hindered the adsorption of pms li et al 2021 on the contrary the generation of so4 oh was positively correlated with feal2o4 d3 and fexn sext1 sext2 with the pearson correlation coefficients of 0 88 0 80 and 0 94 however the generation of so4 oh was very minor by psbc 400 and psbc 600 although they contained high contents of feal2o4 ruling out its role in the radical activation of pms obviously these results reflected that fen4 and fexn were the key catalytic centers in psbc for the pms activation to produce non radical feivo2 as well as so4 and oh radicals respectively dft calculations were thus carried out to understand the catalytic mechanism of the fen4 and fexn active sites text s6 based on the characterization results we selected two possible structures as the representatives of fen4 and fexn sites namely the pyrrolic n coordinated fe embedded in carbon fen4 c atomically dispersed fe site and the fe3n carbon composite fe3n c agglomerate fe site respectively fig 5 a the charge density distributions revealed that fe atoms were the electron rich centers in both fen4 c and fe3n c sites figure s21 suggesting that fe sites could donate electrons and act as the catalytic centers for the pms activation which was demonstrated by the difference charge density results between the two fe sites and pms figure s22 the energy of adsorption and reaction transition states of pms on psbc were calculated to demonstrate the feasibility of pms activation by the catalytic sites of psbc strong adsorption between pms and the fen4 c site was revealed with the adsorption energy of 5 82 ev adsorbed pms dissociation on the fen4 c site to generate feivo2 was thermodynamically spontaneous e 0 92 ev with an activation barrier ebar of 1 17 ev fig 5b it was reported that ebar above 0 91 ev generally made the non radical mechanism of pms activation preferable jing et al 2022 consistent with the fact that heme like n coordinated metal sites tend to produce high valent metal oxo intermediates in aops xiong et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 on the contrary pms could be adsorbed on the fe3n c sites with energy of 1 21 ev and spontaneously dissociated to so4 oh e 0 66 ev through a barrierless pathway fig 5c which was well supported by the report that transition metal nitrides exhibited excellent fenton like catalytic activity to produce reactive radicals due to the strong electron transfer ability li et al 2016 based on the above results we could clarify the structure activity relationship sar of psbc for pms activation as follows the fen4 and fexn sites were responsible for the production of feivo2 and so4 oh respectively at pyrolysis temperature of 400 c the amounts of fe n active sites fen4 and fexn on psbc 400 were very limited resulting in its poor pms catalytic performance higher pyrolysis temperature produced more fe n sites to activate pms to be specific psbc 600 mainly contained fen4 and activated pms to feivo2 dominantly for the non radical oxidation of pollutants with the further increase of pyrolysis temperatures the fen4 sites gradually shifted to fexn and thus both feivo2 and radicals so4 oh were produced we believe that pharmaceutical sludge s pyrolysis temperature dependent active sites and reactive species of pms activation may find wide applications in pollutant control and environmental remediation limitations of this study and future perspectives mainly include 1 only one type of pharmaceutical sludge was tested in the present study and ps from different sources and with varied constituents are recommended to be studied to further confirm our conclusions 2 the psbc pms systems shall be evaluated for their performance to remove more water pollutants such as antibiotics persistent organic pollutants personal care products etc especially in real wastewater treatment scenarios 3 the fabrication of psbc deserves up scaling with the cost and benefit of psbc carefully evaluated 4 the potential toxicity of psbc toward the aqueous ecosystem and human must be assessed in the future to assure the safety of application 4 conclusions herein we demonstrated that 1 pharmaceutical sludge ps with abundant iron and nitrogen constituents could be pyrolyzed into functional biochar psbc to efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate pms for rapid pollutants degradation 2 the active sites of psbc for pms activation included the fenx and fexn species which decomposed pms to high valent iron feivo2 and so4 oh respectively 3 pyrolysis temperatures could facilely modulate the active sites of psbc and the resulting reactive species i e lower temperature 600 c favored the formation of fenx and feivo2 whereas higher temperatures 800 1000 c facilitated fexn and so4 oh radicals compared with previous methods to fabricate fenx and fexn catalysts from the topotactic pyrolysis of metal organic frameworks this study provides a cost effective method more importantly the easy regulated active sites and reactive species can match the removal requirements of different contaminants at various water treatment scenarios and may greatly broaden the market of psbc in polluted water and soil remediation etc therefore psbc offers a promising high value added resource recycling product of ps and may promote the sustainability of pharmaceutical

apparent chen et al 2019 dang et al 2020 rysz et al 2013 walsh et al 2011 this prompts the speculation of a continuous arg transfer between the microbial assembly dominant taxa which constantly exist

transfer of arg mge matching pairs have not been evidenced at the community wide scale yet especially in the water supply catchment here we study the main drinking water supply catchment of shanghai the largest city in china to better understand how microbial dynamics and environmental drivers impact in situ resistomes across a catchment using high throughput metagenomic sequencing microbial

putative resistant pathogens and intragenomic args there were 266 and 289 non redundant mags obtained from summer and winter samples respectively around 20 of which were identified as arg hosting bacteria fig 3 overall these arg hosts were significantly more abundant across the catchment in summer than in winter 76 8 9 08 vs 59 0 5 69 gpmr pair wise t test p 0 01 and generally belonged to the phyla of proteobacteria bacteroidota and actinobacteria among them most putative pathogens were mycobacteriaceae 6 83 0 54 gpmr and burkholderiaceae 19 7 6 51 gpmr of which the distribution and concentrations did not significantly vary across sampling sites one way anova p 0 05 adonis p 0 1 fig s5 the predominant subtaxon species such as m mycobacterium spp and b ramibacter spp and limnohabitans spp fig 3a are frequently associated with human ar infections fang et al 2015 fang et al 2019 in winter samples fig 3b mags of putative resistant pathogens were more dispersed across actinobacteria phylum including aeromicrobium nocardioides and phycicoccus these taxa are known to have ill effects on human dermal and intestine health singleton et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 however the predominant putative resistant pathogens still primarily belonged to burkholderiaceae 12 9 3 83 gpmr and were evenly distributed across the river one way anova p 0 05 intragenomic args of putative

cov ppm args fig 3b most of which were associated with burkholderiaceae spp such as b limnohabitans and rhizobacter spp 3 4 importance of putative pathogens to community wide hgt of args the observed larger and diverse intragenomic args in putative pathogenic bacteria may result from frequent hgt of args zhu et al 2013 as shown in fig 4a the normalized intragenomic mge levels often an approximation of hgt potential lamba et al 2017 were significantly correlated with intragenomic args across all samples pearson p 0 05 importantly mges with apparent links to putative pathogenic mags exhibited stronger linear correlations with intragenomic args suggesting that hgt of args within in situ river microbial communities might be more likely to proceed via resistant pathogenic bacteria cohen s d effect size 0 84 vs 0 41 p 0 001 fig 4a this high hgt potential of args in putative pathogens was seen in both summer and winter samples cohen s d effect size 0 6 p 0 001 fig 4a moreover as shown in fig 4b args associated with pathogens had relatively short genetic distances to mges on their genetic context scaffolds e g 3 5 kb which is consistent with the previous work that showed greater hgt potential of args in human pathogens compared with overall mag assemblages forsberg et al 2014 the importance of pathogens to dissemination of args was further suggested by a community wide hgt analysis of all arg hosting mags using the metachip song et al 2019 fig 5a shows that hgt of args more frequently associated with the putative resistant pathogens irrespective of their roles i e donor vs recipients in the hgt processes kruskal wallis test χ2 17 5 ppath 0 001 prole 0 31 notably hgt involved mags primarily belonged to the subtaxa of proteobacteria and actinobacteria fig 5a including burkholderiaceae count 126 8 78 4 ilumatobacteraceae count 12 4 6 1 and microbacteriaceae count 7 25 5 6 these mags not only exhibited more frequent arg transmission kruskal wallis test χ2 96 3 p 0 001 but also were identified as the microbial assembly dominant taxa that shaped the resistomes fig 2a table s4 although cyanobacteria dominated microbial assembly and resistome variations evidence suggests they were not closely invovled in the community wide hgt count 3 0 fig 5a and their acquired intragenomic args all originated from putative pathogenic mags of burkholderiaceae sp fig s7 fig s8 with high hgt potentials fig 5a from the microbial synergistic perspective burkholderiaceae can utilize algal excremets e g microcystin as major metabolic substrates salter et al 2021 therefore the cyanobacterial aggragates tend to closely structure with burkholderiaceae in lake river ecosystems eiler and bertilsson 2004 as reported by guo et al 2018 waterborne args and their hosting bacteria were abundantly observed in the bacterioplanktonic aggregates in the homogeneous selection dominated community fig 1 cyanobacteria usually exhibit high resilliance to environmental variations liu et al 2019b mo et al 2018 which could be beneficial to preserve their associated args fig 5 the predominant intragenomic args including β lactam resistant e g bla oxa and mls resistant genes macb appeared to be disseminated between microbial assembly dominant taxa and putative resistant pathogens fig 5b this explains the high prevalence and the spread of args across the catchment during the period of water diversion 3 5 implications of potential ar hazards and influencing factors the prevalence of args with potential clinical importance fig 1c fig s2 and putative resistant pathogens fig 3 may suggest higher ar risks martinez et al 2015 especially if they are found in drinking water sources dang et al 2020 walsh et al 2011 overall summer samples showed the higher potential ar hazards by compared with the winter ones using metacompare index values 19 3 vs 19 0 the potential exposure risks were significantly lower in the reservoir vs upstream two way anova p 0 05 fig s8 this trend was mirrored by lower density of putative resistant pathogens in the reservoir water samples i e 3 79 2 5 106 cell l on average one way anova f 31 4 p 0 001 fig 6a this value corresponds to a total amount of 13 3 0 89 1015 cells of putative resistant pathogens that are transferred daily to shanghai s water supply system during the water diversion process 3 5 million m3 day however it should be noted that this study was confined to just one catchment for better generalization of at tap drinking water source specific ar a combination of metagenomics and culture based

indirect effects via their influence on the microbial assembly dominant bacterial taxa sem std coeff β 0 45 p 0 05 this suggests that improvement of water quality may have a limited effect on reducing in situ resistome transmission and resistant pathogens p 0 05 fig 6b whereas the holistic management of wastewater inputs containing pathogens jiang et al 2013 quintela baluja et al 2019 and control of microbial assembly dominant bacterial taxa such as curbing algal e g cyanobacteria blooms are critically needed guo et al 2018 mo et al 2018 xue et al 2018 4 conclusions here we show that microbial deterministic assembly process is crucial to the resulting environmental antibiotic resistomes in the taipu river catchment the seasonal variations of args including the ones of particular importance to human health were frequently hosted by putative pathogenic bacteria which greatly contributed to the community wide hgt of args especially with the assembly dominant taxa the pipelines constructed to estimate hgt potentials of args can be applied more generally in a wide range of environmental settings for quantitative comparison and analysis of resistome mobility and potential ar risks importantly in the annually operated water diversion process in the taihu basin the waterborne args released from upstream sources are well preserved in the niched bacterial community and transferred to the downstream drinking water reservoir which presumably contains 3 0 4 0 106 cell l of the putative resistant pathogens although our data are from samples prior to water treatment there is an implicit concern about ar spread through the local water supply possibly impacting 24 million shanghai citizens health however the work also shows importance of environmental factors and microbial spatial ecology on arg fate which provides a useful starting point for developing strategies to curb the ar transmission in the shanghai or other water supply catchments credit authorship contribution

presence of antibiotic resistance genes args in a place as the consequence of selective pressures growing literature suggests that the microbial ecological context and niches may be more important to local arg prevalence in natural and anthropogenic settings mahnert et al 2019 pehrsson et al 2016 however the niche influenced assembly depend on various factors such as microbial phylogenetic and taxonomic structures in human gut smillie et al 2011 salinity in soil tan et al 2019 microplastics in rivers wang et al 2020 and partiles in the air xie et al 2019 strong evidence further suggests that the spread of args is affected by microbial and environmental variables related to mobile genetic elements mges quintela baluja et al 2021 su et al 2015 wu et al 2019 as such different studies

baluja et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 zhu et al 2017 and even in pristine arctic areas mccann et al 2019 however the specific roles of microbial assembly featured key taxa munck et al 2015 pertinent

apparent chen et al 2019 dang et al 2020 rysz et al 2013 walsh et al 2011 this prompts the speculation of a continuous arg transfer between the microbial assembly dominant taxa which constantly exist

transfer of arg mge matching pairs have not been evidenced at the community wide scale yet especially in the water supply catchment here we study the main drinking water supply catchment of shanghai

putative resistant pathogens and intragenomic args there were 266 and 289 non redundant mags obtained from summer and winter samples respectively around 20 of which were identified as arg hosting bacteria fig 3 overall these arg hosts were significantly more abundant across the catchment in summer than in winter 76 8 9 08 vs 59 0 5 69 gpmr pair wise t test p 0 01 and generally belonged to the phyla of proteobacteria bacteroidota and actinobacteria among them most putative pathogens were mycobacteriaceae 6 83 0 54 gpmr and burkholderiaceae 19 7 6 51 gpmr of which the distribution and concentrations did not significantly vary across sampling sites one way anova p 0 05 adonis p 0 1 fig s5 the predominant subtaxon species such as m mycobacterium spp and b ramibacter spp and limnohabitans spp fig 3a are frequently associated with human ar infections fang et al 2015 fang et al 2019 in winter samples fig 3b mags of putative resistant pathogens were more dispersed across actinobacteria phylum including aeromicrobium nocardioides and phycicoccus these taxa are known to have ill effects on human dermal and intestine health singleton et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 however the predominant putative resistant pathogens still primarily belonged to burkholderiaceae 12 9 3 83 gpmr and were evenly distributed across the river one way anova p 0 05 intragenomic args of putative

cov ppm args fig 3b most of which were associated with burkholderiaceae spp such as b limnohabitans and rhizobacter spp 3 4 importance of putative pathogens to community wide hgt of args the observed larger and diverse intragenomic args in putative pathogenic bacteria may result from frequent hgt of args zhu et al 2013 as shown in fig 4a the normalized intragenomic mge levels often an approximation of hgt potential lamba et al 2017 were significantly correlated with intragenomic args across all samples pearson p 0 05 importantly mges with apparent links to putative pathogenic mags exhibited stronger linear correlations with intragenomic args suggesting that hgt of args within in situ river microbial communities might be more likely to proceed via resistant pathogenic bacteria cohen s d effect size 0 84 vs 0 41 p 0 001 fig 4a this high hgt potential of args in putative pathogens was seen in both summer and winter samples cohen s d effect size 0 6 p 0 001 fig 4a moreover as shown in fig 4b args associated with pathogens had relatively short genetic distances to mges on their genetic context scaffolds e g 3 5 kb which is consistent with the previous work that showed greater hgt potential of args in human pathogens compared with overall mag assemblages forsberg et al 2014 the importance of pathogens to dissemination of args was further suggested by a community wide hgt analysis of all arg hosting mags using the metachip song et al 2019 fig 5a shows that hgt of args more frequently associated with the putative resistant pathogens irrespective of their roles i e donor vs recipients in the hgt processes kruskal wallis test χ2 17 5 ppath 0 001 prole 0 31 notably hgt involved mags primarily belonged to the subtaxa of proteobacteria and actinobacteria fig 5a including burkholderiaceae count 126 8 78 4 ilumatobacteraceae count 12 4 6 1 and microbacteriaceae count 7 25 5 6 these mags not only exhibited more frequent arg transmission kruskal wallis test χ2 96 3 p 0 001 but also were identified as the microbial assembly dominant taxa that shaped the resistomes fig 2a table s4 although cyanobacteria dominated microbial assembly and resistome variations evidence suggests they were not closely invovled in the community wide hgt count 3 0 fig 5a and their acquired intragenomic args all originated from putative pathogenic mags of burkholderiaceae sp fig s7 fig s8 with high hgt potentials fig 5a from the microbial synergistic perspective burkholderiaceae can utilize algal excremets e g microcystin as major metabolic substrates salter et al 2021 therefore the cyanobacterial aggragates tend to closely structure with burkholderiaceae in lake river ecosystems eiler and bertilsson 2004 as reported by guo et al 2018 waterborne args and their hosting bacteria were abundantly observed in the bacterioplanktonic aggregates in the homogeneous selection dominated community fig 1 cyanobacteria usually exhibit high resilliance to environmental variations liu et al 2019b mo et al 2018 which could be beneficial to preserve their associated args fig 5 the predominant intragenomic args including β lactam resistant e g bla oxa and mls resistant genes macb appeared to be disseminated between microbial assembly dominant taxa and putative resistant pathogens fig 5b this explains the high prevalence and the spread of args across the catchment during the period of water diversion 3 5 implications of potential ar hazards and influencing factors the prevalence of args with potential clinical importance fig 1c fig s2 and putative resistant pathogens fig 3 may suggest higher ar risks martinez et al 2015 especially if they are found in drinking water sources dang et al 2020 walsh et al 2011 overall summer samples showed the higher potential ar hazards by compared with the winter ones using metacompare index values 19 3 vs 19 0 the potential exposure risks were significantly lower in the reservoir vs upstream two way anova p 0 05 fig s8 this trend was mirrored by lower density of putative resistant pathogens in the reservoir water samples i e 3 79 2 5 106 cell l on average one way anova f 31 4 p 0 001 fig 6a this value corresponds to a total amount of 13 3 0 89 1015 cells of putative resistant pathogens that are transferred daily to shanghai s water supply system during the water diversion process 3 5 million m3 day however it should be noted that this study was confined to just one catchment for better generalization of at tap drinking water source specific ar a combination of metagenomics and culture based

indirect effects via their influence on the microbial assembly dominant bacterial taxa sem std coeff β 0 45 p 0 05 this suggests that improvement of water quality may have a limited effect on reducing in situ resistome transmission and resistant pathogens p 0 05 fig 6b whereas the holistic management of wastewater inputs containing pathogens jiang et al 2013 quintela baluja et al 2019 and control of microbial assembly dominant bacterial taxa such as curbing algal e g cyanobacteria blooms are critically needed guo et al 2018 mo et al 2018 xue et al 2018 4 conclusions here we show that microbial deterministic assembly process is crucial to the resulting environmental antibiotic resistomes in the taipu river catchment the seasonal variations of args including the ones of particular importance to human health were frequently hosted by putative pathogenic bacteria which greatly contributed to the community wide hgt of args especially with the assembly dominant taxa the pipelines constructed to estimate hgt potentials of args can be applied more generally in a wide range of environmental settings for quantitative comparison and analysis of resistome mobility and potential ar risks importantly in the annually operated water diversion process in the taihu basin the waterborne args released from upstream sources are well preserved in the niched bacterial community and transferred to the downstream drinking water reservoir which presumably contains 3 0 4 0 106 cell l of the putative resistant pathogens although our data are from samples prior to water treatment there is an implicit concern about ar spread through the local water supply possibly impacting 24 million shanghai citizens health however the work also shows importance of environmental factors and microbial spatial ecology on arg fate which provides a useful starting point for developing strategies to curb the ar transmission in the shanghai or other water supply catchments credit authorship contribution
