5845,global warming has substantially altered vegetation growth and phenology in temperate biomes worldwide whose impacts on river runoff have not been fully understood especially at the watershed scale investigating the relationships among phenological shift changes in vegetation growth and river runoff is essential to improve our understanding of the ecosystem response to ongoing climate change using in situ runoff records phenological dates that were extracted from the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi over the period 1982 2015 and grey relational analysis this study investigated the relationships between changes in river runoff and phenological variables in luanhe river basin china it was found that the growing season in the luanhe basin was significantly extended by 0 60 0 08 d per year associated with climate warming over the period 1982 2015 which is mainly related to the earlier start of growing season sos 0 40 0 05 d per year rather than the delayed end of growing season eos 0 11 0 01 d per year the vegetation growth defined as the average growing season ndvi gs ndvi significantly increased in more than 88 4 of the study area on average the gs ndvi increased by 1 30 0 03 10 3 d per year on the other hand runoff significantly reduced by 1 42 mm per year over the study period but large differences were observed between upper and middle lower reaches region of the luanhe basin the grey relational analysis confirmed the primary regulation of river runoff by precipitation but the length of growing season and vegetation growth also played a key role in the changes of runoff these results provide new insights into the interaction between vegetation dynamics and water balance at the watershed scale and highlight to couple the phenological processes into eco hydrological models to improve the modelling accuracy keywords climate change phenology shifts vegetation growth river runoff watershed scale 1 introduction in temperate and boreal regions vegetation phenology is particularly sensitive to climate change chuine et al 2004 schwartz 2013 recent climate warming has extended the growing season mainly due to the advanced start of season sos and the delayed end of season eos in the northern hemisphere menzel et al 2006 peñuelas and filella 2001 piao et al 2019 fu et al 2015 and has subsequently affected the ecosystem structure and function piao et al 2017 thackeray et al 2016 zohner et al 2018 extended growing season results in higher carbon assimilation and increases the water retention of terrestrial ecosystems lu et al 2013 piao et al 2007a b williams et al 2012 however to our knowledge how the phenological shift affects the regional water cycle especially at the watershed scale has not been well investigated hence it is essential to investigate the water cycle response to climate warming by analyzing the interaction between phenological shift and river runoff at the watershed scale peñuelas et al 2009 zeng et al 2018a b it is widely accepted that water cycle processes are mainly controlled by changes of climatic variables such as precipitation and radiation as well as land use and land cover change chiew et al 2009 hundecha and bárdossy 2004 singh et al 2014 williams et al 2012 climate warming may directly cause the frequency and intensity changes in precipitation accelerate the transfer of water from the earth s surface to the atmosphere and lead to higher drought stress and thus reduce river runoffs hao et al 2018 prudhomme et al 2014 except for climate variables recent studies have found that warming induced vegetation growth has affected evapotranspiration in river basins and thus has a great impact on water yield and river runoff goulden and bales 2014 li et al 2018 richardson et al 2013 thompson et al 2011 yang et al 2019a b zeng et al 2018a b for example lemordant et al 2018 found that compared with the changes of precipitation or radiation the physiological response to co2 and water use efficiency of vegetation growth played a more pivotal role affecting terrestrial water cycles based on earth system models in general few studies have investigated the influence of vegetation growth on river runoff especially using in situ records at the watershed scale vegetation phenology also contributes to the shift of river runoff recent studies found that in a temperate deciduous forest advanced spring green up dates caused higher evapotranspiration and reduced river runoff kim et al 2018 where the spatial resolution was small i e based only on a small catchment scale 0 8 km2 how phenological shifts affect river runoff at a large scale especially at the large watershed scale is still unclear furthermore climate warming has extended the vegetation growing season but the contribution of spring and autumn phenology has been reported inconsistently among studies some studies found that the spring phenology contributed more to the length of growing season chen et al 2000 linderholm 2006 menzel and fabian 1999 however other studies reported that autumn phenology played a more decisive role than spring phenology wu et al 2013 overall how spring and autumn phenology affect the length of growing season gsl and subsequently hydrological processes of the watershed ecosystem remains unclear one possible reason is that large uncertainty exists when extracting remote sensing based phenology dates using a single method cong et al 2012 white et al 2009 using multiple methods to accurately extract phenology dates are thus necessary to apply in the phenology river runoff analysis we therefore applied five methods to determine the start and the end of growing season sos and eos using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi over the period 1982 2015 in luanhe river basin a typical semi arid watershed in temperate china grey relational analysis gra was applied to detect the relationships among phenology vegetation growth climatic variables and river runoff the objectives of this study were to a determine the temporal shifts of vegetation phenology and growth and river runoff b investigate the relative contribution of spring and autumn phenology to vegetation growth and c explore the relationships between trends in phenology vegetation growth and river runoff over the period 1982 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area luanhe river basin with a total area of 38 000 km2 is located in arid and semi arid areas of north china 115 27 e 118 56 e 40 n 42 41 n fig 1 a the luanhe river

but a large spatial heterogeneity exists in recent decades the land use types in the area have not changed much and mainly covered by forest 42 4 and grassland 46 3 table a 1 the whole river basin was separated into two regions based on different land covers in year of 2015 fig 1c the upper reaches region ur is mainly covered by temperate and meadow grassland while the middle lower reaches region

basin were collected from the chinese daily surface weather database http data cma cn fig 1b the kriging method was applied for spatial interpolation and then annual series of meteorological variables were obtained for sub basins in order to analyze temporal trends and relationships between runoff and related factors the observed data of annual runoff was collected from hydrometric stations in 12 typical sub basins of luanhe river basin fig 1b including 4 sub basins in the ur s1 s4 and 8 sub basins in the mlr s5 s12 figure a 1 the distributions of meteorological and hydrometric stations are shown in fig 1b 2 2 3 ndvi dataset the data of vegetation growth and long term phenological records 1982 2015 were extracted from the bi monthly 8 km global inventory modeling and mapping studies

1349 the growing season length gsl was defined as the time interval between the start of growing season sos and the end of growing season eos vegetation growth was defined as the mean ndvi over the growing season 2 2 4 estimation of sos and eos five commonly used methods including gaussian midpoint method spline midpoint method hants maximum method polyfit maximum method and timesat sg method were applied to determine sos and eos the mean values of sos and eos across the five methods were applied for each pixel the details of the five methods are provided in the appended text a 1 in general three steps were involved for extracting the phenological dates 1 eliminating the influence of errors and noises caused by orbital drift calibration viewing geometry stratospheric volcanic aerosols and snow cover 2 using different methods to filter and interpolate ndvi and using thresholds or maximum minimum rate of temporal ndvi change to determine the phenological dates and 3 distinguishing and removing the abnormal points based on a five point median value moving average method 2 3 methods min max normalization was used to process the time series data to compare temporal dynamics of different indicators with large different absolute magnitudes jia et al 2011 grey relational analysis gra is a method of the geometric proximity between different discrete sequences within a system huang and huang 1996 deng 1989 which was applied to determine the correlation among climatic variables i e precipitation temperature solar radiation ecological variables i e sos eos gsl gs ndvi and river runoff the proximity of two series is described by the grey relational degree grd a higher grd usually greater than 0 6 represents a greater influence of the parameter on the reference series fu et al 2001 ip et al 2009 xu et al 2011 the grd was calculated as follows deng 1989 runoff series were named as reference sequences labeled as x 0 t and the climatic and ecological variables

series x 0 t was calculated following the formulations given below 1 grd i 1 n t 1 n k t 2 k t min δ x t ρ m a x δ x t δ x t ρ m a x δ x t 3 δ x t x i t x 0 t where ρ is the grey parameter that ranged from 0 to 1 and is often assigned a value of 0 5 3 results 3 1 changes of climatic variables during the period 1982 2015 the whole region of luanhe river basin wr was getting warming and drying with temperature significantly increasing by 0 03 0 002 per year y and precipitation decreasing by 1 35 0 19 mm per year mm y and the radiation was increasing by 0 19 0 03 w m 2 per year fig 2 these trends were consistent in all sub basins figure a 2 but the warming trend was stronger in ur than in mlr 0 04 0 002 and 0 02 0 001 y ur and mlr respectively while the drying trend was more obvious in mlr than in ur on average more than two times reduction in precipitation was observed in ur 0 76 0 05 and 1 66 0 02 mm y ur and mlr respectively 3 2 changes in phenology and vegetation growth in luanhe river basin 3 2 1 phenological dynamics the mean date of sos in the luanhe river basin is 121 4 5 day of year doy over the period 1982 2015 the sos was advanced by an average of 0 40 0 05 days per year d y and around 75 4 of the study area experienced advanced trends with roughly 24 0 of them statistically significant at p value 0 05 fig 3 a however large spatial difference of sos exists and the earlier sos was mainly observed in mlr 0 61 0 06 d y whereas the sos in ur was even delayed 0 21 0 06 d y fig 3b the mean date of eos is 291 2 8 doy over the whole area and the eos was delayed by an average of 0 11 0 01 d y over the study period 1982 2015 the delayed trend was observed in 81 1 of the study area and 53 5 of which was significant at p value 0 05 fig 3c although delayed eos existed in both ur and mlr its value was different in the two regions the eos delay in mlr 0 14 0 01 d y was more than twice that in ur 0 06 0 01 d y fig 3d the spatial distribution of annual trend of gsl is shown in fig 3e the extension of gsl was extensively observed across 76 0 of the study area with 43 0 of the pixels showing significant extension p value 0 05 fig 3e the mean extension of gsl across the whole basin was 0 60 0 08 d y comparing different regions it was found that the significant extension pixels were mainly distributed in mlr 0 85 0 10 d y while there was no obvious change in ur 0 002 0 07 d y fig 3f 3 2 2 growth dynamics and its correlation with phenology using the gs ndvi as proxy of vegetation growth it was found that vegetation growth substantially increased over the luanhe river basin during the period 1982 2015 increasing trends were found in 88 4 areas with mean annual trend 1 30 0 03 10 3 and 78 4 of the trends were statistically significant at p value 0 05 fig 3g consistent with phenological changes there were large spatial variances between ur and mlr although the overall gs ndvi in ur exhibited an increasing trend 0 55 0 05 10 3 per year there were still 23 pixels with decreasing vegetation growth whereas gs ndvi in mlr increased significantly at 1 6 0 04 10 3 per year nearly three times as large as that in ur fig 3h in addition it was noted that the gs ndvi was not the same everywhere in ur so we further divided the ur into two regions according to the gsl i e extended vs shortened compared with gsl extended areas both the temperature and precipitation in gsl shortened areas were lower and the changes of both temperature and precipitation were significantly higher p value 0 05 figure a 3 all these changes were likely to affect the vegetation growth and lead to the regional differences of growing season in ur gs ndvi was significantly correlated with sos and gsl p value 0 05 but not with eos p value 0 10 in the whole region wr fig 4 however significant correlations were observed only in mlr rather than in ur suggesting other factors such as climate and peak ndvi may determine the vegetation growth in ur on the contrary in mlr sos eos and gsl were all significantly correlated with vegetation growth especially gsl where the coefficient of determination was larger r 2 0 48 than for sos r 2 0 34 and eos r 2 0 13 3 3 changes of river runoff and its association with phenology 3 3 1 changes of river runoff to compare the temporal trend of annual runoff this study used annual runoff anomaly fig 5 across all the 12 sub basins runoff decreased significantly at a rate of 1 42 mm y p value 0 05 from 1982 to 2015 the significantly reduced runoff was found in both ur and mlr but the reduction in mlr was around 4 times higher than in ur the average trends of the four sub basins in ur and the eight sub basins in mlr were 0 45 mm y and 1 90 mm y respectively p value 0 05 fig 5 furthermore it was found that river runoff in the whole region or sub basins was generally lower than the multi year average after the year 2000 3 3 2 correlation between shifts in river runoff and phenology linear trends of key factors affecting river runoff fig 6 a c and grey relational analysis gra among them fig 6d are shown in fig 6 the runoff in wr showed a negative association with either gsl or gs ndvi fig 6a and the negative association was much stronger in mlr than in ur fig 6b and c combining with the grey relational degree it was found that the association between the change of precipitation and that of river runoff was the strongest grd 0 75 fig 6d it was also observed that both gsl and gs ndvi showed a relatively higher association with river runoff grd 0 59 and 0 64 respectively rather than other climatic variables fig 6d these relationships varied between ur and mlr the change of river runoff in ur was most related to the change of gs ndvi grd 0 75 even slightly more strongly than to precipitation grd 0 72 fig 6d however precipitation change still had the highest correlation with river runoff grd 0 77 in mlr and gsl and gs ndvi were strongly associated with runoff grd 0 59 and 0 60 respectively fig 6d these findings suggested that both climate and ecological variables were associated with changes of river runoff the grey relational analysis between sos eos and river runoff figure a 4 was also applied both precipitation and phenological shifts showed a relatively higher association with river runoff than other climatic factors among which the contribution of sos grd 0 66 was more significant than eos grd 0 64 figure a 4d 4 discussion 4 1 phenological shift and spatial heterogeneity earlier sos and later eos and extended growing season were found in the luanhe river basin over the period 1982 2015 when significant warming trend was detected it was further found that the extended growing season promoted the vegetation growth in the basin such results are consistent with previous studies in temperate areas in the northern hemisphere cong et al 2012 gong et al 2015 linderholm 2006 whereas higher vegetation growth largely relied on the earlier sos rather than eos in the basin in addition higher vegetation growth was found in mrl but not in ur this was mainly because a delayed rather advanced sos found in ur due to small changes of land use in the study area over the past years table a 1 such a difference in phenology shift is likely attributed to the different vegetation types fig 1d liu et al 2016 richardson et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2012 the mechanisms of phenology dynamics between grassland and forest are different grassland phenology usually depends on the combined effect of temperature and precipitation and it was more sensitive to precipitation compared with forests chuai et al 2013 in ur where grasslands are dominant the spring phenology may be determined by precipitation rather temperature yuan et al 2007 and thus a reduced precipitation would result in a delayed sos and the legacy effect on the vegetation growth on the other hand in mlr where forest vegetation is dominant the large root system of trees may buffer the water stress during spring before sos and during the growing season brunner et al 2015 gargallo garriga et al 2015 and thus a warming spring would promote sos and extend the growing season and vegetation growth it needs to be however noted that the phenology of forest is also influenced by precipitation and radiation photoperiod fu et al 2015 fu et al 2019 hänninen 2016 and a gradually increasing weight of other climatic variables on the forest phenology may be expected under future climate change 4 2 phenology shift contribution to gs ndvi this study used gs ndvi as proxy of vegetation growth and found an overall enhanced tendency of vegetation growth over the past 34 years in the luanhe river basin this is consistent with previous studies that reported that a longer gsl could induce higher vegetation growth park et al 2016 piao et al 2007a b changes of sos and eos resulting in a longer gsl have been widely reported lucht et al 2002 menzel and fabian 1999 piao et al 2007a b tucker et al 2001 vesala et al 2010 but their contributions to vegetation growth vary barichivich et al 2013 vesala et al 2010 wu et al 2013 in this study it was found that the advanced sos contributed more to the enhanced gs ndvi than did the postponed eos fig 4 this may be attributed to different seasonal temperature changes garonna et al 2014 piao et al 2007a b according to ipcc 2013 report the warming trends in winter and spring was significantly higher than autumn although autumn phenology was not as well documented as spring phenology recent studies indicated the critical role of delayed autumn in prolonging the growing season garonna et al 2014 jeong et al 2011 zhu et al 2012 however that mainly happened in shrubs covered lands with short gsl zhu et al 2012 or where vegetation growth depends more on photoperiod and temperature garonna et al 2014 liu et al 2016 furthermore to better understand the contributions of phenological shift to gs ndvi vegetation types and changes of environmental factors were also considered garonna et al 2014 peng et al 2013 this study found significantly different gs ndvi between ur and mlr of the basin which may be attributed to the deeper root system of forest in mlr and its better capability of resistance to drought stress than grassland in ur filoso et al 2017 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2011 4 3 vegetation impacts on river runoff and its spatial heterogeneity previous studies have reported that shifted regimes in precipitation and radiation under climate warming were the key factors impacting hydrological processes nohara et al 2006 ragettli et al 2016 revi et al 2014 consistent with these studies it was found that precipitation was strongly associated with river runoff but interestingly sos and gsl as well as gs ndvi were all strongly associated with river runoff specifically vegetation growth played a more important role in ur than precipitation fig 6 and the contribution of sos to runoff was second to precipitation but obviously higher than that of other climatic factors figure a 4 forest covered areas e g mlr in this study usually have higher water interception and transpiration compared with grassland covered areas e g ur in this study james et al 2003 yamazaki et al 2004 due to earlier spring growth onset and longer vegetation greening vegetation water use may lead to aggravated decrease of soil water even groundwater resulting in water stress in spring therefore precipitation would first replenish soil deficit and recharge groundwater thus reduce water discharge of the river basin kim et al 2018 wang et al 2019 additionally the spring phenology effect may also promote the process of water transport from land surface to the atmosphere substantially huntington 2008 kim et al 2018 piao et al 2019 wang et al 2016 zeng et al 2018a b as transpiration of vegetation canopy is the main contribution of evapotranspiration in arid and semi arid areas jasechko et al 2014 wang et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2004 intensified evapotranspiration might be expected and would subsequently result in the reduction of river runoff indeed using the gridded dataset the evapotranspiration was found significantly increased over the study period in the river basin figure a 5 therefore the intensified processes of surface water recharge of soil and groundwater vegetation evapotranspiration combined with precipitation reduction jointly led to the decreasing of river runoff in addition land cover is a key factor affecting runoff with the promotion of afforestation researches on impacts of land use or vegetation type change on surface runoff are still of great importance yang et al 2019a b 5 conclusion and implications our results confirmed that river runoff was regulated by both climatic and phenological variables at the watershed scale hwang et al 2018 the prominent effects of vegetation growth and phenological shift on river runoff were revealed in luanhe river basin however research at the watershed scale is still lacking considering that luanhe river basin is located in a typical semi arid area in addition large scale research cannot effectively reveal the underlying mechanisms of the impacts of phenological shift and vegetation growth on river runoff thus it is necessary to further assess on other watersheds in different climate regions and conduct eco physiological experiments which is of great practical significance to cope with climate change and strengthen water resources and ecosystem management in watersheds additionally river water withdrawal may affect the estimation of runoff and subsequently increase uncertainty in our analysis and thus the role of vegetation phenology on runoff might be overestimated whereas over the luanhe river basin considering the fact that forest and grassland are the major vegetation types and the cover of cropland is minor and the ground water is the main source of cropland requirement in the study area we may expect an insignificant effect of river water withdrawal on luanhe runoff furthermore although not included in this study it is worthy of strengthening the impacts of land use change on surface runoff which is of great significance for resource and environment management under the intensified human activities in the future vegetation phenology is particularly sensitive to climate change and a dramatic shift in phenology would be expected under future climate change and subsequently impact terrestrial water cycles however it was found that different extraction methods generate large uncertainties in phenological date estimation due to irregular or asymmetric ndvi series or their sensitivity to ndvi values of the non growing season affected by snow cover cong et al 2012 liu et al 2016 therefore the fusion of multiple methods is necessary to make the results more reliable in addition researches on physiological processes are required to further improve the accuracy of remote sensing information furthermore the river runoff may be greatly underestimated by hydrological models without considering the vegetation dynamics and its response to climate change this study highlights the importance of accurate estimation of vegetation phenology in the hydrological models especially in semi arid and arid areas because vegetation may be more sensitive to precipitation changes in these areas current phenology models are generally based on statistical methods especially the autumn phenology models and process based models that based on eco physiological processes hänninen et al 2019 are thus needed additionally coupled with hydrological models will help improve model accuracy and our understanding of the terrestrial water cycles under future climate change

1349 the growing season length gsl was defined as the time interval between the start of growing season sos and the end of growing season eos vegetation growth was defined as the mean ndvi over the growing season 2 2 4 estimation of sos and eos five commonly used methods including gaussian midpoint method spline midpoint method hants maximum method polyfit maximum method and timesat sg method were applied to determine sos and eos the mean values of sos and eos across the five methods were applied for each pixel the details of the five methods are provided in the appended text a 1 in general three steps were involved for extracting the phenological dates 1 eliminating the influence of errors and noises caused by orbital drift calibration viewing geometry stratospheric volcanic aerosols and snow cover 2 using different methods to filter and interpolate ndvi and using thresholds or maximum minimum rate of temporal ndvi change to determine the phenological dates and 3 distinguishing and removing the abnormal points based on a five point median value moving average method 2 3 methods min max normalization was used to process the time series data to compare temporal dynamics of different indicators with large different absolute magnitudes jia et al 2011 grey relational analysis gra is a method of the geometric proximity between different discrete sequences within a system huang and huang 1996 deng 1989 which was applied to determine the correlation among climatic variables i e precipitation temperature solar radiation ecological variables i e sos eos gsl gs ndvi and river runoff the proximity of two series is described by the grey relational degree grd a higher grd usually greater than 0 6 represents a greater influence of the parameter on the reference series fu et al 2001 ip et al 2009 xu et al 2011 the grd was calculated as follows deng 1989 runoff series were named as reference sequences labeled as x 0 t and the climatic and ecological variables as influence sequences labeled as x i t x 0 t and x i t represent the normalized variables of x 0 t and x i t through min max normalization the grd of influence of each series x i t on reference series x 0 t was calculated following the formulations given below 1 grd i 1 n t 1 n k t 2 k t min δ x t ρ m a x δ x t δ x t ρ m a x δ x t 3 δ x t x i t x 0 t where ρ is the grey parameter that ranged from 0 to 1 and is often assigned a value of 0 5 3 results 3 1 changes of climatic variables during the period 1982 2015 the whole region of luanhe river basin wr was getting warming and drying with temperature significantly increasing by 0 03 0 002 per year y and precipitation decreasing by 1 35 0 19 mm per year mm y and the radiation was increasing by 0 19 0 03 w m 2 per year fig 2 these trends were consistent in all sub basins figure a 2 but the warming trend was stronger in ur than in mlr 0 04 0 002 and 0 02 0 001 y ur and mlr respectively while the drying trend was more obvious in mlr than in ur on average more than two times reduction in precipitation was observed in ur 0 76 0 05 and 1 66 0 02 mm y ur and mlr respectively 3 2 changes in phenology and vegetation growth in luanhe river basin 3 2 1 phenological dynamics the mean date of sos in the luanhe river basin is 121 4 5 day of year doy over the period 1982 2015 the sos was advanced by an average of 0 40 0 05 days per year d y and around 75 4 of the study area experienced advanced trends with roughly 24 0 of them statistically significant at p value 0 05 fig 3 a however large spatial difference of sos exists and the earlier sos was mainly observed in mlr 0 61 0 06 d y whereas the sos in ur was even delayed 0 21 0 06 d y fig 3b the mean date of eos is 291 2 8 doy over the whole area and the eos was delayed by an average of 0 11 0 01 d y over the study period 1982 2015 the delayed trend was observed in 81 1 of the study area and 53 5 of which was significant at p value 0 05 fig 3c although delayed eos existed in both ur and mlr its value was different in the two regions the eos delay in mlr 0 14 0 01 d y was more than twice that in ur 0 06 0 01 d y fig 3d the spatial distribution of annual trend of gsl is shown in fig 3e the extension of gsl was extensively observed across 76 0 of the study area with 43 0 of the pixels showing significant extension p value 0 05 fig 3e the mean extension of gsl across the whole basin was 0 60 0 08 d y comparing different regions it was found that the significant extension pixels were mainly distributed in mlr 0 85 0 10 d y while there was no obvious change in ur 0 002 0 07 d y fig 3f 3 2 2 growth dynamics and its correlation with phenology using the gs ndvi as proxy of vegetation growth it was found that vegetation growth substantially increased over the luanhe river basin during the period 1982 2015 increasing trends were found in 88 4 areas with mean annual trend 1 30 0 03 10 3 and 78 4 of the trends were statistically significant at p value 0 05 fig 3g consistent with phenological changes there were large spatial variances between ur and mlr although the overall gs ndvi in ur exhibited an increasing trend 0 55 0 05 10 3 per year there were still 23 pixels with decreasing vegetation growth whereas gs ndvi in mlr increased significantly at 1 6 0 04 10 3 per year nearly three times as large as that in ur fig 3h in addition it was noted that the gs ndvi was not the same everywhere in ur so we further divided the ur into two regions according to the gsl i e extended vs shortened compared with gsl extended areas both the temperature and precipitation in gsl shortened areas were lower and the changes of both temperature and precipitation were significantly higher p value 0 05 figure a 3 all these changes were likely to affect the vegetation growth and lead to the regional differences of growing season in ur gs ndvi was significantly correlated with sos and gsl p value 0 05 but not with eos p value 0 10 in the whole region wr fig 4 however significant correlations were observed only in mlr rather than in ur suggesting other factors such as climate and peak ndvi may determine the vegetation growth in ur on the contrary in mlr sos eos and gsl were all significantly correlated with vegetation growth especially gsl where the coefficient of determination was larger r 2 0 48 than for sos r 2 0 34 and eos r 2 0 13 3 3 changes of river runoff and its association with phenology 3 3 1 changes of river runoff to compare the temporal trend of annual runoff this study used annual runoff anomaly fig 5 across all the 12 sub basins runoff decreased significantly at a rate of 1 42 mm y p value 0 05 from 1982 to 2015 the significantly reduced runoff was found in both ur and mlr but the reduction in mlr was around 4 times higher than in ur the average trends of the four sub basins in ur and the eight sub basins in mlr were 0 45 mm y and 1 90 mm y respectively p value 0 05 fig 5 furthermore it was found that river runoff in the whole region or sub basins was generally lower than the multi year average after the year 2000 3 3 2 correlation between shifts in river runoff and phenology linear trends of key factors affecting river runoff fig 6 a c and grey relational analysis gra among them fig 6d are shown in fig 6 the runoff in wr showed a negative association with either gsl or gs ndvi fig 6a and the negative association was much stronger in mlr than in ur fig 6b and c combining with the grey relational degree it was found that the association between the change of precipitation and that of river runoff was the strongest grd 0 75 fig 6d it was also observed that both gsl and gs ndvi showed a relatively higher association with river runoff grd 0 59 and 0 64 respectively rather than other climatic variables fig 6d these relationships varied between ur and mlr the change of river runoff in ur was most related to the change of gs ndvi grd 0 75 even slightly more strongly than to precipitation grd 0 72 fig 6d however precipitation change still had the highest correlation with river runoff grd 0 77 in mlr and gsl and gs ndvi were strongly associated with runoff grd 0 59 and 0 60 respectively fig 6d these findings suggested that both climate and ecological variables were associated with changes of river runoff the grey relational analysis between sos eos and river runoff figure a 4 was also applied both precipitation and phenological shifts showed a relatively higher association with river runoff than other climatic factors among which the contribution of sos grd 0 66 was more significant than eos grd 0 64 figure a 4d 4 discussion 4 1 phenological shift and spatial heterogeneity earlier sos and later eos and extended growing season were found in the luanhe river basin over the period 1982 2015 when significant warming trend was detected it was further found that the extended growing season promoted the vegetation growth in the basin such results are consistent with previous studies in temperate areas in the northern hemisphere cong et al 2012 gong et al 2015 linderholm 2006 whereas higher vegetation growth largely relied on the earlier sos rather than eos in the basin in addition higher vegetation growth was found in mrl but not in ur this was mainly because a delayed rather advanced sos found in ur due to small changes of land use in the study area over the past years table a 1 such a difference in phenology shift is likely attributed to the different vegetation types fig 1d liu et al 2016 richardson et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2012 the mechanisms of phenology dynamics between grassland and forest are different grassland phenology usually depends on the combined effect of temperature and precipitation and it was more sensitive to precipitation compared with forests chuai et al 2013 in ur where grasslands are dominant the spring phenology may be determined by precipitation rather temperature yuan et al 2007 and thus a reduced precipitation would result in a delayed sos and the legacy effect on the vegetation growth on the other hand in mlr where forest vegetation is dominant the large root system of trees may buffer the water stress during spring before sos and during the growing season brunner et al 2015 gargallo garriga et al 2015 and thus a warming spring would promote sos and extend the growing season and vegetation growth it needs to be however noted that the phenology of forest is also influenced by precipitation and radiation photoperiod fu et al 2015 fu et al 2019 hänninen 2016 and a gradually increasing weight of other climatic variables on the forest phenology may be expected under future climate change 4 2 phenology shift contribution to gs ndvi this study used gs ndvi as proxy of vegetation growth and found an overall enhanced tendency of vegetation growth over the past 34 years in the luanhe river basin this is consistent with previous studies that reported that a longer gsl could induce higher vegetation growth park et al 2016 piao et al 2007a b changes of sos and eos resulting in a longer gsl have been widely reported lucht et al 2002 menzel and fabian 1999 piao et al 2007a b tucker et al 2001 vesala et al 2010 but their contributions to vegetation growth vary barichivich et al 2013 vesala et al 2010 wu et al 2013 in this study it was found that the advanced sos contributed more to the enhanced gs ndvi than did the postponed eos fig 4 this may be attributed to different seasonal temperature changes garonna et al 2014 piao et al 2007a b according to ipcc 2013 report the warming trends in winter and spring was significantly higher than autumn although autumn phenology was not as well documented as spring phenology recent studies indicated the critical role of delayed autumn in prolonging the growing season garonna et al 2014 jeong et al 2011 zhu et al 2012 however that mainly happened in shrubs covered lands with short gsl zhu et al 2012 or where vegetation growth depends more on photoperiod and temperature garonna et al 2014 liu et al 2016 furthermore to better understand the contributions of phenological shift to gs ndvi vegetation types and changes of environmental factors were also considered garonna et al 2014 peng et al 2013 this study found significantly different gs ndvi between ur and mlr of the basin which may be attributed to the deeper root system of forest in mlr and its better capability of resistance to drought stress than grassland in ur filoso et al 2017 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2011 4 3 vegetation impacts on river runoff and its spatial heterogeneity previous studies have reported that shifted regimes in precipitation and radiation under climate warming were the key factors impacting hydrological processes nohara et al 2006 ragettli et al 2016 revi et al 2014 consistent with these studies it was found that precipitation was strongly associated with river runoff but interestingly sos and gsl as well as gs ndvi were all strongly associated with river runoff specifically vegetation growth played a more important role in ur than precipitation fig 6 and the contribution of sos to runoff was second to precipitation but obviously higher than that of other climatic factors figure a 4 forest covered areas e g mlr in this study usually have higher water interception and transpiration compared with grassland covered areas e g ur in this study james et al 2003 yamazaki et al 2004 due to earlier spring growth onset and longer vegetation greening vegetation water use may lead to aggravated decrease of soil water even groundwater resulting in water stress in spring therefore precipitation would first replenish soil deficit and recharge groundwater thus reduce water discharge of the river basin kim et al 2018 wang et al 2019 additionally the spring phenology effect may also promote the process of water transport from land surface to the atmosphere substantially huntington 2008 kim et al 2018 piao et al 2019 wang et al 2016 zeng et al 2018a b as transpiration of vegetation canopy is the main contribution of evapotranspiration in arid and semi arid areas jasechko et al 2014 wang et al 2010 yamazaki et al 2004 intensified evapotranspiration might be expected and would subsequently result in the reduction of river runoff indeed using the gridded dataset the evapotranspiration was found significantly increased over the study period in the river basin figure a 5 therefore the intensified processes of surface water recharge of soil and groundwater vegetation evapotranspiration combined with precipitation reduction jointly led to the decreasing of river runoff in addition land cover is a key factor affecting runoff with the promotion of afforestation researches on impacts of land use or vegetation type change on surface runoff are still of great importance yang et al 2019a b 5 conclusion and implications our results confirmed that river runoff was regulated by both climatic and phenological variables at the watershed scale hwang et al 2018 the prominent effects of vegetation growth and phenological shift on river runoff were revealed in luanhe river basin however research at the watershed scale is still lacking considering that luanhe river basin is located in a typical semi arid area in addition large scale research cannot effectively reveal the underlying mechanisms of the impacts of phenological shift and vegetation growth on river runoff thus it is necessary to further assess on other watersheds in different climate regions and conduct eco physiological experiments which is of great practical significance to cope with climate change and strengthen water resources and ecosystem management in watersheds additionally river water withdrawal may affect the estimation of runoff and subsequently increase uncertainty in our analysis and thus the role of vegetation phenology on runoff might be overestimated whereas over the luanhe river basin considering the fact that forest and grassland are the major vegetation types and the cover of cropland is minor and the ground water is the main source of cropland requirement in the study area we may expect an insignificant effect of river water withdrawal on luanhe runoff furthermore although not included in this study it is worthy of strengthening the impacts of land use change on surface runoff which is of great significance for resource and environment management under the intensified human activities in the future vegetation phenology is particularly sensitive to climate change and a dramatic shift in phenology would be expected under future climate change and subsequently impact terrestrial water cycles however it was found that different extraction methods generate large uncertainties in phenological date estimation due to irregular or asymmetric ndvi series or their sensitivity to ndvi values of the non growing season affected by snow cover cong et al 2012 liu et al 2016 therefore the fusion of multiple methods is necessary to make the results more reliable in addition researches on physiological processes are required to further improve the accuracy of remote sensing information furthermore the river runoff may be greatly underestimated by hydrological models without considering the vegetation dynamics and its response to climate change this study highlights the importance of accurate estimation of vegetation phenology in the hydrological models especially in semi arid and arid areas because vegetation may be more sensitive to precipitation changes in these areas current phenology models are generally based on statistical methods especially the autumn phenology models and process based models that based on eco physiological processes hänninen et al 2019 are thus needed additionally coupled with hydrological models will help improve model accuracy and our understanding of the terrestrial water cycles under future climate change

5846,high nitrogen loading in aquifers is an important issue because of its harmful effects on human health its origins are often complicated especially in urbanized areas this study aims to investigate the distributions of nitrate nitrite and ammonium in various aquifers in the pearl river delta and to identify their main sources using hydrochemical and socioeconomic data and principal component analysis the results show that groundwater with high nitrate 20 mg l as n high nitrite 1 mg l as n and high ammonium 0 5 mg l as n appeared in 7 0 4 3 and 20 5 of granular aquifers and in 8 3 0 8 and 5 3 of fissured aquifers respectively but did not appear in karst aquifers the proportions of high nitrate and high ammonium groundwater in urbanized areas were nearly or more than twice those in non urbanized areas high nitrate levels in both granular and fissured aquifers originated mainly from the wastewater leakage of township village enterprises during the industrialization urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage was another main driving force for high nitrate levels in fissured aquifers housing construction aggravated groundwater nitrate contamination in newly urbanized areas nitrate contamination in granular aquifers was reduced via denitrification in urbanized areas developed in 1988 1998 whereas that in fissured aquifers was increased by nitrification in urbanized areas developed before 1998 high ammonium levels in granular aquifers in urbanized areas originated mainly from mineralization of organic nitrogen in overlying aquitards whereas that in peri urban areas and non urbanized areas originated mainly from urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage and irrigation using ammonium rich river water respectively by contrast high ammonium levels in fissured aquifers are attributed mainly to mineralization of organic nitrogen in carbon rich strata which was enhanced by urbanization accompanied by a relatively anoxic environment our study implies that nitrate and ammonium contaminations in this area will worsen in the future owing to a lack of effective control and treatment in these rapidly urbanized areas naturally originating high ammonium groundwater in this area can be used as a nitrogen resource for example as a nitrogen fertilizer in agricultural irrigation keywords nitrate ammonium groundwater sources and driving forces urbanized areas 1 introduction groundwater is an important reservoir of nitrogen nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 are commonly the main dissolved nitrogen compounds in groundwater investigating the distributions and controlling factors of these nitrogen compounds in groundwater is useful for understanding the regional nitrogen cycle groundwater with high concentrations of no3 and nh4 has been reported worldwide for example in the united states glessner and roy 2009 burow et al 2010 mexico ortega guerrero 2003 and canada benson et al 2006 in north america england rivett et al 2007 italy mastrocicco et al 2013 netherlands griffioen et al 2013 france ledoux et al 2007 ireland tedd et al 2014 and austria wick et al 2012 in europe japan hosono et al 2013 indonesia taufiq et al 2019 vietnam norrman et al 2015 and china ju et al 2006 in asia and australia thorburn et al 2003 most studies have focused on groundwater with elevated no3 in agricultural areas and the main sources of no3 in groundwater have often been identified using isotopic techniques hosono et al 2013 pastén zapata et al 2014 multivariate statistical methods zhang et al 2015 taufiq et al 2019 and the concentration ratios of different ions spruill et al 2002 various human activities such as wastewater irrigation fertilizer use and the use of landfills specifically leakage of the resulting leachate are commonly responsible for high no3 concentrations in groundwater umezawa et al 2008 pastén zapata et al 2014 by contrast not only various anthropogenic sources but also natural sources are often responsible for high nh4 concentrations in groundwater lingle et al 2017 the pearl river delta prd is a rapidly urbanized and industrialized area in china extremely high nitrogen in the waters of this region is a major concern owing to its harmful impacts on water quality huang et al 2016 the contributions of anthropogenic sources to nitrogen in the rivers of the prd have been calculated industrial wastewater and domestic sewage are the two main sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in rivers lu et al 2009 further groundwater with elevated nh4 and no3 was also reported in the prd and the natural source of groundwater containing nh4 in granular aquifers and anthropogenic sources of groundwater containing no3 have also been discussed jiao et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 however the spatial distributions of groundwater containing no3 no2 and nh4 in the prd at a regional scale remain unclear because the hydrogeological conditions are complicated and distinct levels of urbanization occur within the prd in addition the effect of urban expansion on the distribution of groundwater with elevated no3 and nh4 levels in the prd has received little attention this study aims to 1 delineate the spatial distributions of no3 no2 and nh4 not only in various aquifers but also in various areas with different levels of urbanization in the prd on the regional scale and 2 discuss the sources and driving forces of these nitrogen compounds in particular the effect of urban expansion on the occurrence of elevated no3 and nh4 in groundwater in the prd is highlighted the conclusions would be helpful for improving groundwater management in the prd and as a reference for the distributions and origins of nitrogen compounds in aquifer systems during different periods of urbanization in other countries 2 study area 2 1 hydrogeological and geological conditions as shown in fig 1 the prd is located in south china and includes nine major cities guangzhou foshan dongguan jiangmen zhongshan shenzhen zhuhai zhaoqing and huizhou huang et al 2018a it was formed as a result of the tibetan plateau uplift during the tertiary and quaternary periods quaternary deposits appear in the central and southern parts of the prd and arecomposedof two marine strata and two terrestrial strata zong et al 2009 the younger marine stratum has an elevation above 20 m and the older marine stratum is located between 15 and 40 m fig 1 the younger terrestrial stratum could be sandy fluvial deposits or clayey silt the older terrestrial stratum is dominated by sand and gravel jiao et al 2010 aquifers in these strata are called granular aquifers and the groundwater in these aquifers is recharged primarily by atmospheric precipitation agricultural irrigation and lateral flow of bedrock groundwater in hilly regions fig s1 the bedrock includes limestone mudstone sandstone shale dolomite granite and gneiss which range in age from cambrian to tertiary and crop out in the hilly areas in the prd fig s2 aquifers in these areas are associated with fractures and are called fissured aquifers in addition karst aquifers account for less than 10 of the total area and appear around the prd plain guangdong hydrogeological second team ghst 1981 the general direction of regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd roughly follows the major river flow zhang et al 2019 which is from the northwest and northeast toward the coast fig s1 2 2 characteristics of urbanization and industrialization in the prd the prd has been rapidly urbanized and industrialized during the past three decades and the amount of developed land increased by 1 3 times from 1988 to 2006 ye et al 2013 according to the urbanization levels land use in the prd can be divided into three types urbanized peri urban and non urbanized areas huang et al 2018b the urbanized areas are characterized by dense populations numerous factories and a very large production of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater in addition newly urbanized areas were sometimes originally peri urban areas because urban expansion in the prd occurred from one area to the surroundings fig 2 the peri urban areas also have many factories and large populations but lack sewer systems the non urban areas are mainly woodlands small villages and agricultural lands where irrigation with polluted river water often occurs huang et al 2013 note that wastewater from industrial enterprises above a specified size in urbanized areas in the prd is discharged into sewer systems but wastewater from township village enterprises tves is often illegally discharged without treatment into the surrounding area huang et al 2013 in addition many landfills have been formed in peri urban areas during urbanization fig 2 note that urban expansion of the prd accelerated after deng xiaoping s southern tour of 1992 for instance the annual population increase in guangdong province including the prd before 1990 was much lower than that after 1990 table s1 ye et al 2013 divided the urbanization of the prd before 2006 into three stages before 1988 1988 to 1998 and 1998 to 2006 here the areas of the prd that were urbanized before 1988 from 1988 to 1998 and from 1998 to 2006 are referred to as ua1st ua2nd and ua3rd respectively thus ua1st is characterized by a lower proportion of factories compared with ua2nd and ua3rd sun et al 2009 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques in this study 399 groundwater samples 258 samples from granular aquifers 132 samples from fissured aquifers and 9 samples from karst aquifers were collected once during the wet season of 2006 though more realistic chemical information is obtained when the multi level sampling mls is used choi et al 2010 müller et al 2010 the groundwater samples in this study were collected by an integrated depth method not by mls because of insufficient funds in addition nine leachate samples and nine surface water samples were collected

or more types of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and to further discuss the origin or interaction of these nitrogen compounds and other parameters for the same pc zhang et al 2019 in addition pca was used to identify the relationships between the mean concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and the relevant socioeconomic data in this study in the pca only pcs with eigenvalues greater than one were retained for analyses and the varimax method was adopted 4 results 4 1 concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen compounds in groundwater 4 1 1 dissolved inorganic nitrogen compounds in various aquifers as shown in table 1 the concentrations of groundwater no3 no2 and nh4 in the prd were as high as 333 5 33 2 and 60 mg l respectively the average concentrations of no3 in granular and fissured aquifers were similar and both were approximately 1 4 1 5 times that in karst aquifers by contrast the average concentrations of no2 and nh4 in granular aquifers were 5 3 and 12 5 times those in fissured aquifers and 29 4 and 40 8 times those in karst aquifers respectively in this study groundwater concentrations of no3 20 mg l as n no2 1mg l as n and nh4 0 5 mg l as n exceeding the groundwater quality standard of china general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china gaqsiqprc 2017 are called high no3 high no2 and high nh4 groundwater respectively as shown in table 1 high no3 high no2 and high nh4 groundwater appeared in 7 0 4 3 and 20 5 of granular aquifers and in 8 3 0 8 and 5 3 of fissured aquifers respectively but did not appear in karst aquifers 4 1 2 groundwater inorganic nitrogen compounds in areas with different urbanization levels in granular aquifers the mean value of groundwater no3 and the proportion of high no3 groundwater in urbanized areas were 1 3 and 1 9 times those in peri urban areas and 1 8 and 7 5 times those in non urbanized areas respectively in fissured aquifers the average concentrations of groundwater no3 in urbanized and peri urban areas were similar and both were approximately 1 6 1 7 times those in non urbanized areas by contrast the proportion of high no3 groundwater in urbanized areas was slightly higher than that in peri urban areas and the proportions in these areas were 2 3 and 1 9 times that in non urbanized areas respectively in granular aquifers the average concentrations of groundwater no2 in urbanized and peri urban areas were simialr and both were approximately 2 9 times that in non urbanized areas by contrast in fissured aquifers the mean value of groundwater no2 in urbanized areas was 1 2 and 4 7 times those in peri urban and non urbanized areas respectively in both granular and fissured aquifers the proportions of high no2 groundwater in peri urban and non urbanized areas were similar and both were slightly lower than those in urbanized areas in granular aquifers the mean value of groundwater nh4 in peri urban areas was 1 7 and 2 1 times those in urbanized and non urbanized areas respectively however the proportion of high nh4 groundwater in urbanized areas was 1 1 times that in peri urban areas and 1 8 times that in non urbanized areas by contrast in fissured aquifers the mean value of groundwater nh4 and the proportion of high nh4 groundwater in urbanized areas were 2 2 and 2 4 times those in peri urban areas and were 2 4 and 8 9 times those in non urbanized areas respectively 4 1 3 groundwater inorganic nitrogen compounds in urbanized areas developed in different periods table 2 summarizes the descriptive statistics for groundwater no3 no2 and nh4 in granular and fissured aquifers in urbanized areas developed in different periods in granular aquifers the mean value of groundwater no3 in ua3rd was 1 2 and 1 1 times those in ua1st and ua2nd respectively by contrast the proportions of high no3 groundwater in ua2nd and ua3rd were similar and both were approximately 2 0 2 1 times that in ua1st in fissured aquifers the average concentrations of groundwater no3 as well as the proportions of high no3 groundwater in ua2nd and ua3rd were much higher than those in ua1st in granular aquifers the average no2 concentrations and proportions of high no2 groundwater in ua2nd and ua3rd were significantly higher than those in ua1st by contrast in fissured aquifers the mean value of groundwater no2 and the proportion of high no2 groundwater in ua2nd were much higher than those in ua3rd and ua1st in granular aquifers the mean value of groundwater nh4 and the proportion of high nh4 groundwater in ua1st were 1 8 and 1 6 times those in ua2nd and were 1 2 and 1 6 times those in ua3rd respectively in fissured aquifers the average concentrations of groundwater nh4 in ua1st and ua2nd were 2 6 and 3 3 times that in ua3rd respectively consequently the proportions of high nh4 groundwater in ua1st and ua2nd were 4 0 and 2 7 times that in ua3rd respectively 4 2 concentrations of inorganic nitrogen compounds in surface water and landfill leachate table s3 presents the descriptive statistics for inorganic nitrogen compounds in surface water and landfill leachate in the prd the concentrations of no3 no2 and nh4 in surface water were as high as 31 8 1 2 and 42 0 mg l respectively the mean and maximum values of nh4 in surface water are higher than those of no3 and no2 because most of the surface water samples were collected from small rivers or ditches with black water anaerobic conditions the mean and maximum concentrations of no3 in groundwater were significantly higher than those in surface water regardless of the aquifer and urbanization level by contrast the mean concentration of nh4 was much lower in groundwater than in surface water regardless of the aquifers and urbanization level nh4 was the main nitrogenous compound in landfill leachates in the prd followed by no3 and the concentrations of no2 in landfill leachates were almost negligible the average concentrations of no3 and nh4 in landfill leachates were much higher than those in groundwater 4 3 spatial distributions of inorganic nitrogen compounds in groundwater in the prd groundwater no3 no2 and nh4 concentrations were divided into classes i to v table s4 that is the no3 concentrations are denoted as no3 i to no3 v and so on as shown in fig 3 high no3 groundwater occurred mainly in urbanized and peri urban areas for example 50 and 33 3 of no3 v groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas respectively similarly 60 9 and 21 7 of no3 iv groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas respectively by contrast only 20 of no3 v and no3 iv groundwater occurred in non urbanized areas high no2 and high nh4 groundwaters also occurred mainly in urbanized and peri urban areas figs 4 and 5 for example all the no2 v groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas and 60 and 20 of no2 iv groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas respectively by contrast no no2 v and only 20 of no2 iv groundwater occurred in non urbanized areas similarly 42 9 and 34 3 of nh4 v groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas 64 and 28 of nh4 iv groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas respectively note however that 20 of nh4 v groundwater occurred in non urbanized areas mostly near small rivers figs 1 and 5 as shown in table s5 dongguan showed the highest mean concentration of groundwater no3 followed by huizhou foshan guangzhou zhongshan zhuhai zhaoqing jiangmen and shenzhen in addition dongguan also showed the highest proportion of high no3 groundwater followed by zhongshan foshan huizhou guangzhou and jiangmen whereas the other cities such as shenzhen zhaoqing and zhuhai had no high no3 groundwater the mean concentrations of groundwater no2 in various cities in the prd were ordered as follows shenzhen dongguan zhuhai zhongshan foshan zhaoqing guangzhou huizhou jiangmen further dongguan showed the highest proportion of high no2 groundwater followed by zhuhai shenzhen zhongshan foshan and zhaoqing whereas the other cities had no high no2 groundwater the mean concentrations of groundwater nh4 in various cities in the prd were ordered as follows dongguan shenzhen zhuhai guangzhou huizhou foshan zhaoqing zhongshan jiangmen in addition dongguan also showed the highest proportion of high nh4 groundwater followed by zhuhai shenzhen foshan zhongshan guangzhou jiangmen huizhou zhaoqing 4 4 relationships between inorganic nitrogen compounds and other hydrochemical parameters table s6 shows the average concentrations of hydrochemical parameters other than inorganic nitrogen compounds the groundwater chemistry of granular aquifers was controlled by a four factor model table 3 pc3 has a strong positive loading 0 75 with no2 and cod and a moderate positive loading 0 50 with nh4 pc4 has strong and moderate positive loadings with no3 and k respectively in addition pc1 shows strong positive loadings with cl na mg2 and tds and a moderate positive loading with nh4 by contrast the groundwater chemistry of fissured aquifers was controlled by a three factor model and the three pcs accounted for 78 5 of the cumulative variance table 3 pc1 has strong positive loadings with k so4 2 no3 tds and cl and moderate positive loadings with na and ca2 pc2 shows strong positive loadings with no2 and mg2 and a moderate positive loading with hco3 the pc3 has strong positive loadings with nh4 and cod 4 5 relationships between concentrations of inorganic nitrogen compounds and socioeconomic parameters the relationships between the mean concentrations of inorganic nitrogen compounds in groundwater and relevant socioeconomic parameters in nine major cities of the prd were identified by pca note that differences in the socioeconomic parameters of the cities resulting from differences in size were eliminated by using the values of the socioeconomic parameters per square kilometer pc1 shows strong positive loadings with gdp pd dsd pua no2 and ie and a moderate positive loading with nh4 table 4 pc2 has strong positive loadings with tve iwd and no3 and a weak positive loading 0 30 with ie table 4 5 discussion severe contamination of the groundwater of the prd by inorganic nitrogen compounds was observed especially nh4 and no3 contamination in granular and fissured aquifers moreover the concentrations of groundwater no3 and nh4 in the prd were alarmingly high compared with those in other regions worldwide table s7 for instance the maximum and mean concentrations of groundwater no3 in the prd were much higher than those in most regions of the world for example the south eastern river basin in ireland prince edward island in canada bandung basin in indonesia and the state of nuevo leon in mexico similarly the maximum concentration of groundwater nh4 in the prd was much higher than those in manila philippines bangkok thailand jakarta indonesia the la laguna region of mexico the state of michigan in the united states and so on thus we focus on the main origins and driving forces of groundwater nh4 and no3 in granular and fissured aquifers in the following discussion 5 1 origins and driving forces for nitrate in groundwater 5 1 1 sources of high nitrate groundwater domestic sewage industrial wastewater septic tanks animal waste landfills river water and fertilizers are generally nitrogen rich anthropogenic sources wakida and lerner 2005 rao 2006 matiatos 2016 and may be responsible for high no3 groundwater in the prd the pc4 component for granular aquifers has strong and moderate positive loadings with no3 and k respectively table 3 indicating that river water is not the source of high no3 groundwater in granular aquifers in the prd because river water is characterized by low concentrations of k and no3 table s6 and shows little correlation between no3 and k fig s3a table 3 shows that there is little correlation with no3 and cl in the groundwater of granular aquifers indicating that domestic sewage and landfill leachate are also not the major sources of no3 in granular aquifers in the prd because domestic sewage and landfill leachate commonly exhibit significant positive correlations between no3 and cl fig s3b widory et al 2005 in addition the na to k ratio in high no3 groundwater in granular aquifers ranged from 0 44 to 3 15 fig s3c indicating that animal waste is probably the main source of no3 in granular aquifers whereas septic tanks are not because na k 3 2 and 3 2 for septic system waste and animal waste respectively spruill et al 2002 far less fertilizer is used in urbanized areas than in agricultural areas sun et al 2009 and the dose of no3 n in urban fertilizers is commonly less than 20 mg l sharma et al 1996 indicating that the contribution of fertilizers to no3 in granular aquifers in urbanized areas is negligible therefore fertilizer is not the main source of no3 in granular aquifers because most of the high no3 groundwater occurred in urbanized areas table 1 according to the above process of elimination animal waste and wastewater from industry may be the main sources of high no3 groundwater in granular aquifers in the prd because these sources are commonly characterized by high concentrations of no3 and k spruill et al 2002 arienzo et al 2009 however in granular aquifers in ua3rd not only industrial wastewater and animal waste but also domestic sewage are probably the major sources of high no3 groundwater because the pc3 component for granular aquifers in ua3rd shows strong or moderate positive loadings with no3 cl k and na table s8 and the discharge of untreated domestic sewage is common in ua3rd because there are fewer sewer systems in newly urbanized areas the pc1 component of fissured aquifers has strong or moderate positive correlations with k so4 2 no3 tds cl na and ca2 table 3 indicating that high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers may originate from many anthropogenic sources e g domestic sewage septic tanks animal waste industrial wastewater landfills river water and fertilizers the na k ratio of 90 9 of the high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers was less than 2 8 fig s3d indicating that septic tanks are not the main source of no3 in fissured aquifers spruill et al 2002 high no3 levels in fissured aquifers commonly appeared far from rivers figs 1 and 3 indicating that river water is also not the major source of high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers as is the case for granular aquifers fertilizers are also not an important source of high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers owing to the much lower proportion of high no3 groundwater in non urbanized areas compared with that in urbanized areas table 1 less than 10 of high no3 groundwater was found near landfills figs 1 and 3 indicating that landfills are also not the major source of high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers according to the above process of elimination domestic sewage industrial wastewater and animal waste are probably the main sources of high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers in addition pca was used to determine the key socioeconomic parameters that were responsible for the occurrence of high no3 groundwater on the regional scale zhang et al 2015 taufiq et al 2019 pc2 table 4 has strong positive loadings with no3 iwd and tves and a weak positive loading with ies but little loading with dsd indicating that wastewater from tves industry is the main source of high no3 groundwater in the prd whereas domestic sewage and wastewater from ies industry are not the reason may be differences in the discharge method because domestic sewage and wastewater from ies in urbanized areas in the prd are discharged into sewer systems but wastewater from tves is often discharged directly into the nearby ground without treatment huang et al 2013 thus no occurrence of high no3 groundwater was observed in areas with few tves such as shenzhen zhaoqing and zhuhai table s2 and s5 by contrast more than 10 of high no3 groundwater was observed in areas with many tves such as dongguan and zhongshan table s2 and s5 this finding may explain why the proportions of high no3 groundwater in ua2nd and ua3rd were much higher than that in ua1st because ua2nd and ua3rd had a much higher proportions of tves than ua1st in addition pc2 table 4 shows little loadings with lo and ld indicating that animal waste is probably not the main source of high no3 groundwater in the prd because animal waste is closely related to lo and ld according to the above discussion high no3 groundwater in both granular and fissured aquifers was attributed mainly to illegal discharge of tve wastewater and domestic sewage is also an important source of no3 in fissured aquifers as well as in granular aquifers in ua3rd in addition other anthropogenic sources such as septic tanks animal waste landfills and fertilizers are probably sources of high no3 groundwater in the prd but not the main ones 5 1 2 driving forces of groundwater nitrate contamination industrialization accompanied by leakage of wastewater from tves is likely to be the main driving force for high no3 groundwater in both of granular and fissured aquifers because high no3 groundwater in the prd originates mainly from tve wastewater similarly urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage is also one of the main driving forces of high no3 levels in fissured aquifers as well as in granular aquifers in ua3rd housing construction is probably an important driving force for high no3 groundwater in the prd ua3rd consists of newly urbanized areas most of them were originally peri urban areas so many nitrogen sources remain in the soil because peri urban areas lack sewer systems and nitrogen rich waste is discharged into the nearby ground sun et al 2009 further wakida 2002 revealed that soil disturbance during housing construction increases soil aeration and mixing of nitrogen sources with soil microorganisms under favorable conditions soil microbial activity results in accumulation of nitrate owing to mineralization and nitrification thus the proportions of high no3 groundwater and mean concentrations of groundwater no3 in both granular and fissured aquifers in newly urbanized areas ua2nd and ua3rd were significantly higher than those in older urbanized area ua1st table 2 in addition denitrification has probably reduced no3 contamination in granular aquifers in ua2nd because groundwater in these aquifers is characterized by low eh and high cod values table s6 and the pc4 component for granular aquifers in ua2nd shows a strong positive loading with hco3 and a moderate negative loading with no3 table s8 by contrast nitrification is an important driving force for high no3 levels in fissured aquifers in urbanized areas because fissured aquifers appear in a relatively oxic subsurface environment table s6 and nitrogen rich anthropogenic sources such as sewage and waste are commonly characterized by high concentrations of nh4 and an anoxic environment wakida and lerner 2005 for instance the pc3 component of ua1st table s9 shows a strong negative loading with cod and a moderate positive loading with no3 similarly the pc3 component of ua2nd table s9 shows strong and weak negative loadings with nh4 and cod respectively and a moderate positive loading with no3 both of them indicate that nitrification is one of the main chemical processes controlling the groundwater chemistry of fissured aquifers in urbanized areas developed before 1998 5 2 sources and driving forces of groundwater ammonium the pc3 component of granular aquifers in urbanized areas has strong positive loadings with no2 nh4 and cod table 5 indicating that ammonification and nitrification probably control the groundwater nh4 and no2 levels respectively in these aquifers reichman et al 1966 it is known that mineralization of organic nitrogen in the overlying holocene pleistocene aquitards is mainly responsible for the high nh4 levels in granular aquifers in the prd because these aquitards contain abundant organic nitrogen and are characterized by anoxic environments which convert it to nh4 and hco3 jiao et al 2010 thus groundwater nh4 is significantly positively correlated with hco3 p 0 01 in granular aquifers fig s4a in addition granular aquifers in urbanized areas have relatively anoxic environments and lower eh values than those in other areas table s6 therefore we believe that organic nitrogen in overlying aquitards is the main source of nh4 and no2 in granular aquifers in urbanized areas thus mineralization of organic nitrogen and subsequent nitrification are the main driving forces for high nh4 and high no2 levels in granular aquifers in urbanized areas by contrast organic nitrogen in overlying aquitards is a source but not the main one of high nh4 in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas because the pc1 components of granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas have strong or moderate positive loadings with nh4 cl na mg2 and tds and a weak positive loading with cod table 5 the reason may be the relatively oxic environment and higher eh values in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas compared with those in urbanized areas table s6 on the other hand high nh4 levels in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas may originate from anthropogenic sources such as sewage landfills and river water because leakage of sewage often occurs in peri urban areas owing to the lack of sewer systems huang et al 2018b further irrigation using nh4 rich river water often occurs in non urbanized areas all the landfills in the prd are located in peri urban areas and non urbanized areas sun et al 2009 and these anthropogenic sources are commonly characterized by high concentrations of nh4 cl na mg2 and tds table s6 furthermore most of the nh4 v groundwater in non urbanized areas is near small rivers figs 1 and 5 and small rivers are often nh4 rich table s3 among these anthropogenic sources domestic sewage is likely to be the main source of high nh4 groundwater in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas because the pc1 component table 4 shows strong and moderate positive loadings with dsd and nh4 respectively furthermore less than 5 of the high nh4 groundwater is near landfills figs 1 and 5 indicating that landfills are not the major source of nh4 in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas in addition lu et al 2009 reported that domestic sewage is one of the main sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in rivers in the prd indicating that high nh4 groundwater resulting from irrigation using nh4 rich river water probably originated from domestic sewage thus leakage of domestic sewage and irrigation using nh4 rich river water are likely to be the main driving forces for high nh4 levels in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas respectively similar to that of granular aquifers in urbanized areas the pc3 component of fissured aquifers table 3 has strong positive loadings with nh4 and cod and a weak positive loading with hco3 but little loadings with other chemicals such as cl na so4 2 k and tds indicating that anthropogenic sources should be excluded and that ammonification also probably controls the groundwater nh4 in fissured aquifers fissured aquifers overlain by carbon rich strata appear to be most vulnerable to elevated ammonium schilling 2002 thus high nh4 groundwater in fissured aquifers in the prd is mainly located in devonian permian and jurassic triassic strata fig 5 and s2 where carbon rich rocks such as mudstone and shale are common ghst 1981 furthermore groundwater nh4 was positively correlated with hco3 p 0 05 in fissured aquifers fig s4b thus high nh4 levels in fissured aquifers probably originated from the organic nitrogen in carbon rich rocks thus mineralization of organic nitrogen is also probably the main driving force for high nh4 levels in fissured aquifers in addition in fissured aquifers urbanization accompanied by a relatively anoxic environment seems to be another important factor that enhances the mineralization of organic nitrogen because a relatively anoxic subsurface system is often present in urbanized areas umezawa et al 2008 and the proportion of high nh4 levels in urbanized areas table 1 especially in ua1st and ua2nd table 2 is much higher than that in non urbanized areas thus the groundwater in fissured aquifers in ua1st and ua2nd has much lower eh values and higher cod values than that in non urbanized areas table s6 note that there are some limitations on the proposed mechanisms for the origins and processes of no3 and nh4 for instance it is well known that accurate analyses of sources and processes of nitrogen compounds are typically based on isotopic information böhlke et al 2006 hosono et al 2013 pastén zapata et al 2014 taufiq et al 2019 but this study lacks evidences based on stable isotope data in addition this study also presents no data on dissolved organic nitrogen which is important for discussing elevated nh4 in groundwater resulting from mineralization of organic nitrogen 6 conclusions in this study the spatial distributions of no3 no2 and nh4 in the prd were investigated high no3 high no2 and high nh4 groundwater were observed in granular and fissured aquifers but not in karst aquifers in both granular and fissured aquifers the proportions of high no3 and high nh4 groundwater in urbanized areas were nearly or more than twice those in non urbanized areas the proportions of high no3 groundwater in newly urbanized areas were 2 or more times those in old urbanized areas by contrast the proportions of high nh4 groundwater in old urbanized areas were much higher than those in newly urbanized areas the main sources and driving forces of no3 and nh4 in granular and fissured aquifers were identified using hydrochemical and socioeconomic data and pca high no3 levels in both granular and fissured aquifers probably originated mainly from industrialization accompanied by leakage of wastewater from tves urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage is likely to be another main driving force for high no3 levels in fissured aquifers in newly urbanized areas of the prd housing construction probably increased groundwater no3 contamination no3 contamination might be reduced via denitrification in granular aquifers in urbanized areas developed in 1988 1998 whereas it might be increased by nitrification in fissured aquifers in urbanized areas developed before 1998 high nh4 groundwater in granular aquifers in urbanized areas likely originated mainly from mineralization of organic nitrogen in overlying aquitards whereas that in peri urban and non urbanized areas probably originated mainly from urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage and irrigation using nh4 rich river water respectively by contrast high nh4 groundwater in fissured aquifers was probably attributable mainly to mineralization of organic nitrogen in carbon rich strata and urbanization accompanied by a relatively anoxic environment enhanced this mineralization our study implies that nitrate and ammonium contamination will worsen in the future owing to a lack of effective control and treatment in such rapidly urbanized areas long term monitoring of groundwater no3 and nh4 is needed in newly urbanized areas and old urbanized areas respectively especially in some developing countries supervision of wastewater discharge should be strengthened during urban expansion periods to prevent inappropriate emission of wastewater into groundwater naturally originating high nh4 groundwater on the regional scale can be used as a nitrogen resource for example as a nitrogen fertilizer in agricultural

5846,high nitrogen loading in aquifers is an important issue because of its harmful effects on human health its origins are often complicated especially in urbanized areas this study aims to investigate the distributions of nitrate nitrite and ammonium in various aquifers in the pearl river delta and to identify their main sources using hydrochemical and socioeconomic data and principal component analysis the results show that groundwater with high nitrate 20 mg l as n high nitrite 1 mg l as n and high ammonium 0 5 mg l as n appeared in 7 0 4 3 and 20 5 of granular aquifers and in 8 3 0 8 and 5 3 of fissured aquifers respectively but did not appear in karst aquifers the proportions of high nitrate and high ammonium groundwater in urbanized areas were nearly or more than twice those in non urbanized areas high nitrate levels in both granular and fissured aquifers originated mainly from the wastewater leakage of township village enterprises during the industrialization urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage was another main driving force for high nitrate levels in fissured aquifers housing construction aggravated groundwater nitrate contamination in newly urbanized areas nitrate contamination in granular aquifers was reduced via denitrification in urbanized areas developed in 1988 1998 whereas that in fissured aquifers was increased by nitrification in urbanized areas developed before 1998 high ammonium levels in granular aquifers in urbanized areas originated mainly from mineralization of organic nitrogen in overlying aquitards whereas that in peri urban areas and non urbanized areas originated mainly from urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage and irrigation using ammonium rich river water respectively by contrast high ammonium levels in fissured aquifers are attributed mainly to mineralization of organic nitrogen in carbon rich strata which was enhanced by urbanization accompanied by a relatively anoxic environment our study implies that nitrate and ammonium contaminations in this area will worsen in the future owing to a lack of effective control and treatment in these rapidly urbanized areas naturally originating high ammonium groundwater in this area can be used as a nitrogen resource for example as a nitrogen fertilizer in agricultural irrigation keywords nitrate ammonium groundwater sources and driving forces urbanized areas 1 introduction groundwater is an important reservoir of nitrogen nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 are commonly the main dissolved nitrogen compounds in groundwater investigating the distributions and controlling factors of these nitrogen compounds in groundwater is useful for understanding the regional nitrogen cycle groundwater with high concentrations of no3 and nh4 has been reported worldwide for example in the united states glessner and roy 2009 burow et al 2010 mexico ortega guerrero 2003 and canada benson et al 2006 in north america england rivett et al 2007 italy mastrocicco et al 2013 netherlands griffioen et al 2013 france ledoux et al 2007 ireland tedd et al 2014 and austria wick et al 2012 in europe japan hosono et al 2013 indonesia taufiq et al 2019 vietnam norrman et al 2015 and china ju et al 2006 in asia and australia thorburn et al 2003 most studies have focused on groundwater with elevated no3 in agricultural areas and the main sources of no3 in groundwater have often been identified using isotopic techniques hosono et al 2013 pastén zapata et al 2014 multivariate statistical methods zhang et al 2015 taufiq et al 2019 and the concentration ratios of different ions spruill et al 2002 various human activities such as wastewater irrigation fertilizer use and the use of landfills specifically leakage of the resulting leachate are commonly responsible for high no3 concentrations in groundwater umezawa et al 2008 pastén zapata et al 2014 by contrast not only various anthropogenic sources but also natural sources are often responsible for high nh4 concentrations in groundwater lingle et al 2017 the pearl river delta prd is a rapidly urbanized and industrialized area in china extremely high nitrogen in the waters of this region is a major concern owing to its harmful impacts on water quality huang et al 2016 the contributions of anthropogenic sources to nitrogen in the rivers of the prd have been calculated industrial wastewater and domestic sewage are the two main sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in rivers lu et al 2009 further groundwater with elevated nh4 and no3 was also reported in the prd and the natural source of groundwater containing nh4 in granular aquifers and anthropogenic sources of groundwater containing no3 have also been discussed jiao et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 however the spatial distributions of groundwater containing no3 no2 and nh4 in the prd at a regional scale remain unclear because the hydrogeological conditions are complicated and distinct levels of urbanization occur within the prd in addition the effect of urban expansion on the distribution of groundwater with elevated no3 and nh4 levels in the prd has received little attention this study aims to 1 delineate the spatial distributions of no3 no2 and nh4 not only in various aquifers but also in various areas with different levels of urbanization in the prd on the regional scale and 2 discuss the sources and driving forces of these nitrogen compounds in particular the effect of urban expansion on the occurrence of elevated no3 and nh4 in groundwater in the prd is highlighted the conclusions would be helpful for improving groundwater management in the prd and as a reference for the distributions and origins of nitrogen compounds in aquifer systems during different periods of urbanization in other countries 2 study area 2 1 hydrogeological and geological conditions as shown in fig 1 the prd is located in south china and includes nine major cities guangzhou foshan dongguan jiangmen zhongshan shenzhen zhuhai zhaoqing and huizhou huang et al 2018a it was formed as a result of the tibetan plateau uplift during the tertiary and quaternary periods quaternary deposits appear in the central and southern parts of the prd and arecomposedof two marine strata and two terrestrial strata zong et al 2009 the younger marine stratum has an elevation above 20 m and the older marine stratum is located between 15 and 40 m fig 1 the younger terrestrial stratum could be sandy fluvial deposits or clayey silt the older terrestrial stratum is dominated by sand and gravel jiao et al 2010 aquifers in these strata are called granular aquifers and the groundwater in these aquifers is recharged primarily by atmospheric precipitation agricultural irrigation and lateral flow of bedrock groundwater in hilly regions fig s1 the bedrock includes limestone mudstone sandstone shale dolomite granite and gneiss which range in age from cambrian to tertiary and crop out in the hilly areas in the prd fig s2 aquifers in these areas are associated with fractures and are called fissured aquifers in addition karst aquifers account for less than 10 of the total area and appear around the prd plain guangdong hydrogeological second team ghst 1981 the general direction of regional groundwater flow in the aquifers of the prd roughly follows the major river flow zhang et al 2019 which is from the northwest and northeast toward the coast fig s1 2 2 characteristics of urbanization and industrialization in the prd the prd has been rapidly urbanized and industrialized during the past three decades and the amount of developed land increased by 1 3 times from 1988 to 2006 ye et al 2013 according to the urbanization levels land use in the prd can be divided into three types urbanized peri urban and non urbanized areas huang et al 2018b the urbanized areas are characterized by dense populations numerous factories and a very large production of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater in addition newly urbanized areas were sometimes originally peri urban areas because urban expansion in the prd occurred from one area to the surroundings fig 2 the peri urban areas also have many factories and large populations but lack sewer systems the non urban areas are mainly woodlands small villages and agricultural lands where irrigation with polluted river water often occurs huang et al 2013 note that wastewater from industrial enterprises above a specified size in urbanized areas in the prd is discharged into sewer systems but wastewater from township village enterprises tves is often illegally discharged without treatment into the surrounding area huang et al 2013 in addition many landfills have been formed in peri urban areas during urbanization fig 2 note that urban expansion of the prd accelerated after deng xiaoping s southern tour of 1992 for instance the annual population increase in guangdong province including the prd before 1990 was much lower than that after 1990 table s1 ye et al 2013 divided the urbanization of the prd before 2006 into three stages before 1988 1988 to 1998 and 1998 to 2006 here the areas of the prd that were urbanized before 1988 from 1988 to 1998 and from 1998 to 2006 are referred to as ua1st ua2nd and ua3rd respectively thus ua1st is characterized by a lower proportion of factories compared with ua2nd and ua3rd sun et al 2009 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques in this study 399 groundwater samples 258 samples from granular aquifers 132 samples from fissured aquifers and 9 samples from karst aquifers were collected once during the wet season of 2006 though more realistic chemical information is obtained when the multi level sampling mls is used choi et al 2010 müller et al 2010 the groundwater samples in this study were collected by an integrated depth method not by mls because of insufficient funds in addition nine leachate samples and nine surface water samples were collected from nine landfills and nine rivers or ditches fig 1 all the samples were filtered 1 2 μm membrane on site and stored at 4 c until the laboratory procedures could be performed twelve parameters of the

various aquifers as shown in table 1 the concentrations of groundwater no3 no2 and nh4 in the prd were as high as 333 5 33 2 and 60 mg l respectively the average concentrations of no3 in granular and fissured aquifers were similar and both were approximately 1 4 1 5 times that in karst aquifers by contrast the average concentrations of no2 and nh4 in granular aquifers were 5 3 and 12 5 times those in fissured aquifers and 29 4 and 40 8 times those in karst aquifers respectively in this study groundwater concentrations of no3 20 mg l as n no2 1mg l as n and nh4 0 5 mg l as n exceeding the groundwater quality standard of china general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china gaqsiqprc 2017 are called high no3 high no2 and high nh4 groundwater respectively as shown in table 1 high no3 high no2 and high nh4 groundwater appeared in 7 0 4 3 and 20 5 of granular aquifers and in 8 3 0 8 and 5 3 of fissured aquifers respectively but did not appear in karst aquifers 4 1 2 groundwater inorganic nitrogen compounds in areas with different urbanization levels in granular aquifers the mean value of groundwater no3 and the proportion of high no3 groundwater in urbanized areas were 1 3 and 1 9 times those in peri urban areas and 1 8 and 7 5 times those in non urbanized areas respectively in fissured aquifers the average concentrations of groundwater no3 in urbanized and peri urban areas were similar and both were approximately 1 6 1 7 times those in non urbanized areas by contrast the proportion of high no3 groundwater in urbanized areas was slightly higher than that in peri urban areas and the proportions in these areas were 2 3 and 1 9 times that in non urbanized areas respectively in granular aquifers the average concentrations of groundwater no2 in urbanized and peri urban areas were simialr and both were approximately 2 9 times that in non urbanized areas by contrast in fissured aquifers the mean value of groundwater no2 in urbanized areas was 1 2 and 4 7 times those in peri urban and non urbanized areas respectively in both granular and fissured aquifers the proportions of high no2 groundwater in peri urban and non urbanized areas were similar and both were slightly lower than those in urbanized areas in granular aquifers the mean value of groundwater nh4 in peri urban areas was 1 7 and 2 1 times those in urbanized and non urbanized areas respectively however the proportion of high nh4 groundwater in urbanized areas was 1 1 times that in peri urban areas and 1 8 times that in non urbanized areas by contrast in fissured aquifers the mean value of groundwater nh4 and the proportion of high nh4 groundwater in urbanized areas were 2 2 and 2 4 times those in peri urban areas and were 2 4 and 8 9 times those in non urbanized areas respectively 4 1 3 groundwater inorganic nitrogen compounds in urbanized areas developed in different periods table 2 summarizes the descriptive statistics for groundwater no3 no2 and nh4 in granular and fissured aquifers in urbanized areas developed in different periods in granular aquifers the mean value of groundwater no3 in ua3rd was 1 2 and 1 1 times those in ua1st and ua2nd respectively by contrast the proportions of high no3 groundwater in ua2nd and ua3rd were similar and both were approximately 2 0 2 1 times that in ua1st in fissured aquifers the average concentrations of groundwater no3 as well as the proportions of high no3 groundwater in ua2nd and ua3rd were much higher than those in ua1st in granular aquifers the average no2 concentrations and proportions of high no2 groundwater in ua2nd and ua3rd were significantly higher than those in ua1st by contrast in fissured aquifers the mean value of groundwater no2 and the proportion of high no2 groundwater in ua2nd were much higher than those in ua3rd and ua1st in granular aquifers the mean value of groundwater nh4 and the proportion of high nh4 groundwater in ua1st were 1 8 and 1 6 times those in ua2nd and were 1 2 and 1 6 times those in ua3rd respectively in fissured aquifers the average concentrations of groundwater nh4 in ua1st and ua2nd were 2 6 and 3 3 times that in ua3rd respectively consequently the proportions of high nh4 groundwater in ua1st and ua2nd were 4 0 and 2 7 times that in ua3rd respectively 4 2 concentrations of inorganic nitrogen compounds in surface water and landfill leachate table s3 presents the descriptive statistics for inorganic nitrogen compounds in surface water and landfill leachate in the prd the concentrations of no3 no2 and nh4 in surface water were as high as 31 8 1 2 and 42 0 mg l respectively the mean and maximum values of nh4 in surface water are higher than those of no3 and no2 because most of the surface water samples were collected from small rivers or ditches with black water anaerobic conditions the mean and maximum concentrations of no3 in groundwater were significantly higher than those in surface water regardless of the aquifer and urbanization level by contrast the mean concentration of nh4 was much lower in groundwater than in surface water regardless of the aquifers and urbanization level nh4 was the main nitrogenous compound in landfill leachates in the prd followed by no3 and the concentrations of no2 in landfill leachates were almost negligible the average concentrations of no3 and nh4 in landfill leachates were much higher than those in groundwater 4 3 spatial distributions of inorganic nitrogen compounds in groundwater in the prd groundwater no3 no2 and nh4 concentrations were divided into classes i to v table s4 that is the no3 concentrations are denoted as no3 i to no3 v and so on as shown in fig 3 high no3 groundwater occurred mainly in urbanized and peri urban areas for example 50 and 33 3 of no3 v groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas respectively similarly 60 9 and 21 7 of no3 iv groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas respectively by contrast only 20 of no3 v and no3 iv groundwater occurred in non urbanized areas high no2 and high nh4 groundwaters also occurred mainly in urbanized and peri urban areas figs 4 and 5 for example all the no2 v groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas and 60 and 20 of no2 iv groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas respectively by contrast no no2 v and only 20 of no2 iv groundwater occurred in non urbanized areas similarly 42 9 and 34 3 of nh4 v groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas 64 and 28 of nh4 iv groundwater occurred in urbanized and peri urban areas respectively note however that 20 of nh4 v groundwater occurred in non urbanized areas mostly near small rivers figs 1 and 5 as shown in table s5 dongguan showed the highest mean concentration of groundwater no3 followed by huizhou foshan guangzhou zhongshan zhuhai zhaoqing jiangmen and shenzhen in addition dongguan also showed the highest proportion of high no3 groundwater followed by zhongshan foshan huizhou guangzhou and jiangmen whereas the other cities such as shenzhen zhaoqing and zhuhai had no high no3 groundwater the mean concentrations of groundwater no2 in various cities in the prd were ordered as follows shenzhen dongguan zhuhai zhongshan foshan zhaoqing guangzhou huizhou jiangmen further dongguan showed the highest proportion of high no2 groundwater followed by zhuhai shenzhen zhongshan foshan and zhaoqing whereas the other cities had no high no2 groundwater the mean concentrations of groundwater nh4 in various cities in the prd were ordered as follows dongguan shenzhen zhuhai guangzhou huizhou foshan zhaoqing zhongshan jiangmen in addition dongguan also showed the highest proportion of high nh4 groundwater followed by zhuhai shenzhen foshan zhongshan guangzhou jiangmen huizhou zhaoqing 4 4 relationships between inorganic nitrogen compounds and other hydrochemical parameters table s6 shows the average concentrations of hydrochemical parameters other than inorganic nitrogen compounds the groundwater chemistry of granular aquifers was controlled by a four factor model table 3 pc3 has a strong positive loading 0 75 with no2 and cod and a moderate positive loading 0 50 with nh4 pc4 has strong and moderate positive loadings with no3 and k respectively in addition pc1 shows strong positive loadings with cl na mg2 and tds and a moderate positive loading with nh4 by contrast the groundwater chemistry of fissured aquifers was controlled by a three factor model and the three pcs accounted for 78 5 of the cumulative variance table 3 pc1 has strong positive loadings with k so4 2 no3 tds and cl and moderate positive loadings with na and ca2 pc2 shows strong positive loadings with no2 and mg2 and a moderate positive loading with hco3 the pc3 has strong positive loadings with nh4 and cod 4 5 relationships between concentrations of inorganic nitrogen compounds and socioeconomic parameters the relationships between the mean concentrations of inorganic nitrogen compounds in groundwater and relevant socioeconomic parameters in nine major cities of the prd were identified by pca note that differences in the socioeconomic parameters of the cities resulting from differences in size were eliminated by using the values of the socioeconomic parameters per square kilometer pc1 shows strong positive loadings with gdp pd dsd pua no2 and ie and a moderate positive loading with nh4 table 4 pc2 has strong positive loadings with tve iwd and no3 and a weak positive loading 0 30 with ie table 4 5 discussion severe contamination of the groundwater of the prd by inorganic nitrogen compounds was observed especially nh4 and no3 contamination in granular and fissured aquifers moreover the concentrations of groundwater no3 and nh4 in the prd were alarmingly high compared with those in other regions worldwide table s7 for instance the maximum and mean concentrations of groundwater no3 in the prd were much higher than those in most regions of the world for example the south eastern river basin in ireland prince edward island in canada bandung basin in indonesia and the state of nuevo leon in mexico similarly the maximum concentration of groundwater nh4 in the prd was much higher than those in manila philippines bangkok thailand jakarta indonesia the la laguna region of mexico the state of michigan in the united states and so on thus we focus on the main origins and driving forces of groundwater nh4 and no3 in granular and fissured aquifers in the following discussion 5 1 origins and driving forces for nitrate in groundwater 5 1 1 sources of high nitrate groundwater domestic sewage industrial wastewater septic tanks animal waste landfills river water and fertilizers are generally nitrogen rich anthropogenic sources wakida and lerner 2005 rao 2006 matiatos 2016 and may be responsible for high no3 groundwater in the prd the pc4 component for granular aquifers has strong and moderate positive loadings with no3 and k respectively table 3 indicating that river water is not the source of high no3 groundwater in granular aquifers in the prd because river water is characterized by low concentrations of k and no3 table s6 and shows little correlation between no3 and k fig s3a table 3 shows that there is little correlation with no3 and cl in the groundwater of granular aquifers indicating that domestic sewage and landfill leachate are also not the major sources of no3 in granular aquifers in the prd because domestic sewage and landfill leachate commonly exhibit significant positive correlations between no3 and cl fig s3b widory et al 2005 in addition the na to k ratio in high no3 groundwater in granular aquifers ranged from 0 44 to 3 15 fig s3c indicating that animal waste is probably the main source of no3 in granular aquifers whereas septic tanks are not because na k 3 2 and 3 2 for septic system waste and animal waste respectively spruill et al 2002 far less fertilizer is used in urbanized areas than in agricultural areas sun et al 2009 and the dose of no3 n in urban fertilizers is commonly less than 20 mg l sharma et al 1996 indicating that the contribution of fertilizers to no3 in granular aquifers in urbanized areas is negligible therefore fertilizer is not the main source of no3 in granular aquifers because most of the high no3 groundwater occurred in urbanized areas table 1 according to the above process of elimination animal waste and wastewater from industry may be the main sources of high no3 groundwater in granular aquifers in the prd because these sources are commonly characterized by high concentrations of no3 and k spruill et al 2002 arienzo et al 2009 however in granular aquifers in ua3rd not only industrial wastewater and animal waste but also domestic sewage are probably the major sources of high no3 groundwater because the pc3 component for granular aquifers in ua3rd shows strong or moderate positive loadings with no3 cl k and na table s8 and the discharge of untreated domestic sewage is common in ua3rd because there are fewer sewer systems in newly urbanized areas the pc1 component of fissured aquifers has strong or moderate positive correlations with k so4 2 no3 tds cl na and ca2 table 3 indicating that high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers may originate from many anthropogenic sources e g domestic sewage septic tanks animal waste industrial wastewater landfills river water and fertilizers the na k ratio of 90 9 of the high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers was less than 2 8 fig s3d indicating that septic tanks are not the main source of no3 in fissured aquifers spruill et al 2002 high no3 levels in fissured aquifers commonly appeared far from rivers figs 1 and 3 indicating that river water is also not the major source of high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers as is the case for granular aquifers fertilizers are also not an important source of high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers owing to the much lower proportion of high no3 groundwater in non urbanized areas compared with that in urbanized areas table 1 less than 10 of high no3 groundwater was found near landfills figs 1 and 3 indicating that landfills are also not the major source of high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers according to the above process of elimination domestic sewage industrial wastewater and animal waste are probably the main sources of high no3 groundwater in fissured aquifers in addition pca was used to determine the key socioeconomic parameters that were responsible for the occurrence of high no3 groundwater on the regional scale zhang et al 2015 taufiq et al 2019 pc2 table 4 has strong positive loadings with no3 iwd and tves and a weak positive loading with ies but little loading with dsd indicating that wastewater from tves industry is the main source of high no3 groundwater in the prd whereas domestic sewage and wastewater from ies industry are not the reason may be differences in the discharge method because domestic sewage and wastewater from ies in urbanized areas in the prd are discharged into sewer systems but wastewater from tves is often discharged directly into the nearby ground without treatment huang et al 2013 thus no occurrence of high no3 groundwater was observed in areas with few tves such as shenzhen zhaoqing and zhuhai table s2 and s5 by contrast more than 10 of high no3 groundwater was observed in areas with many tves such as dongguan and zhongshan table s2 and s5 this finding may explain why the proportions of high no3 groundwater in ua2nd and ua3rd were much higher than that in ua1st because ua2nd and ua3rd had a much higher proportions of tves than ua1st in addition pc2 table 4 shows little loadings with lo and ld indicating that animal waste is probably not the main source of high no3 groundwater in the prd because animal waste is closely related to lo and ld according to the above discussion high no3 groundwater in both granular and fissured aquifers was attributed mainly to illegal discharge of tve wastewater and domestic sewage is also an important source of no3 in fissured aquifers as well as in granular aquifers in ua3rd in addition other anthropogenic sources such as septic tanks animal waste landfills and fertilizers are probably sources of high no3 groundwater in the prd but not the main ones 5 1 2 driving forces of groundwater nitrate contamination industrialization accompanied by leakage of wastewater from tves is likely to be the main driving force for high no3 groundwater in both of granular and fissured aquifers because high no3 groundwater in the prd originates mainly from tve wastewater similarly urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage is also one of the main driving forces of high no3 levels in fissured aquifers as well as in granular aquifers in ua3rd housing construction is probably an important driving force for high no3 groundwater in the prd ua3rd consists of newly urbanized areas most of them were originally peri urban areas so many nitrogen sources remain in the soil because peri urban areas lack sewer systems and nitrogen rich waste is discharged into the nearby ground sun et al 2009 further wakida 2002 revealed that soil disturbance during housing construction increases soil aeration and mixing of nitrogen sources with soil microorganisms under favorable conditions soil microbial activity results in accumulation of nitrate owing to mineralization and nitrification thus the proportions of high no3 groundwater and mean concentrations of groundwater no3 in both granular and fissured aquifers in newly urbanized areas ua2nd and ua3rd were significantly higher than those in older urbanized area ua1st table 2 in addition denitrification has probably reduced no3 contamination in granular aquifers in ua2nd because groundwater in these aquifers is characterized by low eh and high cod values table s6 and the pc4 component for granular aquifers in ua2nd shows a strong positive loading with hco3 and a moderate negative loading with no3 table s8 by contrast nitrification is an important driving force for high no3 levels in fissured aquifers in urbanized areas because fissured aquifers appear in a relatively oxic subsurface environment table s6 and nitrogen rich anthropogenic sources such as sewage and waste are commonly characterized by high concentrations of nh4 and an anoxic environment wakida and lerner 2005 for instance the pc3 component of ua1st table s9 shows a strong negative loading with cod and a moderate positive loading with no3 similarly the pc3 component of ua2nd table s9 shows strong and weak negative loadings with nh4 and cod respectively and a moderate positive loading with no3 both of them indicate that nitrification is one of the main chemical processes controlling the groundwater chemistry of fissured aquifers in urbanized areas developed before 1998 5 2 sources and driving forces of groundwater ammonium the pc3 component of granular aquifers in urbanized areas has strong positive loadings with no2 nh4 and cod table 5 indicating that ammonification and nitrification probably control the groundwater nh4 and no2 levels respectively in these aquifers reichman et al 1966 it is known that mineralization of organic nitrogen in the overlying holocene pleistocene aquitards is mainly responsible for the high nh4 levels in granular aquifers in the prd because these aquitards contain abundant organic nitrogen and are characterized by anoxic environments which convert it to nh4 and hco3 jiao et al 2010 thus groundwater nh4 is significantly positively correlated with hco3 p 0 01 in granular aquifers fig s4a in addition granular aquifers in urbanized areas have relatively anoxic environments and lower eh values than those in other areas table s6 therefore we believe that organic nitrogen in overlying aquitards is the main source of nh4 and no2 in granular aquifers in urbanized areas thus mineralization of organic nitrogen and subsequent nitrification are the main driving forces for high nh4 and high no2 levels in granular aquifers in urbanized areas by contrast organic nitrogen in overlying aquitards is a source but not the main one of high nh4 in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas because the pc1 components of granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas have strong or moderate positive loadings with nh4 cl na mg2 and tds and a weak positive loading with cod table 5 the reason may be the relatively oxic environment and higher eh values in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas compared with those in urbanized areas table s6 on the other hand high nh4 levels in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas may originate from anthropogenic sources such as sewage landfills and river water because leakage of sewage often occurs in peri urban areas owing to the lack of sewer systems huang et al 2018b further irrigation using nh4 rich river water often occurs in non urbanized areas all the landfills in the prd are located in peri urban areas and non urbanized areas sun et al 2009 and these anthropogenic sources are commonly characterized by high concentrations of nh4 cl na mg2 and tds table s6 furthermore most of the nh4 v groundwater in non urbanized areas is near small rivers figs 1 and 5 and small rivers are often nh4 rich table s3 among these anthropogenic sources domestic sewage is likely to be the main source of high nh4 groundwater in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas because the pc1 component table 4 shows strong and moderate positive loadings with dsd and nh4 respectively furthermore less than 5 of the high nh4 groundwater is near landfills figs 1 and 5 indicating that landfills are not the major source of nh4 in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas in addition lu et al 2009 reported that domestic sewage is one of the main sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in rivers in the prd indicating that high nh4 groundwater resulting from irrigation using nh4 rich river water probably originated from domestic sewage thus leakage of domestic sewage and irrigation using nh4 rich river water are likely to be the main driving forces for high nh4 levels in granular aquifers in peri urban and non urbanized areas respectively similar to that of granular aquifers in urbanized areas the pc3 component of fissured aquifers table 3 has strong positive loadings with nh4 and cod and a weak positive loading with hco3 but little loadings with other chemicals such as cl na so4 2 k and tds indicating that anthropogenic sources should be excluded and that ammonification also probably controls the groundwater nh4 in fissured aquifers fissured aquifers overlain by carbon rich strata appear to be most vulnerable to elevated ammonium schilling 2002 thus high nh4 groundwater in fissured aquifers in the prd is mainly located in devonian permian and jurassic triassic strata fig 5 and s2 where carbon rich rocks such as mudstone and shale are common ghst 1981 furthermore groundwater nh4 was positively correlated with hco3 p 0 05 in fissured aquifers fig s4b thus high nh4 levels in fissured aquifers probably originated from the organic nitrogen in carbon rich rocks thus mineralization of organic nitrogen is also probably the main driving force for high nh4 levels in fissured aquifers in addition in fissured aquifers urbanization accompanied by a relatively anoxic environment seems to be another important factor that enhances the mineralization of organic nitrogen because a relatively anoxic subsurface system is often present in urbanized areas umezawa et al 2008 and the proportion of high nh4 levels in urbanized areas table 1 especially in ua1st and ua2nd table 2 is much higher than that in non urbanized areas thus the groundwater in fissured aquifers in ua1st and ua2nd has much lower eh values and higher cod values than that in non urbanized areas table s6 note that there are some limitations on the proposed mechanisms for the origins and processes of no3 and nh4 for instance it is well known that accurate analyses of sources and processes of nitrogen compounds are typically based on isotopic information böhlke et al 2006 hosono et al 2013 pastén zapata et al 2014 taufiq et al 2019 but this study lacks evidences based on stable isotope data in addition this study also presents no data on dissolved organic nitrogen which is important for discussing elevated nh4 in groundwater resulting from mineralization of organic nitrogen 6 conclusions in this study the spatial distributions of no3 no2 and nh4 in the prd were investigated high no3 high no2 and high nh4 groundwater were observed in granular and fissured aquifers but not in karst aquifers in both granular and fissured aquifers the proportions of high no3 and high nh4 groundwater in urbanized areas were nearly or more than twice those in non urbanized areas the proportions of high no3 groundwater in newly urbanized areas were 2 or more times those in old urbanized areas by contrast the proportions of high nh4 groundwater in old urbanized areas were much higher than those in newly urbanized areas the main sources and driving forces of no3 and nh4 in granular and fissured aquifers were identified using hydrochemical and socioeconomic data and pca high no3 levels in both granular and fissured aquifers probably originated mainly from industrialization accompanied by leakage of wastewater from tves urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage is likely to be another main driving force for high no3 levels in fissured aquifers in newly urbanized areas of the prd housing construction probably increased groundwater no3 contamination no3 contamination might be reduced via denitrification in granular aquifers in urbanized areas developed in 1988 1998 whereas it might be increased by nitrification in fissured aquifers in urbanized areas developed before 1998 high nh4 groundwater in granular aquifers in urbanized areas likely originated mainly from mineralization of organic nitrogen in overlying aquitards whereas that in peri urban and non urbanized areas probably originated mainly from urbanization accompanied by leakage of domestic sewage and irrigation using nh4 rich river water respectively by contrast high nh4 groundwater in fissured aquifers was probably attributable mainly to mineralization of organic nitrogen in carbon rich strata and urbanization accompanied by a relatively anoxic environment enhanced this mineralization our study implies that nitrate and ammonium contamination will worsen in the future owing to a lack of effective control and treatment in such rapidly urbanized areas long term monitoring of groundwater no3 and nh4 is needed in newly urbanized areas and old urbanized areas respectively especially in some developing countries supervision of wastewater discharge should be strengthened during urban expansion periods to prevent inappropriate emission of wastewater into groundwater naturally originating high nh4 groundwater on the regional scale can be used as a nitrogen resource for example as a nitrogen fertilizer in agricultural

5847,characterizing the mining induced temporal changes of hydraulic properties of the overburden aquifer is significant for groundwater resource protection conventional hydrogeological methods e g hydraulic test physical model test and numerical simulation of determining hydraulic properties of the overburden aquifer cannot quantitatively analyze the temporal changes of the hydraulic properties induced by mining disturbances this paper demonstrates a quantitative determination for the temporal changes of parameters compressibility porosity and specific storage in the overburden aquifer influenced by the mining processes based on in situ continuous measurements of groundwater level that was affected by earth tide atmospheric loading and mining disturbances the results showed that when working face reached a certain distance 127 m from borehole j6 in this study those parameters compressibility porosity and specific storage of overburden aquifer began to show gradual decrease with approximately up to two order of magnitudes after the working face passed by the observation borehole j6 those properties of overburden aquifer recovered in about 80 days which might reflect the characteristic of elastic deformation of the aquifer those findings of the mining induced parameters temporal changes could improve our understanding of the mining effects on aquifer system and could

overburden aquifer properties will have some changes which will pose a safety threat to mining operations izadi et al 2011 adhikary and guo 2014 for example changes of overburden aquifer properties cause variation of groundwater flow field which may cause leakage loss of groundwater resources water inrush disasters and large disturbance in groundwater system and eco environment thus understanding the temporal evolution of overburden aquifer properties associated with mining activities is very important in preventing mine water disaster and managing water resource investigations into the impacts of mining on overburden aquifer depend on accurate and in situ estimates of the parameters of aquifers common methods for determining the properties of aquifer include hydraulic test with which researchers can acquire aquifer parameters by analyzing the temporal variation of groundwater level fluctuations in pre and post mining stages booth et al 1998 booth 2002 karacan and goodman 2009 in addition physical model test and numerical simulation are another common ways for evaluating the spatial evolution of overburden aquifer properties during mining liu and elsworth 1997 palchik 2003 liu and manga 2009 sui et al 2015 wang et al 2016 however these methods are expensive time consuming and cannot obtain temporal data david et al 2017 sun et al 2018 furthermore these methods rely on specific parameters values derived from literatures or limited field hydraulic test without considering the change process of those parameters including compressibility porosity and specific storage thus the impact of mining on the evolution of aquifer properties has not been fully understood immm 2005 feng et al 2007 adhikary and guo 2014 wang et al 2016 an alternative method is required to study the temporal evolution of overburden aquifer properties during mining process an artesian well may respond to earth tide and barometric pressure fluctuations at different time scales bredehoeft 1967 van der kamp and gale 1983 and the aquifer properties could be inferred by coupling the tidal and barometric pressure fluctuations and groundwater flow caused by the deformation hsieh et al 1987 rojstaczer and agnew 1989 igarashi and wakita 1991 this method presents several advantages for measuring the parameters of an aquifer it is a passive method that avoids any possible disturbance from pumping on the system allègre et al 2016 the temporal variation of the properties of an aquifer could be inferred from the long term monitoring of the level of the well water elkhoury et al 2006 xue et al 2013 the in situ and temporal variation of aquifer properties such as the porosity compressibility and specific storage could be inferred by combing the barometric pressure and tidal response providing a more realistic result than previous studies in this study we attempt to analyze groundwater level fluctuation in response to earth tide and barometric pressure in order to quantify the temporal progressive changes in overburden aquifer properties including porosity compressibility and specific storage as a result of mechanical disturbance due to mining 2 study area and data availability 2 1 overview of mine area the ningtiaota coalfield covering an area of 71 2 km2 is located in the yulin city of shaanxi province china fig 1 yao and xia 2007 the underground coal mines have been put into operation in the coalfield for 10 years longwall mining completely extracts large rectangular areas panels of coal panel s12003 which is typically about 4 km long by 300 m wide and 4 2 m high started mining october 2017 from south to north fig 1 the roof over the narrow strip of working area across the width of the panel is temporarily supported using moveable hydraulic supports which bear the load of the immediate roof strata the study area has a semi arid continental climate with an annual average temperature of 8 6 c according to observational data from 1961 to 2003 at the yulin weather station the annual average precipitation is 434 1 mm while annual average evaporation is 1712 0 mm su et al 2013 the rivers in this area are mainly the kaokaowusu river and its tributaries the kentieling dahoujiamu and xiaohoujiamu rivers and the majiata river s branch lucao river which is near the study area s southern boundary fig 2 2 2 geology and hydrogeology ningtiaota coalfield is located in the northeast of the ordos basin the interior of the basin was relatively stable although the margins were tectonically active wang et al 2014 the study area is located in the interior of the basin and mainly went through vertical lifting and depression without magmatic activity or large faults the strata of the coalfield incline to the northeast as a monoclinic structure and the general inclination is 1 xue et al 2010 ding et al 2016 from bottom to top the strata of the coalfield lies middle jurassic yan an group j2y zhiluo group j2z neogene pliocene baode group n2b middle pleistocene lishi group q2l quaternary alluvium q4 al and eolian sand q4 eol li et al 2008 yang et al 2015 the main mining coal seam 2 2 is located in the yan an group j2y there are four main aquifers in the coalfield the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone aquifer the jurassic zhiluo group j2z weathered fractured aquifer the upper pleistocene salawusu group q3s alluvial aquifers the quaternary holocene alluvium q4 al aquifer aquicludes which consist of the baode group n2b red clay aquiclude and the lishi group q2l loess aquiclude fig 2 among them the jurassic zhiluo group j2z weathered fractured aquifer is a main source for water supply and is a potential threat to coal mining in the coalfield it is characterized as medium coarse grained gravel bearing sandstone with well developed weathered fractures and recharged by groundwater from the lateral or overlying aquifer through weathered fractures according to the pumping and draining tests conducted in the coalfield the hydraulic conductivity of the jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer is 1 98 28 80 m d but hydraulic conductivity of the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone aquifer

watershed flows towards the northeast and then discharges to the kaokaowusu river while groundwater in the south flows to the southeast and eventually discharges to the lucao river fig 2 2 3 data availability 2 3 1 groundwater level and barometric pressure observation the data including groundwater level and barometric pressure for this study was obtained from pressure transducers installed in three boreholes drilled in 2012 labeled as j6 j14 and sk8 in fig 1 j6 borehole is located centrally above s12003 panel and j14 borehole is located in the southwest corner of study area far from panels these two boreholes j6 and j14 with a well radius of 70 mm and depth of open hole of 215 and 188 4 m were penetrated to the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone aquifer fig 2 the boreholes were screened in the jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer with depth of casing pipe including screened section of 151 4 and 146 6 m so the groundwater level in boreholes mainly represents that of j2z sandstone aquifer boreholes j6 and j14 were equipped with absolute pressure gauge solinst solinst canada ltd levellogger to observe the dynamic variation of groundwater level sk8 borehole is located at the southern margin of coalfield and equipped with solinst barologger to observe barometric pressure fig 1 2 3 2 data analysis several methods have been developed to estimate loading efficiency le rasmussen and crawford 1997 anochikwa et al 2012 smith et al 2013 acworth et al 2015 in this study two relatively new methods were used to estimate the le and the applicability of these two methods was investigated the first method is frequency spectrum method fsm with this method the le was estimated by analyzing the groundwater level response to earth tides in this method fast fourier transform fft was used to convert time series of groundwater level data to frequency domain through tsoft package van camp and vauterin 2005 then the fast fourier transform algorithm was used to extract the signal at a certain frequency e g 1 and 2 cycles per day cpd clear peaks observed in groundwater data at 1 and 2 cpd allowed the use of a band pass filter to remove lower and higher frequencies outside of the bandwidth a cut off at 1 9 cpd and a bandwidth of 1 1 cpd this method is used to separate groundwater level response to atmospheric and earth tide and to apply the ratio of earth tides lunar m2 and solar s2 constituent to estimate barometric efficiency and ultimate ss the second method of estimating le is corrected method cm this method has been widely used to estimate in situ le resulting in estimation for in situ β and ss david et al 2017 for this method the pore pressure p should be corrected by using the following equation 1 p p 0 b ave le b a b ave where p0 is the uncorrected groundwater level m ba is the barometric pressure m for each data point and bave is the average barometric pressure m from december 2017 to august 2018 then the time series data of calculated value of p uncorrected groundwater level data and barometric pressure are plotted with this plot le can be calculated by adjusting plotted p to smooth and monotonically curve 3 methodology it is practical to estimate the porosity compressibility and specific storage of a formation if the response of the groundwater level inside the borehole to the earth tide and barometric pressure can be determined bredehoeft 1967 rojstaczer and agnew 1989 the relationships are applied to determine the compressibility β porosity φ and specific storage ss from the response of the observation

sensitivity av is defined as the ratio of the groundwater level fluctuation in response to volumetric strain εv that produced by earth tides the most efficient way for acquiring the volume strain sensitivity av is to quantify the tidal parameters of all the tidal frequencies identified in the observation data the theoretical tides xt represent the sum of all the tidal frequencies contained within the rich tidal spectrum of a particular tidal catalog wenzel 1997 burbey 2010 10 x t k n a k e iω k t where x t is the predicted response or tide forcing function at time t ak is the amplitude

response can be similarly written as 11 y t j k n ω k a k e i ω k t j where y tj is the observed earth tide signal at data point j water level response and ωk is the complex transfer function

secondary loadings the parametric inversion eq 12 is achieved by the program baytap g ishiguro and tamura 1985 which incorporates a bayesian inversion process that allows the parameters ak and bk to be calculated then evaluated by minimizing an akaike bayesian information criterion that is formulated from eq 12 although the output from baytap g provides the amplitude and phase for each tide group the main lines of the spectrum of the tidal potential are due to the o1 k1 m2 and s2 tides bredehoeft 1967 van der kamp and gale 1983 in this study the calculated av of m2 constituent is used to eq 9 because m2 constituent has large signal to noise ratio and it is not contaminated by barometric effects hsieh et al 1987 4 results 4 1 variability in groundwater level associated with longwall extraction the time series data of boreholes j6 and j14 from december 2017 to august 2018 were analyzed fig 3 j6 is located directly above the s12003 panel which has been undermined since october 2017 and the working face of s12003 panel passed j6 on 10th may 2018 j14 borehole is located in the southwest corner of coalfield and far from panels which is used for comparison in this study the location of j6 borehole is set as the original point as shown in fig 3 along the mining direction from south to north i e from left to right in fig 3 the negative value of mining distance represent the distance of working face ahead the j6 borehole and the positive value of mining distance represent the distance of working face passed the j6 borehole as shown in fig 3 the decrease of groundwater level is gradual as the formations are dewatered until the mining distance reached 127 m the groundwater level begin to show an instantaneous decline booth 2007 david et al 2017 the instantaneous change of groundwater level decline indicates the instantaneous presence of abnormal disturbance mining disturbance which infers that the influential distance of working face is about 127 m when the mining distance reached 0 m i e location of j6 borehole groundwater level shows a rapid decline the groundwater level in j6 showed a continuous decrease up to 20 m namely approximately decreased by 54 relative to initial level these larger more rapid changes in hydraulic head were likely due to relative rapid changes in mechanical stress and compressive straining of the formation kim and parizek 1997 then the groundwater level began to recover when the working face passed j6 borehole and recovered to the previous level in 80 days when the mining distance reached 536 m fig 3a the recovery in groundwater level may be related to recharge and stress recovery however as shown in fig 3b the groundwater level in j14 well which is about 1714 m away from s12003 panel was relatively stable without large fluctuation the difference variation characteristics of groundwater level indicate that j6 is influenced by mining activity 4 2 calculation of loading efficiency in this study two relatively new methods fsm and cm were used to estimate the le for barometric pressure and their applicability in our study on the basis of fsm taking the data of december 2017 in borehole j6 as an example fast fourier transform fft was used to convert time series of hydraulic head data theoretical earth tide data calculated by procedure etgtab doan et al 2006 and barometric pressure data in j6 in december 2017 to frequency domain to get the frequency spectrums of these data figs 4 and 5 in fig 4 s2 is the s2 constituent of theoretical earth tide m2 is the m2 constituent of theoretical earth tide s2h is the s2 constituent of groundwater level m2h is the m2 constituent of groundwater level s2a is the s2 constituent of barometric pressure the s2 constituent of groundwater level comprises the input from both the barometric tide s2a and the earth tide s2 existing the relation below acworth et al 2015 13 s 2 h s 2 h earth s 2 h a 14 s 2 h earth m 2 h s 2 m 2 the barometric efficiency be can be calculated from the ratio of s2h a and s2a le can be calculated by the relation between le and be van der kamp and gale 1983 15 le 1 be by using the fsm method the results of le in borehole j6 and j14 from december 2017 to august 2018 were calculated and shown in table 1 from table 1 the calculated le shows stable in j14 and fluctuant in j6 the calculated le of borehole j6 from december 2017 to april 2018 is relatively stable without large anomaly however the le in j6 is negative during may and june 2018 according to the definition le has a range of 0 to 1 doan et al 2006 the working face of s12003 panel passed j6 during may 2018 to june 2018 so the negative le value in j6 wells may indicate the disturbance caused by mining activity fig 6 and table 1 after the working face passed j6 the calculated le value recovered fig 7 and table 1 thus the negative le value in j6 is caused by the mining disturbance on the basis of method of cm the le was calculated with the data of december 2017 in borehole j6 shown in fig 8 then the results of le in boreholes j6 and j14 from december 2017 to august 2018 are calculated and shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 the calculated le of boreholes j6 and j14 are within the reasonable range the calculated le disturbed by mining working face in j6 in may 2018 are smaller than the le without disturbance meanwhile the calculated le value in j14 without any disturbance is relatively stable which also proves the change of le in j6 is caused by the disturbances of mining activity a comparison of le as estimated from fsm and cm was undertaken to analyze the superiority of these two methods the values of le of fsm were estimated by fast fourier transform fft to convert time series of groundwater level theoretical earth tide and barometric pressure thus the results of spectral analysis directly determine the calculation of le mining activity can disturb the stability of frequency spectrum so fsm is not suitable for this study however the calculated le by cm is not disturbed by mining activity thus in this study the cm is suitable for estimating the le for barometric pressure in j6 and j14 4 3 changes in compressibility porosity and specific storage with the calculated le and eqs 2 and 3 the parameters of β and φ were determined fig 9 as shown the changes in β and φ will have a direct response to the mine activities this study compared j6 with j14 to analyze the impact of mining distance in s12003 panel on the temporal evolution of overburden properties in j6 the in situ measurements presented in this study highlight temporal changes in compressibility and porosity associated with the change of the mining distance as shown in fig 9 when the mining distance ranges 1382 m to 127 m the values of β and φ are relatively stable without large anomaly fig 9 when the mining distance reached to 127 m the values of β and φ begin to decrease obviously the β approximately ranges from 9 84e 09 in february 2018 to 5 22e 11 in may 2018 and the φ approximately ranges from 0 31 in february 2018 to 0 003 in may 2018 the β and φ were approximately two order of magnitudes smaller compared with pre mining respectively however the values of β and φ in j14 are remaining stable it is proved that the disturbance of mining activity has impact on the values of β and φ but the compressibility and porosity recovered in about 80 days the ss values in j6 estimated from le varied by two orders of magnitude during the mining period fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the ss values approximately range from 1 06e 05 in december 2017 to 1 57e 07 in may 2018 showing two order of magnitudes decrease however the values of ss in j14 are relatively stable without anomaly it is means that the change of ss value in j6 is caused by the disturbance of the mining activities after working face passed j6 the recovery process of value of ss is similar to the value of β and φ 5 discussion 5 1 applicability of the methods fsm and cm in estimating le value during mining period a comparison of le as estimated from fsm and cm was conducted and the values of le of fsm show abnormal caused by mining disturbance but the values of le of cm always keep in the reasonable range fsm is based on fast fourier transform fft to convert time series of hydraulic head data theoretical earth tide data and barometric pressure data to frequency domain to get the frequency spectrums of these data and s2 and m2 tides in frequency spectrum are the key for calculating barometric loading efficiency when working face is far from j6 from december 2017 to april 2018 the amplitudes of s2 and m2 tides are obvious and the result of le is relatively stable without large anomaly fig 4 however s2 and m2 tides disappear and the result of le is negative during the approaching of working face fig 6 after the working face passed m2 tide recovers but s2 tide is still not obvious fig 7 so s2h a is smaller than that when working face is ahead of j6 meanwhile the s2a is relatively stable barometric pressure without large changes fig 3c consequently the result of be s2h a s2a after the passing of working face is smaller than that from december 2017 to april 2018 inducing a larger le thus it is concluded that mining activity has impact on s2 and m2 tides in frequency spectrum especially for s2 tide in this case fsm might not be suitable for the calculation of le by contrast cm is a better method to calculate le in this study the le values calculated by cm of j6 and j14 are within reasonable range and remain stable when the working face is far away but the calculated le values of borehole j6 disturbed by mining working face are smaller than those of borehole j14 without mining disturbance according to the definition davis and rasmussen 1993 doan et al 2006 loading efficiency le is the ratio of observed pore pressure to an applied barometric load as shown in fig 3c the barometric pressure stably ranges from 0 86 105 to 0 89 105 pa so the pore pressure is the main controlling factor of the le value when the working face approached j6 in may 2018 the groundwater level in j6 declined induced by water draining which caused the decrease of pore pressure in overburden aquifer and the smaller le value after working face passed j6 the le value gradually recovered with the increase of pore pressure in addition the le values of j14 calculated by fsm table 1 are higher than those calculated by cm table 2 this difference may be partly due to the calculation principles fsm is based on the loading of earth tide and barometric pressure but cm is just based on the loading of barometric pressure david et al 2017 5 2 mechanism of the temporal changes of parameters in this study as shown in figs 9 and 10 we determined the temporal changes of parameters including β φ and ss during the mining period these changes of β φ and ss values can take an important role in understanding the response of aquifer system to the mining activities our study showed that the parameters β φ and ss were affected by longwall extraction with more significant disturbance as increasing mining distance when the working face approaches j6 the values of β φ and ss begin to show gradual decrease accompanying with decline of groundwater level according to consolidation theory and principle of effective stress terzaghi 1943 16 σ σ p where σ is applied stress σ is effective stress and p is pore pressure when pore pressure decreases and applied barometric pressure is relatively constant effective stress will increase and the overburden strata will compress leading to a decrease in β φ and ss β is the parameter to measure the compressibility degree of aquifer the aquifer is more difficult to compress with smaller β duncan and bursey 2013 the decrease of β depends on lithology with closure of voids and decrease of porosity in sandstone brantut et al 2014 hu et al 2014 thus the compaction of rocks and closure of voids result in the decrease in β and φ on the basis of the definition of ss rhoads and robinson 1979 the compaction of strata and the decrease of pore pressure will weaken the elastic storage capacity of overburden aquifer generally groundwater level and hydraulic parameters of overburden aquifer will recover after mining activity but they are different from the value before mining booth 2007 david et al 2017 in this study the values of β φ and ss begin to increase after working face passing j6 and recovered to the initial values from december 2017 to april 2018 based on the empirical formula of height of water flow fractured zone including fractured zone and caved zone li 2016 17 h l 100 m 1 6 m 3 6 5 6 where hl is the height of water flow fractured zone m is the thickness of coal seam m 4 2 m it has been calculated that hl is 46 30 m as mentioned above the groundwater level in j6 represented that of jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer the j2z sandstone aquifer is about 55 100 m higher than the main coal seam fig 2 so the j2z aquifer in j6 mainly belongs to constrained zone which is higher than water flow fractured zone in the constrained zone the groundwater level decline is expected to be the result of stress changes compression of strata consistent with literature findings mills 2012 matetic and trevits 1991 according to zhao 2018 in the process of mining the strata of constrained zone will undergo the process of elastic plastic deformation fractured zone will undergo the process of deformation yield and crack caved zone will undergo the process of deformation yield crack crush and caving thus the degree of damage of strata in the constrained zone is lower than that in the fractured zone and caved zone and an elastic deformation might occur and the maximum effective stress didn t reach yield point in typical stress strain curve fig 11 thus the properties of overburden in constrained zone could be recovered in response to stress changes relaxation of strata 6 conclusions the paper presents a measurement of the temporal changes in compressibility β porosity φ and specific storage ss associated with the influence of mining activities along the horizontal direction when working face reached to a certain distance the compressibility porosity and specific storage of the overburden aquifer begin to show obvious decrease approximately two orders of magnitudes then it begins to recover after the working face passing by and those parameters of compressibility porosity and specific storage recovered in about 80 days those findings of mining induced temporal changes of parameters β φ and ss can assist in predicting the groundwater response to the mining activity and in preventing of mine water disaster and protecting groundwater resource

5847,characterizing the mining induced temporal changes of hydraulic properties of the overburden aquifer is significant for groundwater resource protection conventional hydrogeological methods e g hydraulic test physical model test and numerical simulation of determining hydraulic properties of the overburden aquifer cannot quantitatively analyze the temporal changes of the hydraulic properties induced by mining disturbances this paper demonstrates a quantitative determination for the temporal changes of parameters compressibility porosity and specific storage in the overburden aquifer influenced by the mining processes based on in situ continuous measurements of groundwater level that was affected by earth tide atmospheric loading and mining disturbances the results showed that when working face reached a certain distance 127 m from borehole j6 in this study those parameters compressibility porosity and specific storage of overburden aquifer began to show gradual decrease with approximately up to two order of magnitudes after the working face passed by the observation borehole j6 those properties of overburden aquifer recovered in about 80 days which might reflect the characteristic of elastic deformation of the aquifer those findings of the mining induced parameters temporal changes could improve our understanding of the mining effects on aquifer system and could

overburden aquifer properties will have some changes which will pose a safety threat to mining operations izadi et al 2011 adhikary and guo 2014 for example changes of overburden aquifer properties cause variation of groundwater flow field which may cause leakage loss of groundwater resources water inrush disasters and large disturbance in groundwater system and eco environment thus understanding the temporal evolution of overburden aquifer properties associated with mining activities is very important in preventing mine water disaster and managing water resource investigations into the impacts of mining on overburden aquifer depend on accurate and in situ estimates of the parameters of aquifers common methods for determining the properties of aquifer include hydraulic test with which researchers can acquire aquifer parameters by analyzing the temporal variation of groundwater level fluctuations in pre and post mining stages booth et al 1998 booth 2002 karacan and goodman 2009 in addition physical model test and numerical simulation are another common ways for evaluating the spatial evolution of overburden aquifer properties during mining liu and elsworth 1997 palchik 2003 liu and manga 2009 sui et al 2015 wang et al 2016 however these methods are expensive time consuming and cannot obtain temporal data david et al 2017 sun et al 2018 furthermore these methods rely on specific parameters values derived from literatures or limited field hydraulic test without considering the change process of those parameters including compressibility porosity and specific storage thus the impact of mining on the evolution of aquifer properties has not been fully understood immm 2005 feng et al 2007 adhikary and guo 2014 wang et al 2016 an alternative method is required to study the temporal evolution of overburden aquifer properties during mining process an artesian well may respond to earth tide and barometric pressure fluctuations at different time scales bredehoeft 1967 van der kamp and gale 1983 and the aquifer properties could be inferred by coupling the tidal and barometric pressure fluctuations and groundwater flow caused by the deformation hsieh et al 1987 rojstaczer and agnew 1989 igarashi and wakita 1991 this method presents several advantages for measuring the parameters of an aquifer it is a passive method that avoids any possible disturbance from pumping on the system allègre et al 2016 the temporal variation of the properties of an aquifer could be inferred from the long term monitoring of the level of the well water elkhoury et al 2006 xue et al 2013 the in situ and temporal variation of aquifer properties such as the porosity compressibility and specific storage could be inferred by combing the barometric pressure and tidal response providing a more realistic result than previous studies in this study we attempt to analyze groundwater level fluctuation in response to earth tide and barometric pressure in order to quantify the temporal progressive changes in overburden aquifer properties including porosity compressibility and specific storage as a result of mechanical disturbance due to mining 2 study area and data availability 2 1 overview of mine area the ningtiaota coalfield covering an area of 71 2 km2 is located in the yulin city of shaanxi province china fig 1 yao and xia 2007 the underground coal mines have been put into operation in the coalfield for 10 years longwall mining completely extracts large rectangular areas panels of coal panel s12003 which is typically about 4 km long by 300 m wide and 4 2 m high started mining october 2017 from south to north fig 1 the roof over the narrow strip of working area across the width of the panel is temporarily supported using moveable hydraulic supports which bear the load of the immediate roof strata the study area has a semi arid continental climate with an annual average temperature of 8 6 c according to observational data from 1961 to 2003 at the yulin weather station the annual average precipitation is 434 1 mm while annual average evaporation is 1712 0 mm su et al 2013 the rivers in this area are mainly the kaokaowusu river and its tributaries the kentieling dahoujiamu and xiaohoujiamu rivers and the majiata river s branch lucao river which is near the study area s southern boundary fig 2 2 2 geology and hydrogeology ningtiaota coalfield is located in the northeast of the ordos basin the interior of the basin was relatively stable although the margins were tectonically active wang et al 2014 the study area is located in the interior of the basin and mainly went through vertical lifting and depression without magmatic activity or large faults the strata of the coalfield incline to the northeast as a monoclinic structure and the general inclination is 1 xue et al 2010 ding et al 2016 from bottom to top the strata of the coalfield lies middle jurassic yan an group j2y zhiluo group j2z neogene pliocene baode group n2b middle pleistocene lishi group q2l quaternary alluvium q4 al and eolian sand q4 eol li et al 2008 yang et al 2015 the main mining coal seam 2 2 is located in the yan an group j2y there are four main aquifers in the coalfield the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone aquifer the jurassic zhiluo group j2z weathered fractured aquifer the upper pleistocene salawusu group q3s alluvial aquifers the quaternary holocene alluvium q4 al aquifer aquicludes which consist of the baode group n2b red clay aquiclude and the lishi group q2l loess aquiclude fig 2 among them the jurassic zhiluo group j2z weathered fractured aquifer is a main source for water supply and is a potential threat to coal mining in the coalfield it is characterized as medium coarse grained gravel bearing sandstone with well developed weathered fractures and recharged by groundwater from the lateral or overlying aquifer through weathered fractures according to the pumping and draining tests conducted in the coalfield the hydraulic conductivity of the jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer is 1 98 28 80 m d but hydraulic conductivity of the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone aquifer is just 2 69 10 4 3 00 10 4 m d indicating poor permeability groundwater flow in the study area is mainly controlled by topography and bounded by the watershed fig 2 groundwater in the north of the watershed flows towards the northeast and then discharges to the kaokaowusu river while groundwater in the south flows to the southeast and eventually discharges to the lucao river fig 2 2 3 data availability 2 3 1 groundwater level and barometric pressure observation the data including groundwater level and barometric pressure for this study was obtained from pressure transducers installed in three boreholes drilled in 2012 labeled as j6 j14 and sk8 in fig 1 j6 borehole is located centrally above s12003 panel and j14 borehole is located in the southwest corner of study area far from panels these two boreholes j6 and j14 with a well radius of 70 mm and depth of open hole of 215 and 188 4 m were penetrated to the jurassic yan an group j2y sandstone aquifer fig 2 the boreholes were screened in the jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer with depth of casing pipe including screened section of 151 4 and 146 6 m so the groundwater level in boreholes mainly represents that of j2z sandstone aquifer boreholes j6 and j14 were equipped with absolute pressure gauge solinst solinst canada ltd levellogger to observe the dynamic variation of groundwater level sk8 borehole is located at the southern margin of coalfield and equipped with solinst barologger to observe barometric pressure fig 1 2 3 2 data analysis several methods have been developed to estimate loading efficiency le rasmussen and crawford 1997 anochikwa et al 2012 smith et al 2013 acworth et al 2015 in this study two relatively new methods were used to estimate the le and the applicability of these two methods was investigated the first method is frequency spectrum method fsm with this method the le was estimated by analyzing the groundwater level response to earth tides in this method fast fourier transform fft was used to convert time series of groundwater level data to frequency domain through tsoft package van camp and vauterin 2005 then the fast fourier transform algorithm was used to extract the signal at a certain frequency e g 1 and 2 cycles per day cpd clear peaks observed in groundwater data at 1 and 2 cpd allowed the use of a band pass filter to remove lower and higher frequencies outside of the bandwidth a cut off at 1 9 cpd and a bandwidth of 1 1 cpd this method is used to separate groundwater level response to atmospheric and earth tide and to apply the ratio of earth tides lunar m2 and solar s2 constituent to estimate barometric efficiency and ultimate ss the second method of estimating le is corrected method cm this method has been widely used to estimate in situ le resulting in estimation for in situ β and ss david et al 2017 for this method the pore pressure p should be corrected by using the following equation 1 p p 0 b ave le b a b ave where p0 is the uncorrected groundwater level m ba is the barometric pressure m for each data point and bave is the average barometric pressure m from december 2017 to august 2018 then the time series data of calculated value of p uncorrected groundwater level data and barometric pressure are plotted with this plot le can be calculated by adjusting plotted p to smooth and monotonically curve 3 methodology it is practical to estimate the porosity compressibility and specific storage of a formation if the response of the groundwater level inside the borehole to the earth tide and barometric pressure can

extraction the time series data of boreholes j6 and j14 from december 2017 to august 2018 were analyzed fig 3 j6 is located directly above the s12003 panel which has been undermined since october 2017 and the working face of s12003 panel passed j6 on 10th may 2018 j14 borehole is located in the southwest corner of coalfield and far from panels which is used for comparison in this study the location of j6 borehole is set as the original point as shown in fig 3 along the mining direction from south to north i e from left to right in fig 3 the negative value of mining distance represent the distance of working face ahead the j6 borehole and the positive value of mining distance represent the distance of working face passed the j6 borehole as shown in fig 3 the decrease of groundwater level is gradual as the formations are dewatered until the mining distance reached 127 m the groundwater level begin to show an instantaneous decline booth 2007 david et al 2017 the instantaneous change of groundwater level decline indicates the instantaneous presence of abnormal disturbance mining disturbance which infers that the influential distance of working face is about 127 m when the mining distance reached 0 m i e location of j6 borehole groundwater level shows a rapid decline the groundwater level in j6 showed a continuous decrease up to 20 m namely approximately decreased by 54 relative to initial level these larger more rapid changes in hydraulic head were likely due to relative rapid changes in mechanical stress and compressive straining of the formation kim and parizek 1997 then the groundwater level began to recover when the working face passed j6 borehole and recovered to the previous level in 80 days when the mining distance reached 536 m fig 3a the recovery in groundwater level may be related to recharge and stress recovery however as shown in fig 3b the groundwater level in j14 well which is about 1714 m away from s12003 panel was relatively stable without large fluctuation the difference variation characteristics of groundwater level indicate that j6 is influenced by mining activity 4 2 calculation of loading efficiency in this study two relatively new methods fsm and cm were used to estimate the le for barometric pressure and their applicability in our study on the basis of fsm taking the data of december 2017 in borehole j6 as an example fast fourier transform fft was used to convert time series of hydraulic head data theoretical earth tide data calculated by procedure etgtab doan et al 2006 and barometric pressure data in j6 in december 2017 to frequency domain to get the frequency spectrums of these data figs 4 and 5 in fig 4 s2 is the s2 constituent of theoretical earth tide m2 is the m2 constituent of theoretical earth tide s2h is the s2 constituent of groundwater level m2h is the m2 constituent of groundwater level s2a is the s2 constituent of barometric pressure the s2 constituent of groundwater level comprises the input from both the barometric tide s2a and the earth tide s2 existing the relation below acworth et al 2015 13 s 2 h s 2 h earth s 2 h a 14 s 2 h earth m 2 h s 2 m 2 the barometric efficiency be can be calculated from the ratio of s2h a and s2a le can be calculated by the relation between le and be van der kamp and gale 1983 15 le 1 be by using the fsm method the results of le in borehole j6 and j14 from december 2017 to august 2018 were calculated and shown in table 1 from table 1 the calculated le shows stable in j14 and fluctuant in j6 the calculated le of borehole j6 from december 2017 to april 2018 is relatively stable without large anomaly however the le in j6 is negative during may and june 2018 according to the definition le has a range of 0 to 1 doan et al 2006 the working face of s12003 panel passed j6 during may 2018 to june 2018 so the negative le value in j6 wells may indicate the disturbance caused by mining activity fig 6 and table 1 after the working face passed j6 the calculated le value recovered fig 7 and table 1 thus the negative le value in j6 is caused by the mining disturbance on the basis of method of cm the le was calculated with the data of december 2017 in borehole j6 shown in fig 8 then the results of le in boreholes j6 and j14 from december 2017 to august 2018 are calculated and shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 the calculated le of boreholes j6 and j14 are within the reasonable range the calculated le disturbed by mining working face in j6 in may 2018 are smaller than the le without disturbance meanwhile the calculated le value in j14 without any disturbance is relatively stable which also proves the change of le in j6 is caused by the disturbances of mining activity a comparison of le as estimated from fsm and cm was undertaken to analyze the superiority of these two methods the values of le of fsm were estimated by fast fourier transform fft to convert time series of groundwater level theoretical earth tide and barometric pressure thus the results of spectral analysis directly determine the calculation of le mining activity can disturb the stability of frequency spectrum so fsm is not suitable for this study however the calculated le by cm is not disturbed by mining activity thus in this study the cm is suitable for estimating the le for barometric pressure in j6 and j14 4 3 changes in compressibility porosity and specific storage with the calculated le and eqs 2 and 3 the parameters of β and φ were determined fig 9 as shown the changes in β and φ will have a direct response to the mine activities this study compared j6 with j14 to analyze the impact of mining distance in s12003 panel on the temporal evolution of overburden properties in j6 the in situ measurements presented in this study highlight temporal changes in compressibility and porosity associated with the change of the mining distance as shown in fig 9 when the mining distance ranges 1382 m to 127 m the values of β and φ are relatively stable without large anomaly fig 9 when the mining distance reached to 127 m the values of β and φ begin to decrease obviously the β approximately ranges from 9 84e 09 in february 2018 to 5 22e 11 in may 2018 and the φ approximately ranges from 0 31 in february 2018 to 0 003 in may 2018 the β and φ were approximately two order of magnitudes smaller compared with pre mining respectively however the values of β and φ in j14 are remaining stable it is proved that the disturbance of mining activity has impact on the values of β and φ but the compressibility and porosity recovered in about 80 days the ss values in j6 estimated from le varied by two orders of magnitude during the mining period fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the ss values approximately range from 1 06e 05 in december 2017 to 1 57e 07 in may 2018 showing two order of magnitudes decrease however the values of ss in j14 are relatively stable without anomaly it is means that the change of ss value in j6 is caused by the disturbance of the mining activities after working face passed j6 the recovery process of value of ss is similar to the value of β and φ 5 discussion 5 1 applicability of the methods fsm and cm in estimating le value during mining period a comparison of le as estimated from fsm and cm was conducted and the values of le of fsm show abnormal caused by mining disturbance but the values of le of cm always keep in the reasonable range fsm is based on fast fourier transform fft to convert time series of hydraulic head data theoretical earth tide data and barometric pressure data to frequency domain to get the frequency spectrums of these data and s2 and m2 tides in frequency spectrum are the key for calculating barometric loading efficiency when working face is far from j6 from december 2017 to april 2018 the amplitudes of s2 and m2 tides are obvious and the result of le is relatively stable without large anomaly fig 4 however s2 and m2 tides disappear and the result of le is negative during the approaching of working face fig 6 after the working face passed m2 tide recovers but s2 tide is still not obvious fig 7 so s2h a is smaller than that when working face is ahead of j6 meanwhile the s2a is relatively stable barometric pressure without large changes fig 3c consequently the result of be s2h a s2a after the passing of working face is smaller than that from december 2017 to april 2018 inducing a larger le thus it is concluded that mining activity has impact on s2 and m2 tides in frequency spectrum especially for s2 tide in this case fsm might not be suitable for the calculation of le by contrast cm is a better method to calculate le in this study the le values calculated by cm of j6 and j14 are within reasonable range and remain stable when the working face is far away but the calculated le values of borehole j6 disturbed by mining working face are smaller than those of borehole j14 without mining disturbance according to the definition davis and rasmussen 1993 doan et al 2006 loading efficiency le is the ratio of observed pore pressure to an applied barometric load as shown in fig 3c the barometric pressure stably ranges from 0 86 105 to 0 89 105 pa so the pore pressure is the main controlling factor of the le value when the working face approached j6 in may 2018 the groundwater level in j6 declined induced by water draining which caused the decrease of pore pressure in overburden aquifer and the smaller le value after working face passed j6 the le value gradually recovered with the increase of pore pressure in addition the le values of j14 calculated by fsm table 1 are higher than those calculated by cm table 2 this difference may be partly due to the calculation principles fsm is based on the loading of earth tide and barometric pressure but cm is just based on the loading of barometric pressure david et al 2017 5 2 mechanism of the temporal changes of parameters in this study as shown in figs 9 and 10 we determined the temporal changes of parameters including β φ and ss during the mining period these changes of β φ and ss values can take an important role in understanding the response of aquifer system to the mining activities our study showed that the parameters β φ and ss were affected by longwall extraction with more significant disturbance as increasing mining distance when the working face approaches j6 the values of β φ and ss begin to show gradual decrease accompanying with decline of groundwater level according to consolidation theory and principle of effective stress terzaghi 1943 16 σ σ p where σ is applied stress σ is effective stress and p is pore pressure when pore pressure decreases and applied barometric pressure is relatively constant effective stress will increase and the overburden strata will compress leading to a decrease in β φ and ss β is the parameter to measure the compressibility degree of aquifer the aquifer is more difficult to compress with smaller β duncan and bursey 2013 the decrease of β depends on lithology with closure of voids and decrease of porosity in sandstone brantut et al 2014 hu et al 2014 thus the compaction of rocks and closure of voids result in the decrease in β and φ on the basis of the definition of ss rhoads and robinson 1979 the compaction of strata and the decrease of pore pressure will weaken the elastic storage capacity of overburden aquifer generally groundwater level and hydraulic parameters of overburden aquifer will recover after mining activity but they are different from the value before mining booth 2007 david et al 2017 in this study the values of β φ and ss begin to increase after working face passing j6 and recovered to the initial values from december 2017 to april 2018 based on the empirical formula of height of water flow fractured zone including fractured zone and caved zone li 2016 17 h l 100 m 1 6 m 3 6 5 6 where hl is the height of water flow fractured zone m is the thickness of coal seam m 4 2 m it has been calculated that hl is 46 30 m as mentioned above the groundwater level in j6 represented that of jurassic zhiluo group j2z sandstone aquifer the j2z sandstone aquifer is about 55 100 m higher than the main coal seam fig 2 so the j2z aquifer in j6 mainly belongs to constrained zone which is higher than water flow fractured zone in the constrained zone the groundwater level decline is expected to be the result of stress changes compression of strata consistent with literature findings mills 2012 matetic and trevits 1991 according to zhao 2018 in the process of mining the strata of constrained zone will undergo the process of elastic plastic deformation fractured zone will undergo the process of deformation yield and crack caved zone will undergo the process of deformation yield crack crush and caving thus the degree of damage of strata in the constrained zone is lower than that in the fractured zone and caved zone and an elastic deformation might occur and the maximum effective stress didn t reach yield point in typical stress strain curve fig 11 thus the properties of overburden in constrained zone could be recovered in response to stress changes relaxation of strata 6 conclusions the paper presents a measurement of the temporal changes in compressibility β porosity φ and specific storage ss associated with the influence of mining activities along the horizontal direction when working face reached to a certain distance the compressibility porosity and specific storage of the overburden aquifer begin to show obvious decrease approximately two orders of magnitudes then it begins to recover after the working face passing by and those parameters of compressibility porosity and specific storage recovered in about 80 days those findings of mining induced temporal changes of parameters β φ and ss can assist in predicting the groundwater response to the mining activity and in preventing of mine water disaster and protecting groundwater resource

5848,the influence of surface roughness on fluid flow and solute transport through three dimensional 3d crossed rock fractures are investigated by numerical simulations three crossed fracture models with different degrees of surface roughness are established by two intersecting rough walled fractures with four branches the fracture surface morphological data are measured from three natural fractures in sandstone and granite rock samples the fluid flow is simulated by solving the navier stokes equations and solute transport is simulated by solving the advective diffusion equation by rotating one fracture plane while fixing the other series of intersection models with different angles between the two crossed fractures are established to investigate the influence of the intersecting angle simulation results of the rough walled fractures are compared with the smooth parallel plate model showing that the surface roughness significantly enhances channeling and mixing for fluid flow and solute transport at fracture intersections the mechanism is that the complex geometry of the intersection for rough walled models results in reallocation of fluid pathways at the intersection which consequently affect the mixing behavior depending on the peclet number the intersecting angle affects the channeling and mixing behavior because it influences the geometrical structure of the fracture intersection the correlation between the mixing ratio and the geometrical characteristics of intersections is quantified by a relative roughness parameter the results reveal that the widely adopted smooth parallel plate model may lead to significant uncertainty in predicting the solute transport in crossed fractures especially at intersections with unmated fracture surfaces the correlation between the mixing ratio and the roughness parameter developed in this study can be incorporated into discrete fracture network models to improve their performance in estimating solute transport in fractured rocks keywords crossed rock fracture surface roughness channeling flow mixing ratio peclet number 1 introduction modeling of fluid flow and solute transport in rock fractures is a key issue in resolving a great number of geoengineering problems in the disciplines of rock mechanics hydrology and geophysics such as enhanced geothermal systems bächler and kohl 2005 zhao 2016 geological disposal of nuclear waste tsang et al 2015 and closure of faults after earthquakes tenthorey et al 2003 scholz 2019 most fractures in rock formations intersect with each other due to fracture surface roughness the crossed fractures often form intersections with complex geometrical structures which significantly affect fluid flow and solute transport kosakowski and berkowitz 1999 johnson and brown 2001 johnson et al 2006 zou et al 2017a b the effect of surface roughness needs to be quantified to improve the performance of large scale models for fluid flow and solute transport in rock masses since most of the present large scale models still extensively rely on the simplification of smooth parallel plate model and its modified forms for natural rough walled rock fractures e g zimmerman et al 1992 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 ge 1997 bodin et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the effect of surface roughness on the fluid flow and solute transport processes in single rock fractures has been intensively studied in the past decades two typical approaches are adopted to account for the influence of surface roughness the first approach introduces different types of roughness parameters to amend the theoretical solutions for flow and transport such as the modified cubic law ge 1997 brush and thomson 2003 wang et al 2015 the roughness parameters can be statistical indices of the digitized surfaces fractal dimensions and frequencies by wavelet analysis olsson and barton 2001 xiong et al 2011 deng et al 2015 zou et al 2015 li et al 2016a this approach is especially helpful for large scale rock mass models composed of a great number of fractures and is widely adopted in discrete fracture network models zhao et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the second approach attempts to establish high precision models with realistic geometry of void spaces in fractures and directly solve the original governing equations such as the navier stokes equations or the reynolds equation and the advection diffusion equation to obtain the exact flow velocity and solute concentration fields xiong et al 2011 deng et al 2015 kang et al 2016 pyrak nolte and nolte 2016 wang and cardenas 2016 the surface roughness is no longer a correction parameter but is realistically represented as a geometrical model in this case the channelization of flow and dispersion of solutes induced by surface roughness is explicitly modelled such an approach relies on advanced modeling techniques and heavy computational loads which are difficult to directly apply for large scale simulations a detailed simulation approach however can be used to investigate the flow and transport mechanisms in rough walled single fractures or fracture intersections zimmerman et al 2004 xiong et al 2011 wang et al 2015 zou et al 2017a b liu et al 2018 in this study we use detailed simulations to investigate the channeling and mixing mechanisms in 3d rough walled rock fracture intersections the fluid flow and solute mixing behavior at the intersection of crossed fractures is primarily important since the fracture intersections allow different fluid and solute to mix along the flow pathways which significantly affect the entire transport processes in fractured rocks hull and koslow 1986 berkowitz et al 1994 park and lee 1999 johnson and brown 2001 mourzenko et al 2002 johnson et al 2006 hellou and bach 2011 zafarani and detwiler 2013 traditionally solute mixing in crossed fractures is approximated by two simple models i e the complete mixing mode and the streamline routing mode based on the simplification of smooth parallel plates for rock fractures as shown in fig 1 park and lee 1999 complete mixing assumes that the solute is fully mixed at the intersection and solute concentrations in the outlet branches are identical the streamline routing model implies that solute transport completely follows the flow streamlines at the intersection and solute concentrations in the inlet branches are controlled by the flow field in practice the complete mixing mode is more suitable for modeling the diffusion controlled transport while the streamline routing model is more suitable for advection controlled transport e g stockman et al 2001 zafarani and detwiler 2013 in general the mixing ratio at intersections is a function of both flow rates in the four branches and the peclet number pe for homogeneous models without surface roughness hull and koslow 1986 berkowitz et al 1994 park and lee 1999 park et al 2001 philip 1988 park and lee 1999 mourzenko et al 2002 hellou and bach 2011 johnson and brown 2001 grubert 2001 li 2002 johnson et al 2006 michalis et al 2009 zafarani and detwiler 2013 however the simplified 2d intersection models formed by two smooth parallel plates ignore the effects of surface roughness as well as the associated 3d effects on the flow and transport processes such a simplification is inadequate for natural rock fractures and intersections leading to unknown uncertainties in the modelings and predictions in reality natural crossed rock fractures always contain complex geometrical structures in 3d due to surface roughness which leads to a wide spectrum of fluid flow and mixing patterns at the intersections moreno et al 1988 thompson and brown 1991 kosakowski and berkowitz 1999 yeo 2001 li et al 2016b due to the difficulties in detailed experiments and direct numerical simulations only a few studies on the fluid flow and mixing patterns at 3d crossed fracture intersections have been reported for instance johnson and brown 2001 and johnson et al 2006 performed laboratory experiments of fluid flow and mixing within an artificial rough walled fracture intersection made of textured glass zou et al 2017a studied fluid flow and solute mixing behaviors using a 3d model of the fracture matrix system with two orthogonally intersected rough walled rock fractures by direct numerical simulations these studies generally demonstrated that flow through rough walled fracture intersections leads to flow channelization which enhances the solute mixing compared to the 2d intersecting fractures however these studies only considered the simplest orthogonal intersections where the intersecting angle is 90 so that the impact of intersecting angles on the mixing behaviors in 3d crossed fractures remains unknown more importantly these previous studies demonstrated the enhanced mixing behavior by the channelized flow qualitatively only the relationship between the surface roughness and mixing ratio remains unclear therefore systematical and quantitative studies are still needed to quantify the influence of surface roughness on fluid flow and solute transport in 3d crossed fractures the presented study is motivated by aforementioned knowledge gaps our main objectives are 1 to quantitatively characterize the relationship between surface roughness and the mixing behaviors in 3d crossed fractures and 2 investigate the influence of intersecting angles on such behaviors via direct numerical simulation using high resolution models with different characteristics of surface roughness 2 modeling of flow and transport in 3d crossed fractures 2 1 fracture surface digitization representative 3d crossed fracture models are needed for numerical modeling of the fluid flow and solute mixing behaviors to date directly measuring the geometrical structure of natural crossed fractures without disturbing their original state remains a challenge since natural fractures are buried in host rocks subject to the confinements of surrounding rock masses alternately outcrop data or artificially generated fracture surfaces are the most representative way to create fracture geometry models for numerical simulations in this study we use scanned surfaces of several natural rock fractures to generate 3d crossed fracture models by artificially assembling smaller pieces of surfaces selected from the original fracture surfaces here we introduce the procedure of fracture surface digitization details of establishing a 3d crossed fracture models are presented in the next section a 3d optical scanner keyence vr 3100 was used to obtain the digital surfaces of rock fractures the measuring accuracy of this instrument is 2 µm in horizontal x y axes and 3 µm in the vertical z axis the measuring resolution is 0 1 µm to study the influence of surface roughness three natural fracture surfaces with different degrees of roughness were cast using plaster from the outcrops of a construction site for a hydraulic power station the original rocks are fine grained sandstone coarse grained sandstone and granite the plaster samples were then scanned with an interval of 0 2 mm in both x and y directions this magnitude of interval ensures that most surface characteristics could be well represented by the digitized model yong et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 these surfaces exhibit different roughness characteristics where the surface f 1 is the smoothed and that of f 3 is the roughest the dimension of surfaces is 200 mm by 100 mm 2 2 establishment of 3d crossed fracture models the crossed fracture models are established using the digitized surfaces since each scanned outcrop only represents one wall of a fracture each surface is duplicated and then uplifted by 0 8 mm which generates a fully mated rough walled fracture with a constant local aperture 0 8 mm previous studies have revealed that the influence of roughness on fluid flow is negligible for a model with a constant aperture when the flow is in the linear regime zou et al 2017b the upper surface is thereafter shifted along the x axis by 1 mm to artificially simulate a shear process which creates unmated rough walled fracture models with spatially variable aperture a square region with a side length of 20 mm is then selected and symmetrically divided into four parts to generate four branches of a crossed fracture model as shown in fig 3 here u and l represents the upper and lower surfaces of a fracture respectively the dimension of the model is 20 mm along the x axis 10 mm along the y axis and 20 mm along the z axis after establishing the model with an intersecting angle of 90 other models with intersecting angles of 60 45 and 30 are then generated by rotation for comparison a group of smooth parallel plate models is established leading to four groups of models with different roughness which are labeled as smooth parallel plate model ppm rough walled model no 1 rwm 1 rough walled model no 2 rwm 2 and rough walled model no 3 rwm 3 with the increasing roughness as shown in fig 4 in addition three crossed fracture models with mated rough surfaces are also established to illustrate the impact of surface matedness on the flow and mixing behaviors at 3d intersections 2 3 governing equations for isothermal and steady state incompressible newtonian fluids the flow processes are governed by the navier stokes equations written as e g zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 1 ρ u u μ 2 u p 2 u 0 where u m s is the velocity of flow ρ kg m3 is the fluid density p pa is the pressure and μ pa s is the viscosity steady state solute transport is governed by the general advection diffusion equation written as e g bear et al 1993 3 u c d c 0 where c kg m3 is volumetric solute concentration in the fluid phase and d m2 s is the combined dispersion and molecular diffusion coefficient the commercial software comsol multiphysics is employed to perform numerical simulations for fluid flow and solute transport by solving the governing partial differential eqs 1 3 it has been extensively employed for multi physics computations in the fields of rock mechanics and hydrology and has demonstrated superior capability in dealing with problems associated with fluid dynamics and mass transport e g cardenas et al 2007 wang et al 2015 pe is a dimensionless number that has a significant influence on the mixing behavior of solute through crossed fractures it represents the ratio between the convection rate and diffusion rate written as 4 p e q wd where q m3 s is the flow rate and w m is the width of the fracture to ensure that the flow is within the linear regime the reynolds number re was calculated by 5 r e ρ q w μ 2 4 boundary conditions among the four branches of each model b 1 and b 2 as shown in fig 3 are selected as inlet branches and the rest two are outlet branches to facilitate the numerical simulation and control of re and pe numbers for the study of pe dependent mixing ratio in crossed fractures identical flow rates are imposed on the two inlet branches the boundary condition of constant flow rate rather than constant pressure is adopted because it is straightforward to control the re and pe numbers by flow rate applying pressure boundary condition may lead to different flow rates into the inlets since the cross sectional areas of the two inlets may be different solute with a concentration of c c 0 1 mol m3 is continuously injected at the inlet i 1 fig 3 pressure p 0 boundary conditions are assigned at the two outlet boundaries such assignment of boundary conditions is intended to mimic the mixing phenomenon of contaminated and uncontaminated groundwater at fracture intersections in rock masses given the low permeability of crystalline and other rock type matrices flow in the rock matrix is neglected therefore impermeable boundary conditions are assigned to the fracture walls the matrix diffusion is not considered in this study since previous studies indicated that the matrix diffusion has negligible influences on the mixing behavior over a short time scale zou et al 2017a the fluid used in the simulations is water at 10 c and the values of parameters used in simulations are given in table 1 a series of simulations for flow rate ranging from 2 03 10 12 to 1 218 10 8 m3 s are conducted leading to the pe number ranging from 0 1 to 600 for the case with the maximum flow rate the re remains smaller than 1 indicating that the flow in all simulations may remain in the linear regime zimmerman et al 2004 this has also been confirmed by analyzing the calculated relationship between fluid rate and hydraulic gradient 3 roughness analysis 3 1 roughness of fractures a wide spectrum of descriptive methods and parameters have been developed for characterizing the roughness of fracture surfaces some parameters have been linked to the mechanical hydraulic and solute transport properties of rock fractures zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 olsson and barton 2001 xiong et al 2011 deng et al 2015 however the applicability of these parameters to crossed fractures especially for quantifying the mixing behavior of solute has not been verified our choice here is a simple dimensionless parameter z 2 it is defined as the root mean square of the first deviation of a profile written as myers 1962 6 z 2 1 n z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 where xi and zi are coordinates of the length and height of a surface profile and n is sampling point number in the length direction due to the clear definition and the simplicity in calculation z 2 has been widely accepted for characterizing the surface roughness of rock fractures zhao et al 2013 li and huang 2015 in the discipline of rock mechanics and rock engineering one of the most important parameters for roughness characterization is the joint roughness coefficient jrc barton et al 1985 it quantifies the roughness of a profile by a series of values ranging from 0 to 20 which are typically back calculated from tilt test results on fracture samples this parameter links the hydro mechanical behavior of fractures to their roughness which can also be estimated from z 2 by tse and cruden 1979 7 jrc 32 2 32 47 log z 2 compared to z 2 jrc is not defined in a mathematically rigorous manner but it could provide a generic understanding on the roughness degree of a fracture applying eqs 6 and 7 to the digitized surface data their average jrc values of all cross sectional profiles with an interval of 0 2 mm were estimated as tabulated in table 2 the results show that the jrc value ranges are 0 2 10 12 16 18 for the surfaces f 1 f 2 and f 3 respectively jrc 0 represents a smooth parallel plate model and jrc 20 represents the considerably rough fractures rarely encountered in practices therefore these three surfaces represent the smooth moderate and very rough fracture surfaces respectively that could facilitate the following investigations on the effects of roughness the fractions of apertures of the three rough walled models are shown in fig 5 since an initial aperture of 0 8 mm is applied to the original fractures the distributions are centered at values close to 0 8 mm with the increasing roughness the aperture distribution extends to broader ranges that follow normal distributions the distributions reveal that a rougher surface produces a greater degree of variations in the local apertures and therefore could form more complex void geometries 3 2 geometrical characteristics of the intersections the most significant difference between crossed fractures and single fractures lies in the existence of the intersection beside the roughness of fracture walls the geometrical characteristics of the intersection may make an even greater impact on the fluid flow and transport behaviors fig 6 shows the 2d view of the intersection facets and 3d view of the intersections of the three rough walled models at an intersecting angle of 90 the intersection of rwm 1 exhibits a slightly curved shape with a mostly uniform aperture at each facet while the intersection of rwm 3 shows a largely twisted shape with remarkable variations in the local apertures among the four facets and within each facet the degree of variation in the apertures of rwm 2 was between those of rwm 1 of rwm 3 the mean aperture of the intersection facets and the mean aperture of the branches are tabulated in table 3 the mean aperture of the fracture branch and the mean aperture of the corresponding intersection facet is roughly correlated in magnitude but also show different degrees of deviations such heterogeneity and randomness in the local aperture of the intersection originate from the unmated nature of these rough surfaces which results in the diversity of the geometry of intersections formed by different original fractures these geometrical characteristics are similar for models intersected at different angles when they are formed by the same original fracture therefore the details of their values are not presented z 2 is effective in characterizing the surface roughness which however is difficult to apply for quantifying aperture variations here a well accepted parameter relative standard deviation rsd also known as relative roughness was employed to characterize the aperture variation of intersections kang et al 2016 wang and cardenas 2016 8 rsd i 1 n e i e 2 n 1 e 100 where e i is the local aperture with a total number of n and e is their mean value 4 results and analysis 4 1 channeling flow the maximum re 1 table 1 thus the flow is likely to maintain in the linear laminar regime the distribution of streamlines are then constant regardless of the re number the case of pe 1 is selected to represent the streamline distributions for the models with different intersecting angles as shown in fig 7 in these figures fluids from the two inlet branches are differentiated using the black and red colors where the red represents the fluid containing solutes the flow pattern in the ppm is uniform and symmetrical regardless of the intersecting angle the fluids from the two inlet branches do not interfere with each other which conforms to the theoretical solution of fluid flow in the ppm as shown in fig 1 in contrast the streamlines in the rwms are tortuous in the branches and are partially redirected to the neighbor branches at the intersections the solution in red color that completely flows to the outlet branch b 4 fig 7d according to the result of ppm appears simultaneously in both outlet branches in rwms this channelization phenomenon is induced by the geometrical variation of the intersections which become more obvious as the roughness increases by comparing fig 7h l and p such channelization in space cannot be realized in 2d crossed fracture models fig 1 which again suggests the necessity to investigate the flow and transport behavior of natural rock fractures based on 3d rough walled models for each rwm the variations in streamline distributions are negligible among the cases with different intersecting angles since they are formed by the same original fractures 4 2 concentration distributions fig 8 shows the concentration distributions for cases with an intersecting angle of 90 at different pe numbers ranging from 0 1 to 600 where the solute is injected from i 1 when pe 0 1 the dominant mode of solute transport through the intersection is diffusion and the concentration in the two outlet branches are identical for all models which conforms to the complete mixing mode in this case solutes are fully mixed at the intersection and then flow into the two outlet branches the amount of solutes flowing out from each outlet branch is positively correlated with the flow rate of each branch with the increasing pe number the effect of convection gradually prevails and the solute concentration in the outlet branch b 4 becomes greater than that in the b 3 following the streamline routing mode this transition mainly happens when the pe number increases from 1 to 100 after which the change of concentration distributions become negligible at large pe the concentration distributions of the rwms are obviously affected by the structure of streamlines as observed by comparing figs 7 and 8 as expected the concentration field is more heterogeneous in rougher fractures the channelization of streamlines produces fast pathways for solute transport which enhances the exchange of fluids between the branches at the intersection fluids with a wide spectrum of concentrations appear in the outlet branches b 3 and b 4 at relatively low pe numbers e g pe 10 for rwm 2 this result indicates that the roughness induced channelization significantly enhances solute mixing in 3d crossed rough walled fractures 4 3 mixing ratio the mixing ratio defined below is used to quantify solute mixing in 3d crossed fractures when different solute concentrations mix at fracture intersections stockman et al 1997 park and lee 1999 johnson et al 2006 zafarani and detwiler 2013 8 m r q 3 c 3 q 3 c 3 q 4 c 4 where q 3 and q 4 are the flow rates and c 3 and c 4 are the mean concentrations at the outlets o 3 and o 4 respectively as indicated by eq 8 the mixing ratio is controlled by both the flow rates and the mean concentrations at the two outlets the flow rate is proportional to the aperture of each branch cubed consistent with the cubic law therefore mr is subject to change if the outlet branches have different apertures i e q 3 q 4 to clarify the influence of such differential flow rates the values of mr of a series of ppms with different ratios of the apertures of b 3 to b 4 are calculated as shown in fig 9 this ratio is defined as r that ranges from 0 2 to 5 only ppm is taken into account in order to eliminate the influence of roughness the results of the three rough walled cases with the intersecting angle of 90 are also plotted for comparison the values of mr exhibit a descending tendency with increasing pe the significant change happens when pe increases from 1 to 100 before and after that the value of mr is roughly constant for each case which is in concert with the observations on the concentration distributions shown in fig 8 for a ppm with an identical aperture of the two outlet branches i e r 1 mr has a high limit value of 0 5 at a sufficiently small pe which then approaches a low limit value of 0 as pe increases the high and low limits 0 5 and 0 represent the complete mixing and streamline routing modes respectively it is obvious from eq 2 that the value of mr will approach 0 or 1 when the value of r approaches 0 or becomes infinitely large respectively as confirmed by the curves of r 0 2 and r 5 on fig 9 it is notable that the low limit increases simultaneously with the increasing high limit which will not reach 0 when the value of r is greater than 1 due to the reallocation of solutes to the dominant branch i e b 3 that has a greater aperture the difference between the two limits reaches the maximum 0 5 when r 5 and decreases with the increase or decrease of r the values of flow rate ratio and flow flux ratio are also plotted on fig 9 for pe assumed 0 1 and 600 respectively the flow rate ratio is defined by q 3 q 3 q 4 that represents the fraction of flow rate at o 3 to the total value the flow flux ratio is defined by the ratio of the specific flow flux originating from b 1 that entered b 3 to the total flux in b 1 as shown by the red color in fig 7 this ratio is calculated by comparing the number of streamlines in red color in b 3 to that in b 1 given that each streamline represents an identical magnitude of flux the high limit of each case is identical to the corresponding flow rate ratio indicating with complete mixing the mixing ratio is only controlled by the relative magnitude of flow rates in the outlet branches on the other hand the low limit of each case is identical to the corresponding flow flux ratio which reflects the essence of the mixing ratio at the streamline routing mode the mixing ratio is governed by the relative magnitude of flow fluxes containing solutes in the outlet branches since the solutes only transport along the streamlines without diffusion in this mode the curves of three rwms exhibit similar descending tendencies with those of the ppms possessing different high and low limits since the low limits of them are all greater than 0 their values of r should be greater than 1 which agrees with the measured aperture of each branches as tabulated in table 3 their high and low limits show some deviations from the prediction of ppms due to the effect of roughness which will be discussed more in the next subsection the mixing ratios for the models with different intersecting angles are shown in fig 10 the curves of ppms completely overlap with each other indicating that the intersecting angle does not affect the mixing ratio for ppm for each rwm the curves of different angles share an almost identical initial value of mr since these models have identical apertures flow rates of each branch the deviation gradually becomes obvious as pe increases and the greater the surface roughness the smaller the deviation when rough walled fractures are intersecting at different angles the specific geometry of the intersection may be slightly altered resulting in the variations in channeling flow at different degrees the low limit determined under the streamline routing mode is strongly affected by the channeling flow that is the source of the reallocation of solutes which is responsible for these deviations a rougher model has a smaller difference between the high and low limits therefore the deviations among curves of different angled models are narrowed down the influence of intersecting angle stems from the geometrical characteristics of the intersections that can also be attributed to the effect of roughness 4 4 effects of roughness the above results have revealed that both of the differences in the apertures of branches and the surface roughness are influential factors to the flow and transport behaviors in crossed fractures to investigate the role played by the roughness the effect of the difference in aperture needs to be eliminated from the results first fig 9 has demonstrated that the difference in aperture and the roughness affects the high and low limits simultaneously therefore the difference between the high and low limits δmr is used to represent their effects since the roughness in the models with different intersecting angles has a similar effect on mixing only the cases intersected at 90 are analyzed here the calculated δmr for the rwm 1 rwm 2 and rwm 3 are 0 40 0 29 and 0 18 respectively since the value for δmr is 0 5 for the ppm with an identical aperture these values are in concert with the fact that a rougher model leads to a greater deviation from the theoretical value according to the mean aperture of each branch of the rwms table 3 three new ppms are established that have identical aperture to the corresponding fracture branches of the rwms the calculated δmr for these ppms are 0 42 0 34 0 30 corresponding to the rwm 1 rwm 2 and rwm 3 respectively the deviation of these values from 0 5 reflects the effect of the difference in the aperture on the mixing ratio which has a positive relation with the aperture difference table 3 finally subtraction of the δmr between the original rwms and their corresponding ppms yields the net contribution of roughness to the mixing ratio δmr the values of δmr for the rwm 1 rwm 2 and rwm 3 are 0 02 0 05 and 0 12 respectively the value of δmr apparently increases with increasing roughness figs 6 8 have demonstrated that a rougher fracture could form more complex geometry of the intersection which in turn enhances the channelization and mixing in the crossed fractures here three parameters were selected to represent the rough nature of the branch and the intersection z 2 of the branches see table 2 z 2 of the intersecting profiles i e four corner profiles of an intersection and rsd of the intersection apertures see fig 6 the mean values for the branches profiles or apertures are calculated as summarized in tables 2 and 3 these parameters systematically reflect the geometrical characteristics of the fracture surfaces intersection profiles and the resulting aperture of intersections the values of δmr are plotted against these parameters as shown in fig 11 although all three parameters exhibit a similar tendency the rsd shows a strong linear correlation with δmr in a form of δmr 0 4 rms indicating that δmr is more intimately related with the geometrical characteristics of the intersection apertures rather than the surface roughness this agrees with the fact that it is the local aperture distribution that determines the fluid flow and solute transport in fractures johnson and brown 2001 johnson et al 2006 zou et al 2017a b the channelization is primarily induced by the specific geometry of the intersection which is the mechanism that drives the reallocation of solutes the aperture distribution is the product of the two fracture walls therefore these three parameters are fundamentally related however it is well known that the surface roughness of rock fractures possesses some degree of randomness the intersections formed by fractures with the same degree of roughness e g identical jrc may present considerably different geometrical characteristics which explains the deviation between the surface parameters and the aperture parameter in fig 11 4 5 effects of matedness the above results have demonstrated that in the unmated rough walled models the roughness significantly alters mixing at intersections for fresh tensile fractures the walls of each branch may remain a well mated status before mechanical processes such as shear sliding and chemical alterations take effect in such a case one wall of each branch is a replica of the other wall and the local aperture is constant at any location the variation in the local aperture of the intersection naturally vanishes numerical simulations on three mated models based on the same surfaces as the unmated models fig 2 are conducted and the results are shown in fig 12 a constant aperture of 0 8 mm is assigned for all branches it is obvious that the concentration fields in the mated models are almost identical to those of the ppm shown in fig 8 except that reallocation of fluids happens slightly on a few isolated locations along the intersection this is because for mated rough walled cases the streamlines are not disturbed in the x y plane and the tortuosity exists only in the z direction the tortuosity close to the intersection may enforce a small portion of fluid flow into the neighboring branch such as from b 1 to b 3 as shown in fig 13 the results of mated and unmated cases are compared to the results of previous studies it is obvious that all the 3d models exhibit a similar evolutionary tendency that is different from those previous 2d models the discrepancy between the 3d model results and those of previous 2d models is caused by the fact that the complex aperture geometry in 3d have been fully modeled in present study while those previous 2d models only used crossed parallel plates or simplified cross sectional profiles to represent the fracture intersection this result indicates that it is important to consider the impact of 3d surface roughness on the mixing ratio at crossed fractures and the mixing ratio obtained from 2d models without consideration of surface roughness may produce biased estimations for solute transport in natural fractured rocks although the 3d mated cases are made up of rough walled fractures in contrast to the unmated models the curves of mixing ratio are close to that of the 3d ppm the values of δmr for the three mated cases are 0 021 0 037 and 0 041 increasing with increasing roughness from f1 to f3 these values are less than 10 of the δmr for ppm i e 0 5 indicating that the effect of surface roughness on mixing in mated fracture surface cases is negligibly small 5 conclusions in this study we systematically investigate fluid flow and solute mixing in 3d crossed rock fracture models taking into account the effects of surface roughness intersecting angle pe and fracture matedness the 3d crossed rough walled fracture models are established based on digitized natural rock fractures the impacts of intersection geometry and fracture aperture on the fluid flow and solute mixing in 3d crossed rough walled fractures are quantitatively characterized for the first time the main findings are summarized as follows 1 in 3d crossed rough walled rock fractures with unmated surfaces the heterogeneity of geometrical structures at the intersection and variable fracture apertures lead to preferential channelized flow which significantly enhances solute mixing at the intersection this feature emerges even when pe is as low as around one the enhanced mixing ratio generally increases with the increasing surface roughness especially when pe 100 note that the preferential channelized flow behavior cannot be observed in parallel plate models that are widely adopted in previous studies e g park and lee 1999 stockman et al 2001 zafarani and detwiler 2013 2 the mixing mode in 3d crossed rough walled rock fractures gradually transits from the complete mixing mode to the streamline routing mode when pe increases from 0 1 to 600 for all cases the mixing ratio decreases from 0 5 to 0 for the parallel plate model with an identical aperture in each branch in contrast mixing in rough walled rock fractures significantly deviate from that of the parallel plate model where the mixing ratio exhibits larger variations with increasing degree of surface roughness the ranges of pe for different mixing behaviors and the dependence of the mixing ratio variations on surface roughness are quantified for the first time 3 the effect of intersecting angle stems from the variation in intersection geometries which is negligibly small for the models with the same level of roughness in the linear flow regime this finding reveals that it is more important to consider the local intersection apertures rather than the intersection angle in quantification of the mixing behaviors at realistic rock fracture intersections it is unnecessary to take the intersecting angle as an independent variable for modeling of solute mixing in crossed fractures 4 regardless of the degree of fracture surface roughness the solute mixing in mated fractures behave analogously to that in the smooth parallel plate model for unmated cases the roughness and the mixing behavior can be characterized by the roughness parameter rsd that quantifies the variation of local aperture at the intersection therefore the parallel plate model may be applicable to fractured rock with predominantly mated fractures and the roughness parameter should be introduced for unmated fractures in order to improve the accuracy of assessments quantification of fluid flow and solute mixing at 3d fracture intersections is a crucial step to understand groundwater flow and solute transport in large scale fracture networks due to the difficulties in measuring modelling and simulating of the specific geometrical structures of each intersection in large scale fracture networks the surface roughness is often neglected or only represented by some empirical parameters to improve the efficiency in assessment the quantified mixing ratios presented in this study provide a possibility to correct the mixing results predicted by using the parallel plate model locally in large scale fractured systems it may largely improve the assessment accuracy compared to the parallel plate model while maintaining computational efficiency note that due to limited fracture surfaces and the limited range of pe considered in the present study the relationship between surface roughness and the mixing ratio shown in fig 11 needs to be further verified with a broader scope of geometrical and hydraulic conditions in the future meanwhile the mechanical process including shear and or closure could significant affect geometrical structure and consequently influence the flow and solute transport at the intersections therefore hydro mechanical coupling embedded with a solute transport module needs to be developed to account for the potential mechanical effects on fluid flow and solute transport processes in rough walled crossed fractures which is an important topic for future study declaration

5848,the influence of surface roughness on fluid flow and solute transport through three dimensional 3d crossed rock fractures are investigated by numerical simulations three crossed fracture models with different degrees of surface roughness are established by two intersecting rough walled fractures with four branches the fracture surface morphological data are measured from three natural fractures in sandstone and granite rock samples the fluid flow is simulated by solving the navier stokes equations and solute transport is simulated by solving the advective diffusion equation by rotating one fracture plane while fixing the other series of intersection models with different angles between the two crossed fractures are established to investigate the influence of the intersecting angle simulation results of the rough walled fractures are compared with the smooth parallel plate model showing that the surface roughness significantly enhances channeling and mixing for fluid flow and solute transport at fracture intersections the mechanism is that the complex geometry of the intersection for rough walled models results in reallocation of fluid pathways at the intersection which consequently affect the mixing behavior depending on the peclet number the intersecting angle affects the channeling and mixing behavior because it influences the geometrical structure of the fracture intersection the correlation between the mixing ratio and the geometrical characteristics of intersections is quantified by a relative roughness parameter the results reveal that the widely adopted smooth parallel plate model may lead to significant uncertainty in predicting the solute transport in crossed fractures especially at intersections with unmated fracture surfaces the correlation between the mixing ratio and the roughness parameter developed in this study can be incorporated into discrete fracture network models to improve their performance in estimating solute transport in fractured rocks keywords crossed rock fracture surface roughness channeling flow mixing ratio peclet number 1 introduction modeling of fluid flow and solute transport in rock fractures is a key issue in resolving a great number of geoengineering problems in the disciplines of rock mechanics hydrology and geophysics such as enhanced geothermal systems bächler and kohl

berkowitz 1999 johnson and brown 2001 johnson et al 2006 zou et al 2017a b the effect of surface roughness needs to be quantified to improve the performance of large scale models for fluid flow and solute transport in rock masses since most of the present large scale models still extensively rely on the simplification of smooth parallel plate model and its modified forms for natural rough walled rock fractures e g zimmerman et al 1992 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 ge 1997 bodin et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the effect of surface roughness on the fluid flow and solute transport processes in single rock fractures has been intensively studied in the past decades two typical approaches are adopted to account for the influence of surface roughness the first approach introduces different types of roughness parameters to amend the theoretical solutions for flow and transport such as the modified cubic law ge 1997 brush and thomson 2003 wang et al 2015 the roughness parameters can be statistical indices of the digitized surfaces fractal dimensions and frequencies by wavelet analysis olsson and barton 2001 xiong et al 2011 deng et al 2015 zou et al 2015 li et al 2016a this approach is especially helpful for large scale rock mass models composed of a great number of fractures and is widely adopted in discrete fracture network models zhao et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the second approach attempts to establish high precision models with realistic geometry of void spaces in fractures and directly solve the original governing equations such as the navier stokes equations or the reynolds equation and the advection diffusion equation to obtain the exact flow velocity and solute concentration fields xiong et al 2011 deng et al 2015 kang et al 2016 pyrak nolte and nolte 2016 wang and cardenas 2016 the surface roughness is no longer a correction parameter but is realistically represented as a geometrical model in this case the channelization of flow and dispersion of solutes induced by surface roughness is explicitly modelled such an approach relies on advanced modeling techniques and heavy computational loads which are difficult to directly apply for large scale simulations a detailed simulation approach however can be used to investigate the flow and transport mechanisms in rough walled single fractures or fracture intersections zimmerman et al 2004 xiong et al 2011 wang et al 2015 zou et al 2017a b liu et al 2018 in this study we use detailed simulations to investigate the channeling and mixing mechanisms in 3d rough walled rock fracture intersections the fluid flow and solute mixing behavior at the intersection of crossed fractures is primarily important since the fracture intersections allow different fluid and solute to mix along the flow pathways which significantly affect the entire transport processes in fractured rocks hull and koslow 1986 berkowitz et al 1994 park and lee 1999 johnson and brown 2001 mourzenko et al 2002 johnson et al 2006 hellou and bach 2011 zafarani and detwiler 2013 traditionally solute mixing in crossed fractures is approximated by two simple models i e the complete mixing mode and the streamline routing mode based on the simplification of smooth parallel plates for rock fractures as shown in fig 1 park and lee 1999 complete mixing assumes that the solute is fully mixed at the intersection and solute concentrations in the outlet branches are identical the streamline routing model implies that solute transport completely follows the flow streamlines at the intersection and solute concentrations in the inlet branches are controlled by the flow field in practice the complete mixing mode is more suitable for modeling the diffusion controlled transport while the streamline routing model is more suitable for advection controlled transport e g stockman et al 2001 zafarani and detwiler 2013 in general the mixing ratio at intersections is a function of both flow rates in the four branches and the peclet number pe for homogeneous models without surface roughness hull and koslow 1986 berkowitz et al 1994 park and lee 1999 park et al 2001 philip 1988 park and lee 1999 mourzenko et al 2002 hellou and bach 2011 johnson and brown 2001 grubert 2001 li 2002 johnson et al 2006 michalis et al 2009 zafarani and detwiler 2013 however the simplified 2d intersection models formed by two smooth parallel plates ignore the effects of surface roughness as well as the associated 3d effects on the flow and transport processes such a simplification is inadequate for natural rock fractures and intersections leading to unknown uncertainties in the modelings and predictions in reality natural crossed rock fractures always contain complex geometrical structures in 3d due to surface roughness which leads to a wide spectrum of fluid flow and mixing patterns at the intersections moreno et al 1988 thompson and brown 1991 kosakowski and berkowitz 1999 yeo 2001 li et al 2016b due to the difficulties in detailed experiments and direct numerical simulations only a few studies on the fluid flow and mixing patterns at 3d crossed fracture intersections have been reported for instance johnson and brown 2001 and johnson et al 2006 performed laboratory experiments of fluid flow and mixing within an artificial rough walled fracture intersection made of textured glass zou et al 2017a studied fluid flow and solute mixing behaviors using a 3d model of the fracture matrix system with two orthogonally intersected rough walled rock fractures by direct numerical simulations these studies generally demonstrated that flow through rough walled fracture intersections leads to flow channelization which enhances the solute mixing compared to the 2d intersecting fractures however these studies only considered the simplest orthogonal intersections where the intersecting angle is 90 so that the impact of intersecting angles on the mixing behaviors in 3d crossed fractures remains unknown more importantly these previous studies demonstrated the enhanced mixing behavior by the channelized flow qualitatively only the relationship between the surface roughness and mixing ratio remains unclear therefore systematical and quantitative studies are still needed to quantify the influence of surface roughness on fluid flow and solute transport in 3d crossed fractures the presented study is motivated by aforementioned knowledge gaps our main objectives are 1 to quantitatively characterize the relationship between surface roughness and the mixing behaviors in 3d crossed fractures and 2 investigate the influence of intersecting angles on such behaviors via direct numerical simulation using high resolution models with different characteristics of surface roughness 2 modeling of flow and transport in 3d crossed fractures 2 1 fracture surface digitization representative 3d crossed fracture models are needed for numerical modeling of the fluid flow and solute mixing behaviors to date directly measuring the geometrical structure of natural crossed fractures without disturbing their original state remains a challenge since natural fractures are buried in host rocks subject to the confinements of surrounding rock masses alternately outcrop data or artificially generated fracture surfaces are the most representative way to create fracture geometry models for numerical simulations in this study we use scanned surfaces of several natural rock fractures to generate 3d crossed fracture models by artificially assembling smaller pieces of surfaces selected from the original fracture surfaces here we introduce the procedure of fracture surface digitization details of establishing a 3d crossed fracture models are presented in the next section a 3d optical scanner keyence vr 3100 was used to obtain the digital surfaces of rock fractures the measuring accuracy of this instrument is 2 µm in horizontal x y axes and 3 µm in the vertical z axis the measuring resolution is 0 1 µm to study the influence of surface roughness three natural fracture surfaces with different degrees of roughness were cast using plaster from the outcrops of a construction site for a hydraulic power station the original rocks are fine grained sandstone coarse grained sandstone and granite the plaster samples were then scanned with an interval of 0 2 mm in both x and y directions this magnitude of interval ensures that most surface characteristics could be well represented by the digitized model yong et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 these surfaces exhibit different roughness characteristics where the surface f 1 is the smoothed and that of f 3 is the roughest the dimension of surfaces is 200 mm by 100 mm 2 2 establishment of 3d crossed fracture models the crossed fracture models are established using the digitized surfaces since each scanned outcrop only represents one wall of a fracture each surface is duplicated and then uplifted by 0 8 mm which generates a fully mated rough walled fracture with a constant local aperture 0 8 mm previous studies have revealed that the influence of roughness on fluid flow is negligible for a model with a constant aperture when the flow is in the linear regime zou et al 2017b the upper surface is thereafter shifted along the x axis by 1 mm to artificially simulate a shear process which creates unmated rough walled fracture models with spatially variable aperture a square region with a side length of 20 mm is then selected and symmetrically divided into four parts to generate four branches of a crossed fracture model as shown in fig 3 here u and l represents the upper and lower surfaces of a fracture respectively the dimension of the model is 20 mm along the x axis 10 mm along the y axis and 20 mm along the z axis after establishing the model with an intersecting angle of 90 other models with intersecting angles of 60 45 and 30 are then generated by rotation for comparison a group of smooth parallel plate models is established leading to four groups of models with different roughness which are labeled as smooth parallel plate model ppm rough walled model no 1 rwm 1 rough walled model no 2 rwm 2 and rough walled model no 3 rwm 3 with the increasing roughness as shown in fig 4 in addition three crossed fracture models with mated rough surfaces are also established to illustrate the impact of surface matedness on the flow and mixing behaviors at 3d intersections 2 3 governing equations for isothermal and steady state incompressible newtonian fluids the flow processes are governed by the navier stokes equations written as e g zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 1 ρ u u μ 2 u p 2 u 0 where u m s is the velocity of flow ρ kg m3 is the fluid density p pa is the pressure and μ pa s is the viscosity steady state solute transport is governed by the general advection diffusion equation written as e g bear et al 1993 3 u c d c 0 where c kg m3 is volumetric solute concentration in the fluid phase and d m2 s is the combined dispersion and molecular diffusion coefficient the commercial software comsol multiphysics is employed to perform numerical simulations for fluid flow and solute transport by solving the governing partial differential eqs 1 3 it has been extensively employed for multi physics computations in the fields of rock mechanics and hydrology and has demonstrated superior capability in dealing with problems associated with fluid dynamics and mass transport e g cardenas et al 2007 wang et al 2015 pe is a dimensionless number that has a significant influence on the mixing behavior of solute through crossed fractures it represents the ratio between the convection rate and diffusion rate written as 4 p e q wd where q m3 s is the flow rate and w m is the width of the fracture to ensure that the flow is within the linear regime the reynolds number re was calculated by 5 r e ρ q w μ 2 4 boundary conditions among the four branches of each model b 1 and b 2 as shown in fig 3 are selected as inlet branches and the rest two are outlet branches to facilitate the numerical simulation and control of re and pe numbers for the study of pe dependent mixing ratio in crossed fractures identical flow rates are imposed on the two inlet branches the boundary condition of constant flow rate rather than constant pressure is adopted because it is straightforward to control the re and pe numbers by flow rate applying pressure boundary condition may lead to different flow rates into the inlets since the cross sectional areas of the two inlets may be different solute with a concentration of c c 0 1 mol m3 is continuously injected at the inlet i 1 fig 3 pressure p 0 boundary conditions are assigned at the two outlet boundaries such assignment of boundary conditions is intended to mimic the mixing phenomenon of contaminated and uncontaminated groundwater at fracture intersections in rock masses given the low permeability of crystalline and other rock type matrices flow in the rock matrix is neglected therefore impermeable boundary conditions are assigned to the fracture walls the matrix diffusion is not considered in this study since previous studies indicated that the matrix diffusion has negligible influences on the mixing behavior over a short time scale zou et al 2017a the fluid used in the simulations is water at 10 c and the values of parameters used in simulations are given in table 1 a series of simulations for flow rate ranging from 2 03 10 12 to 1 218 10 8 m3 s are conducted leading to the pe number ranging from 0 1 to 600 for the case with the maximum flow rate the re remains smaller than 1 indicating that the flow in all simulations may remain in the linear regime zimmerman et al 2004 this has also been confirmed by analyzing the calculated relationship between fluid rate and hydraulic gradient 3 roughness analysis 3 1 roughness of fractures a wide spectrum of descriptive methods and parameters have been developed for characterizing the roughness of fracture surfaces some parameters have been linked to the mechanical hydraulic and solute transport properties of rock fractures zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 olsson and barton 2001 xiong et al 2011 deng et al 2015 however the applicability of these parameters to crossed fractures especially for quantifying the mixing behavior of solute has not been verified our choice here is a simple dimensionless parameter z 2 it is defined as the root mean square of the first deviation of a profile written as myers 1962 6 z 2 1 n z i 1 z i x i 1 x i 2 1 2 where xi and zi are coordinates of the length and height of a surface profile and n is sampling point number in the length direction due to the clear definition and the simplicity in calculation z 2 has been widely accepted for characterizing the surface roughness of rock fractures zhao et al 2013 li and huang 2015 in the discipline of rock mechanics and rock engineering one of the most important parameters for roughness characterization is the joint roughness coefficient jrc barton et al 1985 it quantifies the roughness of a profile by a series of values ranging from 0 to 20 which are typically back calculated from tilt test results on fracture samples this parameter links the hydro mechanical behavior of fractures to their roughness which can also be estimated from z 2 by tse and cruden 1979 7 jrc 32 2 32 47 log z 2 compared to z 2 jrc is not defined in a mathematically rigorous manner but it could provide a generic understanding on the roughness degree of a fracture applying eqs 6 and 7 to the digitized surface data their average jrc values of all cross sectional profiles with an interval of 0 2 mm were estimated as tabulated in table 2 the results show that the jrc value ranges are 0 2 10 12 16 18 for the surfaces f 1 f 2 and f 3 respectively jrc 0 represents a smooth parallel plate model and jrc 20 represents the considerably rough fractures rarely encountered in practices therefore these three surfaces represent the smooth moderate and very rough fracture surfaces respectively that could facilitate the following investigations on the effects of roughness the fractions of apertures of the three rough walled models are shown in fig 5 since an initial aperture of 0 8 mm is applied to the original fractures the distributions are centered at values close to 0 8 mm with the increasing roughness the aperture distribution extends to broader ranges that follow normal distributions the distributions reveal that a rougher surface produces a greater degree of variations in the local apertures and therefore could form more complex void geometries 3 2 geometrical characteristics of the intersections the most significant difference between crossed fractures and single fractures lies in the existence of the intersection beside the roughness of fracture walls the geometrical characteristics of the intersection may make an even greater impact on the fluid flow and transport behaviors fig 6 shows the 2d view of the intersection facets and 3d view of the intersections of the three rough walled models at an intersecting angle of 90 the intersection of rwm 1 exhibits a slightly curved shape with a mostly uniform aperture at each facet while the intersection of rwm 3 shows a largely twisted shape with remarkable variations in the local apertures among the four facets and within each facet the degree of variation in the apertures of rwm 2 was between those of rwm 1 of rwm 3 the mean aperture of the intersection facets and the mean aperture of the branches are tabulated in table 3 the mean aperture of the fracture branch and the mean aperture of the corresponding intersection facet is roughly correlated in magnitude but also show different degrees of deviations such heterogeneity and randomness in the local aperture of the intersection originate from the unmated nature of these rough surfaces which results in the diversity of the geometry of intersections formed by different original fractures these geometrical characteristics are similar for models intersected at different angles when they are formed by the same original fracture therefore the details of their values are not presented z 2 is effective in characterizing the surface roughness which however is difficult to apply for quantifying aperture variations here a well accepted parameter relative standard deviation rsd also known as relative roughness was employed to characterize the aperture variation of intersections kang et al 2016 wang and cardenas 2016 8 rsd i 1 n e i e 2 n 1 e 100 where e i is the local aperture with a total number of n and e is their mean value 4 results and analysis 4 1 channeling flow the maximum re 1 table 1 thus the flow is likely to maintain in the linear laminar regime the distribution of streamlines are then constant regardless of the re number the case of pe 1 is selected to represent the streamline distributions for the models with different intersecting angles as shown in fig 7 in these figures fluids from the two inlet branches are differentiated using the black and red colors where the red represents the fluid containing solutes the flow pattern in the ppm is uniform and symmetrical regardless of the intersecting angle the fluids from the two inlet branches do not interfere with each other which conforms to the theoretical solution of fluid flow in the ppm as shown in fig 1 in contrast the streamlines in the rwms are tortuous in the branches and are partially redirected to the neighbor branches at the intersections the solution in red color that completely flows to the outlet branch b 4 fig 7d according to the result of ppm appears simultaneously in both outlet branches in rwms this channelization phenomenon is induced by the geometrical variation of the intersections which become more obvious as the roughness increases by comparing fig 7h l and p such channelization in space cannot be realized in 2d crossed fracture models fig 1 which again suggests the necessity to investigate the flow and transport behavior of natural rock fractures based on 3d rough walled models for each rwm the variations in streamline distributions are negligible among the cases with different intersecting angles since they are formed by the same original fractures 4 2 concentration distributions fig 8 shows the concentration distributions for cases with an intersecting angle of 90 at different pe numbers ranging from 0 1 to 600 where the solute is injected from i 1 when pe 0 1 the dominant mode of solute transport through the intersection is diffusion and the concentration in the two outlet branches are identical for all models which conforms to the complete mixing mode in this case solutes are fully mixed at the intersection and then flow into the two outlet branches the amount of solutes flowing out from each outlet branch is positively correlated with the flow rate of each branch with the increasing pe number the effect of convection gradually prevails and the solute concentration in the outlet branch b 4 becomes greater than that in the b 3 following the streamline routing mode this transition mainly happens when the pe number increases from 1 to 100 after which the change of concentration distributions become negligible at large pe the concentration distributions of the rwms are obviously affected by the structure of streamlines as observed by comparing figs 7 and 8 as expected the concentration field is more heterogeneous in rougher fractures the channelization of streamlines produces fast pathways for solute transport which enhances the exchange of fluids between the branches at the intersection fluids with a wide spectrum of concentrations appear in the outlet branches b 3 and b 4 at relatively low pe numbers e g pe 10 for rwm 2 this result indicates that the roughness induced channelization significantly enhances solute mixing in 3d crossed rough walled fractures 4 3 mixing ratio the mixing ratio defined below is used to quantify solute mixing in 3d crossed fractures when different solute concentrations mix at fracture intersections stockman et al 1997 park and lee 1999 johnson et al 2006 zafarani and detwiler 2013 8 m r q 3 c 3 q 3 c 3 q 4 c 4 where q 3 and q 4 are the flow rates and c 3 and c 4 are the mean concentrations at the outlets o 3 and o 4 respectively as indicated by eq 8 the mixing ratio is controlled by both the flow rates and the mean concentrations at the two outlets the flow rate is proportional to the aperture of each branch cubed consistent with the cubic law therefore mr is subject to change if the outlet branches have different apertures i e q 3 q 4 to clarify the influence of such differential flow rates the values of mr of a series of ppms with different ratios of the apertures of b 3 to b 4 are calculated as shown in fig 9 this ratio is defined as r that ranges from 0 2 to 5 only ppm is taken into account in order to eliminate the influence of roughness the results of the three rough walled cases with the intersecting angle of 90 are also plotted for comparison the values of mr exhibit a descending tendency with increasing pe the significant change happens when pe increases from 1 to 100 before and after that the value of mr is roughly constant for each case which is in concert with the observations on the concentration distributions shown in fig 8 for a ppm with an identical aperture of the two outlet branches i e r 1 mr has a high limit value of 0 5 at a sufficiently small pe which then approaches a low limit value of 0 as pe increases the high and low limits 0 5 and 0 represent the complete mixing and streamline routing modes respectively it is obvious from eq 2 that the value of mr will approach 0 or 1 when the value of r approaches 0 or becomes infinitely large respectively as confirmed by the curves of r 0 2 and r 5 on fig 9 it is notable that the low limit increases simultaneously with the increasing high limit which will not reach 0 when the value of r is greater than 1 due to the reallocation of solutes to the dominant branch i e b 3 that has a greater aperture the difference between the two limits reaches the maximum 0 5 when r 5 and decreases with the increase or decrease of r the values of flow rate ratio and flow flux ratio are also plotted on fig 9 for pe assumed 0 1 and 600 respectively the flow rate ratio is defined by q 3 q 3 q 4 that represents the fraction of flow rate at o 3 to the total value the flow flux ratio is defined by the ratio of the specific flow flux originating from b 1 that entered b 3 to the total flux in b 1 as shown by the red color in fig 7 this ratio is calculated by comparing the number of streamlines in red color in b 3 to that in b 1 given that each streamline represents an identical magnitude of flux the high limit of each case is identical to the corresponding flow rate ratio indicating with complete mixing the mixing ratio is only controlled by the relative magnitude of flow rates in the outlet branches on the other hand the low limit of each case is identical to the corresponding flow flux ratio which reflects the essence of the mixing ratio at the streamline routing mode the mixing ratio is governed by the relative magnitude of flow fluxes containing solutes in the outlet branches since the solutes only transport along the streamlines without diffusion in this mode the curves of three rwms exhibit similar descending tendencies with those of the ppms possessing different high and low limits since the low limits of them are all greater than 0 their values of r should be greater than 1 which agrees with the measured aperture of each branches as tabulated in table 3 their high and low limits show some deviations from the prediction of ppms due to the effect of roughness which will be discussed more in the next subsection the mixing ratios for the models with different intersecting angles are shown in fig 10 the curves of ppms completely overlap with each other indicating that the intersecting angle does not affect the mixing ratio for ppm for each rwm the curves of different angles share an almost identical initial value of mr since these models have identical apertures flow rates of each branch the deviation gradually becomes obvious as pe increases and the greater the surface roughness the smaller the deviation when rough walled fractures are intersecting at different angles the specific geometry of the intersection may be slightly altered resulting in the variations in channeling flow at different degrees the low limit determined under the streamline routing mode is strongly affected by the channeling flow that is the source of the reallocation of solutes which is responsible for these deviations a rougher model has a smaller difference between the high and low limits therefore the deviations among curves of different angled models are narrowed down the influence of intersecting angle stems from the geometrical characteristics of the intersections that can also be attributed to the effect of roughness 4 4 effects of roughness the above results have revealed that both of the differences in the apertures of branches and the surface roughness are influential factors to the flow and transport behaviors in crossed fractures to investigate the role played by the roughness the effect of the difference in aperture needs to be eliminated from the results first fig 9 has demonstrated that the difference in aperture and the roughness affects the high and low limits simultaneously therefore the difference between the high and low limits δmr is used to represent their effects since the roughness in the models with different intersecting angles has a similar effect on mixing only the cases intersected at 90 are analyzed here the calculated δmr for the rwm 1 rwm 2 and rwm 3 are 0 40 0 29 and 0 18 respectively since the value for δmr is 0 5 for the ppm with an identical aperture these values are in concert with the fact that a rougher model leads to a greater deviation from the theoretical value according to the mean aperture of each branch of the rwms table 3 three new ppms are established that have identical aperture to the corresponding fracture branches of the rwms the calculated δmr for these ppms are 0 42 0 34 0 30 corresponding to the rwm 1 rwm 2 and rwm 3 respectively the deviation of these values from 0 5 reflects the effect of the difference in the aperture on the mixing ratio which has a positive relation with the aperture difference table 3 finally subtraction of the δmr between the original rwms and their corresponding ppms yields the net contribution of roughness to the mixing ratio δmr the values of δmr for the rwm 1 rwm 2 and rwm 3 are 0 02 0 05 and 0 12 respectively the value of δmr apparently increases with increasing roughness figs 6 8 have demonstrated that a rougher fracture could form more complex geometry of the intersection which in turn enhances the channelization and mixing in the crossed fractures here three parameters were selected to represent the rough nature of the branch and the intersection z 2 of the branches see table 2 z 2 of the intersecting profiles i e four corner profiles of an intersection and rsd of the intersection apertures see fig 6 the mean values for the branches profiles or apertures are calculated as summarized in tables 2 and 3 these parameters systematically reflect the geometrical characteristics of the fracture surfaces intersection profiles and the resulting aperture of intersections the values of δmr are plotted against these parameters as shown in fig 11 although all three parameters exhibit a similar tendency the rsd shows a strong linear correlation with δmr in a form of δmr 0 4 rms indicating that δmr is more intimately related with the geometrical characteristics of the intersection apertures rather than the surface roughness this agrees with the fact that it is the local aperture distribution that determines the fluid flow and solute transport in fractures johnson and brown 2001 johnson et al 2006 zou et al 2017a b the channelization is primarily induced by the specific geometry of the intersection which is the mechanism that drives the reallocation of solutes the aperture distribution is the product of the two fracture walls therefore these three parameters are fundamentally related however it is well known that the surface roughness of rock fractures possesses some degree of randomness the intersections formed by fractures with the same degree of roughness e g identical jrc may present considerably different geometrical characteristics which explains the deviation between the surface parameters and the aperture parameter in fig 11 4 5 effects of matedness the above results have demonstrated that in the unmated rough walled models the roughness significantly alters mixing at intersections for fresh tensile fractures the walls of each branch may remain a well mated status before mechanical processes such as shear sliding and chemical alterations take effect in such a case one wall of each branch is a replica of the other wall and the local aperture is constant at any location the variation in the local aperture of the intersection naturally vanishes numerical simulations on three mated models based on the same surfaces as the unmated models fig 2 are conducted and the results are shown in fig 12 a constant aperture of 0 8 mm is assigned for all branches it is obvious that the concentration fields in the mated models are almost identical to those of the ppm shown in fig 8 except that reallocation of fluids happens slightly on a few isolated locations along the intersection this is because for mated rough walled cases the streamlines are not disturbed in the x y plane and the tortuosity exists only in the z direction the tortuosity close to the intersection may enforce a small portion of fluid flow into the neighboring branch such as from b 1 to b 3 as shown in fig 13 the results of mated and unmated cases are compared to the results of previous studies it is obvious that all the 3d models exhibit a similar evolutionary tendency that is different from those previous 2d models the discrepancy between the 3d model results and those of previous 2d models is caused by the fact that the complex aperture geometry in 3d have been fully modeled in present study while those previous 2d models only used crossed parallel plates or simplified cross sectional profiles to represent the fracture intersection this result indicates that it is important to consider the impact of 3d surface roughness on the mixing ratio at crossed fractures and the mixing ratio obtained from 2d models without consideration of surface roughness may produce biased estimations for solute transport in natural fractured rocks although the 3d mated cases are made up of rough walled fractures in contrast to the unmated models the curves of mixing ratio are close to that of the 3d ppm the values of δmr for the three mated cases are 0 021 0 037 and 0 041 increasing with increasing roughness from f1 to f3 these values are less than 10 of the δmr for ppm i e 0 5 indicating that the effect of surface roughness on mixing in mated fracture surface cases is negligibly small 5 conclusions in this study we systematically investigate fluid flow and solute mixing in 3d crossed rock fracture models taking into account the effects of surface roughness intersecting angle pe and fracture matedness the 3d crossed rough walled fracture models are established based on digitized natural rock fractures the impacts of intersection geometry and fracture aperture on the fluid flow and solute mixing in 3d crossed rough walled fractures are quantitatively characterized for the first time the main findings are summarized as follows 1 in 3d crossed rough walled rock fractures with unmated surfaces the heterogeneity of geometrical structures at the intersection and variable fracture apertures lead to preferential channelized flow which significantly enhances solute mixing at the intersection this feature emerges even when pe is as low as around one the enhanced mixing ratio generally increases with the increasing surface roughness especially when pe 100 note that the preferential channelized flow behavior cannot be observed in parallel plate models that are widely adopted in previous studies e g park and lee 1999 stockman et al 2001 zafarani and detwiler 2013 2 the mixing mode in 3d crossed rough walled rock fractures gradually transits from the complete mixing mode to the streamline routing mode when pe increases from 0 1 to 600 for all cases the mixing ratio decreases from 0 5 to 0 for the parallel plate model with an identical aperture in each branch in contrast mixing in rough walled rock fractures significantly deviate from that of the parallel plate model where the mixing ratio exhibits larger variations with increasing degree of surface roughness the ranges of pe for different mixing behaviors and the dependence of the mixing ratio variations on surface roughness are quantified for the first time 3 the effect of intersecting angle stems from the variation in intersection geometries which is negligibly small for the models with the same level of roughness in the linear flow regime this finding reveals that it is more important to consider the local intersection apertures rather than the intersection angle in quantification of the mixing behaviors at realistic rock fracture intersections it is unnecessary to take the intersecting angle as an independent variable for modeling of solute mixing in crossed fractures 4 regardless of the degree of fracture surface roughness the solute mixing in mated fractures behave analogously to that in the smooth parallel plate model for unmated cases the roughness and the mixing behavior can be characterized by the roughness parameter rsd that quantifies the variation of local aperture at the intersection therefore the parallel plate model may be applicable to fractured rock with predominantly mated fractures and the roughness parameter should be introduced for unmated fractures in order to improve the accuracy of assessments quantification of fluid flow and solute mixing at 3d fracture intersections is a crucial step to understand groundwater flow and solute transport in large scale fracture networks due to the difficulties in measuring modelling and simulating of the specific geometrical structures of each intersection in large scale fracture networks the surface roughness is often neglected or only represented by some empirical parameters to improve the efficiency in assessment the quantified mixing ratios presented in this study provide a possibility to correct the mixing results predicted by using the parallel plate model locally in large scale fractured systems it may largely improve the assessment accuracy compared to the parallel plate model while maintaining computational efficiency note that due to limited fracture surfaces and the limited range of pe considered in the present study the relationship between surface roughness and the mixing ratio shown in fig 11 needs to be further verified with a broader scope of geometrical and hydraulic conditions in the future meanwhile the mechanical process including shear and or closure could significant affect geometrical structure and consequently influence the flow and solute transport at the intersections therefore hydro mechanical coupling embedded with a solute transport module needs to be developed to account for the potential mechanical effects on fluid flow and solute transport processes in rough walled crossed fractures which is an important topic for future study declaration

5849,this study focuses on the description of soil water dynamics at four sites with different land cover types namely beech forest conifer forest meadow and clipped grass the analysis was based on soil tensiometer measurements from five consecutive vegetation seasons comprising both wet and dry years we investigated both column average pressure heads and also their vertical distribution the soil water balance was studied by the hydrus 1d model the highest pressure heads were observed at the grassland site followed by the meadow site the forested sites were generally reaching lower pressure head values which was a result of higher evapotranspiration and different soil properties the differences between the spruce forest picea abies l and beech forest fagus sylvatica l were evident namely in dry periods when the beech site was experiencing lower pressure heads contrarily the spruce site was drier with recorded lower pressure heads in wet periods and at the beginning of each season compared to the conifer forest lower pressure heads were observed in beech forest namely at the bottom of the inspected soil column down to 100 cm the inspection of the soil water balance revealed different rates of evapotranspiration and drainage at all sites the evapotranspiration was highest in the beech canopy followed by spruce and both grass covered sites the differences between spruce and beech forest were based namely on the water consumption efficiency and differences in interception rates vertical distribution of the roots and soil hydraulic properties keywords water resources soil moisture spatial variability hydrus 1d land cover soil hydrology forest hydrology 1 introduction an understanding of spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture is essential for studying other hydrological biological or chemical soil processes such as water movement microbial activity and biogeochemical cycling ridolfi et al 2003 legates et al 2011 zarlenga et al 2018 gao et al 2019 although the world wide total amount of water stored in the soil profile is negligible compared to ocean and glacier storages it represents a crucial variable in terms of water resources and agricultural management this is valid especially in the context of the ongoing shift in climate soil water exhibits a tremendous heterogeneity both in space and time gomez plaza et al 2000 espejo pérez et al 2016 tauro et al 2018 therefore spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture have always been a critical issue the spatial variability is influenced by several factors ranging from the topographical effect on lateral water redistribution williams et al 2003 solar radiation geroy et al 2011 grayson et al 1997 soil texture and structure famiglietti et al 1998 pan and peters lidard 2008 vegetation teuling and troch 2005 climate lawrence and hornberger 2007 precipitation patterns keim et al 2005 and antecedent soil moisture rosenbaum et al 2012 the land cover and land use

hydraulic properties i e hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics haghighi et al 2010 zhou et al 2008 several previous studies have investigated spatial and temporal variation of soil water under a certain land cover type gross et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 nevertheless studies comparing the influence of several land cover types on soil water regime over the period longer than one or two years studied e g by huang et al 2016 korres et al 2015 zucco et al 2014 are missing thus there is still a need to compare the dynamics of soil water regime under different land use types and longer time periods niu et al 2015 this knowledge would be valuable especially in the context of extreme climatic events that occur nowadays in central europe a period of major floods 1997 2002 2013 was followed by serious dry spells 2003 2011 2012 2015 trnka et al 2015 this observed hydrological extremity raised the question of a sustainable water management one of the possible management practices in consideration is represented by the land cover changes intended to hold more water in the landscape and simultaneously to attenuate the rainfall runoff response the aim of this study is therefore to understand the soil water regime based on soil tensiometer measurements in the vegetation season under four different land covers coniferous deciduous forest meadow grassland another objective is to describe possible differences in the water balance which strongly influences the soil water regime during the vegetation season this could help to explain the soil water behaviour in the region when exposed to a water deficiency or abundance this analysis was therefore conducted in five consecutive years encompassing both dry and wet periods 2 data and methods 2 1 study site the liz experimental catchment czech republic 49 04 n 13 41 e was used as an experimental area for this study the catchment lies in the in the šumava mountains southern bohemia which form a boundary between the czech republic and germany it belongs to forested mountainous region which serves as a headwater area for numerous flood events the soil type is classified as moderately deep loamy sand dystric cambisol the average soil depth is estimated to be approximately 100 cm the soil in the area generally has high water permeability 518 1700 cm day 1 from the bottom to the top of the soil profile the saturated hydraulic conductivities were measured using a pressure infiltrometer pavelková 2003 the geological base is represented by crystalline hard rocks which enable water circulation only in the weathered zone hrkal et al 2009 hence in the liz experimental area the hydrological catchments correspond to the hydrogeological ones the majority of the area is covered by mixed forest with prevailing coniferous trees picea abies l of various ages up to 140 years according to köppen climate classification the site lies in the dfb climate zone characterised by a humid continental climate with approximately uniform precipitation distribution and warm summers the average annual temperature is 6 6 c the average annual precipitation is approximately 863 mm a more detailed description of the site is available in sipek and tesar 2016 2 2 field measurements the experimental site was equipped with an automatic system for measuring meteorological and hydrological variables via wireless data transmission the fundamental meteorological measurements necessary for this study comprise air temperature and relative humidity fiedler rv12 rk5 czech republic and precipitation meteoservis mrw 500 czech republic the meteorological data were measured at a 10 minute interval during the entire period the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the method introduced by pristley and taylor 1972 all the necessary variables were available the only exception was the net longwave radiation which was estimated using the fao56 approach with the site specific coefficient values kofronova et al 2019 the soil water regime was measured by means of permanently installed soil tensiometers adolf thies gmbh germany supplementary material fig s1 the sampling strategy was set up in order to comprise sites with different land cover and simultaneously with similar meteorological conditions hence the soil water pressure heads were measured at four locations representing four different land covers clipped grassland gra meadow mea spruce forest spr and beech forest bee the maximum distance between the sites was 1355 m the location of particular sites is shown in fig 1 and their overall characteristics are given in table 1 at each site the pressure heads were measured at five depths 15 30 45 60 and 90 cm the measuring range of these tensiometers accounted for the pressure heads from 0 cm to 867 cm 85 kpa the pressure head values were recorded manually three times a week during the vegetation season mid may to mid october from 2003 to 2007 one to four tensiometers were available for each measuring depth at each site and the single value for a particular depth was taken as their average the median standard deviation of daily measurements taking into account all measurements for each depth ranged between 5 and 15 of the observed mean daily value it was generally highest in spruce forest and dry periods moreover in all land covers it decreased with depth average soil column pressure head was estimated as a weighted mean of five soil layers each being represented by one measurement depth the soil layers were separated by the depths of 22 5 37 5 52 5 and 75 cm lying exactly between the two adjacent tensiometer measurement points the soil profile was considered to be of the uniform depth of 100 cm the quality of the available tensiometric measurements adolf thies gmbh germany was compared with widely used ums t8 tensiometers ums germany at the spr site ums t8 were installed in 2009 the pressure heads measured by both tensiometer types corresponded to each other satisfactorily over the following five year period which is shown in the supplementary material fig s2 2 3 climate and soil characteristics the climatic characteristics of the study period are given in fig 2 each year was split into a cold november april and a warm may october season the five evaluated years represented very different climatic conditions when compared to long term average values the year 2003 was extremely dry with above average temperatures in the warm season the sum precipitation in the warm season was lower than potential evapotranspiration by 120 mm the year 2004 was also dry but the preceding winter was wetter than on average hence the initial wetness was substantially higher compared to 2003 initial pressure heads were in the range from 70 to 100 cm compared to 120 to 280 cm in 2003 the sum of precipitation was again lower than potential evapotranspiration but the difference decreased to 41 mm the wettest year observed was 2005 having slightly below average temperatures and above average precipitation both in the warm and the cold seasons the very wet antecedent winter was reflected by the highest initial wetness of all inspected years 2003 2007 ranging from 50 cm grass site to 110 cm spruce site the subsequent year 2006 was also wetter than average but compared to 2005 the temperatures were lower during the cold season and higher in the warm season the snow cover in this winter was the highest observed since the beginning of the observations in 2002 the average snow water equivalent over the 2005 2006 winter season ranged from 90 to 120 mm depending on the location compared to the long term average of 40 65 mm sipek and tesar 2014 the last year of the experiment 2007 was again very wet this was reflected by the excess of precipitation over the potential evapotranspiration attaining 166 mm however the preceding winter 2006 2007 was the warmest winter observed with nearly no snow cover this significantly influenced the pressure heads in the warm season undisturbed soil samples collected in stainless steel sample rings of a high of 6 cm and volume of 138 cm3 were used to determine the soil water retention curves swrc for each site and depth a number from two to six of measured swrcs were available for each depth and site the sand table method was used for pressure heads in the range from 1 to 30 cm the pressure plate extractor soilmoisture equipment corp usa was used for the pressure head range from 102 to 15296 cm 10 to 1500 kpa the volumetric soil moisture content was determined for 7 11 specific pressure head values the swrc were fitted by means of the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 using the van genuchten 1980 equation all swrcs are present in the supplementary material see fig s3 the column average van genuchten 1980 swrc parameters are shown in table 1 generally the forested sites were drained more easily and had a higher saturation water content which was determined by the higher portion of sand particles in the soil column in this study the primary analyses were conducted using the pressure head data obtained directly from the soil tensiometers the reason for that was the uncertainty related to the conversion of pressure heads to volumetric water contents this uncertainty is based on the dependence of the equilibrium soil water content on the direction of the soil wetting drying process hillel 2003 for comparability of the results with other studies the information about volumetric water contents obtained by the soil water retention curves from the tensiometer data is presented in the supplementary material figs s5 s7 2 4 statistical analysis the differences between the means of pressure heads from individual sites and depths were statistically assessed analysis of variance anova is often used for testing the equality of means nevertheless the crucial assumption of anova is the equality of variances of individual samples this assumption was tested using the brown and forsythe test brown and forsythe 1974 in all cases the brown and forsythe test confirmed the significant differences between the variances of individual datasets therefore the anova was not considered and the non parametric kruskal wallis test kruskal and wallis 1952 was applied instead the kruskal wallis test examines the hypothesis that the individual samples originate from the identical distribution nevertheless it is particularly sensitive to differences in the means all tests presented in section 3 were performed at a significance

flow process might be neglected and water flow due to thermal gradients is also insignificant the model version using a single porosity hydraulic model was used this was based on several extensive side experiments in which different hydraulic models were examined and the single porosity model was generally the most efficient one reaching lowest rmse the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties were described using van genuchten 1980 type of analytical functions in hydrus 1d model the actual root water uptake rwu was represented by feddes equation feddes et al 1974 beer s law method was used to partition potential transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes based on the leaf area index lai the depth of the modelled soil profile was set to 100 cm because the soil bedrock interface takes place at this depth the soil profile was divided into five distinct layers 0 22 5 37 5 52 5 75 100 cm for each layer the tensiometer measurement was available see section 2 2 and used for the model calibration the lower boundary condition was represented by free drainage the atmospheric boundary condition with surface runoff was used as an upper boundary condition the grass interception capacity was obtained based on side experiments in hydrus 1d comparing several scenarios where the interception storages ranged between 0 and 2 mm the value of 1 1 mm was chosen to be the most efficient it also fits the observed range by thurow et al 1987 investigating the interception characteristics in grasslands the lai of both grass covered sites was set to the value of 2 4 m2 m 2 which was estimated based on fao56 approach allen et al 1998 the interception capacity of the spruce covered site was set to 2 mm which was reported by dohnal et al 2014 based on the measurement using five raingauges measuring throughfall located in the same experimental site in the same study the measured average lai of spruce equalled to 5 83 m2 m 2 the interception capacity of the beech site was set to 1 5 mm which was obtained from a similar experiment estimating throughfall in beech canopy at the bee site the lai of the beech site was set seasonally variable ranging from 1 27 to 5 08 m2 m 2 from may to october this range was reported by haninec 2014 who compared several methods of lai estimation in the beech forest in the czech republic the depths of the rooting zones were not exactly quantified however based on the visual inspection when excavating the soil they were set to 40 cm gra mea and spr sites and to 100 cm bee site this is in agreement with schmid 2002 and schwärzel et al 2009 who reported similar root distributions in the spruce down to 40 50 cm and beech stands down to the depth of 80 90 cm in cambisol sites in austria and germany 2 5 2 modelling procedure the soil water model was used to optimise the root water uptake parameters for each particular place separately for this experiment the measured soil water retention curves were utilised and saturated hydraulic conductivities ksat were inversely estimated the measured ksat was available only at the spr site the parameters of the root water uptake model were manually fitted hydrus 1d does not enable their automatic optimisation so that the modelled soil water regime matched closely to the observed one the objective criteria for this match composed of rmses and visual inspection of the resulting plots the parameters that were adjusted consisted of threshold values of the feddes et al 1974 function denoting the pressure head below which roots start to extract water from the soil p0 the pressure head below which roots extract water at the maximum possible rate p1 value of the limiting pressure head below which roots can no longer extract water at the maximum rate p2 and value of the pressure head below which root water uptake ceases usually taken as the wilting point p3 3 results 3 1 measured soil water regime in different land cover types the measured pressure heads were analysed from two different points of view the first was focused on the column average pressure heads while the second was represented by the vertical distribution of the pressure heads in the soil column down to the depth of 100 cm for clarity the pressure heads from individual sites seasons depths are presented as box plots 3 1 1 measured average pressure head in the entire soil column all observed pressure heads for each site and year separately are shown in fig 3 the values were season dependent and might be roughly divided into wet and dry years in the dry years 2003 and 2004 the beech site was attaining lowest pressure heads the median observed values were 751 and 534 cm the median pressure heads in the spruce forest spr were higher by 21 and 23 cm respectively the pressure heads in the spruce forest site were lower than the beech site bee only when the observed precipitation was average or above average 2005 2007 moreover the differences in pressure heads between spruce and beech plot were actually more pronounced as the tensiometer data often reached the lower measurement limit of 867 cm in some depths especially in the beech forest this was the case of the year 2004 and 2007 fig 4 when the pressure heads in beech forest were most probably lower than those recorded by the soil tensiometers see fig s4 the reading from the depth of 90 cm the entire soil profile was affected by the measurement restriction in 2007 not only at a depth of 90 cm measurement in the year 2003 the pressure heads at all sites exceeded the measuring range 0 to 867 cm hence the differences in the lowest pressure heads were biased nevertheless in the case of pressure heads lower than the measurement limit the loss gain of the volumetric water content corresponding to the unit change in pressure head is very small it accounts for less than 0 002 cm3 cm 3 of change in the volumetric water content per a 100 cm change in pressure head the same rate observed from the saturation to the pressure head of 100 cm equals to 0 22 cm3 cm 3 hence the changes in pressure head concerning such low heads result in a very little change in the amount of water present in the soil profile and simultaneously very little variation in water fluxes the differences in pressure heads between beech and spruce sites were statistically significant only in the dry year 2007 fig 5 the differences between spruce and beech sites were more significant in terms of volumetric water contents figs s5 and s6 the spruce site was significantly wetter in dry years in wet years the differences were of lower magnitude but of the same character as in pressure head datasets the reason is that the soil water retention curves representing these two sites do not intersect and the particular pressure head always implied higher volumetric soil water content in the case of the spruce site compared to the beech site the pressured heads and volumetric water contents in grassland gra and meadow mea sites were generally higher than in the forested sites spr bee except for the year 2003 the interquartile range of pressure heads q2 q3 was higher in the forested sites and lower in meadow and grassland sites these observations were confirmed by the results of the kruskal wallis test fig 5 showing prevailing significant differences among gra mea and forested sites 3 1 2 vertical distribution of the pressure heads the box plots depicting the vertical distribution of all pressure head values in the seasons with contrasting precipitation 2004 and 2005 are shown in fig 6 moreover the four year temporal evolution of pressure heads with respect to depth is depicted in fig 4 these years were selected as examples of dry and wet seasons in drier years the beech and spruce forests slightly differed in their vertical distribution of pressure heads the beech forest extracted water more efficiently from higher depths which resulted in a higher variation of pressure heads contrarily in the topsoil depth of 0 37 cm median pressure head values were slightly lower in the spruce forest this is nicely shown on the evolution of the pressure heads from the beginning of august to the end of september in 2004 fig 4 fig 4 namely the years 2003 2004 and 2007 also documents the drier soil under spruce forest at the beginning of the season which can be attributed to higher interception of conifer forest compared to deciduous one moreover it also shows that gra mea spr sites dries gradually from the soil surface towards the deeper layers contrarily at bee site the lower pressure heads were usually observed first in the deeper layers however the kruskal wallis test did not confirm any significantly different pressure heads between spr and bee fig 5 on the other hand the statistically significant differences were found in the vertical distribution of volumetric water contents fig s6 in wet years the differences between spruce and beech sites were even less obvious and the vertical distribution of pressure heads was similar to those of grassland and meadow sites see year 2006 in fig 4 this underpins the fact that when water is abundant the differences in pressure heads among particular land covers are of low importance in wet seasons the pressure heads in gra mea spr bee sites can be characterised by an approximately uniform vertical distribution rarely attaining values lower than 200 cm at all four sites the pressure heads were increasing with increasing depth fig 6 the statistically significant differences among gra mea and forested sites were regularly identified at the bottom of the soil profile below 45 cm however they were based on narrow distributions of pressure heads in the topsoil the significant differences concerning gra mea and forested sites were restricted to dry years fig 5 3 2 soil water balance modelling the measured pressure heads were used to calibrate the hydrus 1d soil water model for all four inspected sites the main objective was to adjust the root water uptake rwu model parameters so that the soil water regime simulations would be as efficient as possible the model results are used to differentiate particular water fluxes at all sites in all seasons namely the rates of evaporation from soil column and canopy plant transpiration and drainage are of particular interest the root water uptake model parameters were identified for each site separately table 2 representing a specific land cover characteristics resulting model efficiencies in terms of rmse coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient are shown in table 3 the estimated pressure heads varied from the observed ones most pronouncedly in both forested areas rmse range extending from 100 cm to 176 cm the grass covered sites were generally better represented by the model with the exception of the year 2003 the reasons for such high error statistics are further discussed in the discussion section the estimated water balances are for each year depicted in table 4 in every single year the beech site had the highest amount of actual evapotranspiration aet sum of canopy transpiration evaporation form soil surface and interception loss the differences were from 62 to 81 mm per season compared to the spr site and from 44 to 105 mm per season compared to grass covered sites gra mea the differences between particular sites followed the same pattern every year only their absolute values were variable the highest transpiration rates were always observed in beech forest seasonal average equalled to 278 mm over the five year period followed by spruce one 230 mm and lowest rates were in the grass covered sites 164 and 173 mm as shown in fig 7 the differences in transpiration between beech and spruce trees were usually increasing from the beginning to the middle of vegetation season when beech transpired at higher rate which was followed by their gradual attenuation higher transpiration of spruce compared to beech at the end of the season this seasonality was one of the causes of significantly lower pressure heads observed in summer in beech forest albeit the annual differences were less pronounced contrarily the evaporation from the soil surface was highest in the grass covered sites with the season average of 144 mm in the gra site and 127 mm in the mea site respectively both forest covered sites had lower rates of surface evaporation 30 mm in spruce and 75 mm in beech covered site respectively the different rates of evaporation can be explained by differences in the lai and available soil water see table 2 the seasonal interception loss in particular sites corresponded to maximum interception capacity reaching highest seasonal averages in the spruce forest 100 mm per season finally the drainage was highest in the spruce forest compared to all remaining sites altogether the highest average annual evapotranspiration rate was observed in the beech forest 431 mm year 1 compared to all other remaining sites 361 368 mm year 1 the difference between spruce and grassland sites was namely in the above mentioned higher drainage in the spruce site 89 mm year 1 compared to 50 and 56 mm per a year 4 discussion 4 1 measured pressure heads under different land covers the spruce site was generally wetter compared to the beech site this is in contradiction with the previous findings of schume et al 2004 and jost et al 2004 who observed wetter beech forest sites compared to spruce dominated sites nevertheless the comparison is influenced by the different soil properties both studies were conducted in the site with significantly higher clay content ranging from 37 to 56 compared to 2 7 found in the liz site besides the soil characteristics the differences between spruce and beech forest could also be based on more economic transpiration demand cermak et al 1995 schume et al 2004 and higher interception in the case of spruce augusto et al 2002 sipek and tesar 2014 moreover the midday stomatal closure hence increased stomatal resistance and reduced transpiration was observed in spruce forest by zweifel et al 2002 when the vapour pressure deficit became sufficiently high additionally at the beginning of the vegetation season slightly lower pressure heads were regularly observed in the spruce stand fig 4 this was caused by the higher interception of the snowfall in the conifer forest observed in the area sipek and tesar 2014 and by the transpiration of spruce on favourable winter days boyce and lucero 1999 mayr et al 2002 drier forest sites compared to grassland and meadow ones have been reported by several authors wiekenkamp et al 2016a zehe et al 2010 zucco et al 2014 this was caused mainly by the higher evapotranspiration of forested sites as documented by the model in fig 7 which led to more pronounced declines in pressure heads the major difference in pressure heads depth distribution was caused by the different distribution of roots in norway spruce picea abies l and european beech fagus sylvatica l forests schmid 2002 while the fine roots of the spruce are mainly located in the topsoil in a dystric cambisol the beech roots are distributed more uniformly similar character of root water uptake depth distribution was also reported by schwärzel et al 2009 in the ore mts germany as this study is based on a five year period covering both wet and dry years we would like to stress that the prevailing character of the differences in pressure heads among particular land covers was partly determined by the climatic characteristics of the particular season as well as those of the preceding season the partition into wet and dry years according to precipitation amounts was not sufficient as the year 2007 was very wet in the vegetation season but preceeded by a relatively warm winter the resulting soil water regime in 2007 thus rather corresponded to that of a dry year hence to obtain representative results it is necessary to conduct comparison studies on longer time scales short term experiments bias the results of several studies and cause differences when comparing the outcomes this could be partly the case of this study and the outcomes of jost et al 2004 and schume et al 2004 who documented drier spruce sites compared to beech sites albeit only in two vegetation seasons of which one was drier however as mentioned above they have investigated a site with different soil properties namely significantly higher clay content ranging from 36 to 56 4 2 water balance modelling the soil water model root water uptake parameters were manually optimised in order to obtain most efficient simulation of the pressure heads in particular depths the resulting parameters for the spruce site were in the range reported by rabbel et al 2018 and vogel et al 2013 who also focused on the rwu parameters in the spruce covered sites the parameters for the grass covered sites differed only slightly from the default hydrus 1d parameters for the grass cover the only difference between mea and gra sites was that the mea site where grass was not clipped so often had a lower pressure head threshold denoting reduced actual evapotranspiration from its potential p2 which could be explained by higher amounts of above ground biomass the beech site model parameters obtained by the calibration procedure indicated namely the higher ability of the beech stand to extract water from deeper soil layers köstner 2001 the most problematic was the wilting point p3 which was in our study optimised to be around the measuring limit of the tensiometer table 2 hence it does not represent the wilting point at all the reason for this is twofold first when using the soil tensiometer no reliable information is available about the course of soil water regime below its measuring limit therefore it is impossible to adjust the wilting point correctly second the previously published shortcoming of the feddes et al 1974 root water uptake model by vogel et al 2013 showed incorrectly low pressure heads estimated by this approach compared to newly designed water potential based model the larger declines in pressure heads were given by the late start of the reduction of transpiration after the onset of dry conditions and the permanent proportionality of root water uptake to the root distribution function hence in our study the value of the wilting point p3 does not correspond to its physical meaning but it is used only as a tool to capture the soil water regime as efficiently as possible in order to obtain the information about soil column water balance generally the simulated pressure heads at the spr site were slightly less efficient that those obtained by vogel et al 2013 focused on the same site but using a slightly different s1d model also based on numerical solution of richards equation vogel et al 2010 for a five month period the efficiency of the pressure heads modelling was influenced by several factors that are not included in the modelling procedure first the rock fragments their volume was not quantified in this study could have influence the estimate of the total amount of water present in the soil profile hydrus 1d model generally assumes uniform distribution of water in each soil layer however if a certain percentage of the profile is formed by the rock fragments then the vegetation will extract more water from the areas between those rock fragments in order to fulfil the water demand this could result in a higher actual drop in observed pressure heads vlček et al 2012 hlaváčiková et al 2015 which would not be represented in the model second the hydrophobicity of the soils doerr et al 2000 may result in non uniform drainage of water into deeper soil layers and formation of a shallow biomat flow gerke et al 2015 the percolation of water can then be limited only to certain locations eventually bypassing the measurement probes further wiekenkamp et al 2016b showed that the occurrence of preferential flow in the forested catchment can cause non sequential reaction of soil moisture sensors at different depths micro relief of the site could also bias the pressure head estimation in the same way due to the concentration of water infiltration into the small depressions as the surface is not completely flat in the spr and bee sites moreover in these depressions the infiltration rate can be gradually reduced by clogging of soil pores by finer particles originating from the surface rousseva et al 2002 thompson et al 2010 finally the course of pressure heads below the tensiometer detection limit discussed is section 2 2 is not known hence the simulation of these low pressure heads was omitted by restricting the rwu limit to this threshold p3 at maximum however this restriction should not have a significant influence on the volume of estimated water present in the soil profile and on the rate of its fluxes discussed in section 3 1 1 the simulated transpiration rates in beech forest were in general agreement with beech annual transpiration across several sites in germany reported by schipka et al 2005 the average seasonal actual evapotranspiration in the spruce forest ranging from 259 to 441 mm per vegetation season corresponded roughly to the values of 269 351 mm reported by sipek and tesar 2017 they estimated aet in the same area but for a different time period and using a different soil moisture model the differences among particular sites namely in the rate of drainage were given particularly by the model set up concerning rwu parameters and soil hydraulic properties this is based on several side experiments when several combinations of shp and rwu parameters from different sites were investigated however due to the above mentioned uncertainties in parameter determination they are not included in the current study 5 conclusion in this study we found that the grassland and meadow sites had generally higher pressure heads compared to the forested sites the soil water model results showed that it was caused by higher evapotranspiration rates in beech forest by 60 mm on average and higher drainage in spruce forest by 35 mm on average the differences in pressure heads between conifer forest picea abies l and deciduous forest fagus sylvatica l were season dependent in dry periods 2003 and 2004 the soil with lower pressure heads was found in beech forest compared to conifer forest lower pressure head values were observed namely at the bottom of the inspected soil column down to 100 cm this was probably caused by the more economical water consumption of coniferous trees in dry periods compared to that of broad leaves trees different vertical root distribution and different soil properties the higher transpiration of the beech forest site was proved by the model results the beech forest evapotranspiration was on average higher by 68 mm which was only partially compensated by higher drainage in the spruce forest which resulted in slightly higher pressure heads in spruce forest the pressure heads were slightly lower compared to beech forest only in seasons with abundant precipitation 2005 2007 which was caused by the higher interception rate of conifer trees compared to that of deciduous trees however in the seasons with high precipitation the differences among all evaluated land cover types were insignificant european beech fagus sylvatica l and norway spruce picea abies l are two of the most dominant tree species in central europe hence

5849,this study focuses on the description of soil water dynamics at four sites with different land cover types namely beech forest conifer forest meadow and clipped grass the analysis was based on soil tensiometer measurements from five consecutive vegetation seasons comprising both wet and dry years we investigated both column average pressure heads and also their vertical distribution the soil water balance was studied by the hydrus 1d model the highest pressure heads were observed at the grassland site followed by the meadow site the forested sites were generally reaching lower pressure head values which was a result of higher evapotranspiration and different soil properties the differences between the spruce forest picea abies l and beech forest fagus sylvatica l were evident namely in dry periods when the beech site was experiencing lower pressure heads contrarily the spruce site was drier with recorded lower pressure heads in wet periods and at the beginning of each season compared to the conifer forest lower pressure heads were observed in beech forest namely at the bottom of the inspected soil column down to 100 cm the inspection of the soil water balance revealed different rates of evapotranspiration and drainage at all sites the evapotranspiration was highest in the beech canopy followed by spruce and both grass covered sites the differences between spruce and beech forest were based namely on the water consumption efficiency and differences in interception rates vertical distribution of the roots and soil hydraulic properties keywords water resources soil moisture spatial variability hydrus 1d land cover soil hydrology forest hydrology 1 introduction an understanding of spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture is essential for studying other hydrological biological or chemical soil processes such as water movement microbial activity and biogeochemical cycling ridolfi et al 2003 legates et al 2011 zarlenga et al 2018 gao et al 2019 although the world wide total amount of water stored in the soil profile is negligible compared to ocean and glacier storages it represents a crucial variable in terms of water resources and agricultural management this is valid especially in the context of the ongoing shift in climate soil water exhibits a tremendous heterogeneity both in space and time gomez plaza et al 2000 espejo pérez et al 2016 tauro et al 2018 therefore spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture have always been a critical issue the spatial variability is influenced by several factors ranging from the topographical effect on lateral water redistribution williams et al 2003 solar radiation geroy et al 2011 grayson et al 1997 soil texture and structure famiglietti et al 1998 pan and peters lidard 2008 vegetation teuling and troch 2005 climate lawrence and hornberger 2007 precipitation patterns keim et al 2005 and antecedent soil moisture rosenbaum et al 2012 the land cover and land use influence on the soil water regime is complex involving various processes like interception and transpiration sutanto et al 2012 jakobi et al 2018 in addition vegetation can also influence the soil hydraulic properties i e hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics haghighi et al 2010 zhou et al 2008 several previous studies have investigated spatial and temporal variation of soil water under a certain land cover type gross et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 nevertheless studies comparing the influence of several land cover types on soil water regime over the period longer than one or two years studied e g by huang et al 2016 korres et al 2015 zucco et al 2014 are missing thus there is still a need to compare the dynamics of soil water regime under different land use types and longer time periods niu et al 2015 this knowledge would be valuable especially in the context of extreme climatic events that occur nowadays in central europe a period of major floods 1997 2002 2013 was followed by serious dry spells 2003 2011 2012 2015 trnka et al 2015 this observed hydrological extremity raised the question of a sustainable water management one of the possible management practices in consideration is represented by the land cover changes intended to hold more water in the landscape and simultaneously to attenuate the rainfall runoff response the aim of this study is therefore to understand the soil water regime based on soil tensiometer measurements in the vegetation season under four different land covers coniferous deciduous forest meadow grassland another objective is to describe possible differences in the water balance which strongly influences the soil water regime during the vegetation season this could help to explain the soil water behaviour in the region when exposed to a water deficiency or abundance this analysis was therefore conducted in five consecutive years encompassing both dry and wet periods 2 data and methods 2 1 study site the liz experimental catchment czech republic 49 04 n 13 41 e was used as an experimental area for this study the catchment lies in the in the šumava mountains southern bohemia which form a boundary between the czech republic and germany it belongs to forested mountainous region which serves as a headwater area for numerous flood events the soil type is classified as moderately deep loamy sand dystric cambisol the average soil depth is estimated to be approximately 100 cm the soil in the area generally has high water permeability 518 1700 cm day 1 from the bottom to the top of the soil profile the saturated hydraulic conductivities were measured using a pressure infiltrometer pavelková 2003 the geological base is represented by crystalline hard rocks which enable water circulation only in the weathered zone hrkal et al 2009 hence in the liz experimental area the hydrological catchments correspond to the hydrogeological ones the majority of the area is covered by mixed forest with prevailing coniferous trees picea abies l of various ages up to 140 years according to köppen climate classification the site lies in the dfb climate zone characterised by a humid continental climate with approximately uniform precipitation distribution and warm summers the average annual temperature is 6 6 c the average annual precipitation is approximately 863 mm a more detailed description of the site is available in sipek and tesar 2016 2 2 field measurements the experimental site was equipped with an automatic system for measuring meteorological and hydrological variables via wireless data transmission the fundamental meteorological measurements necessary for this study comprise air temperature and relative humidity fiedler rv12 rk5 czech republic and precipitation meteoservis mrw 500 czech republic the meteorological data were measured at a 10 minute interval during the entire period the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the method introduced by pristley and taylor 1972 all the necessary variables were available the only exception was the net longwave radiation which was estimated using the fao56 approach with the site specific coefficient values kofronova et al 2019 the soil water regime was measured by means of permanently installed soil tensiometers adolf thies gmbh germany supplementary material fig s1 the sampling strategy was set up in order to comprise sites with different land cover and simultaneously with similar meteorological conditions hence the soil water pressure heads were measured at four locations representing four different land covers clipped grassland gra meadow mea spruce forest spr and beech forest bee the maximum distance between the sites was 1355 m the location of particular sites is shown in fig 1 and their overall characteristics are given in table 1 at each site the pressure heads were measured at five depths 15 30 45 60 and 90 cm the measuring range of these tensiometers accounted for the pressure heads from 0 cm to 867 cm 85 kpa the pressure head values were recorded manually three times a week during the vegetation season mid may to mid october from 2003 to 2007 one to four tensiometers were available for each measuring depth at each site and the single value for a particular depth was taken as their average the median standard deviation of daily measurements taking into account all measurements for each depth ranged between 5 and 15 of the observed mean daily value it was generally highest in spruce forest and dry periods moreover in all land covers it decreased with depth average soil column pressure head was estimated as a weighted mean of five soil layers each being represented by one measurement depth the soil layers were separated by the depths of 22 5 37 5 52 5 and 75 cm lying exactly between the two adjacent tensiometer measurement points the soil profile was considered to be of the uniform depth of 100 cm the quality of the available tensiometric measurements adolf thies gmbh germany was compared with widely used ums t8 tensiometers ums germany at the spr site ums t8 were installed in 2009 the pressure heads measured by both tensiometer types corresponded to each other satisfactorily over the following five year period which is shown in the supplementary material fig s2 2 3 climate and soil characteristics the climatic characteristics of the study period are given in fig 2 each year was split into a cold november april and a warm may october season the five evaluated years represented very different climatic conditions when compared to long term average values the year 2003 was extremely dry with above average temperatures in the warm season the sum precipitation in the warm season was lower than potential evapotranspiration by 120 mm the year 2004 was also dry but the preceding winter was wetter than on average hence the initial wetness was substantially higher compared to 2003 initial pressure heads were in the range from 70 to 100 cm compared to 120 to 280 cm in 2003 the sum of precipitation was again lower than potential evapotranspiration but the difference decreased to 41 mm the wettest year observed was 2005 having slightly below average temperatures and above average precipitation both in the warm and the cold seasons the very wet antecedent winter was reflected by the highest initial wetness of all inspected years 2003 2007 ranging from 50 cm grass site to 110 cm spruce site the subsequent year 2006 was also wetter than average but compared to 2005 the temperatures were lower during the cold season and higher in the warm season the snow cover in this winter was the highest observed since the beginning of the observations in 2002 the average snow water equivalent over the 2005 2006 winter season ranged from 90 to 120 mm depending on the location compared to the long term average of 40 65 mm sipek and tesar 2014 the last year of the experiment 2007 was again very wet this was reflected by the excess of precipitation over the potential evapotranspiration attaining 166 mm however the preceding winter 2006 2007 was the warmest winter observed with nearly no snow cover this significantly influenced the pressure heads in the warm season undisturbed soil samples collected in stainless steel sample rings of a high of 6 cm and volume of 138 cm3 were used to determine the soil water retention curves swrc for each site and depth a number from two to six of measured swrcs were available for each depth and site the sand table method was used for pressure heads in the range from 1 to 30 cm the pressure plate extractor soilmoisture equipment corp usa was used for the pressure head range from 102 to 15296 cm 10 to 1500 kpa the volumetric soil moisture content was determined for 7 11 specific pressure head values the swrc were fitted by means of the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 using the van genuchten 1980 equation all swrcs are present in the supplementary material see fig s3 the column average van genuchten 1980 swrc parameters are shown in table 1 generally the forested sites were drained more easily and had a higher saturation water content which was determined by the higher portion of sand particles in the soil column in this study the primary analyses were conducted using the pressure head data obtained directly from the soil tensiometers the reason for that was the uncertainty related to the conversion of pressure heads to volumetric water contents this uncertainty is based on the dependence of the equilibrium soil water content on the direction of the soil wetting drying process hillel 2003 for comparability of the results with other studies the information about volumetric water contents obtained by the soil water retention curves from the tensiometer data is presented in the supplementary material figs s5 s7 2 4 statistical analysis the differences between the means of pressure heads from individual sites and depths were statistically assessed analysis of variance anova is often used for testing the equality of means nevertheless the crucial assumption of anova is the equality of variances of individual samples this assumption was tested using the brown and forsythe test brown and forsythe 1974 in all cases the brown and forsythe test confirmed the significant differences between the variances of individual datasets therefore the anova was not considered and the non parametric kruskal wallis test kruskal and wallis 1952 was applied instead the kruskal wallis test examines the hypothesis that the individual samples originate from the identical distribution nevertheless it is particularly sensitive to differences in the means all tests presented in section 3 were performed at a significance

porous media simunek et al 2008 the hydrus 1d model designed for one dimensional fluxes is based on the modified richard s equation with the assumption that the air phase interactions with the liquid flow process might be neglected and water flow due to thermal gradients is also insignificant the model version using a single porosity hydraulic model was used this was based on several extensive side experiments in which different hydraulic models were examined and the single porosity model was generally the most efficient one reaching lowest rmse the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties were described using van genuchten 1980 type of analytical functions in hydrus 1d model the actual root water uptake rwu was represented by feddes equation feddes et al 1974 beer s law method was used to partition potential transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes based on the leaf area index lai the depth of the modelled soil profile was set to 100 cm because the soil bedrock interface takes place at this depth the soil profile was divided into five distinct layers 0 22 5 37 5 52 5 75 100 cm for each layer the tensiometer measurement was available see section 2 2 and used for the model calibration the lower boundary condition was represented by free drainage the atmospheric boundary condition with surface runoff was used as an upper boundary condition the grass interception capacity was obtained based on side experiments in hydrus 1d comparing several scenarios where the interception storages ranged between 0 and 2 mm the value of 1 1 mm was chosen to be the most efficient it also fits the observed range by thurow et al 1987 investigating the interception characteristics in grasslands the lai of both grass covered sites was set to the value of 2 4 m2 m 2 which was estimated based on fao56 approach allen et al 1998 the interception capacity of the spruce covered site was set to 2 mm which was reported by dohnal et al 2014 based on the measurement using five raingauges measuring throughfall located in the same experimental site in the same study the measured average lai of spruce equalled to 5 83 m2 m 2 the interception capacity of the beech site was set to 1 5 mm which was obtained from a similar experiment estimating throughfall in beech canopy at the bee site the lai of the beech site was set seasonally variable ranging from 1 27 to 5 08 m2 m 2 from may to october this range was reported by haninec 2014 who compared several methods of lai estimation in the beech forest in the czech republic the depths of the rooting zones were not exactly quantified however based on the visual inspection when excavating the soil they were set to 40 cm gra mea and spr sites and to 100 cm bee site this is in agreement with schmid 2002 and schwärzel et al 2009 who reported similar root distributions in the spruce down to 40 50 cm and beech stands down to the depth of 80 90 cm in cambisol sites in austria and germany 2 5 2 modelling procedure the soil water model was used to optimise the root water uptake parameters for each particular place separately for this experiment the measured soil water retention curves were utilised and saturated hydraulic conductivities ksat were inversely estimated the measured ksat was available only at the spr site the parameters of the root water uptake model were manually fitted hydrus 1d does not enable their automatic optimisation so that the modelled soil water regime matched closely to the observed one the objective criteria for this match composed of rmses and visual inspection of the resulting plots the parameters that were adjusted consisted of threshold values of the feddes et al 1974 function denoting the pressure head below which roots start to extract water from the soil p0 the pressure head below which roots extract water at the maximum possible rate p1 value of the limiting pressure head below which roots can no longer extract water at the maximum rate p2 and value of the pressure head below which root water uptake ceases usually taken as the wilting point p3 3 results 3 1 measured soil water regime in different land cover types the measured pressure heads were analysed from two different points of view the first was focused on the column average pressure heads while the second was represented by the vertical distribution of the pressure heads in the soil column down to the depth of 100 cm for clarity the pressure heads from individual sites seasons depths are presented as box plots 3 1 1 measured average pressure head in the entire soil column all observed pressure heads for each site and year separately are shown in fig 3 the values were season dependent and might be roughly divided into wet and dry years in the dry years 2003 and 2004 the beech site was attaining lowest pressure heads the median observed values were 751 and 534 cm the median pressure heads in the spruce forest spr were higher by 21 and 23 cm respectively the pressure heads in the spruce forest site were lower than the beech site bee only when the observed precipitation was average or above average 2005 2007 moreover the differences in pressure heads between spruce and beech plot were actually more pronounced as the tensiometer data often reached the lower measurement limit of 867 cm in some depths especially in the beech forest this was the case of the year 2004 and 2007 fig 4 when the pressure heads in beech forest were most probably lower than those recorded by the soil tensiometers see fig s4 the reading from the depth of 90 cm the entire soil profile was affected by the measurement restriction in 2007 not only at a depth of 90 cm measurement in the year 2003 the pressure heads at all sites exceeded the measuring range 0 to 867 cm hence the differences in the lowest pressure heads were biased nevertheless in the case of pressure heads lower than the measurement limit the loss gain of the volumetric water content corresponding to the unit change in pressure head is very small it accounts for less than 0 002 cm3 cm 3 of change in the volumetric water content per a 100 cm change in pressure head the same rate observed from the saturation to the pressure head of 100 cm equals to 0 22 cm3 cm 3 hence the changes in pressure head concerning such low heads result in a very little change in the amount of water present in the soil profile and simultaneously very little variation in water fluxes the differences in pressure heads between beech and spruce sites were statistically significant only in the dry year 2007 fig 5 the differences between spruce and beech sites were more significant in terms of volumetric water contents figs s5 and s6 the spruce site was significantly wetter in dry years in wet years the differences were of lower magnitude but of the same character as in pressure head datasets the reason is that the soil water retention curves representing these two sites do not intersect and the particular pressure head always implied higher volumetric soil water content in the case of the spruce site compared to the beech site the pressured heads and volumetric water contents in grassland gra and meadow mea sites were generally higher than in the forested sites spr bee except for the year 2003 the interquartile range of pressure heads q2 q3 was higher in the forested sites and lower in meadow and grassland sites these observations were confirmed by the results of the kruskal wallis test fig 5 showing prevailing significant differences among gra mea and forested sites 3 1 2 vertical distribution of the pressure heads the box plots depicting the vertical distribution of all pressure head values in the seasons with contrasting precipitation 2004 and 2005 are shown in fig 6 moreover the four year temporal evolution of pressure heads with respect to depth is depicted in fig 4 these years were selected as examples of dry and wet seasons in drier years the beech and spruce forests slightly differed in their vertical distribution of pressure heads the beech forest extracted water more efficiently from higher depths which resulted in a higher variation of pressure heads contrarily in the topsoil depth of 0 37 cm median pressure head values were slightly lower in the spruce forest this is nicely shown on the evolution of the pressure heads from the beginning of august to the end of september in 2004 fig 4 fig 4 namely the years 2003 2004 and 2007 also documents the drier soil under spruce forest at the beginning of the season which can be attributed to higher interception of conifer forest compared to deciduous one moreover it also shows that gra mea spr sites dries gradually from the soil surface towards the deeper layers contrarily at bee site the lower pressure heads were usually observed first in the deeper layers however the kruskal wallis test did not confirm any significantly different pressure heads between spr and bee fig 5 on the other hand the statistically significant differences were found in the vertical distribution of volumetric water contents fig s6 in wet years the differences between spruce and beech sites were even less obvious and the vertical distribution of pressure heads was similar to those of grassland and meadow sites see year 2006 in fig 4 this underpins the fact that when water is abundant the differences in pressure heads among particular land covers are of low importance in wet seasons the pressure heads in gra mea spr bee sites can be characterised by an approximately uniform vertical distribution rarely attaining values lower than 200 cm at all four sites the pressure heads were increasing with increasing depth fig 6 the statistically significant differences among gra mea and forested sites were regularly identified at the bottom of the soil profile below 45 cm however they were based on narrow distributions of pressure heads in the topsoil the significant differences concerning gra mea and forested sites were restricted to dry years fig 5 3 2 soil water balance modelling the measured pressure heads were used to calibrate the hydrus 1d soil water model for all four inspected sites the main objective was to adjust the root water uptake rwu model parameters so that the soil water regime simulations would be as efficient as possible the model results are used to differentiate particular water fluxes at all sites in all seasons namely the rates of evaporation from soil column and canopy plant transpiration and drainage are of particular interest the root water uptake model parameters were identified for each site separately table 2 representing a specific land cover characteristics resulting model efficiencies in terms of rmse coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient are shown in table 3 the estimated pressure heads varied from the observed ones most pronouncedly in both forested areas rmse range extending from 100 cm to 176 cm the grass covered sites were generally better represented by the model with the exception of the year 2003 the reasons for such high error statistics are further discussed in the discussion section the estimated water balances are for each year depicted in table 4 in every single year the beech site had the highest amount of actual evapotranspiration aet sum of canopy transpiration evaporation form soil surface and interception loss the differences were from 62 to 81 mm per season compared to the spr site and from 44 to 105 mm per season compared to grass covered sites gra mea the differences between particular sites followed the same pattern every year only their absolute values were variable the highest transpiration rates were always observed in beech forest seasonal average equalled to 278 mm over the five year period followed by spruce one 230 mm and lowest rates were in the grass covered sites 164 and 173 mm as shown in fig 7 the differences in transpiration between beech and spruce trees were usually increasing from the beginning to the middle of vegetation season when beech transpired at higher rate which was followed by their gradual attenuation higher transpiration of spruce compared to beech at the end of the season this seasonality was one of the causes of significantly lower pressure heads observed in summer in beech forest albeit the annual differences were less pronounced contrarily the evaporation from the soil surface was highest in the grass covered sites with the season average of 144 mm in the gra site and 127 mm in the mea site respectively both forest covered sites had lower rates of surface evaporation 30 mm in spruce and 75 mm in beech covered site respectively the different rates of evaporation can be explained by differences in the lai and available soil water see table 2 the seasonal interception loss in particular sites corresponded to maximum interception capacity reaching highest seasonal averages in the spruce forest 100 mm per season finally the drainage was highest in the spruce forest compared to all remaining sites altogether the highest average annual evapotranspiration rate was observed in the beech forest 431 mm year 1 compared to all other remaining sites 361 368 mm year 1 the difference between spruce and grassland sites was namely in the above mentioned higher drainage in the spruce site 89 mm year 1 compared to 50 and 56 mm per a year 4 discussion 4 1 measured pressure heads under different land covers the spruce site was generally wetter compared to the beech site this is in contradiction with the previous findings of schume et al 2004 and jost et al 2004 who observed wetter beech forest sites compared to spruce dominated sites nevertheless the comparison is influenced by the different soil properties both studies were conducted in the site with significantly higher clay content ranging from 37 to 56 compared to 2 7 found in the liz site besides the soil characteristics the differences between spruce and beech forest could also be based on more economic transpiration demand cermak et al 1995 schume et al 2004 and higher interception in the case of spruce augusto et al 2002 sipek and tesar 2014 moreover the midday stomatal closure hence increased stomatal resistance and reduced transpiration was observed in spruce forest by zweifel et al 2002 when the vapour pressure deficit became sufficiently high additionally at the beginning of the vegetation season slightly lower pressure heads were regularly observed in the spruce stand fig 4 this was caused by the higher interception of the snowfall in the conifer forest observed in the area sipek and tesar 2014 and by the transpiration of spruce on favourable winter days boyce and lucero 1999 mayr et al 2002 drier forest sites compared to grassland and meadow ones have been reported by several authors wiekenkamp et al 2016a zehe et al 2010 zucco et al 2014 this was caused mainly by the higher evapotranspiration of forested sites as documented by the model in fig 7 which led to more pronounced declines in pressure heads the major difference in pressure heads depth distribution was caused by the different distribution of roots in norway spruce picea abies l and european beech fagus sylvatica l forests schmid 2002 while the fine roots of the spruce are mainly located in the topsoil in a dystric cambisol the beech roots are distributed more uniformly similar character of root water uptake depth distribution was also reported by schwärzel et al 2009 in the ore mts germany as this study is based on a five year period covering both wet and dry years we would like to stress that the prevailing character of the differences in pressure heads among particular land covers was partly determined by the climatic characteristics of the particular season as well as those of the preceding season the partition into wet and dry years according to precipitation amounts was not sufficient as the year 2007 was very wet in the vegetation season but preceeded by a relatively warm winter the resulting soil water regime in 2007 thus rather corresponded to that of a dry year hence to obtain representative results it is necessary to conduct comparison studies on longer time scales short term experiments bias the results of several studies and cause differences when comparing the outcomes this could be partly the case of this study and the outcomes of jost et al 2004 and schume et al 2004 who documented drier spruce sites compared to beech sites albeit only in two vegetation seasons of which one was drier however as mentioned above they have investigated a site with different soil properties namely significantly higher clay content ranging from 36 to 56 4 2 water balance modelling the soil water model root water uptake parameters were manually optimised in order to obtain most efficient simulation of the pressure heads in particular depths the resulting parameters for the spruce site were in the range reported by rabbel et al 2018 and vogel et al 2013 who also focused on the rwu parameters in the spruce covered sites the parameters for the grass covered sites differed only slightly from the default hydrus 1d parameters for the grass cover the only difference between mea and gra sites was that the mea site where grass was not clipped so often had a lower pressure head threshold denoting reduced actual evapotranspiration from its potential p2 which could be explained by higher amounts of above ground biomass the beech site model parameters obtained by the calibration procedure indicated namely the higher ability of the beech stand to extract water from deeper soil layers köstner 2001 the most problematic was the wilting point p3 which was in our study optimised to be around the measuring limit of the tensiometer table 2 hence it does not represent the wilting point at all the reason for this is twofold first when using the soil tensiometer no reliable information is available about the course of soil water regime below its measuring limit therefore it is impossible to adjust the wilting point correctly second the previously published shortcoming of the feddes et al 1974 root water uptake model by vogel et al 2013 showed incorrectly low pressure heads estimated by this approach compared to newly designed water potential based model the larger declines in pressure heads were given by the late start of the reduction of transpiration after the onset of dry conditions and the permanent proportionality of root water uptake to the root distribution function hence in our study the value of the wilting point p3 does not correspond to its physical meaning but it is used only as a tool to capture the soil water regime as efficiently as possible in order to obtain the information about soil column water balance generally the simulated pressure heads at the spr site were slightly less efficient that those obtained by vogel et al 2013 focused on the same site but using a slightly different s1d model also based on numerical solution of richards equation vogel et al 2010 for a five month period the efficiency of the pressure heads modelling was influenced by several factors that are not included in the modelling procedure first the rock fragments their volume was not quantified in this study could have influence the estimate of the total amount of water present in the soil profile hydrus 1d model generally assumes uniform distribution of water in each soil layer however if a certain percentage of the profile is formed by the rock fragments then the vegetation will extract more water from the areas between those rock fragments in order to fulfil the water demand this could result in a higher actual drop in observed pressure heads vlček et al 2012 hlaváčiková et al 2015 which would not be represented in the model second the hydrophobicity of the soils doerr et al 2000 may result in non uniform drainage of water into deeper soil layers and formation of a shallow biomat flow gerke et al 2015 the percolation of water can then be limited only to certain locations eventually bypassing the measurement probes further wiekenkamp et al 2016b showed that the occurrence of preferential flow in the forested catchment can cause non sequential reaction of soil moisture sensors at different depths micro relief of the site could also bias the pressure head estimation in the same way due to the concentration of water infiltration into the small depressions as the surface is not completely flat in the spr and bee sites moreover in these depressions the infiltration rate can be gradually reduced by clogging of soil pores by finer particles originating from the surface rousseva et al 2002 thompson et al 2010 finally the course of pressure heads below the tensiometer detection limit discussed is section 2 2 is not known hence the simulation of these low pressure heads was omitted by restricting the rwu limit to this threshold p3 at maximum however this restriction should not have a significant influence on the volume of estimated water present in the soil profile and on the rate of its fluxes discussed in section 3 1 1 the simulated transpiration rates in beech forest were in general agreement with beech annual transpiration across several sites in germany reported by schipka et al 2005 the average seasonal actual evapotranspiration in the spruce forest ranging from 259 to 441 mm per vegetation season corresponded roughly to the values of 269 351 mm reported by sipek and tesar 2017 they estimated aet in the same area but for a different time period and using a different soil moisture model the differences among particular sites namely in the rate of drainage were given particularly by the model set up concerning rwu parameters and soil hydraulic properties this is based on several side experiments when several combinations of shp and rwu parameters from different sites were investigated however due to the above mentioned uncertainties in parameter determination they are not included in the current study 5 conclusion in this study we found that the grassland and meadow sites had generally higher pressure heads compared to the forested sites the soil water model results showed that it was caused by higher evapotranspiration rates in beech forest by 60 mm on average and higher drainage in spruce forest by 35 mm on average the differences in pressure heads between conifer forest picea abies l and deciduous forest fagus sylvatica l were season dependent in dry periods 2003 and 2004 the soil with lower pressure heads was found in beech forest compared to conifer forest lower pressure head values were observed namely at the bottom of the inspected soil column down to 100 cm this was probably caused by the more economical water consumption of coniferous trees in dry periods compared to that of broad leaves trees different vertical root distribution and different soil properties the higher transpiration of the beech forest site was proved by the model results the beech forest evapotranspiration was on average higher by 68 mm which was only partially compensated by higher drainage in the spruce forest which resulted in slightly higher pressure heads in spruce forest the pressure heads were slightly lower compared to beech forest only in seasons with abundant precipitation 2005 2007 which was caused by the higher interception rate of conifer trees compared to that of deciduous trees however in the seasons with high precipitation the differences among all evaluated land cover types were insignificant european beech fagus sylvatica l and norway spruce picea abies l are two of the most dominant tree species in central europe hence
