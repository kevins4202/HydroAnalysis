1500,an accurate solute transport model is critical to the interpretation of single well push pull swpp test previous studies of swpp test generally consider solitary aquifer that is confined by impermeable layers also existing solutions for solute transport in aquifer aquitard systems only consider the injection phase and over simplify the flow field by assuming uniformly distributed velocity in the aquitard in this study we developed a numerical model with dirichlet boundary condition for swpp test affected by leakage described by a low permeability non darcian expression involving a threshold pressure gradient i 0 our swpp test model considered transient flow in multi phases which include injection chase rest and extraction phases finite difference scheme was adopted to solve the models of flow and solute transport the results indicate that an increasing hydraulic diffusivity leads to a greater peak value of breakthrough curve btc while a medium with larger grain size results in less estimation error when using steady state flow model to interpret the transient swpp test additionally a greater i 0 makes the solute stored in aquitard more difficult to be extracted out due to dispersion dominance which results in higher btc values for the purpose of application a lumped dimensionless index called the non darcian index ndi was proposed to quantify the overestimation degree by neglecting leakage and the underestimation degree by accounting for darcian leakage when interpreting the swpp test with low permeability non darcian leakage the long term slope of breakthrough curve coupled with the ndi can be employed to determine the cases in which the low permeability non darcian leakage should be considered keywords low permeability non darcian leakage push pull test parameter estimation finite difference scheme 1 introduction single well push pull test swpp is a special case of single well tracer test which has wide applications in hydrogeochemical characterization of deep geothermal system hebig et al 2015 and identification of in situ aquifer parameters relevant to solute transport gelhar and collins 1971 schroth et al 2001 li et al 2019b and biogeochemical reactions istok et al 1997 phanikumar and mcguire 2010 wang and zhan 2019 a basic swpp test involves injection of a prepared solution followed by extraction of groundwater through the same well huang et al 2010 between injection and extraction phases a chase phase and a rest phase are recommended for the purpose of ensuring a more complete reaction of the injected chemicals phanikumar and mcguire 2010 wang and zhan 2019 breakthrough curves btcs observed in the wellbore during the extraction phase are fitted by analytical or numerical results to obtain the target aquifer parameters previous swpp studies have proposed various models with respect to different dimensions of solute transport gelhar and collins 1971 developed an approximate analytical solution to the model of purely radial advection dispersion with fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer as for two dimensional solute transport in swpp test with partially penetrating well huang et al 2010 developed an analytical solution involving advection longitudinal and vertical dispersion unlike the conventional well induced flow field a spherical flow field was employed by schroth and istok 2005 in swpp test to investigate the difference from its cylindrical flow counterpart in addition some studies focused on often overlooked factors that actually have significant effects on the accuracy of parameter estimation through swpp test such as the non darcian effects of wang et al 2017 skin effects of li et al 2019a regional groundwater flow effects of li et al 2019b mixing effects and wellbore storage effects of wang et al 2018 wang and zhan 2019 and shi et al 2020 it is important to note that the studies mentioned above solely focused on a totally confined aquifer system in other words the aquifer has no hydraulic connection to adjacent ones due to the impermeable layers at the top and bottom to our knowledge a low permeability layer is a fine grained sedimentary deposit such as clay or shale which forms an interlayer between two high permeability layers like sand or limestone in such a case the low permeability layer is able to conduct water when there is significant water head difference between two high permeability aquifers furthermore previous studies have uncovered the effects of leakage on the radial flow field hantush 1967 wen et al 2011a 2011b meng et al 2015 demonstrating that neglecting aquitard effects might lead to remarkable errors in the description of reactive transport in the main aquifer zhan et al 2009a 2009b this is particularly true in the case of a fully penetrating injection well which can quickly deliver solute to the aquifer aquitard interface where a portion of the solute may spread over the aquitard to a certain extent due to leakage flow a number of previous studies of aquitard effects on aquifer solute transport exist such as chen 1985 wang and zhan 2013 and zhan et al 2009a 2009b however these only focused on the injection phase of the swpp test furthermore these studies assumed the flow in the aquifer aquitard system to be steady state with wang and zhan 2013 and zhan et al 2009a 2009b even assuming a uniformly distributed velocity in the aquitard for the purpose of analytical derivation as far as we know these assumptions may be rational in a single injection phase but may be invalid for swpp test firstly despite the significant low flow velocity in low permeability medium the flow velocity in aquitard should depend on the radial distance from the well since positions closer to the well have greater variation in hydraulic head resulting in a greater vertical leakage at locations closer to the well besides the flow field in the well vicinity is critical to the btcs observed in wellbore secondly it is hardly possible to maintain steady state flow during swpp test because after transition between two phases in swpp test the flow field is slow to reach steady state due to aquifer storage effect vandenbohede et al 2008 2009 and wang et al 2017 investigated transient swpp test however they did not consider aquitard effect consequently a more accurate description of aquitard flow may be critical to improving the estimation of aquifer parameters using the swpp test previous studies also employed darcy s law to determine transient leakage through aquitard wen et al 2011b feng and zhan 2015 2016 although non darcian behavior of flow in clay were reported decades ago by series of experimental studies lutz and kemper 1959 hansbo 1960 miller and low 1963 blecker 1970 which mentioned a so called threshold pressure gradient defined as the intercept between the linear part of the curve and the i axis as fig 1 shows with a hydraulic gradient smaller than the threshold pressure gradient denoted as i 0 the flux gradient relationship shows non darcian behavior moreover a linear relationship can be satisfied when hydraulic gradient is higher than i 0 therefore extensive studies have proposed non darcian expressions of flow in low permeability medium according to experimental results hansbo 1960 2001 swartzendruber 1961 bear 1979 liu and birkholzer 2012 for example swartzendruber 1961 introduced a modified version of darcy s law as 1 q k i i 0 1 e i i 0 where q is specific discharge l t and k is hydraulic conductivity l t it is notable that eq 1 was verified by extensive experiments under saturated condition swartzendruber 1961 blecker 1970 and has two noteworthy advantages compared with other empirical expressions of low permeability flow firstly the equation of swartzendruber 1961 is practicable in both cases of i i 0 and i i 0 and covers the non linear flux gradient relationship with low hydraulic gradient unlike bear s 1979 expression liu and birkholzer 2012 secondly on the precondition of accuracy the equation of swartzendruber 1961 employed less uncertain parameters than the expressions of other studies such as hansbo 1960 2001 and zou 1996 to our best knowledge very few studies considered non darcian leakage in well hydraulics although meng et al 2015 employed bear s 1979 expression to describe leakage to a pumping well in a semi confined aquifer however they did not consider non linear flow in the case of i i 0 which may be questionable in the case of high i 0 therefore in this study we will develop a new numerical model for a transient four phase swpp test accounting for low permeability non darcian leakage the wellbore storage will be considered during injection chase rest and extraction phases as well our objective is to elucidate the effects of low velocity non darcian flow on swpp test under transient flow conditions 2 problem statement fig 2 represents a four phase swpp test in a leaky confined aquifer both top and bottom of the target aquifer are connected to aquitards both being low permeability interlayers between two neighboring aquifers a cylindrical coordinate is established with the origin located at the intersection between the well center axis and the bottom of the lower aquitard the leaky confined system is homogeneous and laterally infinite a fully penetrating well generates radial flow field in the aquifer while the vertical flow in the aquifer is overlooked meanwhile non uniform leakage exists along the upper and lower aquifer aquitard interfaces both aquitards have the first kind of leakage boundary dirichlet i e the heads of neighboring aquifers are assumed to be constant while the storage capacities of both aquitards are assumed to be neglected considering that the vertical hydraulic gradient is much higher than the radial one in the aquitard the radial flow in the aquitard is therefore overlooked with the solute transport assumed to be dominated by vertical advection dispersion the flow in the aquifer obeys darcy s law while the flow in the aquitard shows low velocity non darcian behavior which can be described by eq 1 2 1 mathematical model of transient groundwater flow based on the aforementioned assumptions the governing equations of transient flow field in the leaky confined aquifer can be written as follows 2 k r 2 s r t r 2 k r r s r t r q u r t m q d r t m s s s r t t 3 s r t 0 0 4 s r t 0 5 2 π r w mq r t r r w π r c 2 s w t t q where s r t indicates the drawdown l at the radial location r and time t k r and s s represent the radial hydraulic conductivity l t and the specific storage of aquifer respectively m is the thickness of aquifer l s w is the drawdown in wellbore l q is the constant pumping rate which is negative for injection and positive for extraction l3 t r w and r c are the radius of well screen and well casing l q u r t and q d r t indicate the spatiotemporal leakage into aquifer from upper and lower aquitards l t respectively they are calculated as 6 q u r t k u s r t b u i 0 1 e s r t b u i 0 7 q d r t k d s r t b d i 0 1 e s r t b d i 0 where k u and k d represent the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the upper and lower aquitards l t respectively b u and b d are the thicknesses of the upper and lower aquitard l respectively i 0 is the threshold pressure gradient of aquitard which is assumed to be the same in both aquitards eq 3 indicates the initial condition in the injection phase note that the spatially distributed head at the end of each phase is set to be the initial head in the following phase eqs 4 and 5 represent the boundary conditions at infinity and well face respectively 2 2 mathematical model of solute transport in the leaky confined system the transient flow model provides spatiotemporal head which yields the spatiotemporal average radial pore velocity l t by darcy s law in aquifer as follows 8 v r r t k r θ 1 s r t r where θ 1 indicates the effective porosity of the aquifer similarly the average vertical pore velocities in the upper and lower aquitard are calculated as v u r t q u r t θ 2 and v d r t q d r t θ 2 where θ 2 is the effective porosity of both upper and lower aquitards we assume that the solute transport in the aquifer involves radial advection radial and vertical dispersion meanwhile the solute transport in the aquitard is dominated by vertical advection and dispersion the governing equation of solute transport in the leaky confined aquifer around well is wen and wang 2013 9a c 1 r z t t 1 r r rd 1 r r t c 1 r z t r z d 1 z r t c 1 r z t z v r r t c 1 r z t r r r w b d z b d m where c 1 r z t represents the spatiotemporal concentration m l3 with r z to indicate two dimensional 2 d coordinate in the aquifer d 1r r t and d 1z r t represent the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficient l2 t in the aquifer respectively they are calculated as d 1r r t α l v r r t d 0 and d 1z r t α t v r r t d 0 where α l and α t are the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity in the aquifer l respectively d 0 is the effective diffusion coefficient l2 t the governing equations of solute transport in the upper and lower aquitards can be written as c u r z t t d u r t 2 c u r z t z 2 v u r t c u r z t z 9b r r w b d m z b d m b u and c d r z t t d d r t 2 c d r z t z 2 v d r t c d r z t z 9c r r w 0 z

coefficients l2 t in the upper and lower aquitards respectively which can be calculated as d u r t v u r t α u d 0 and d d r t v d r t α d d 0 where α u and α d are the vertical dispersivities l in the upper and lower aquitards respectively the initial condition of injection phase is 10 c 1 r z t 0 c u r z t 0 c d r z t 0 0 note that the spatially distributed concentration at the end of each phase is set to be the initial condition of the next phase the boundary conditions in the aquifer and aquitard are 11 c 1 r z t c u r z t c d r z t 0 12 c u r z b d m b u t c d r z 0 t 0 the

wellbore concentrations of tracer in the injection and chase phases respectively obviously c cha equals to 0 due to the absence of tracer in the injected water 3 numerical solution because of the non linearity of aquitard flow it seems impractical to obtain analytical solutions to eqs 2 15d therefore this study will employ a finite difference fd scheme to solve the transient swpp test model considering low permeability non darcian leakage the radial discretization is similar to that in meng et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 which employed a logarithmic node system for the purpose of minimizing numerical errors 16 r i r i 1 2 r i 1 2 2 i 1 2 n where r i 1 2 is defined as 17 log 10 r i 1 2 log 10 r w i log 10 r e log 10 r w n i 0 1 n in which n represents the number of nodes r e indicates the influence radius or the infinite boundary at which the solute concentration equals to zero as eq 11 indicates in this study n and r e are set to 2000 and 1 104 m respectively the vertical discretization should refine the node density at the aquifer aquitard interface wang and zhan 2013 therefore the domain 0 b d is logarithmically discretized as 18 z j b d 1 z j j 1 2 15 the domain b d b d m 2 can be discretized as 19 z j b d z j 15 m 2 j 16 17 30 the domain b d m 2 b d m can be discretized as 20 z j b d m 2 m 2 1 z j 30 j 31 32 45 the domain b d m b d m b u can be discretized as 21 z j b d m z j 45 b u j 46 47 60 where 22 log 10 z j 16 j log 10 0 01 log 10 1 10 j 1 2 15 23 log 10 z j j log 10 0 01 log 10 1 10 j 1 2 15 after the above discretization in both radial and vertical directions the governing equations of solute transport in the aquifer and aquitard can be rewritten as 24 d c i j dt r i 1 2 d r i c i 1 j c i j r i r i 1 r i 1 2 d r i 1 c i j c i 1 j r i 1 r i r i r i 1 2 r i 1 2 d z i c i j 1 c i j z j z j 1 d z i 1 c i j c i j 1 z j 1 z j z j 1 2 z j 1 2 v r i c i 1 2 j c i 1 2 j r i 1 2 r i 1 2 i 2 3 n 1 j 16 17 45 and 25 d c i j dt d u d i c i j 1 c i j z j z j 1 d u d i c i j c i j 1 z j 1 z j z j 1 2 z j 1 2 v z i c i j 1 2 c i j 1 2 z j 1 2 z j 1 2 i 2 3 n 1 j 1 2 15 and 46 47 60 respectively where d r i α r v r i d 0 d z i α t v r i d 0 d 2 i α 2 v z i d 0 v r i d r i and d z i are the radial flow velocity v r longitudinal dispersivity d r and transverse dispersivity d z at the nodes with coordinates r r i v z i and d u d i are the vertical flow velocity v z and dispersivity d u d in the aquitard at the nodes with coordinates r r i c i j is the concentration c at node i j note that u d indicates that both aquitards have the same parameter value therefore eq 25 is suitable for both upper and lower aquitards eqs eqn 24 and 25 are composed of a group of n ordinary differential functions of time which are solved by a stiff integrator ode15s in matlab associated with relevant boundary conditions and initial conditions considering that fd solution cannot avoid numerical oscillation unless the spatial and temporal discretization are refined enough a benchmark solution with semi analytical method is often used to test the discretization performance in this study the robustness of the models with respect to both flow field and solute transport are validated fig 3 indicates the comparisons between the fd solution in this study and analytical solution with respect to time varying drawdowns in the extraction phase at r 0 1 1 and 10 m respectively in these comparisons the initial drawdown is assumed to be zero and the non darcian expression in eq 3 is transformed into darcy s law by eliminating the threshold pressure gradient term hence eqs 2 7 yield an analytical solution in the laplace form as 26 s r p q k 0 ra p 2 π r w m k r a k 1 r w a π r c 2 p k 0 r w a where 27 a k u k d k r mb sp k r m in which p indicates the laplace variable k 0 and k 1 are the second kind of modified bessel function with order zero and one respectively the derivation procedure for eq 26 is similar to that in wen and wang 2013 and the numerical inversion of eq 26 can be conducted by stehfest method stehfest 1970a 1970b the parameters used for these comparisons are q 100 m3 day k r 1 m day k u k d 0 01 m day m 10 m b 5 m s s 1 10 4 m r w r c 0 05 m the values of k r k u k d and s s are set according to spitz and moreno 1996 from fig 3 particularly in the case of darcian leakage our numerical solution agrees well with the analytical solution for the description of transient flow field in this leaky confined system therefore the discretization for transient flow field in our fd method is reliable as for the benchmark solution of solute transport in leaky confined aquifer we employ the analytical solution to the injection phase in wang et al 2013 for comparison in this comparison the flow field in our model is modified to maintain similarity with wang et al 2013 that is to say instead of a transient value dependent on the drawdown in the aquifer the vertical porous velocity v z in the aquitard is set to be a uniformly distributed constant while the radial porous velocity v r in the aquifer is assumed to be steady state which means v r q 2πrmθ 1 the parameters used for solute transport are q 500 m3 day θ 1 0 35 m 10 m b u d 5 m s s 1 10 4 m 1 r w 0 05 m α l 10 m α t 3 m α 2 2 m v z 0 1 m day and molecular diffusion is neglected fig 4 shows the comparisons between our fd solution and the analytical solution of wang et al 2013 with respect to dimensionless concentration profiles in the vertical direction at r 5 m in the injection phase c 0 is the concentration at the well during injection phase and c c 0 indicates the dimensionless concentration of btcs from fig 4 it can be noted that the two solutions agree well with each other at t 105 and 106 s which also implies a reliable elaboration of solute transport in the aquifer aquitard system through the fd method in general these benchmark solutions have verified the validity of our fd scheme with respect to both transient flow field and solute transport in this aquifer aquitard system 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of flow field on solute transport fig 5 shows the breakthrough curves btcs at the well during the extraction phase of the swpp test considering low permeability non darcian leakage we applied the model in aquifers composed of three representative porous media with different hydraulic diffusivities denoted as a and calculated as k r s s which are coarse sand k r 1 10 4 m s s s 1 10 5 m 1 a 10 m2 s medium sand k r 1 10 5 m s s s 1 10 4 m 1 a 0 1 m2 s and fine sand k r 5 10 6 m s s s 1 10 4 m 1 a 0 05 m2 s respectively the values of k r and s s of these media can be found in domenico and schwartz 1990 spitz and moreno 1996 and batu 1998 the other parameters are given as k u k d 0 02 m day m 5 m b u b d 5 m i 0 5 r w r c 0 05 m θ 1 θ 2 0 3 α l 20 m α t 8 m α 2 4 m d 0 1 10 9 m2 s t inj 0 5 day t cha 0 1 day t res 0 1 day t ext 5 day q inj 50 m3 day q cha 50 m3 day q res 0 and q ext 50 m3 day where q inj q cha q res and q ext are the pumping rates of injection chase rest and extraction phases respectively note that the vertical tracer concentration distribution is non uniform as fig 4 demonstrates here we define the concentration at the well as a weighted average along the well screen expressed as 28 c i 1 n c r r w z i dz i m where z i and dz i indicate the midpoint and length of the vertical segment discretized by eqs 18 23 respectively note that i 1 n dz i m and dz i z i 1 2 z i 1 2 where z i 1 2 and z i 1 2 are the locations of both ends of the ith vertical segment generally a greater grain size results in a larger a which indicates that pore water is released and carried to pumping well faster making the flow regime approach steady state earlier fig 6 represents the temporal change rate of head in wellbore in which positive or negative peaks happen at the beginning of each phases except chase phase because flow rate has no changes only during the transition between injection and chase phase as fig 6 indicates the change rate of the head in wellbore in the case of coarse sand has the smallest peak value and the earliest drop to zero therefore one can assume the flow regime in swpp test in coarse sand to be quasi steady state as fig 5 indicates the quasi steady state btc of coarse sand is obviously higher than the other two types of btcs this implies that a flow tending to steady state has a stronger ability to extract the solute out from the aquifer therefore one can conclude that the steady state solution may not always interpret the transient swpp test perfectly especially in this case with leaky confined system composed of fine grain conversely the transient degree of flow in the medium composed of coarse grain probably has limited effects on swpp test and a greater grain size leads to less estimation error if using steady state model to interpret the transient swpp test 4 2 effects of low permeability non darcian flow on solute transport extensive experimental studies report a wide range of i 0 value lutz and kemper 1959 miller and low 1963 blecker 1970 dubin and moulin 1986 zou 1996 wang et al 2011 for example blecker 1970 measured i 0 of clay loam from brolliar and springervilla soil series and obtained a range of 0 04 0 267 zou 1996 found that clay has higher i 0 than silty clay and silt with the range of i 0 measured to be 1 10 wang et al 2011 measured the cores of daqing oilfield in china by flowing water with a certain salinity and obtained a i 0 range of 10 30 miller and low 1963 measured i 0 of clay samples from wyoming bentonite to be higher than 100 obviously porous media in nature have wide range of i 0 for the purpose of our discussion we selected median values of i 0 i e from 0 1 to 10 fig 7 presents the btcs at the well during the extraction phase in different cases the legend no aquitard indicates no leakage while darcy indicates that the leakage is described by darcy s law i 0 0 5 and i 0 5 indicate that the leakage is low permeability non darcian with threshold pressure gradient equal to 0 5 and 5 respectively k r 0 5 m day and s s 1 10 4 m 1 are employed for fig 7 and the other parameters are the same to those in section 4 1 for fig 5 the comparison between the cases with and without leakage reveals some of the injected solute goes through the aquifer aquitard interface and is stored in the aquitard before the extraction phase begins which makes the residual solute in the aquifer less than that in the case without leakage therefore the extracted concentration in the leaky case is smaller than that of the confined case additionally an increasing i 0 makes the btcs approach the one without leakage effects while a decreasing i 0 makes the btcs approach the one with darcian leakage for i 0 values smaller than 0 5 the difference between darcian and non darcian solutions is small making darcy s law practicable to describe the leakage effects in terms of swpp test interpretation on the other hand when i 0 exceeds a certain value in this case higher than 5 the leaky confined aquifer can be regarded as a totally confined aquifer with respect to swpp test this is because a high i 0 results in a considerable amount of low velocity flow as eqs 6 and 7 indicate and this kind of low permeability leakage has weak transport capacity to make solute move through the aquifer aquitard interface fig 8 highlights the dimensionless mass of solute stored in aquitards denoted as m u d m tot during the four phases in the cases of darcian and non darcian leakage m tot represents the total solute mass injected into the leaky confined system and m u d refers to the sum of mass in both aquitards which can be calculated as 29 m u d rw 0 b d 2 πr c d dzdr rw b d m b d m b u 2 πr c u dzdr as fig 8 indicates the value of m u d m tot with darcian leakage is the highest in the three cases which indicates that darcian leakage has the strongest ability to spread solute into aquitards before the extraction phase in the extraction phase m u d m tot in all the three cases increases at first and then decreases on one hand this is because in the early extraction phase the flow direction at most of the aquifer aquitard interface is still from aquifer to aquitard which can be roughly indicated by the groundwater table in fig 2 b and qualitatively represented by fig 9 where the positive velocity also indicates a flow direction from aquifer to aquitard while the negative velocity refers to the opposite direction also t 0 12 s and 80 min represent the three different time points from the onset of the extraction phase in the early stage though a drawdown forms at the vicinity of the well screen in which the flow direction is still from aquifer to aquitard at most of the aquifer aquitard interface indicated by the curve in the case with darcian leakage at t 12 s fig 9 on the other hand even after a period of extraction the flow direction is towards the well from almost everywhere in the main aquifer with the flow direction from aquitard to aquifer almost everywhere at the aquifer aquitard interface as indicated by the curve in the case with darcian leakage at t 80 min furthermore the solute concentration in the main aquifer is still generally much higher than in the aquitards making a portion of the solute penetrate into the aquitards from the main aquifer by dispersion especially at the interface where the vertical flow is weak when the concentration difference between aquifer and aquitard disappears the solute can no longer transport into the aquitard by dispersion this further elucidates why m u d m tot first increases and then decreases in addition it can be found from fig 8 that the diminished magnitude of m u d m tot in the case with darcian leakage is greater than that in the case with low permeability non darcian leakage and that the diminished magnitude reduces with respect to a higher threshold gradient as the low permeability non darcian leakage effects become stronger the transporting capacity of advection becomes weaker while the dispersion induced solute transport gains greater dominance in the mass transfer between aquifer and aquitards in other words with increasing low permeability non darcian leakage it is more difficult for pumping flow to pull the solute out from the aquitards as highlighted in fig 7 fig 10 shows the extraction phase btcs for cases of no aquitard darcian and non darcian leakage i 0 5 with respect to different aquifer thickness m which are 1 2 and 3 times the aquitard thickness b u d where b u d refers to b u or b d both are assumed to be equal the other parameters are the same with those in fig 7 section 4 2 the comparison among figs a b and c indicates that when aquifer thickness is close to or even less than aquitard thickness then leakage effect should not be overlooked when conducting swpp test meanwhile the low permeability non darcian flow shows remarkable effects on the interpretation of btcs furthermore leakage effects reduce as m b u d increases as long as the aquifer is three or more times thicker than the aquitard therefore the solution for swpp in confined aquifer can replace that in the leaky system with low permeability non darcian leakage which has less impact compared with the case of small m b u d hence low permeability non darcian flow should be considered in a sandwich strata composed of two thick aquitards and a thin interlayered aquifer 4 3 sensitivity analysis since the leakage through low permeability layer has effects on the swpp test it is necessary to compare the degree of influence of aquitard parameters on the solute concentration at the well during the extraction phase consequently sensitivity analyses were conducted for the parameters including i 0 k u d α u d and b u d to highlight the effects of each on the characteristics of the extraction phase btcs the normalized sensitivity analysis method kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 which has been widely used in the study of aquifer parameter estimation is adopted for the sensitivity analysis in this study here the subscript u d indicates that the upper and lower aquitards have the same value with respect to this parameter for example α u d indicates the vertical dispersivities of the two aquitards are equal in fig 11 the normalized sensitivity during the extraction phase indicates the variation degree of c c 0 generated by a tiny increment or decrement of the parameter value in the legend 1 and 1 represent 1 increment and 1 decrement respectively it is notable that the normalized sensitivities of all the parameters decrease with time this phenomenon is associated with the decrease in residual mass of solute in the system over time due to extraction this is found to also be in agreement with the results in figs 7 and 10 where the variations of i 0 and b u d tend to make greater difference in the early stage and smaller difference in the tailings of btcs what is important to note is that the normalized sensitivities of i 0 k u d and b u d decrease more sharply than that of α u d note that the effects of i 0 k u d and b u d on solute transport come mainly from their effects on flow field while α u d cannot influence the flow velocity in the aquitards considering that the behavior of btcs at the well depends highly on the solute mass stored in the aquitards it is reasonable to infer that dispersion dominance makes solute transport difficult by advection from aquitard to aquifer in this transient flow field this is also in agreement with the results presented in fig 8 where the solute mass stored in the aquitards have a remarkable increase before decrease during the extraction phase 4 4 application in parameter estimation the results presented and discussed in the above sections show that the solution of swpp test considering low permeability non darcian leakage yields significantly different btcs from the solutions that do not consider any leakage as well as those that only consider darcian leakage this is particularly evident when the aquifer thickness is not much thicker than the aquitard as eq 1 and sensitivity analyses indicate the influence factors include more than threshold pressure gradient and aquifer thickness therefore the low permeability non darcian leakage effects on swpp test should be theoretically expressed by a lumped dimensionless parameter which is an algebraic expression composed of the most relevant parameters following a series of numerical experiments and analysis with eq 1 we define a lumped dimensionless parameter called the non darcian index ndi expressed as 30 ndi 1 exp a a where 31 a q k r m b u d i 0 32 δ α 2 m the derivation of ndi can be found in detail in appendix a in terms of practical use two meaningful questions are a how the effects on swpp test can be comprehensively quantified by the dimensionless parameter ndi b how the ndi parameter indicates whether the low permeability non darcian leakage should be considered or neglected fig 12 generally shows that the btcs with low permeability non darcian leakage should theoretically be found between the btcs of no leakage nl model and darcian leakage dl model as fig 1 indicates an extremely high i 0 makes the specific discharge approach zero and a smaller i 0 makes the non darcian effects imperceptible the btcs of two simpler models i e nl and dl models are used to fit the actual btcs that are generated by the model which considers low permeability non darcian leakage note that in the case of moderate non darcian leakage in fig 12 it is difficult to fit the tailing stage of btcs during the adjustment of estimated parameters this is attributed to the fact that the peak values of btcs in the early extraction stage are highly relevant to the residual solute mass stored in the main aquifer before pumping similarly the btcs can be easily fitted by adjusting the estimated parameters such as longitudinal dispersivity and porosity of the main aquifer nevertheless the tailing stage of btc reflects a long term dispersion induced mass transfer between aquifer and aquitard which is similar to the long term mass diffusion between matrix and natural fractures in the non fickian behavior of chen et al 2017 as long as the peak value of btcs in the early stage is fitted the differences of the mass transfer between aquifer and aquitard make the fitting infeasible due to non darcian effect therefore the fitting is conducted by trial and error method only for the btcs in the early stage especially for the peak value since the early btc can reflect the effects of non darcian leakage on swpp tests during injection chase rest and early pumping phase it is reasonable to quantify the effects of low permeability non darcian leakage effects by the fitting process of btcs in the early extraction stage fig 13 highlights the performance of simpler models in the interpretation of swpp test with low permeability non darcian leakage fig 13 a represents the overestimation errors of α l and θ 1 versus ndi using nl model to fit the actual values generated by the model considering low permeability non darcian leakage while fig 13 b indicates the underestimation errors of α l and θ 1 versus ndi using dl model to fit the same ones generally it can be concluded that nl model results in greater estimation errors than dl model this is due to the inability of nl model to deliver any solute from the main aquifer to neighboring layers making the estimation errors greater than those in dl model meanwhile the dl model still accounts for the mass transfer between aquifer and aquitard despite the weak characterization of aquitard flow in addition fig 13 demonstrates how the ndi quantifies low permeability non darcian effects on swpp test as ndi increases the overestimation error of nl model decreases and the underestimation error of dl model increases apparently higher ndi indicates stronger deviation from darcian flow leading to more distinguishable low permeability non darcian leakage effects from fig 1 it can be inferred that a very strong low permeability non darcian flow may be equivalent to a quasi stagnant flow which allows the nl model with no consideration for leakage to interpret the swpp reliably conversely lower ndi corresponds to a weaker non darcian effect indicating that the dl model can be also be utilized for swpp test interpretation moreover fig 13 presents the conditions under which low permeability non darcian effect has to be considered as illustrated in fig 13 a should the overestimation degree fall below an allowable level such as 15 then the ndi should be greater than 0 95 this can be achieved by adjusting a single parameter to a specific value such as q smaller than 7 m3 day k r greater than 4 m day i 0 greater than 40 m or b u d greater than 40 m with the other parameters given the same values as in 4 2 on the other hand fig 13 b demonstrates that if the underestimation degree falls below 15 then the ndi should be less than 0 6 which corresponds to q greater than 70 m3 day k r smaller than 0 35 m day i 0 smaller than 3 5 m or b u d smaller than 3 5 m with the other parameters given the same values as in section 4 2 in order to gain more insights on how to properly utilize a model for swpp test interpretation we use the investigation of long term slope of btcs by chen et al 2017 as a reference chen et al 2017 developed a fractional model accounting for non fickian solute transport in a four stage swpp test and demonstrated that the slope of late time btcs is highly dependent on the mass diffusion between matrix and natural fracture despite the differences between a model that considers leakage effects and that considering dual domain medium the mass transfer at the aquifer aquitard interfaces may still make their respective leakage induced btcs behave in a similar manner especially in the tailing stage generally a double logarithmic coordinate system is employed to investigate the long term btc slope though any effect on peak value seems to be compressed due to logarithmic treatment the long term behavior of btc are better represented by a log log coordinate system than a normal linear coordinate system that is to say for a four stage swpp test which yields a peak value in the extraction phase btc a log log coordinate system may not be suggested for parameter estimation but a log log coordinate system with an extended extraction duration enables the btc to elucidates whether low permeability non darcian leakage should be considered as fig 14 indicates the btcs of nl dl and non darcian models show slight differences in a log log coordinate system until to the tailing stage in which the low permeability non darcian btc is between the nl and dl models in addition greater i 0 results in a smaller value of long term btc which approaches that of nl model due to stronger low permeability non darcian effect this further leads to a weaker mass transfer from aquitard to aquifer during the extraction phase resulting in a greater descending slope of the long term btc besides this fig 14 also depicts the long term slope lines for both nl and dl models providing some guidance on choice of model for real world application typically one can first plot the btcs of nl and dl models in a log log coordinate system if the two long term btc slopes are approximately equal which happens as the case in fig 10 c then the mass transferred between aquifer and aquitard is negligible compared to that in the main aquifer in this case either nl or dl model can be used for the swpp test interpretation and it is not essential to employ the ndi parameter to account for the low permeability non darcian leakage on the contrary if the long term btc slopes of nl and dl models indicate distinct differences while the long term btc slope of the field test data is found between the nl and dl models then it can be inferred that the low permeability non darcian leakage exists and should be estimated in this case the ndi parameter can be employed to discern which model would best interpret the swpp test 5 summary and conclusions swpp test has been an effective strategy to determine the in situ parameters relevant to reactive transport of contaminants therefore an accurate model which describes the tracer transport in swpp test is essential generally conventional models for swpp test assume the aquifer to be isolated by the neighboring ones and previous studies of the solute transport in aquifer aquitard system assume a uniformly distributed velocity in the aquitard for the purpose of analytical derivation these assumptions are limited in practical application of swpp test with leakage effects besides most previous studies of swpp test focus on steady state flow which is actually impractical when injection phase transits to extraction phase therefore this study develops a finite difference solution to transient swpp test considering leakage effects which is described by a low permeability non darcian expression defined by a threshold pressure gradient the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for transient swpp test with low permeability non darcian leakage an increasing hydraulic diffusivity leads to a greater peak value of btcs while a medium with larger grain size results in less estimation error when using steady state flow model for the interpretation of transient swpp test 2 a greater i 0 not only results in less solute stored in aquitard before extraction but also makes it more difficult to extract the solute out from aquitard due to dispersion dominance making the value of btc higher 3 the newly proposed lumped dimensionless parameter ndi quantifies the estimation errors in swpp test considering low permeability non darcian leakage by using simpler models that consider darcian leakage dl or no leakage nl the overestimation degree by nl model decreases while the underestimation degree by dl model increases with an increasing ndi 4 the long term btc slope coupled with the ndi can be employed to determine the case in which low permeability non darcian leakage should be considered declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they do

appendix a the derivation of lumped dimensionless parameter e after thoroughly checking the governing equations for flow and solute transport from eq 1 to eq 15d one can find it is eq 1 that results in the low permeability non darcian leakage effects and influences the accuracy of swpp test in the main aquifer a notable finding is when low permeability non darcian effects are weak i e the term i 0 1 e i i 0 approaches zero and q ki one can employ simple darcian leakage model for the interpretation of swpp test on the other hand if the low permeability non darcian effects are strong i e the value of i 0 1 e i i 0 is considerably large compared to that of i and the scale of pre linear flow extends drastically as in fig 1 then q 0 then one can employ a simpler model without considering leakage to interpret swpp test the above analysis indicates the ratio of i 0 1 e i i 0 to i which can we call the non darcian index ndi is significant for the choice of model as well as the accuracy of parameter estimation for swpp test interpretation in the expression of ndi the only variable i which equals to s b u d depends mostly on the flow behavior in the main aquifer since the drawdown s in the main aquifer is proportional to the pumping injection rate q the main aquifer thickness m and the hydraulic conductivity k r of the main aquifer one can get a1 i q k r m b u d then the

1500,an accurate solute transport model is critical to the interpretation of single well push pull swpp test previous studies of swpp test generally consider solitary aquifer that is confined by impermeable layers also existing solutions for solute transport in aquifer aquitard systems only consider the injection phase and over simplify the flow field by assuming uniformly distributed velocity in the aquitard in this study we developed a numerical model with dirichlet boundary condition for swpp test affected by leakage described by a low permeability non darcian expression involving a threshold pressure gradient i 0 our swpp test model considered transient flow in multi phases which include injection chase rest and extraction phases finite difference scheme was adopted to solve the models of flow and solute transport the results indicate that an increasing hydraulic diffusivity leads to a greater peak value of breakthrough curve btc while a medium with larger grain size results in less estimation error when using steady state flow model to interpret the transient swpp test additionally a greater i 0 makes the solute stored in aquitard more difficult to be extracted out due to dispersion dominance which results in higher btc values for the purpose of application a lumped dimensionless index called the non darcian index ndi was proposed to quantify the overestimation degree by neglecting leakage and the underestimation degree by accounting for darcian leakage when interpreting the swpp test with low permeability non darcian leakage the long term slope of breakthrough curve coupled with the ndi can be employed to determine the cases in which the low permeability non darcian leakage should be considered keywords low permeability non darcian leakage push pull test parameter estimation finite difference scheme 1 introduction single well push pull test swpp is a special case of single well tracer test which has wide applications in hydrogeochemical characterization of deep geothermal system hebig et al 2015 and identification of in situ aquifer parameters relevant to solute transport gelhar and collins 1971 schroth et al 2001 li et al 2019b and biogeochemical reactions istok et al 1997 phanikumar and mcguire 2010 wang and zhan 2019 a basic swpp test involves injection of a prepared solution followed by extraction of groundwater through the same well huang et al 2010 between injection and extraction phases a chase phase and a rest phase are recommended for the purpose of ensuring a more complete reaction of the injected chemicals phanikumar and mcguire 2010 wang and zhan 2019 breakthrough curves btcs observed in the wellbore during the extraction phase are fitted by analytical or numerical results to obtain the target aquifer parameters previous swpp studies have proposed various models with respect to different dimensions of solute transport gelhar and collins 1971 developed an approximate analytical solution to the model of purely radial advection dispersion with fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer as for two dimensional solute transport in swpp test with partially penetrating well huang et al 2010 developed an analytical solution involving advection longitudinal and vertical dispersion unlike the conventional well induced flow field a spherical flow field was employed by schroth and istok 2005 in swpp test to investigate the difference from its cylindrical flow counterpart in addition some studies focused on often overlooked factors that actually have significant effects on the accuracy of parameter estimation through swpp test such as the non darcian effects of wang et al 2017 skin effects of li et al 2019a regional groundwater flow effects of li et al 2019b mixing effects and wellbore storage effects of wang et al 2018 wang and zhan 2019 and shi et al 2020 it is important to note that the studies mentioned above solely focused on a totally confined aquifer system in other words the aquifer has no hydraulic connection to adjacent ones due to the impermeable layers at the top and bottom to our knowledge a low permeability layer is a fine grained sedimentary deposit such as clay or shale which forms an interlayer between two high permeability layers like sand or limestone in such a case the low permeability layer is able to conduct water when there is significant water head difference between two high permeability aquifers furthermore previous studies have uncovered the effects of leakage on the radial flow field hantush 1967 wen et al 2011a 2011b meng et al 2015 demonstrating that neglecting aquitard effects might lead to remarkable errors in the description of reactive transport in the main aquifer zhan et al 2009a 2009b this is particularly true in the case of a fully penetrating injection well which can quickly deliver solute to the aquifer aquitard interface where a portion of the solute may spread over the aquitard to a certain extent due to leakage flow a number of previous studies of aquitard effects on aquifer solute transport exist such as chen 1985 wang and zhan 2013 and zhan et al 2009a 2009b however these only focused on the injection phase of the swpp test furthermore these studies assumed the flow in the aquifer aquitard system to be steady state with wang and zhan 2013 and zhan et al 2009a 2009b even assuming a uniformly distributed velocity in the aquitard for the purpose of analytical derivation as far as we know these assumptions may be rational in a single injection phase but may be invalid for swpp test firstly despite the significant low flow velocity in low permeability medium the flow velocity in aquitard should depend on the radial distance from the well since positions closer to the well have greater variation in hydraulic head resulting in a greater vertical leakage at locations closer to the well besides the flow field in the well vicinity is critical to the btcs observed in wellbore secondly it is hardly possible to maintain steady state flow during swpp test because after transition between two phases in swpp test the flow field is slow to reach steady state due to aquifer storage effect vandenbohede et al 2008 2009 and wang et al 2017 investigated transient swpp test however they did not consider aquitard effect consequently a more accurate description of aquitard flow may be critical to improving the estimation of aquifer parameters using the swpp test previous studies also employed darcy s law to determine transient leakage through aquitard wen et al 2011b feng and zhan 2015 2016 although non darcian behavior of flow in clay were reported decades ago by series of experimental studies lutz and kemper 1959 hansbo 1960 miller and low 1963 blecker 1970 which mentioned a so called threshold pressure gradient defined as the intercept between the linear part of the curve and the i axis as fig 1 shows with a hydraulic gradient smaller than the threshold pressure gradient denoted as i 0 the flux gradient relationship shows non darcian behavior moreover a linear relationship can be satisfied when hydraulic gradient is higher than i 0 therefore extensive studies have proposed non darcian expressions of flow in low permeability medium according to experimental results hansbo 1960 2001 swartzendruber 1961 bear 1979 liu and birkholzer 2012 for example swartzendruber 1961 introduced a modified version of darcy s law as 1 q k i i 0 1 e i i 0 where q is specific discharge l t and k is hydraulic conductivity l t it is notable that eq 1 was verified by extensive experiments under saturated condition swartzendruber 1961 blecker 1970 and has two noteworthy advantages compared with other empirical expressions of low permeability flow firstly the equation of swartzendruber 1961 is practicable in both cases of i i 0 and i i 0 and covers the non linear flux gradient relationship with low hydraulic gradient unlike bear s 1979 expression liu and birkholzer 2012 secondly on the precondition of accuracy the equation of swartzendruber 1961 employed less uncertain parameters than the expressions of other studies such as hansbo 1960 2001 and zou 1996 to our best knowledge very few studies considered non darcian leakage in well hydraulics although meng et al 2015 employed bear s 1979 expression to describe leakage to a pumping well in a semi confined aquifer however they did not consider non linear flow in the case of i i 0 which may be questionable in the case of high i 0 therefore in this study we will develop a new numerical model for a transient four phase swpp test accounting for low permeability non darcian leakage the wellbore storage will be considered during injection chase rest and extraction phases as well our objective is to elucidate the effects of low velocity non darcian flow on swpp test under transient flow conditions 2 problem statement fig 2 represents a four phase swpp test in a leaky confined aquifer both top and bottom of the target aquifer are connected to aquitards both being low permeability interlayers between two neighboring aquifers a cylindrical coordinate is established with the origin located at the intersection between the well center axis and the bottom of the lower aquitard the leaky confined system is homogeneous and laterally infinite a fully penetrating well generates radial flow field in the aquifer while the vertical flow in the aquifer is overlooked meanwhile non uniform leakage exists along the upper and lower aquifer aquitard interfaces both aquitards have the first kind of leakage boundary dirichlet i e the heads of neighboring aquifers are assumed to be constant while the storage capacities of both aquitards are assumed to be neglected considering that the vertical hydraulic gradient is much higher than the radial one in the aquitard the radial flow in the aquitard is therefore overlooked with the solute transport assumed to be dominated by vertical advection dispersion the flow in the aquifer obeys darcy s law while the flow in the aquitard shows low velocity non darcian behavior which can be described by eq 1 2 1 mathematical model of transient groundwater flow based on the aforementioned assumptions the governing equations of transient flow field in the leaky confined aquifer can be written as follows 2 k r 2 s r t r 2 k r r s r t r q u r t m q d r t m s s s r t t 3 s r t 0 0 4 s r t 0 5 2 π r w mq r t r r w π r c 2 s w t t q where s r t indicates the drawdown l at the radial location r and time t k r and

hydraulic conductivity of the upper and lower aquitards l t respectively b u and b d are the thicknesses of the upper and lower aquitard l respectively i 0 is the threshold pressure gradient of aquitard which is assumed to be the same in both aquitards eq 3 indicates the initial condition in the injection phase note that the spatially distributed head at the end of each phase is set to be the initial head in the following phase eqs 4 and 5 represent the boundary conditions at infinity and well face respectively 2 2 mathematical model of solute transport in the leaky confined system the transient flow model provides spatiotemporal head which yields the spatiotemporal average radial pore velocity l t by darcy s law in aquifer as follows 8 v r r t k r θ 1 s r t r where θ 1 indicates the effective porosity of the aquifer similarly the average vertical pore velocities in the upper and lower aquitard are calculated as v u r t q u r t θ 2 and v d r t q d r t θ 2 where θ 2 is the effective porosity of both upper and lower aquitards we assume that the solute transport in the aquifer involves radial advection radial and vertical dispersion meanwhile the solute transport in the aquitard is dominated by vertical advection and dispersion the governing equation of solute transport in the leaky confined aquifer around well is wen and wang 2013 9a c 1 r z t t 1 r r rd 1 r r t c 1

the upper and lower aquitards respectively the initial condition of injection phase is 10 c 1 r z t 0 c u r z t 0 c d r z t 0 0 note that the spatially distributed concentration at the end of each

wellbore concentrations of tracer in the injection and chase phases respectively obviously c cha equals to 0 due to the absence of tracer in the injected water 3 numerical solution because of the non linearity of aquitard flow it seems impractical to obtain analytical solutions to eqs 2 15d therefore this study will employ a finite difference fd scheme to solve the transient swpp test model considering low permeability non darcian leakage the radial discretization is similar to that in meng et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 which employed a logarithmic node system for the purpose of minimizing numerical errors 16 r i r i 1 2 r i 1 2 2 i 1 2 n where r i 1 2 is defined as 17 log 10 r i 1 2 log 10 r w i log 10 r e log 10 r w n i 0 1 n in which n represents the number of nodes r e indicates the influence radius or the infinite boundary at which the solute concentration equals to zero as eq 11 indicates in this study n and r e are set to 2000 and 1 104 m respectively the vertical discretization should refine the node density at the aquifer aquitard interface wang and zhan 2013 therefore the domain 0 b d is logarithmically discretized as 18 z j b d 1 z j j 1 2 15 the domain b d b d m 2 can be discretized as 19 z j b d z j 15 m 2 j 16 17 30 the domain b d m 2 b d m can be discretized as 20 z j b d m 2 m 2 1 z j 30 j 31 32 45 the domain b d m b d m b u can be discretized as 21 z j b d m z j 45 b u j 46 47 60 where 22 log 10 z j 16 j log 10 0 01 log 10 1 10 j 1 2 15 23 log 10 z j j log 10 0 01 log 10 1 10 j 1 2 15 after the above discretization in both radial and vertical directions the governing equations of solute transport in the aquifer and aquitard can be rewritten as 24 d c i j dt r i 1 2 d r i c i 1 j c i j r i r i 1 r i 1 2 d r i 1 c i j c i

d 0 d 2 i α 2 v z i d 0 v r i d r i and d z i are the radial flow velocity v r longitudinal dispersivity d r and transverse dispersivity d z at the nodes with coordinates r r i v z i and d u d i are the vertical flow velocity v z and dispersivity d u d in the aquitard at the nodes with coordinates r r i c i j is the concentration c at node i j note that u d indicates that both aquitards have the same parameter value therefore eq 25 is suitable for both upper and lower aquitards eqs eqn 24 and 25 are composed of a group of n ordinary differential functions of time which are solved by a stiff integrator ode15s in matlab associated with relevant boundary conditions and initial conditions considering that fd solution cannot avoid numerical oscillation unless the spatial and temporal discretization are refined enough a benchmark solution with semi analytical method is often used to test the discretization performance in this study the robustness of the models with respect to both flow field and solute transport are validated fig 3 indicates the comparisons between the fd solution in this study and analytical solution with respect to time varying drawdowns in the extraction phase at r 0 1 1 and 10 m respectively in these comparisons the initial drawdown is assumed to be zero and the non darcian expression in eq 3 is transformed into darcy s law by eliminating the threshold pressure gradient term hence eqs 2 7 yield an analytical solution in the laplace form as 26 s r p q k 0 ra p 2 π r w m k r a k 1 r w a π r c 2 p k 0 r w a where 27 a k u k d k r mb sp k r m in which p indicates the laplace variable k 0 and k 1 are the second kind of modified bessel function with order zero and one respectively the derivation procedure for eq 26 is similar to that in wen and wang 2013 and the numerical inversion of eq 26 can be conducted by stehfest method stehfest 1970a 1970b the parameters used for these comparisons are q 100 m3 day k r 1 m day k u k d 0 01 m day m

well with the analytical solution for the description of transient flow field in this leaky confined system therefore the discretization for transient flow field in our fd method is reliable as for the benchmark solution of solute transport in leaky confined aquifer we employ the analytical solution to the injection phase in wang et al 2013 for comparison in this comparison the flow field in our model is modified to maintain similarity with wang et al 2013 that is to say instead of a transient value dependent on the drawdown in the aquifer the vertical porous velocity v z in the aquitard is set to be a uniformly distributed constant while the radial porous velocity v r in the aquifer is assumed to be steady state which means v r q 2πrmθ 1 the parameters used for solute transport are q

analytical solution of wang et al 2013 with respect to dimensionless concentration profiles in the vertical direction at r 5 m in the injection phase c 0 is the concentration at the well during injection phase and c c 0 indicates the dimensionless concentration of btcs from fig 4 it can be noted that the two solutions agree well with each other at t 105 and 106 s which also implies a reliable elaboration of solute transport in the aquifer aquitard system through the fd method in general these benchmark solutions have verified the validity of our fd scheme with respect to both transient flow field and solute transport in this aquifer aquitard system 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of flow field on solute transport fig 5 shows the breakthrough curves btcs at the well during the extraction phase of the swpp test considering low permeability non darcian leakage we applied the model in aquifers composed of three representative porous media with different hydraulic diffusivities denoted as a and calculated as k r s s which are coarse sand k r 1 10 4 m s s s 1 10 5 m 1 a 10 m2 s medium sand k r 1 10 5 m s s s 1 10 4 m 1 a 0 1 m2 s and fine sand k r 5 10 6 m s s s 1 10 4 m 1 a 0 05 m2 s respectively the values of k r and s s of these media can be found in domenico and schwartz 1990 spitz and moreno 1996 and batu 1998 the other parameters are given as k u k d 0 02 m day m 5 m b u b d 5 m i 0 5 r w r c 0 05 m θ 1 θ 2 0 3 α l 20 m α t 8 m α 2 4 m d 0 1 10 9 m2 s t inj 0 5 day t cha 0 1 day t res 0 1 day t ext 5 day q inj 50 m3 day q cha 50 m3 day q res 0 and q ext 50 m3 day where q inj q cha q res and q ext are the pumping rates of injection chase rest and extraction phases respectively note that the vertical tracer concentration distribution is non uniform as fig 4 demonstrates here we define the concentration at the well as a weighted average along the well screen expressed as 28 c i 1 n c r r w z i dz i m where z i and dz i indicate the midpoint and length of the vertical segment discretized by eqs 18 23 respectively note that i 1 n dz i m and dz i z i 1 2 z i 1 2 where z i 1 2 and z i 1 2 are the locations of both ends of the ith vertical segment generally a greater grain size results in a larger a which indicates that pore water is released and carried to pumping well faster making the flow regime approach steady state earlier fig 6 represents the temporal change rate of head in wellbore in which positive or negative peaks happen at the beginning of each phases except chase phase because flow rate has no changes only during the transition between injection and chase phase as fig 6 indicates the change rate of the head in wellbore in the case of coarse sand has the smallest peak value and the earliest drop to zero therefore one can assume the flow regime in swpp test in coarse sand to be quasi steady state as fig 5 indicates the quasi steady state btc of coarse sand is obviously higher than the other two types of btcs this implies that a flow tending to steady state has a stronger ability to extract the solute out from the aquifer therefore one can conclude that the steady state solution may not always interpret the transient swpp test perfectly especially in this case with leaky confined system composed of fine grain conversely the transient degree of flow in the medium composed of coarse grain probably has limited effects on swpp test and a greater grain size leads to less estimation error if using steady state model to interpret the transient swpp test 4 2 effects of low permeability non darcian flow on solute transport extensive experimental studies report a wide range of i 0 value lutz and kemper 1959 miller and low 1963 blecker 1970 dubin and moulin 1986 zou 1996 wang et al 2011 for example blecker 1970 measured i 0 of clay loam from brolliar and springervilla soil series and obtained a range of 0 04 0 267 zou 1996 found that clay has higher i 0 than silty clay and silt with the range of i 0 measured to be 1 10 wang et al 2011 measured the cores of daqing oilfield in china by flowing water with a certain salinity and obtained a i 0 range of 10 30 miller and low 1963 measured i 0 of clay samples from wyoming bentonite to be higher than 100 obviously porous media in nature have wide range of i 0 for the purpose of our discussion we selected median values of i 0 i e from 0 1 to 10 fig 7 presents the btcs at the well during the extraction phase in different cases the legend no aquitard indicates no leakage while darcy indicates that the leakage is described by darcy s law i 0 0 5 and i 0 5 indicate that the leakage is low permeability non darcian with threshold pressure gradient equal to 0 5 and 5 respectively k r 0 5 m day and s s 1 10 4 m 1 are employed for fig 7 and the other parameters are the same to those in section 4 1 for fig 5 the comparison between the cases with and without leakage reveals some of the injected solute goes through the aquifer aquitard interface and is stored in the aquitard before the extraction phase begins which makes the residual solute in the aquifer less than that in the case without leakage therefore the extracted concentration in the leaky case is smaller than that of the confined case additionally an increasing i 0 makes the btcs approach the one without leakage effects while a decreasing i 0 makes the btcs approach the one with darcian leakage for i 0 values smaller than 0 5 the difference between darcian and non darcian solutions is small making darcy s law practicable to describe the leakage effects in terms of swpp test interpretation on the other hand when i 0 exceeds a certain value in this case higher than 5 the leaky confined aquifer can be regarded as a totally confined aquifer with respect to swpp test this is because a high i 0 results in a considerable amount of low velocity flow as eqs 6 and 7 indicate and this kind of low permeability leakage has weak transport capacity to make solute move through the aquifer aquitard interface fig 8 highlights the dimensionless mass of solute stored in aquitards denoted as m u d m tot during the four phases in the cases of darcian and non darcian leakage m tot represents the total solute mass injected into the leaky confined system and m u d refers to the sum of mass in both aquitards which can be calculated as 29 m u d rw 0 b d 2 πr c d dzdr rw b d m b d m b u 2 πr c u dzdr as fig 8 indicates the value of m u d m tot with darcian leakage is the highest in the three cases which indicates that darcian leakage has the strongest ability to spread solute into aquitards before the extraction phase in the extraction phase m u d m tot in all the three cases increases at first and then decreases on one hand this is because in the early extraction phase the flow direction at most of the aquifer aquitard interface is still from aquifer to aquitard which can be roughly indicated by the groundwater table in fig 2 b and qualitatively represented by fig 9 where the positive velocity also indicates a flow direction from aquifer to aquitard while the negative velocity refers to the opposite direction also t 0 12 s and 80 min represent the three different time points from the onset of the extraction phase in the early stage though a drawdown forms at the vicinity of the well screen in which the flow direction is still from aquifer to aquitard at most of the aquifer aquitard interface indicated by the curve in the case with darcian leakage at t 12 s fig 9 on the other hand even after a period of extraction the flow direction is towards the well from almost everywhere in the main aquifer with the flow direction from aquitard to aquifer almost everywhere at the aquifer aquitard interface as indicated by the curve in the case with darcian leakage at t 80 min furthermore the solute concentration in the main aquifer is still generally much higher than in the aquitards making a portion of the solute penetrate into the aquitards from the main aquifer by dispersion especially at the interface where the vertical flow is weak when the concentration difference between aquifer and aquitard disappears the solute can no longer transport into the aquitard by dispersion this further elucidates why m u d m tot first increases and then decreases in addition it can be found from fig 8 that the diminished magnitude of m u d m tot in the case with darcian leakage is greater than that in the case with low permeability non darcian leakage and that the diminished magnitude reduces with respect to a higher threshold gradient as the low permeability non darcian leakage effects become stronger the transporting capacity of advection becomes weaker while the dispersion induced solute transport gains greater dominance in the mass transfer between aquifer and aquitards in other words with increasing low permeability non darcian leakage it is more difficult for pumping flow to pull the solute out from the aquitards as highlighted in fig 7 fig 10 shows the extraction phase btcs for cases of no aquitard darcian and non darcian leakage i 0 5 with respect to different aquifer thickness m which are 1 2 and 3 times the aquitard thickness b u d where b u d refers to b u or b d both are assumed to be equal the other parameters are the same with those in fig 7 section 4 2 the comparison among figs a b and c indicates that when aquifer thickness is close to or even less than aquitard thickness then leakage effect should not be overlooked when conducting swpp test meanwhile the low permeability non darcian flow shows remarkable effects on the interpretation of btcs furthermore leakage effects reduce as m b u d increases as long as the aquifer is three or more times thicker than the aquitard therefore the solution for swpp in confined aquifer can replace that in the leaky system with low permeability non darcian leakage which has less impact compared with the case of small m b u d hence low permeability non darcian flow should be considered in a sandwich strata composed of two thick aquitards and a thin interlayered aquifer 4 3 sensitivity analysis since the leakage through low permeability layer has effects on the swpp test it is necessary to compare the degree of influence of aquitard parameters on the solute concentration at the well during the extraction phase consequently sensitivity analyses were conducted for the parameters including i 0 k u d α u d and b u d to highlight the effects of each on the characteristics of the extraction phase btcs the normalized sensitivity analysis method kabala 2001 huang and yeh 2007 which has been widely used in the study of aquifer parameter estimation is adopted for the sensitivity analysis in this study here the subscript u d indicates that the upper and lower aquitards have the same value with respect to this parameter for example α u d indicates the vertical dispersivities of the two aquitards are equal in fig 11 the normalized sensitivity during the extraction phase indicates the variation degree of c c 0 generated by a tiny increment or decrement of the parameter value in the legend 1 and 1 represent 1 increment and 1 decrement respectively it is notable that the normalized sensitivities of all the parameters decrease with time this phenomenon is associated with the decrease in residual mass of solute in the system over time due to extraction this is found to also be in agreement with the results in figs 7 and 10 where the variations of i 0 and b u d tend to make greater difference in the early stage and smaller difference in the tailings of btcs what is important to note is that the normalized sensitivities of i 0 k u d and b u d decrease more sharply than that of α u d note that the effects of i 0 k u d and b u d on solute transport come mainly from their effects on flow field while α u d cannot influence the flow velocity in the aquitards considering that the behavior of btcs at the well depends highly on the solute mass stored in the aquitards it is reasonable to infer that dispersion dominance makes solute transport difficult by advection from aquitard to aquifer in this transient flow field this is also in agreement with the results presented in fig 8 where the solute mass stored in the aquitards have a remarkable increase before decrease during the extraction phase 4 4 application in parameter estimation the results presented and discussed in the above sections show that the solution of swpp test considering low permeability non darcian leakage yields significantly different btcs from the solutions that do not consider any leakage as well as those that only consider darcian leakage this is particularly evident when the aquifer thickness is not much thicker than the aquitard as eq 1 and sensitivity analyses indicate the influence factors include more than threshold pressure gradient and aquifer thickness therefore the low permeability non darcian leakage effects on swpp test should be theoretically expressed by a lumped dimensionless parameter which is an algebraic expression composed of the most relevant parameters following a series of numerical experiments and analysis with eq 1 we define a lumped dimensionless parameter called the non darcian index ndi expressed as 30 ndi 1 exp a a where 31 a q k r m b u d i 0 32 δ α 2 m the derivation of ndi can be found in detail in appendix a in terms of practical use two meaningful questions are a how the effects on swpp test can be comprehensively quantified by the dimensionless parameter ndi b how the ndi parameter indicates whether the low permeability non darcian leakage should be considered or neglected fig 12 generally shows that the btcs with low permeability non darcian leakage should theoretically be found between the btcs of no leakage nl model and darcian leakage dl model as fig 1 indicates an extremely high i 0 makes the specific discharge approach zero and a smaller i 0 makes the non darcian effects imperceptible the btcs of two simpler models i e nl and dl models are used to fit the actual btcs that are generated by the model which considers low permeability non darcian leakage note that in the case of moderate non darcian leakage in fig 12 it is difficult to fit the tailing stage of btcs during the adjustment of estimated parameters this is attributed to the fact that the peak values of btcs in the early extraction stage are highly relevant to the residual solute mass stored in the main aquifer before pumping similarly the btcs can be easily fitted by adjusting the estimated parameters such as longitudinal dispersivity and porosity of the main aquifer nevertheless the tailing stage of btc reflects a long term dispersion induced mass transfer between aquifer and aquitard which is similar to the long term mass diffusion between matrix and natural fractures in the non fickian behavior of chen et al 2017 as long as the peak value of btcs in the early stage is fitted the differences of the mass transfer between aquifer and aquitard make the fitting infeasible due to non darcian effect therefore the fitting is conducted by trial and error method only for the btcs in the early stage especially for the peak value since the early btc can reflect the effects of non darcian leakage on swpp tests during injection chase rest and early pumping phase it is reasonable to quantify the effects of low permeability non darcian leakage effects by the fitting process of btcs in the early extraction stage fig 13 highlights the performance of simpler models in the interpretation of swpp test with low permeability non darcian leakage fig 13 a represents the overestimation errors of α l and θ 1 versus ndi using nl model to fit the actual values generated by the model considering low permeability non darcian leakage while fig 13 b indicates the underestimation errors of α l and θ 1 versus ndi using dl model to fit the same ones generally it can be concluded that nl model results in greater estimation errors than dl model this is due to the inability of nl model to deliver any solute from the main aquifer to neighboring layers making the estimation errors greater than those in dl model meanwhile the dl model still accounts for the mass transfer between aquifer and aquitard despite the weak characterization of aquitard flow in addition fig 13 demonstrates how the ndi quantifies low permeability non darcian effects on swpp test as ndi increases the overestimation error of nl model decreases and the underestimation error of dl model increases apparently higher ndi indicates stronger deviation from darcian flow leading to more distinguishable low permeability non darcian leakage effects from fig 1 it can be inferred that a very strong low permeability non darcian flow may be equivalent to a quasi stagnant flow which allows the nl model with no consideration for leakage to interpret the swpp reliably conversely lower ndi corresponds to a weaker non darcian effect indicating that the dl model can be also be utilized for swpp test interpretation moreover fig 13 presents the conditions under which low permeability non darcian effect has to be considered as illustrated in fig 13 a should the overestimation degree fall below an allowable level such as 15 then the ndi should be greater than 0 95 this can be achieved by adjusting a single parameter to a specific value such as q smaller than 7 m3 day k r greater than 4 m day i 0 greater than 40 m or b u d greater than 40 m with the other parameters given the same values as in 4 2 on the other hand fig 13 b demonstrates that if the underestimation degree falls below 15 then the ndi should be less than 0 6 which corresponds to q greater than 70 m3 day k r smaller than 0 35 m day i 0 smaller than 3 5 m or b u d smaller than 3 5 m with the other parameters given the same values as in section 4 2 in order to gain more insights on how to properly utilize a model for swpp test interpretation we use the investigation of long term slope of btcs by chen et al 2017 as a reference chen et al 2017 developed a fractional model accounting for non fickian solute transport in a four stage swpp test and demonstrated that the slope of late time btcs is highly dependent on the mass diffusion between matrix and natural fracture despite the differences between a model that considers leakage effects and that considering dual domain medium the mass transfer at the aquifer aquitard interfaces may still make their respective leakage induced btcs behave in a similar manner especially in the tailing stage generally a double logarithmic coordinate system is employed to investigate the long term btc slope though any effect on peak value seems to be compressed due to logarithmic treatment the long term behavior of btc are better represented by a log log coordinate system than a normal linear coordinate system that is to say for a four stage swpp test which yields a peak value in the extraction phase btc a log log coordinate system may not be suggested for parameter estimation but a log log coordinate system with an extended extraction duration enables the btc to elucidates whether low permeability non darcian leakage should be considered as fig 14 indicates the btcs of nl dl and non darcian models show slight differences in a log log coordinate system until to the tailing stage in which the low permeability non darcian btc is between the nl and dl models in addition greater i 0 results in a smaller value of long term btc which approaches that of nl model due to stronger low permeability non darcian effect this further leads to a weaker mass transfer from aquitard to aquifer during the extraction phase resulting in a greater descending slope of the long term btc besides this fig 14 also depicts the long term slope lines for both nl and dl models providing some guidance on choice of model for real world application typically one can first plot the btcs of nl and dl models in a log log coordinate system if the two long term btc slopes are approximately equal which happens as the case in fig 10 c then the mass transferred between aquifer and aquitard is negligible compared to that in the main aquifer in this case either nl or dl model can be used for the swpp test interpretation and it is not essential to employ the ndi parameter to account for the low permeability non darcian leakage on the contrary if the long term btc slopes of nl and dl models indicate distinct differences while the long term btc slope of the field test data is found between the nl and dl models then it can be inferred that the low permeability non darcian leakage exists and should be estimated in this case the ndi parameter can be employed to discern which model would best interpret the swpp test 5 summary and conclusions swpp test has been an effective strategy to determine the in situ parameters relevant to reactive transport of contaminants therefore an accurate model which describes the tracer transport in swpp test is essential generally conventional models for swpp test assume the aquifer to be isolated by the neighboring ones and previous studies of the solute transport in aquifer aquitard system assume a uniformly distributed velocity in the aquitard for the purpose of analytical derivation these assumptions are limited in practical application of swpp test with leakage effects besides most previous studies of swpp test focus on steady state flow which is actually impractical when injection phase transits to extraction phase therefore this study develops a finite difference solution to transient swpp test considering leakage effects which is described by a low permeability non darcian expression defined by a threshold pressure gradient the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for transient swpp test with low permeability non darcian leakage an increasing hydraulic diffusivity leads to a greater peak value of btcs while a medium with larger grain size results in less estimation error when using steady state flow model for the interpretation of transient swpp test 2 a greater i 0 not only results in less solute stored in aquitard before extraction but also makes it more difficult to extract the solute out from aquitard due to dispersion dominance making the value of btc higher 3 the newly proposed lumped dimensionless parameter ndi quantifies the estimation errors in swpp test considering low permeability non darcian leakage by using simpler models that consider darcian leakage dl or no leakage nl the overestimation degree by nl model decreases while the underestimation degree by dl model increases with an increasing ndi 4 the long term btc slope coupled with the ndi can be employed to determine the case in which low permeability non darcian leakage should be considered declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they do

1501,riverbank filtration is a commonly used technology that improves water quality by passing river water through aquifers in this study a riverbank filtration site in busan south korea was investigated to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of high iron and sulfate concentrations observed in the riverbank filtered water discrepancies between the nonreactive transport results and field measurements suggest that iron sulfate related geochemical reactions play a major role in the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrochemical properties pyrite oxidation was hypothesized to be the main process driving the release of iron and sulfate to test this hypothesis a reactive transport model was developed that implemented pyrite oxidation as a kinetic process and subsequent ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation as equilibrium processes the model accurately captured the temporal evolution of sulfate however iron concentrations were underestimated sensitivity tests revealed that adjusting reaction constants significantly improved the prediction of iron concentrations the results of this study suggest that pyrite oxidation can affect the hydrochemistry of

transfer and recovery riverbank filtration infiltration ponds and soil aquifer treatment in particular riverbank filtration rbf has been used for drinking water supply along the rhine river in germany since the 1870s and in the united states for around 50 years eckert and irmscher 2006 ray et al 2002 tufenkji et al 2002 more recently rbf has also been actively implemented in asia including china india and south korea hyun et al 2013 ray 2008 yi et al 2015 rbf produces filtered surface water through wells constructed in alluvial aquifers near rivers eckert and irmscher 2006 ray et al 2002 tufenkji et al 2002 the filtration of river water in conjunction with hydro biogeochemical processes during rbf is known to aid the removal of natural organic matter pathogenic microbes and various pollutants from the river water tufenkji et al 2002 however water rock interactions can also result in water quality deterioration e g elevating arsenic iron and manganese concentrations grischek and paufler 2017 hyun et al 2013 sharma et al 2012 stuyfzand 2011 yi et al 2015 recent studies reported increases in arsenic concentration at riverbank filtration sites datta et al 2009 groeschke et al 2017 south korea has predominantly relied on surface water resources however interest in rbf as an efficient water pre treatment step has increased due to recent surface water contamination episodes hyun et al 2013 ji and lee 2017 kim et al 2009 yi et al 2015 recently a pilot scale rbf was installed in an unconfined aquifer near the nakdong river estuary in busan south korea and tested for approximately five months to monitor water quality changes during rbf the hydrochemical properties of river water native ambient groundwater and rbf water were periodically measured the results revealed high concentrations of iron and sulfate in the rbf water high concentrations of iron and sulfate in water supply are a concern and can be correlated with trace metal release e g as and mo wallis et al 2011 wallis and pichler 2018 therefore a clear understanding of iron and sulfate release mechanisms is critical for water quality prediction and the sustainable operation of an rbf system previous studies have investigated iron release mechanisms during rbf farnsworth and hering 2011 grischek and paufler 2017 stuyfzand et al 2006 increased iron concentrations in rbf water can often be attributed to the development of reducing conditions near the riverbank farnsworth and hering 2011 massmann et al 2008 tufenkji et al 2002 microorganisms in the riverbed decompose dissolved organic carbon doc contained in the river water consume oxidants during biological doc degradation and thus establish a reducing environment beneath the riverbed near the bank as a consequence iron concentrations can increase due to the reductive dissolution of iron oxides commonly found in aquifer sediments farnsworth and hering 2011 however the reductive dissolution of iron oxides cannot explain the simultaneous increase of iron and sulfate during rbf operations one of the possible mechanisms for the co evolution of iron and sulfate is pyrite oxidation a few studies have proposed pyrite oxidation as the source of iron and sulfate co evolution in confined aquifers during the operation of aquifer storage and recovery asr systems prommer and stuyfzand 2005 wallis et al 2010 2011 using reactive transport modeling wallis et al 2010 2011 showed that pyrite oxidation was a dominant mechanism driving iron and sulfate releases in an asr system furthermore stuyfzand et al 2006 employed batch type mass balance modeling to investigate pyrite oxidation along with other redox reactions to explain water quality changes at an rbf site in the netherlands however to the best of our knowledge pyrite oxidation has never been investigated in an rbf system using reactive transport modeling in this study we investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of iron and sulfate concentrations at an rbf field site by combining field observations and reactive transport modeling we developed a 2d reactive transport model using pht3d which couples solute transport and complex hydrogeochemical reactions in a spatially distributed domain appelo and rolle 2010 ng et al 2017 prommer et al 2019 prommer and post 2010 prommer and stuyfzand 2005 steefel et al 2005 with the modeling framework we investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of iron and sulfate during rbf by simulating pyrite oxidation and subsequent oxidation and precipitation of iron ions and compared the simulation results with field data we then discuss the potential limitations of using theoretical reaction constants in field scale reactive transport modeling this study provides fundamental insights into the hydro biogeochemical reactions occurring during rbf and field scale reactive transport modeling 2 study site and field data the pilot scale rbf system used in this study is located in an open plain of the nakdong river delta busan south korea fig 1 the nakdong river is approximately 510 km long and passes through busan the second largest city in south korea three distinctive layers are identified near the surface a topsoil layer of 0 8 m thickness a layer of sand of 11 8 m thickness and a layer of silt and clay of 10 6 m thickness fig s1 the lower layer silt and clay is an effective confining unit between the unconfined aquifer sand layer and a deeper confined aquifer the confined aquifer is saline and hydraulic disconnected from the unconfined aquifer by the confining unit due to the topography being flat over a large area around the site the initial hydraulic gradient was negligible compared to the hydraulic gradient caused by pumping the initial saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer was estimated to be 11 47 m see fig s1 and section 3 1 for details three extraction wells were installed in the unconfined aquifer near the river fig 1 b and c and were operated for 135 days from late spring to fall may 26 2016 to oct 7 2016 producing approximately 500 m3 of rbf water per day from the unconfined aquifer the pumping rates of the three extraction wells were approximately 237 5 m3 day at wells 1 and 3 and 25 m3 day at well 2 note that the pumping rates had some fluctuations during the operation wells 1 2 and 3 are located 18 7 17 and 15 2 m respectively from the nakdong river and the distances between the wells are 14 8 wells 1 2 and 15 1 m wells 2 3 the depths of wells are approximately 9 m from the ground surface and the pumps were installed 4 m below the surface as shown in fig s1 temperature and precipitation in busan in 2016 are as follows seasonal temperature variations were approximately 4 3 30 5 c during spring 15 7 37 3 c during summer 0 1 29 7 c during fall and 7 7 17 7 c during winter fig s2 a annual monthly average precipitation was 146 7 mm with a maximum of 407 9 mm in september and a minimum of 56 6 mm in november fig s2 b the total precipitation in 2016 was 1760 2 mm the hydrochemical properties were analyzed from the samples of the nakdong river water and the native groundwater we sampled the river water near the extraction wells and the groundwater at the southernmost extraction well see fig 1 c respectively at the beginning of the operation during the operation the rbf water and river water were periodically collected in 50 ml polypropylene tubes the physicochemical properties of the water samples including oxidation reduction potential orp ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured on site using a portable multi meter ysi 556 ysi to estimate ionic composition samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter following collection and were stored at 4 c samples for cation analysis were acidified with hno3 following filtration major anions in the rbf water and river water including cl no3 and so4 2 were analyzed using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1000 equipped with an ionpac ag9 hc column bicarbonate hco3 concentrations were determined using the alkalinity titration method hem 1985 and the concentrations of na ca2 k mg2 fe total and mn total ions were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes agilent 730 doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu the trends of the nine major hydrochemical properties cl na fe t so4 2 o2 no3 ph orp and doc during test operations are shown in fig 2 note that fe t is the sum of fe2 and fe3 concentrations the mixing between the river water and groundwater is evident from the evolution of cl and na concentrations fig 2 a and b cl and na concentrations are higher in the native groundwater than in the river water cl and na concentrations decrease in time at the extraction well reflecting an increase in the proportion of river water reaching the well interestingly fe t and so4 2 concentrations show different trends compared to cl and na fig 2 c shows that the concentration of fe t in the rbf water decreased due to mixing between the native groundwater and river water during early operations t 0 50 days t 0 is may 26th 2016 and then slightly increased t 50 135 days furthermore fig 2 d shows that the so4 2 concentration in the rbf water was significantly higher than the concentrations of sulfate both in the river water and in the native groundwater therefore we infer that iron sulfate related geochemical reactions occurred during the rbf note that the doc concentration at the extraction well fig 2 i increased markedly after 50 days the possible relationship between fe t and doc is discussed in section 5 the trends of o2 and no3 concentrations also indicate the occurrence of geochemical reactions during the rbf as shown in fig 2 e and f the o2 concentration is significantly higher in the river water than in the native groundwater and the no3 concentration in the river water is also generally higher than the native groundwater except for a few days following commencement of pumping the o2 and no3 concentrations in the river water blue lines fluctuate moderately between 2 10 4 and 4 10 4 mol l and between 1 10 4 and 2 10 4 mol l respectively in contrast both o2 and no3 concentrations in the riverbank filtered water are generally close to zero indicating that o2 and no3 have been consumed by biogeochemical reactions during the rbf the early spike in the no3 concentration at the extraction well could be due to aquifer disturbances caused by the initiation of pumping walton 1990 fig 2 g and h show that the ph and orp values in river water and rbf water follow similar temporal patterns the ranges of orp valued are similar to other riverbank filtration sites in south korea yi et al 2015 and india boving et al 2014 the good correlation between the orp values of river and extracted rbf water suggests that there is good hydraulic connectivity between the river and the rbf well also the amount of redox reactions that occurred during the rbf process will determine the difference in orp values of river water and rbf water and the result implies that the amount of redox reactions did not change significantly over time note that the good correlation can be evident only when the measured values are larger in river compared to native groundwater because the flow direction is from the river to the rbf wells otherwise a dilution effect will be evident in rbf water as shown by cl and na fig 2 a and b note that the orp value at the extraction well becomes oxidizing orp 0 towards the end from initially reducing condition orp 0 red line in fig 2 h however the o2 concentration at the extraction well is close to zero red line in fig 2 e the low values of orp and o2 in the rbf water compared to that in the river water and the positive orp at the extraction well at the end indicate that redox reactions have occurred 3 reactive transport model a reactive transport model was developed using pht3d prommer and post 2010 which couples the mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 transport code with the phreeqc 2 reaction code parkhurst and appelo 1999 the flow model is based on the modflow 2005 code harbaugh 2005 the conceptual model and numerical solution are described in the following sections 3 1 flow model the conceptual model of the rbf site is shown in fig 3 groundwater flow is assumed horizontal and both the river and the rbf wells are considered fully penetrating the model is thus two dimensional 2d i e one layer the mixing of deep groundwater is not important for the modeling of the rbf site because the confining layer hydraulically separates deep groundwater from the shallow unconfined aquifer we assumed that the initial water table is flat by considering the flat topography of the study area and the negligible initial hydraulic gradient the initial saturated thickness of the aquifer is set to 11 47 m considering the initial water table level and geologic information fig s1 the boundary conditions and discretization of the 2d domain are shown in fig 4 the model domain is a square of size 2500 m 2500 m which ensures that the boundaries are sufficiently far from the extraction wells to avoid any significant boundary effects one side of the model domain coincides with the river and the other three sides are considered as no flow boundaries the river is represented by a constant head boundary condition and the extraction wells are implemented with the well package in modflow harbaugh 2005 the total simulation time is 135 days and daily time steps are used in the numerical solution the total numbers of cells in x and y directions are 49 and 78 respectively the discretization was finer in the area between river and abstraction wells where reactive processes were expected to occur and progressively coarser towards the three no flow boundaries to minimize computation time hydraulic properties are assumed homogeneous this simplifying assumption is deemed reasonable considering the local geology we calibrated the hydraulic conductivity k in the flow model using the field measured hydraulic head values we systematically varied k values and calculated root mean square error rmse between the field measured and simulated hydraulic heads at the pumping wells the k value of 6 5 m day gave the smallest rmse value the effective porosity ϕ e is estimated to be approximately 0 3 based on the laboratory analysis of sand cores from the field sites we set the value of specific yield sy to be 0 3 assuming the specific yield of the unconfined aquifer is close to the effective porosity bear 1979 gehman et al 2009 modflow is used for solving the transient unconfined groundwater flow equations with the layer property flow package lpf and the preconditioned conjugate gradient package 2 pcg2 solver harbaugh 2005 in the pcg2 solver the convergence criteria on the head change and flow residual are set to 1 10 4 m and 1 10 4 m3 day respectively 3 2 transport model initial solute concentrations in the native groundwater are assumed constant throughout the domain and solute concentrations in the river water are assumed constant in space and time table 1 the effective porosity is set to 0 3 i e equal to the specific yield and the longitudinal dispersivity αl to 1 m we use a αl of 1 m based on the well known approximate relationship between longitudinal dispersivity and the mean travel distance transport scale of αl 0 1 l where l is the transport scale fetter et al 2017 kang et al 2019 lallemand barres and peaudecerf 1978 the transport scale is taken as the distance between the riverside and well 3 the sampling location and is in the order of 10 m as shown in fig 3 the transverse dispersivity is taken equal to one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity gelhar et al 1992 fetter et al 2017 we validate the flow and transport parameters in section 4 in mt3dms or equivalently in pht3d the transient transport equation is solved using an implicit finite difference formulation with upstream weighting and the generalized conjugate gradient gcg solver with the jacobi preconditioner zheng and wang 1999 the relative convergence criterion for concentrations in the gcg solver cclose is set to 10 7 for nonreactive transport simulations and 10 10 for reactive transport simulations to obtain stable solutions the reactive transport simulations required more strict convergence criteria compared to nonreactive transport simulations within each flow time step the transport time step is automatically calculated based on the courant number 0 75 3 3 initial concentrations and geochemical reactions initial hydrochemical properties were obtained by phreeqc 2 batch simulations the phreeqc 2 calculations were conducted for charge balancing and calculating pe values based on the measured concentrations the results are shown in table 1 and were used as the initial river and groundwater properties in the model note that the pyrite concentration in table 1 is based on the assumption that reactions involving pyrite are not limited by the amount of pyrite pyrite oxidation was included in the reactive transport model to investigate whether this process can explain the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrochemistry at the rbf site as discussed in section 2 field data show that iron sulfate related geochemical reactions occurred during the rbf operation furthermore x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis showed the possibility of pyrite oxidation see the details in section 5 and fig s3 in the supplementary material the main reaction chain of pyrite oxidation can be expressed as follows eckert and appelo 2002 williamson and rimstidt 1994 appelo and postma 2005 prommer and

pyrite during the reaction pyrite oxidation by oxygen and nitrate eqs 1 and 2 is treated as a kinetic process and the reaction rate is determined by eq 3 prommer and stuyfzand 2005 wallis et al 2010 williamson and rimstidt 1994 ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation eqs 1b and 1c are treated as equilibrium processes because both reactions are known to be relatively fast in ph conditions of our system appelo and postma 2005 singer and stumm 1970 note that the field measured ph during riverbank filtration fluctuated between seven and nine as shown in fig 2 g the equilibrium reaction constants of the iron oxidation log keq ox and iron precipitation log keq precip are 13 02 and 4 891 respectively and are obtained from the phreeqc 2 database parkhurst and appelo 1999 the model set up is simple but general enough to represent many rbf sites 4 results 4 1 conservative transport modeling we first validate the flow and transport parameters discussed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 by comparing the model prediction of a conservative tracer cl with respect to field measurements as shown in fig 5 a the model successfully captures the general trends of the cl field data this confirms that the flow and transport models are successfully parameterized based on the particle tracking simulation the river water reaches the pumping wells approximately five days after the start of pumping also the proportion of the river water in the pumped water increases up to 80 after 60 days from the beginning of the pumping nonreactive transport simulations of the other chemical elements are also performed to study the mixing effect between river water and native groundwater thereby allowing us to evaluate the need of incorporating geochemical reactions the black dashed lines in fig 5 show the results of the nonreactive transport simulations simulated concentrations of fe t are significantly lower than the field data fig 5 b blue circles simulated nonreactive concentrations of so4 2 are also significantly lower compared to field measurements fig 5 c furthermore simulated nonreactive o2 no3 and ph concentrations do not adequately capture the temporal evolution of the field data fig 5 d f these results show that the mixing effect between the river water and native groundwater alone cannot explain the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrochemical properties the discrepancies between the nonreactive transport results and field measurements suggest that iron sulfate related geochemical reactions play a major role in the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrochemical properties 4 2 reactive transport modeling the red solid lines in fig 5 b f shows the reactive transport simulation results i e including pyrite oxidation the reactive transport simulation well captured the trends of the temporal evolution of so4 2 and other field measurements except for the trend of fe t field data the increase in so4 2 concentration due to pyrite oxidation is evident compare black and red lines in fig 5 c and is also reflected in the spatial distribution of so4 2 compare fig 6 a and b in the reactive transport model o2 and no3 act as oxidants and are consumed during pyrite oxidation therefore o2 and no3 concentrations become close to zero fig 5 d and e declining ph values fig 5 f are thereby a result of the pyrite oxidation process eqs 1a and 2 these results indicate that the model incorporating pyrite oxidation explains the water quality evolution at well 3 better than the nonreactive model except for fe t concentrations fe t concentrations are underestimated by the reactive transport model and show a similar trend to the nonreactive transport simulation the spatiotemporal evolution of fe t simulated by the reactive transport model fig 6 b also shows similar patterns with those of the nonreactive transport simulation fig 6 a similar to cl fe t concentration is lower in the river water than in the native groundwater and the spatial distribution of fe t in the nonreactive transport simulation is almost identical to that of cl fig 6 a these inconsistencies in fe t between the reactive transport simulation and field data may be attributed to uncertainties in the equilibrium constants used in ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation eqs 1b and 1c or to the fact that the processes should be treated as kinetic processes rather than equilibrium reactions also recent studies have shown that various mechanisms can lead to uncertainties in reactive transport modeling dentz et al 2011 ding et al 2017 kang et al 2019 li et al 2008 liu et al 2017 pereira nunes et al 2016 stumm and lee 1961 theis and singer 1974 wright et al 2017 for example various upscaled models that better resolve the subgrid heterogeneity have been proposed and showed some promising results dentz et al 2011 ding et al 2017 le borgne et al 2015 sund et al 2017 we hypothesize that there is a discrepancy between the ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation processes described in the reactive transport model and field conditions to test this hypothesis we simulated reactive transport without the ferric iron precipitation process eq 1c to examine the effects of iron precipitation note that iron precipitation can be controlled by both ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation and we prevented iron precipitation by removing the ferric iron precipitation process the reactive transport simulation results excluding the iron precipitation process are shown by green lines in fig 5 b f it is apparent that concentrations of fe t simulated by the reactive transport simulation model excluding iron precipitation better represent overall trends however the simulated concentrations are now somewhat higher than the field data spatial maps also show that the fe t concentration between the pumping wells and the river are significantly higher for the reactive case without iron precipitation fig 6 c as compared to the reactive case with iron precipitation fig 6 b or the nonreactive transport case fig 6 a simulated concentrations of so4 2 o2 no3 and ph green lines in fig 5 c f do not differ markedly from those of the reactive transport simulation with the iron precipitation process red lines in fig 5 c f overall the simulation results indicate that the pyrite oxidation process can explain the trends of field data however the ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation processes require further investigation to understand the impact of uncertainties in equilibrium constants on the modeling results we conducted a sensitivity analysis of the equilibrium constants of the ferrous iron oxidation log keq ox and ferric iron precipitation log keq precip processes to simulate the inhibition of fe2 oxidation we increased the equilibrium constant of ferrous iron oxidation eq 1b based on the sensitivity analysis we show results that encompasses the field data as follows 1 6 x log keq ox 1 7 x log keq ox and 1 8 x log keq ox where 1 x log keq ox is 13 02 which is the original value in the phreeqc 2 database parkhurst and appelo 1999 fig 7 a shows that the ferrous iron oxidation equilibrium favors fe2 over fe3 as the log keq ox value increases as a consequence the fe t concentration increases due to the decrease in ferric iron precipitation and the model captures the fe t concentration more accurately the results show that the best match would be obtained when using an equilibrium constant between 1 6 x log keq ox purple line and 1 8 x log keq ox red line an equally improved model fit was obtained when the equilibrium constant of ferric iron precipitation eq 1c was increased from the original value of 4 891 parkhurst and appelo 1999 see fig 7 b this results in fe3 being favored over fe oh 3 hence the fe t concentration increases and the model provides a more accurate representation of fe t however this appears unrealistic given that the original log k value reflects the precipitation of amorphous ferrihydrite and therefore lies already at the upper end of observed iron oxides solubilities appelo and postma 2005 cornell and schwertmann 2003 langmuir 1969 5 discussion the reactive transport simulations show that pyrite oxidation is a plausible mechanism that can explain the increase in iron and sulfate concentrations during the rbf in busan south korea it is known that pyrite can exist as the framboidal and euhedral crystals in shallow sedimentary aquifers under reducing conditions berner 1984 1970 1969 rickard 1975 rust 1935 sawlowicz 1993 wilkin and barnes 1997 and the native groundwater in our field site was initially under reducing condition for example houben et al 2017 detected individual pyrite crystals by measuring the contents of elemental metals using an electron microprobe the pyrites were embedded in the heavy mineral fraction of an unconsolidated sand aquifer in northwestern germany houben et al 2001 zhang et al 2009 2013 also obtained pyrite contents from measured total sulfur concentrations in the core samples taken from a shallow aquifer in the oostrum area netherlands we obtained other indirect evidence that supports the existence of pyrite in our field site first the xrd analysis of the core samples from our field site shows the existence of the oxidized form of pyrite pyrite is a highly oxidizing mineral appelo and postma 2005 kohfahl et al 2007 so it was challenging to preserve the sample in an intact condition during field sampling and xrd analysis therefore the detection of oxidized forms of pyrite was attempted and we detected iron sulfate hydroxide fe so4 oh in the soil samples taken from the unconfined aquifer 7 5 m below the ground surface using xrd analysis as shown by red peaks in fig s3 iron sulfate hydroxide can be formed from pyrite by bacterial oxidation and weathering processes komnitsas et al 1995 also a mass balance modeling approach that considers various biogeochemical reactions showed that pyrite oxidation can explain the increase of iron and sulfate at our field site ahn et al 2020 finally pyrite oxidation often releases arsenic as a trace metal smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wallis et al 2010 2011 welch et al 2000 we measured arsenic concentrations in the native groundwater river water and riverbank filtered water rbf water sampled from the field site fig s4 the arsenic concentration in the riverbank filtered water increased in time contrary to this the arsenic concentrations in the native groundwater and river water were under the detection level the arsenic data reinforces our hypothesis that pyrite oxidation occurred during riverbank filtration the reactive transport simulation captured the general trends shown in field observations for most elements related to the pyrite oxidation process e g so4 2 o2 no3 ph and pe fig 5 c f except fe t fig 5 b compared to the reactive transport simulation results with equilibrium constants from the phreeqc 2 database parkhurst and appelo 1999 higher concentrations of unprecipitated fe2 and fe3 were observed in the rbf water i e the model with laboratory measured reaction constants underpredicted the high concentration of iron in the riverbank filtered water this indicates that the ferrous iron oxidation and or ferric iron precipitation processes eqs 1b and 1c used in the reactive transport model did not adequately represent field conditions the sensitivity analysis in section 4 2 fig 7 shows that the calibrated equilibrium constants for ferric iron precipitation are unrealistically high values and this implies that a likely cause for elevated dissolved iron concentrations at the field site is the inhibition of fe2 oxidation the existence of organic matter with low concentration of do has been reported as a possible mechanism for disequilibrium between fe2 and fe3 e g by stumm and lee 1961 theis and singer 1974 oxygen is a major oxidant that causes fe2 oxidation thereby low concentration of dissolved oxygen can inhibit fe2 oxidation stumm and lee 1961 in addition theis and singer 1974 discussed that stabilization effects of fe2 ions by organic matters can contribute to considerable fe2 concentration even in aerobic conditions this discussion can be a valid explanation for inhibition of fe2 oxidation in our study case because doc was measured in the sampled rbf water as well as fe t throughout the operations at the busan rbf site stabilization of fe3 by organic matters could also explain the discrepancy it is known that organic matters can stabilize ferric iron by forming suspended colloids with fe3 pullin and cabaniss 2003 ritter et al 2006 the diameter of colloids has been reported as 50 100 nm therefore the stabilized fe3 by organic matters can pass a 0 45 um filter and contribute to elevating fe t concentrations the doc concentration increased significantly after about day 50 red line in fig 2 i and the trend is correlated with the increase pattern of fe t concentration red line in fig 2 c biogeochemical heterogeneities at the field scale may be another source of the discrepancy between simulated and field measured fe t concentrations spatial heterogeneity of mineral distribution is known for a potential source of the discrepancy liu et al 2017 for example the spatial distribution of pyrite tends to be heterogeneous fakhreddine et al 2016 kohfahl et al 2007 wallis et al 2010 2011 leading to localized biogeochemical reactions and impacting iron release and precipitation dynamics consequently ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation processes may be spatially heterogeneous which would impact effective reaction parameters recent studies also have reported incomplete mixing induced by diverse heterogeneities can affect biogeochemical reactions bolster et al 2012 ding and benson 2015 kang et al 2019 le borgne et al 2011 liu et al 2017 pereira nunes et al 2016 wright et al 2017 however theoretical reaction constants are often measured in idealized experimental settings such as batch and mixed flow type experiments under well mixed conditions rimstidt and dove 1986 williamson and rimstidt 1994 this study highlights the potential limitations of using theoretical reaction constants in field modeling applications as discussed the diverse mechanisms can cause uncertainty in reactive transport modeling and we showed that the calibration of the equilibrium constants enabled the model to more accurately represent the field data this result highlights the potential issue of using laboratory measured theoretical reaction constants in field scale reactive transport models the discrepancies between field observed and laboratory measured reaction constants have been widely reported but their origins are controversial ding and benson 2015 kang et al 2019 le borgne et al 2011 liu et al 2017 pereira nunes et al 2016 wright et al 2017 to improve the mechanistic understanding of the pyrite oxidation process and to improve predictability the origin of the inconsistency between field measured and simulated fe t concentrations should be investigated further this study motivates future studies to elucidate the complex mechanisms of iron release and precipitation which will enable improved predictions of water quality changes during rbf 6 conclusion in this study we combined field measurements and reactive transport modeling to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of hydrochemical properties especially iron and sulfate concentrations at an rbf site located in busan south korea by combining field observations and reactive transport modeling that incorporates pyrite oxidation this study for the first time captured the spatiotemporal co evolution of iron and sulfate concentrations at an rbf site the proper understanding of pyrite oxidation in aquifers is vital for various groundwater applications including riverbank filtration pyrite can exist in both unconfined and confined aquifers berner 1969 1970 1984 rickard 1975 rust 1935 sawlowicz 1993 wilkin and barnes 1997 and pyrite oxidation often releases arsenic smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wallis et al 2010 2011 that is toxic to human health to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that investigates pyrite oxidation in an rbf system using reactive transport modeling therefore the findings from this study related to pyrite oxidation have direct implications for many groundwater applications and other rbf sites we first developed a reactive transport model that implemented pyrite oxidation as a kinetic process and subsequent ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation as equilibrium processes the model accurately represented the evolution of sulfate concentrations however the dissolved iron concentration was significantly underestimated the calibration of the equilibrium constants of ferrous iron oxidation alleviated this discrepancy the difference between the calibrated and reference equilibrium constants of the ferrous iron oxidation process is mainly attributed to the inhibition of fe2 oxidation likely caused by the combination of doc and low concentration of do also the physical and biogeochemical heterogeneities at the field scale and the differences between field and laboratory conditions are discussed as other mechanisms for the discrepancy in the laboratory reaction constants are often obtained under well mixed conditions however concentration gradients can occur in the field due to physical and biogeochemical heterogeneities such as permeability heterogeneity and heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of pyrite consequently effective reaction constants can be different from the theoretical values obtained in idealized laboratory settings kang et al 2019 wright et al 2017 note that it may be the case that the reaction terms should be fundamentally different and should be able to consider non local and non fickian effects benson and meerschaert 2008 dentz et al 2011 ding and benson 2015 these findings warrant further research to better understand and predict water quality

1501,riverbank filtration is a commonly used technology that improves water quality by passing river water through aquifers in this study a riverbank filtration site in busan south korea was investigated to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of high iron and sulfate concentrations observed in the riverbank filtered water discrepancies between the nonreactive transport results and field measurements suggest that iron sulfate related geochemical reactions play a major role in the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrochemical properties pyrite oxidation was hypothesized to be the main process driving the release of iron and sulfate to test this hypothesis a reactive transport model was developed that implemented pyrite oxidation as a kinetic process and subsequent ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation as equilibrium processes the model accurately captured the temporal evolution of sulfate however iron concentrations were underestimated sensitivity tests revealed that adjusting reaction constants significantly improved the prediction of iron concentrations the results of this study suggest that pyrite oxidation can affect the hydrochemistry of

al 2016 valhondo et al 2015 mar is a water storage and treatment technology that utilizes aquifers and encompasses various forms of applications including aquifer storage and recovery aquifer storage transfer and recovery riverbank filtration infiltration ponds and soil aquifer treatment in particular riverbank filtration rbf has been used for drinking water supply along the rhine river in germany since the 1870s and in the united states for around 50 years eckert and irmscher 2006 ray et al 2002 tufenkji et al 2002 more recently rbf has also been actively implemented in asia including china india and south korea hyun et al 2013 ray 2008 yi et al 2015 rbf produces filtered surface water through wells constructed in alluvial aquifers near rivers eckert and irmscher 2006 ray et al 2002 tufenkji et al 2002 the filtration of river water in conjunction with hydro biogeochemical processes during rbf is known to aid the removal of natural organic matter pathogenic microbes and various pollutants from the river water tufenkji et al 2002 however water rock interactions can also result in water quality deterioration e g elevating arsenic iron and manganese concentrations grischek and paufler 2017 hyun et al 2013 sharma et al 2012 stuyfzand 2011 yi et al 2015 recent studies reported increases in arsenic concentration at riverbank filtration sites datta et al 2009 groeschke et al 2017 south korea has predominantly relied on surface water resources however interest in rbf as an efficient water pre treatment step has increased due to recent surface water contamination episodes hyun et al 2013 ji and lee 2017 kim et al 2009 yi et al 2015 recently a pilot scale rbf was installed in an unconfined aquifer near the nakdong river estuary in busan south korea and tested for approximately five months to monitor water quality changes during rbf the hydrochemical properties of river water native ambient groundwater and rbf water were periodically measured the results revealed high concentrations of iron and sulfate in the rbf water high concentrations of iron and sulfate in water supply are a concern and can be correlated with trace metal release e g as and mo wallis et al 2011 wallis and pichler 2018 therefore a clear understanding of iron and sulfate release mechanisms is critical for water quality prediction and the sustainable operation of an rbf system previous studies have investigated iron release mechanisms during rbf farnsworth and hering 2011 grischek and paufler 2017 stuyfzand et al 2006 increased iron concentrations in rbf water can often be attributed to the development of reducing conditions near the riverbank farnsworth and hering 2011 massmann et al 2008 tufenkji et al 2002 microorganisms in the riverbed decompose dissolved organic carbon doc contained in the river water consume oxidants during biological doc degradation and thus establish a reducing environment beneath the riverbed near the bank as a consequence iron concentrations can increase due to the reductive dissolution of iron oxides commonly found in aquifer sediments farnsworth and hering 2011 however the reductive dissolution of iron oxides cannot explain the simultaneous increase of iron and sulfate during rbf operations one of the possible mechanisms for the co evolution of iron and sulfate is pyrite oxidation a few studies have proposed pyrite oxidation as the source of iron and sulfate co evolution in confined aquifers during the operation of aquifer storage and recovery asr systems prommer and stuyfzand 2005 wallis et al 2010 2011 using reactive transport modeling wallis et al 2010 2011 showed that pyrite oxidation was a dominant mechanism driving iron and sulfate releases in an asr system furthermore stuyfzand et al 2006 employed batch type mass balance modeling to investigate pyrite oxidation along with other redox reactions to explain water quality changes at an rbf site in the netherlands however to the best of our knowledge pyrite oxidation has never been investigated in an rbf system using reactive transport modeling in this study we investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of iron and sulfate concentrations at an rbf field site by combining field observations and reactive transport modeling we developed a 2d reactive transport model using pht3d which couples solute transport and complex hydrogeochemical reactions in a spatially distributed domain appelo and rolle 2010 ng et al 2017 prommer et al 2019 prommer and post 2010 prommer and stuyfzand 2005 steefel et al 2005 with the modeling framework we investigated the spatiotemporal evolution of iron and sulfate during rbf by simulating pyrite oxidation and subsequent oxidation and precipitation of iron ions and compared the simulation results with field data we then discuss the potential limitations of using theoretical reaction constants in field scale reactive transport modeling this study provides fundamental insights into the hydro biogeochemical reactions occurring during rbf and field scale reactive transport modeling 2 study site and field data the pilot scale rbf system used in this study is located in an open plain of the nakdong river delta busan south korea fig 1 the nakdong river is approximately 510 km long and passes through busan the second largest city in south korea three distinctive layers are identified near the surface a topsoil layer of 0 8 m thickness a layer of sand of 11 8 m thickness and a layer of silt and clay of 10 6 m thickness fig s1 the lower layer silt and clay is an effective confining unit between the unconfined aquifer sand layer and a deeper confined aquifer the confined aquifer is saline and hydraulic disconnected from the unconfined aquifer by the confining unit due to the topography being flat over a large area around the site the initial hydraulic gradient was negligible compared to the hydraulic gradient caused by pumping the initial saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer was estimated to be 11 47 m see fig s1 and section 3 1 for details three extraction wells were installed in the unconfined aquifer near the river fig 1 b and c and were operated for 135 days from late spring to fall may 26 2016 to oct 7 2016 producing approximately 500 m3 of rbf water per day from the unconfined aquifer the pumping rates of the three extraction wells were approximately 237 5 m3 day at wells 1 and 3 and 25 m3 day at well 2 note that the pumping rates had some fluctuations during the operation wells 1 2 and 3 are located 18 7 17 and 15 2 m respectively from the nakdong river and the distances between the wells are 14 8 wells 1 2 and 15 1 m wells 2 3 the depths of wells are approximately 9 m from the ground surface and the pumps were installed 4 m below the surface as shown in fig s1 temperature and precipitation in busan in 2016 are as follows seasonal temperature variations were approximately 4 3 30 5 c during spring 15 7 37 3 c during summer 0 1 29 7 c during fall and 7 7 17 7 c during winter fig s2 a annual monthly average precipitation was 146 7 mm with a maximum of 407 9 mm in september and a minimum of 56 6 mm in november fig s2 b the total precipitation in 2016 was 1760 2 mm the hydrochemical properties were analyzed from the samples of the nakdong river water and the native groundwater we sampled the river water near the extraction wells and the groundwater at the southernmost extraction well see fig 1 c respectively at the beginning of the operation during the operation the rbf water and river water were periodically collected in 50 ml polypropylene tubes the physicochemical properties of the water samples including oxidation reduction potential orp ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured on site using a portable multi meter ysi 556 ysi to estimate ionic composition samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter following collection and were stored at 4 c samples for cation analysis were acidified with hno3 following filtration major anions in the rbf water and river water including cl no3 and so4 2 were analyzed using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1000 equipped with an ionpac ag9 hc column bicarbonate hco3 concentrations were determined using the alkalinity titration method hem 1985 and the concentrations of na ca2 k mg2 fe total and mn total ions were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes agilent 730 doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu the trends of the nine major hydrochemical properties cl na fe t so4 2 o2 no3 ph orp and doc during test operations are shown in fig 2 note that fe t is the sum of fe2 and fe3 concentrations the mixing between the river water and groundwater is evident from the evolution of cl and na concentrations fig 2 a and b cl and na concentrations are higher in the native groundwater than in the river water cl and na concentrations decrease in time at the extraction well reflecting an increase in the proportion of river water reaching the well interestingly fe t and so4 2 concentrations show different trends compared to cl and na fig 2 c shows that the concentration of fe t in the rbf water decreased due to mixing between the native groundwater and river water during early operations t 0 50 days t 0 is may 26th 2016 and then slightly increased t 50 135 days furthermore fig 2 d shows that the so4 2 concentration in the rbf water was significantly higher than the concentrations of sulfate both in the river water and in the native groundwater therefore we infer that iron sulfate related geochemical reactions occurred during the rbf note that the doc concentration at the extraction well fig 2 i increased markedly after 50 days the possible relationship between fe t and doc is discussed in section 5 the trends of o2 and no3 concentrations also indicate the occurrence of geochemical reactions during the rbf as shown in fig 2 e and f the o2 concentration is significantly higher in the river water than in the native groundwater and the no3 concentration in the river water is also generally higher than the native groundwater except for a few days following commencement of pumping the o2 and no3 concentrations in the river water blue lines fluctuate moderately between 2 10 4 and 4 10 4 mol l and between 1 10 4 and 2 10 4 mol l respectively in contrast both o2 and no3 concentrations in the riverbank filtered water are generally close to zero indicating that o2 and no3 have been consumed by biogeochemical reactions during the rbf the early spike in the no3 concentration at the extraction well could be due to aquifer disturbances caused by the initiation of pumping walton 1990 fig 2 g and h show that the ph and orp values in river water and rbf water follow similar temporal patterns the ranges of orp valued are similar to other riverbank filtration sites in south korea yi et al 2015 and india boving et al 2014 the good correlation between the orp values of river and extracted rbf water suggests that there is good hydraulic connectivity between the river and the rbf well also the amount of redox reactions that occurred during the rbf process will determine the difference in orp values of river water and rbf water and the result implies that the amount of redox reactions did not change significantly over time note that the good correlation can be evident only when the measured values are larger in river compared to native groundwater because the flow direction is from the river to the rbf wells otherwise a dilution effect will be evident in rbf water as shown by cl and na fig 2 a and b note that the orp value at the extraction well becomes oxidizing orp 0 towards the end from initially reducing condition orp 0 red line in fig 2 h however the o2 concentration at the extraction well is close to zero red line in fig 2 e the low values of orp and o2 in the rbf water compared to that in the river water and the positive orp at the extraction well at the end indicate that redox reactions have occurred 3 reactive transport model a reactive transport model was developed using pht3d prommer and post 2010 which couples the mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 transport code with the phreeqc 2 reaction code parkhurst and appelo 1999 the flow model is based on the modflow 2005 code harbaugh 2005 the conceptual model and numerical solution are described in the following sections 3 1 flow model the conceptual model of the rbf site is shown in fig 3 groundwater flow is assumed horizontal and both the river and the rbf wells are considered fully penetrating the model is thus two dimensional 2d i e one layer the mixing of deep groundwater is not important for the modeling of the rbf site because the confining layer hydraulically separates deep groundwater from the shallow unconfined aquifer we assumed that the initial water table is flat by considering the flat topography of the study area and the negligible initial hydraulic gradient the initial saturated thickness of the aquifer is set to 11 47 m considering the initial water table level and geologic information fig s1 the boundary conditions and discretization of the 2d domain are shown in fig 4 the model domain is a square of size 2500 m 2500 m which ensures that the boundaries are sufficiently far from the extraction wells to avoid any significant boundary effects one side of the model domain coincides with the river and the other three sides are considered as no flow boundaries the river is represented by a constant head boundary condition and the extraction wells are implemented with the well package in modflow harbaugh 2005 the total simulation time is 135 days and daily time steps are used in the numerical solution the total numbers of cells in x and y directions are 49 and 78 respectively the discretization was finer in the area between river and abstraction wells where reactive processes were expected to occur and progressively coarser towards the three no flow boundaries to minimize computation time hydraulic properties are assumed homogeneous this simplifying assumption is deemed reasonable considering the local geology we calibrated the hydraulic conductivity k in the flow model using the field measured hydraulic head values we systematically varied k values and calculated root mean square error rmse between the field measured and simulated hydraulic heads at the pumping wells the k value of 6 5 m day gave the smallest rmse value the effective porosity ϕ e is estimated to be approximately 0 3 based on the laboratory analysis of sand cores from the field sites we set the value of specific yield sy to be 0 3 assuming the specific yield of the unconfined aquifer is close to the effective porosity bear 1979 gehman et al 2009 modflow is used for solving the transient unconfined groundwater flow equations with the layer property flow package lpf and the preconditioned conjugate gradient package 2 pcg2 solver harbaugh 2005 in the pcg2 solver the convergence criteria on the head change and flow residual are set to 1 10 4 m and 1 10 4 m3 day respectively 3 2 transport model initial solute concentrations in the native groundwater are assumed constant throughout the domain and solute concentrations in the river water are assumed constant in space and time table 1 the effective porosity is set to 0 3 i e equal to the specific yield and the longitudinal dispersivity αl to 1 m we use a αl of 1 m based on the well known approximate relationship between longitudinal dispersivity and the mean travel distance transport scale of αl 0 1 l where l is the transport scale fetter et al 2017 kang et al 2019 lallemand barres and peaudecerf 1978 the transport scale is taken as the distance between the riverside and well 3 the sampling location and is in the order of 10 m as shown in fig 3 the transverse dispersivity is taken equal to one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity gelhar et al 1992 fetter et al 2017 we validate the flow and transport parameters in section 4 in mt3dms or equivalently in pht3d the transient transport equation is solved using an implicit finite difference formulation with upstream weighting and the generalized conjugate gradient gcg solver with the jacobi preconditioner zheng and wang 1999 the relative convergence criterion for concentrations in the gcg solver cclose is set to 10 7 for nonreactive transport simulations and 10 10 for reactive transport simulations to obtain stable solutions the reactive transport simulations required more strict convergence criteria compared to nonreactive transport simulations within each flow time step the transport time step is automatically calculated based on the courant number 0 75 3 3 initial concentrations and geochemical reactions initial hydrochemical properties were obtained by phreeqc 2 batch simulations the phreeqc 2 calculations were conducted for charge balancing and calculating pe values based on the measured concentrations the results are shown in table 1 and were used as the initial river and groundwater properties in the model note that the pyrite concentration in table 1 is based on the assumption that reactions involving pyrite are not limited by the amount of pyrite pyrite oxidation was included in the reactive transport model to investigate whether this process can explain the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrochemistry at the rbf site as discussed in section 2 field data show that iron sulfate related geochemical reactions occurred during the rbf operation furthermore x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis showed the possibility of pyrite oxidation see the details in section 5 and fig s3 in the supplementary material the main reaction chain of pyrite oxidation can be expressed as follows eckert and appelo 2002 williamson and rimstidt 1994 appelo and postma 2005 prommer and

kinetic reaction rate of pyrite oxidation c o2 c no3 and c h are the concentrations of o2 no3 and h in groundwater respectively a pyr v is the ratio of the surface area of pyrite to the control volume

pyrite during the reaction pyrite oxidation by oxygen and nitrate eqs 1 and 2 is treated as a kinetic process and the reaction rate is determined by eq 3 prommer and stuyfzand 2005 wallis et al 2010 williamson and rimstidt 1994 ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation eqs 1b and 1c are treated as equilibrium processes because both reactions are known to be relatively fast in ph conditions of our system appelo and postma 2005 singer and stumm 1970 note that the field measured ph during riverbank filtration fluctuated between seven and nine as shown in fig 2 g the equilibrium reaction constants of the iron oxidation log keq ox and iron precipitation log keq precip are 13 02 and 4 891 respectively and are obtained from the phreeqc 2 database parkhurst and appelo 1999 the model set up is simple but general enough to represent many rbf sites 4 results 4 1 conservative transport modeling we first validate the flow and transport parameters discussed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 by comparing the model prediction of a conservative tracer cl with respect to field measurements as shown in fig 5 a the model successfully captures the general trends of the cl field data this confirms that the flow and transport models are successfully parameterized based on the particle tracking simulation the river water reaches the pumping wells approximately five days after the start of pumping also the proportion of the river water in the pumped water increases up to 80 after 60 days from the beginning of the pumping nonreactive transport simulations of the other chemical elements are also performed to study the mixing effect between river water and native groundwater thereby allowing us to evaluate the need of incorporating geochemical reactions the black dashed lines in fig 5 show the results of the nonreactive transport simulations simulated concentrations of fe t are significantly lower than the field data fig 5 b blue circles simulated nonreactive concentrations of so4 2 are also significantly lower compared to field measurements fig 5 c furthermore simulated nonreactive o2 no3 and ph concentrations do not adequately capture the temporal evolution of the field data fig 5 d f these results show that the mixing effect between the river water and native groundwater alone cannot explain the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrochemical properties the discrepancies between the nonreactive transport results and field measurements suggest that iron sulfate related geochemical reactions play a major role in the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrochemical properties 4 2 reactive transport modeling the red solid lines in fig 5 b f shows the reactive transport simulation results i e including pyrite oxidation the reactive transport simulation well captured the trends of the temporal evolution of so4 2 and other field measurements except for the trend of fe t field data the increase in so4 2 concentration due to pyrite oxidation is evident compare black and red lines in fig 5 c and is also reflected in the spatial distribution of so4 2 compare fig 6 a and b in the reactive transport model o2 and no3 act as oxidants and are consumed during pyrite oxidation therefore o2 and no3 concentrations become close to zero fig 5 d and e declining ph values fig 5 f are thereby a result of the pyrite oxidation process eqs 1a and 2 these results indicate that the model incorporating pyrite oxidation explains the water quality evolution at well 3 better than the nonreactive model except for fe t concentrations fe t concentrations are underestimated by the reactive transport model and show a similar trend to the nonreactive transport simulation the spatiotemporal evolution of fe t simulated by the reactive transport model fig 6 b also shows similar patterns with those of the nonreactive transport simulation fig 6 a similar to cl fe t concentration is lower in the river water than in the native groundwater and the spatial distribution of fe t in the nonreactive transport simulation is almost identical to that of cl fig 6 a these inconsistencies in fe t between the reactive transport simulation and field data may be attributed to uncertainties in the equilibrium constants used in ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation eqs 1b and 1c or to the fact that the processes should be treated as kinetic processes rather than equilibrium reactions also recent studies have shown that various mechanisms can lead to uncertainties in reactive transport modeling dentz et al 2011 ding et al 2017 kang et al 2019 li et al 2008 liu et al 2017 pereira nunes et al 2016 stumm and lee 1961 theis and singer 1974 wright et al 2017 for example various upscaled models that better resolve the subgrid heterogeneity have been proposed and showed some promising results dentz et al 2011 ding et al 2017 le borgne et al 2015 sund et al 2017 we hypothesize that there is a discrepancy between the ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation processes described in the reactive transport model and field conditions to test this hypothesis we simulated reactive transport without the ferric iron precipitation process eq 1c to examine the effects of iron precipitation note that iron precipitation can be controlled by both ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation and we prevented iron precipitation by removing the ferric iron precipitation process the reactive transport simulation results excluding the iron precipitation process are shown by green lines in fig 5 b f it is apparent that concentrations of fe t simulated by the reactive transport simulation model excluding iron precipitation better represent overall trends however the simulated concentrations are now somewhat higher than the field data spatial maps also show that the fe t concentration between the pumping wells and the river are significantly higher for the reactive case without iron precipitation fig 6 c as compared to the reactive case with iron precipitation fig 6 b or the nonreactive transport case fig 6 a simulated concentrations of so4 2 o2 no3 and ph green lines in fig 5 c f do not differ markedly from those of the reactive transport simulation with the iron precipitation process red lines in fig 5 c f overall the simulation results indicate that the pyrite oxidation process can explain the trends of field data however the ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation processes require further investigation to understand the impact of uncertainties in equilibrium constants on the modeling results we conducted a sensitivity analysis of the equilibrium constants of the ferrous iron oxidation log keq ox and ferric iron precipitation log keq precip processes to simulate the inhibition of fe2 oxidation we increased the equilibrium constant of ferrous iron oxidation eq 1b based on the sensitivity analysis we show results that encompasses the field data as follows 1 6 x log keq ox 1 7 x log keq ox and 1 8 x log keq ox where 1 x log keq ox is 13 02 which is the original value in the phreeqc 2 database parkhurst and appelo 1999 fig 7 a shows that the ferrous iron oxidation equilibrium favors fe2 over fe3 as the log keq ox value increases as a consequence the fe t concentration increases due to the decrease in ferric iron precipitation and the model captures the fe t concentration more accurately the results show that the best match would be obtained when using an equilibrium constant between 1 6 x log keq ox purple line and 1 8 x log keq ox red line an equally improved model fit was obtained when the equilibrium constant of ferric iron precipitation eq 1c was increased from the original value of 4 891 parkhurst and appelo 1999 see fig 7 b this results in fe3 being favored over fe oh 3 hence the fe t concentration increases and the model provides a more accurate representation of fe t however this appears unrealistic given that the original log k value reflects the precipitation of amorphous ferrihydrite and therefore lies already at the upper end of observed iron oxides solubilities appelo and postma 2005 cornell and schwertmann 2003 langmuir 1969 5 discussion the reactive transport simulations show that pyrite oxidation is a plausible mechanism that can explain the increase in iron and sulfate concentrations during the rbf in busan south korea it is known that pyrite can exist as the framboidal and euhedral crystals in shallow sedimentary aquifers under reducing conditions berner 1984 1970 1969 rickard 1975 rust 1935 sawlowicz 1993 wilkin and barnes 1997 and the native groundwater in our field site was initially under reducing condition for example houben et al 2017 detected individual pyrite crystals by measuring the contents of elemental metals using an electron microprobe the pyrites were embedded in the heavy mineral fraction of an unconsolidated sand aquifer in northwestern germany houben et al 2001 zhang et al 2009 2013 also obtained pyrite contents from measured total sulfur concentrations in the core samples taken from a shallow aquifer in the oostrum area netherlands we obtained other indirect evidence that supports the existence of pyrite in our field site first the xrd analysis of the core samples from our field site shows the existence of the oxidized form of pyrite pyrite is a highly oxidizing mineral appelo and postma 2005 kohfahl et al 2007 so it was challenging to preserve the sample in an intact condition during field sampling and xrd analysis therefore the detection of oxidized forms of pyrite was attempted and we detected iron sulfate hydroxide fe so4 oh in the soil samples taken from the unconfined aquifer 7 5 m below the ground surface using xrd analysis as shown by red peaks in fig s3 iron sulfate hydroxide can be formed from pyrite by bacterial oxidation and weathering processes komnitsas et al 1995 also a mass balance modeling approach that considers various biogeochemical reactions showed that pyrite oxidation can explain the increase of iron and sulfate at our field site ahn et al 2020 finally pyrite oxidation often releases arsenic as a trace metal smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wallis et al 2010 2011 welch et al 2000 we measured arsenic concentrations in the native groundwater river water and riverbank filtered water rbf water sampled from the field site fig s4 the arsenic concentration in the riverbank filtered water increased in time contrary to this the arsenic concentrations in the native groundwater and river water were under the detection level the arsenic data reinforces our hypothesis that pyrite oxidation occurred during riverbank filtration the reactive transport simulation captured the general trends shown in field observations for most elements related to the pyrite oxidation process e g so4 2 o2 no3 ph and pe fig 5 c f except fe t fig 5 b compared to the reactive transport simulation results with equilibrium constants from the phreeqc 2 database parkhurst and appelo 1999 higher concentrations of unprecipitated fe2 and fe3 were observed in the rbf water i e the model with laboratory measured reaction constants underpredicted the high concentration of iron in the riverbank filtered water this indicates that the ferrous iron oxidation and or ferric iron precipitation processes eqs 1b and 1c used in the reactive transport model did not adequately represent field conditions the sensitivity analysis in section 4 2 fig 7 shows that the calibrated equilibrium constants for ferric iron precipitation are unrealistically high values and this implies that a likely cause for elevated dissolved iron concentrations at the field site is the inhibition of fe2 oxidation the existence of organic matter with low concentration of do has been reported as a possible mechanism for disequilibrium between fe2 and fe3 e g by stumm and lee 1961 theis and singer 1974 oxygen is a major oxidant that causes fe2 oxidation thereby low concentration of dissolved oxygen can inhibit fe2 oxidation stumm and lee 1961 in addition theis and singer 1974 discussed that stabilization effects of fe2 ions by organic matters can contribute to considerable fe2 concentration even in aerobic conditions this discussion can be a valid explanation for inhibition of fe2 oxidation in our study case because doc was measured in the sampled rbf water as well as fe t throughout the operations at the busan rbf site stabilization of fe3 by organic matters could also explain the discrepancy it is known that organic matters can stabilize ferric iron by forming suspended colloids with fe3 pullin and cabaniss 2003 ritter et al 2006 the diameter of colloids has been reported as 50 100 nm therefore the stabilized fe3 by organic matters can pass a 0 45 um filter and contribute to elevating fe t concentrations the doc concentration increased significantly after about day 50 red line in fig 2 i and the trend is correlated with the increase pattern of fe t concentration red line in fig 2 c biogeochemical heterogeneities at the field scale may be another source of the discrepancy between simulated and field measured fe t concentrations spatial heterogeneity of mineral distribution is known for a potential source of the discrepancy liu et al 2017 for example the spatial distribution of pyrite tends to be heterogeneous fakhreddine et al 2016 kohfahl et al 2007 wallis et al 2010 2011 leading to localized biogeochemical reactions and impacting iron release and precipitation dynamics consequently ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation processes may be spatially heterogeneous which would impact effective reaction parameters recent studies also have reported incomplete mixing induced by diverse heterogeneities can affect biogeochemical reactions bolster et al 2012 ding and benson 2015 kang et al 2019 le borgne et al 2011 liu et al 2017 pereira nunes et al 2016 wright et al 2017 however theoretical reaction constants are often measured in idealized experimental settings such as batch and mixed flow type experiments under well mixed conditions rimstidt and dove 1986 williamson and rimstidt 1994 this study highlights the potential limitations of using theoretical reaction constants in field modeling applications as discussed the diverse mechanisms can cause uncertainty in reactive transport modeling and we showed that the calibration of the equilibrium constants enabled the model to more accurately represent the field data this result highlights the potential issue of using laboratory measured theoretical reaction constants in field scale reactive transport models the discrepancies between field observed and laboratory measured reaction constants have been widely reported but their origins are controversial ding and benson 2015 kang et al 2019 le borgne et al 2011 liu et al 2017 pereira nunes et al 2016 wright et al 2017 to improve the mechanistic understanding of the pyrite oxidation process and to improve predictability the origin of the inconsistency between field measured and simulated fe t concentrations should be investigated further this study motivates future studies to elucidate the complex mechanisms of iron release and precipitation which will enable improved predictions of water quality changes during rbf 6 conclusion in this study we combined field measurements and reactive transport modeling to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of hydrochemical properties especially iron and sulfate concentrations at an rbf site located in busan south korea by combining field observations and reactive transport modeling that incorporates pyrite oxidation this study for the first time captured the spatiotemporal co evolution of iron and sulfate concentrations at an rbf site the proper understanding of pyrite oxidation in aquifers is vital for various groundwater applications including riverbank filtration pyrite can exist in both unconfined and confined aquifers berner 1969 1970 1984 rickard 1975 rust 1935 sawlowicz 1993 wilkin and barnes 1997 and pyrite oxidation often releases arsenic smedley and kinniburgh 2002 wallis et al 2010 2011 that is toxic to human health to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that investigates pyrite oxidation in an rbf system using reactive transport modeling therefore the findings from this study related to pyrite oxidation have direct implications for many groundwater applications and other rbf sites we first developed a reactive transport model that implemented pyrite oxidation as a kinetic process and subsequent ferrous iron oxidation and ferric iron precipitation as equilibrium processes the model accurately represented the evolution of sulfate concentrations however the dissolved iron concentration was significantly underestimated the calibration of the equilibrium constants of ferrous iron oxidation alleviated this discrepancy the difference between the calibrated and reference equilibrium constants of the ferrous iron oxidation process is mainly attributed to the inhibition of fe2 oxidation likely caused by the combination of doc and low concentration of do also the physical and biogeochemical heterogeneities at the field scale and the differences between field and laboratory conditions are discussed as other mechanisms for the discrepancy in the laboratory reaction constants are often obtained under well mixed conditions however concentration gradients can occur in the field due to physical and biogeochemical heterogeneities such as permeability heterogeneity and heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of pyrite consequently effective reaction constants can be different from the theoretical values obtained in idealized laboratory settings kang et al 2019 wright et al 2017 note that it may be the case that the reaction terms should be fundamentally different and should be able to consider non local and non fickian effects benson and meerschaert 2008 dentz et al 2011 ding and benson 2015 these findings warrant further research to better understand and predict water quality

1502,karst wetland is a special complex and fragile type of wetland with increasing economic and agricultural activities the negative impacts of human activities on water quality particularly on karst wetland is also increasing in this paper multiple datasets and methods including hydrological hydrochemical and stable isotope data were used to elucidate the distribution and transport of nitrate pollution in huixian karst wetland under the influence of seasonal hydrodynamic changes and human activities hydrodynamic conditions around the wetland during both wet and dry seasons show large differences due to the complex exchange between surface water and groundwater the northern recharge area receives rainfall recharge with rapid responses in groundwater level temperature and electrical conductivity while those responses are relatively stable in the central area where the surface water interacts with groundwater frequently however their diurnal variations are significant in the western drainage area where groundwater always discharges to rivers the groundwater levels show sharp responses after rainfall but their temperatures are stable in addition δ15n and δ18o of nitrate suggest that the nitrate pollution mainly comes from nh4 in fertilizer and rainfall soil nitrogen animal feces and livestock manure the nitrate concentrations of most surface waters are lower during the wet season affected by the dilution and mixing effect of heavy rainfall and agricultural activities nitrate distributions show considerable spatial variability during the dry season especially in the wells located in residential areas which are mainly polluted by nearby residents this study highlights the vulnerability of karst wetlands and presents methods that are significant for ecological restoration as well as development of karst water resources in karst areas keywords karst wetland nitrate stable isotopes hydrodynamic condition human activities 1 introduction karst wetland is a special type of wetland commonly found in karst areas of south china shen et al 2013 karst aquifers are strongly heterogeneous and characterized by large fissures and subterranean conduit networks huang et al 2009 and therefore are generally more vulnerable to pollution than non karst aquifers goldscheider 2005 yang et al 2019 karst features such as depressions sinkholes as well underground conduits drive the hydraulic process of contaminant transport through the groundwater system in most areas where agriculture is the main economic activity environmental risk is always high due to chemical input from pesticides and fertilizer thereby making it difficult to maintain a healthy ecosystem this is even more so far fragile ecosystems such as wetlands leading to a dramatic decline in the quality of water and environment yue et al 2015 nitrate is one of the common pollutants in water zhang et al 2015 posing great risk to humans at high levels jones et al 2016 nixdorf et al 2017 in general no3 is not released during rock weathering jiang et al 2009a identification of the pollution source and migration pattern of nitrate in wetlands are important for assessing human health risks remediating polluted waters and future protection of wetland ecosystem peng et al 2018 the factors affecting nitrate can be divided into intrinsic factors such as hydrogeological structures and external factors such as human activities opsahl et al 2017 at present the methods of tracing and analyzing the main pollution sources of nitrate by water chemistry and δ15n and δ18o are widely used savard et al 2010 jin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 however the distribution of pollutant concentration in wetland is not only affected by pollution sources but also influenced by hydrodynamic conditions fissures and conduits are well developed in karst areas thereby influencing transport and concentration of nitrate in porous media jiang et al 2009b the hydrological response characteristics of karst groundwater can reflect the groundwater runoff conditions in addition δd and δ18o in groundwater are different under the influence of water rock interaction which can effectively reflect the recharge source and residence time of karst water luo et al 2016 to our knowledge huixian karst wetland study area situated in tropical and subtropical peaks in guilin is the largest scale natural karst wetland in south china making it one of the most valuable wetlands in the world by analyzing the sources of nitrate pollution in the study area this paper further expounds on the factors influencing the concentration and distribution of nitrate from anthropogenic as well as natural activities seasonal hydrodynamic changes 2 study sites 2 1 general descriptions huixian karst wetland is located south of the peak forest plain in guilin guangxi province south china fig 1a b the study site covers about 250km2 including the catchment area of the wetland the area is situated in a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of about 21 c the region has an annual precipitation of about 1800 mm with the heaviest downpours mainly occurring between june and august the northern and southern parts of the wetland are mainly low mountains and the central part is a low lying peak forest plain the relief is defined by high elevations in the northern and southern parts with lower elevations trending from east to west making the central area low and flat in the core part of the area lakes ponds grass fields and marshes have formed over a long period due to backwater in addition several rivers crisscross the area with changeable river courses into liangfeng and xiangsi river there are few industrial and mining enterprises in huixian wetland and surrounding areas major sources of pollution include small scale mining pyrite agriculture fertilizers and pesticides livestock farming and domestic waste in recent times huixian wetland has been shrinking due to increasing infrastructural and industrial development cai and ma 2012 reported that the total area of natural wetlands has declined from more than 41km2 in 1969 to 18 8 km2 in 1997 and to 14 6 km2 in 2006 2 2 hydrology and hydrogeology from the devonian to quaternary all the strata except permian are exposed with the devonian limestone as the dominant carbonate rock in huixian karst wetland fig 1c the main groundwater types in the study area are carbonate karst water and quaternary pore water the quaternary pore water is mainly distributed in the quaternary sediments with a thickness of about 0 2 6 m in the wetland center furthermore huixian wetland is a multi syncline catchment basin multiple synclines constitute a unique and superior hydrogeological structure in the study area and the composite basin of large fold fault depression defines a closed reservoir karst system fig 1d this basin is highly karstified with numerous karst conduits caves and underground rivers which form quick drainage systems both on the surface and underground generating perennial water flow in the center of wetland and the connected rivers the west side of the study area is xiangsi river and its tributary of huixian river and the east side is liangfeng river huixian wetland can be classified into the karst water system in the north the fissure water system in the south and the lake and marsh water system in the center generally the surface water and groundwater of huixian wetland converge at the center of the basin with dominant flow directions coming from the northern and southern mountainous areas also the center of huixian wetland is located between liangfeng and xiangsi river but with no obvious watershed cai and ma 2012 consequently there is strong interaction between surface water and groundwater flowing downstream from northern and southern parts draining to the east and west through liangfeng and xiangsi river respectively the study area covers the karst water system area in the north and the lake and marsh water system area in the center wetland 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis of water chemistry and stable isotopes a total of 29 water samples were collected in july 2018 wet season and february 2019 dry season to obtain the water chemistry stable deuterium oxygen isotopes and nitrate nitrogen oxygen isotopes the samples include 1 sample from fishpond water group 1 gl04 11 samples from rivers and lakes group 2 gl01 gl02 gl06 hx04 hx07 hx08 hx09 hx12 hx21 hx24 3 samples from shiziyan underground river szy group 3 hx01 hx02 hx03 1 sample from cave drip water group 4 gl07 and 13 samples from groundwater in wells group 5 gl03 gl05 gl08 gl09 hx05 hx06 hx10 hx11 hx13 hx15 hx16 hx18 hx22 1 liter of each water type was tested for conductivity temperature ph and dissolved oxygen using a hach hq40d equipment hco3 was titrated by hach alkalinity titrator on site with an accuracy of 0 01 mg l the water samples were filtered with 0 22 μm filter membrane to determine anions cations and stable nitrogen oxygen isotopes in which the cationic water samples were acidified with nitric acid to ph 2 meanwhile the water samples of nitrogen oxygen isotopes were stored under refrigeration at 4 c complete hydrogeochemical and deuterium oxygen isotopes determinations were completed in the basin hydrological process and wetland ecological restoration academic innovation base of china university of geosciences wuhan the cations were determined using a plasma emission spectrometer icp oes icap6300 with an accuracy of 0 001 mg l the anions were determined using ion chromatograph ics 2100 with an accuracy of 0 001 mg l the deuterium oxygen isotopes were determined by the picarro l2140 i water isotope analyzer which is based on the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard expressed in δd and δ18o with typical accuracy of 0 3 and 0 08 respectively the determinations of δ15n and δ18o in nitrate were completed at the institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development chinese academy of agricultural sciences gas stable isotope mass spectrometer trace gas concentrator delta v precon was used for determination based on bacterial denitrification pretreatment method overall the accuracy of nitrogen oxygen isotopes is 0 5 3 2 hydrological and meteorological data hydrological and meteorological data of the study area were collected from gauging stations and a weather station in the field the water level temperature and electrical conductivity ec of groundwater were continuously monitored at 9 wells hx05 hx06 hx10 hx11 hx13 hx15 hx16 hx18 hx22 no ec for hx22 using automatic field equipment model 3001 ltc levelogger solinst canada ltd these measurements had been recorded in 30 min steps from april 2018 to september 2019 except hx15 which was limited to june 2019 and hx18 which was limited to february 2019 daily rainfall and average air temperature were recorded by hobo rain gauge from april 2018 to september 2019 3 3 data handing nitrates from different sources have different characteristic values of nitrogen oxygen isotopes thus nitrogen oxygen isotopes can be used to preliminarily identify the source of nitrate pollution in this study the nitrogen and oxygen isotope characteristic values of various nitrate pollution sources in huixian wetland were derived from the study of peng et al 2018 the typical δ15n no3 ranges were 9 to 16 for atmospheric nitrate 5 to 6 for synthetic nitrate fertilizers 11 to 5 for ammonium fertilizers 2 to 10 for soil nitrogen 0 to 26 for manure and septic waste the typical δ18o no3 ranges were 25 5 to 75 for atmospheric nitrate 15 5 to 25 for synthetic nitrate fertilizers 16 to 15 for ammonium fertilizers soil nitrogen manure and septic waste in principle cl is relatively stable in aqueous solutions and can be used to trace the water very well the theoretical value of no3 can be calculated using cl value in surface water cao et al 2012 as follows if the variation of measured no3 is similar to calculated no3 this would imply that the dilution and mixing effect are the controlling factors to the no3 change along the rivers also if the measured no3 is smaller than the calculated no3 this would imply that except for dilution and mixing other processes such as biochemical reactions influence the change of no3 however if the measured no3 is larger than the calculated no3 this would imply that there is an excess of no3 entering into the river compared to cl calculated no 3 i no 3 initial cl i cl initial where no3 initial and cl initial were concentrations of nitrate and chloride respectively at the starting point for sampling along the river cl i was chloride concentration at sampling site i 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological response and hydrodynamic conditions the δd value ranged from 40 86 to 25 09 in wet season and from 34 37 to 13 78 in dry season where the δ18o value ranged from 6 27 to 2 46 in wet season and from 5 77 to 1 70 in dry season deuterium oxygen isotopes of all samples were located below the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 8 88δ18o 17 96 zhu et al 2017 and evenly distributed on both sides of the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 fig 2 indicating that all samples recharge from precipitation and the main factor affecting the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes is evaporation it is worth noting that the deuterium oxygen isotopes of the fishpond water wet season δd 25 09 δ18o 2 46 dry season δd 13 78 δ18o 1 70 deviated from lmwl due to limited mobility and strong evaporation δd and δ18o in the wet season are more concentrated and negative than that in the dry season indicating that evaporation was more intense during the dry season generally the response of groundwater level to rainfall is obvious fig 3 spatially the groundwater level decreases around the northern parts about 154 m to the center wetland about 148 m the fluctuation of groundwater level in the center about 1 m is smaller than that around the outer boundary about 2 m of the wetland in addition groundwater level drops more rapidly after rainstorms from the recharge to discharge area groundwater temperature in the area is mainly affected by atmospheric temperature water bearing medium and precipitation the water temperature is dramatically affected by the air temperature which is high during the summer and low in winter the fluctuation ranges of groundwater temperature 1 6 4 5 c are obviously smaller than that of atmospheric temperature 30 c indicating they have undergone a certain filtering and hysteresis effect the response of groundwater conductivity to rainfall is relatively lagging and the frequency of peak is less than that of groundwater level peak in addition it only takes 3 15 days for groundwater level temperature and conductivity back to the pre rainfall background indicating a relatively short residence time for groundwater the water in wells can be approximated as pore water under large environmental geological conditions according to the hydrograph characteristics of the groundwater monitoring points fig 3 referring to the four possible thermal and hydraulic reactions in the river and sediment water near the river bed during the interaction between groundwater and surface water ma et al 2013 and classification of the dynamic curve of karst groundwater level zou 1995 the groundwater monitoring points are divided into three groups karst area in the north core area in the center and discharge area in the west karst area in the north is represented by hx05 hx16 and hx22 fig 4a whose groundwater level temperature and conductivity have strong response to rainfall the diurnal fluctuation of water level and temperature are not obvious indicating that they are not closely related to surface water the conductivity response of hx05 and hx16 to rainfall decrease caused by rainfall dilution core area in the center is represented by hx06 hx15 and hx18 fig 4b whose temperature and conductivity are less affected by rainfall and the diurnal variation is significant the groundwater level of hx06 is slightly higher than that of hx07 with a value of about 0 5 m consistent with the surface water the δd and δ18o of hx06 are positive fig 2 indicating that it is affected by evaporation the surface water in the wetland center has generally been immobile for years and the diurnal variation of groundwater level and temperature are significant which indicate that the surface water interacts with groundwater frequently the conductivity of hx06 and hx18 reaches high values in june september and continues to increase after rainfall which may be related to agricultural activities in summer discharge area in the west is represented by the hx10 hx11 and hx13 fig 4c which is located near the huixian river the groundwater level rises up and down sharply after rainfall and the trailing phenomenon is not obvious groundwater temperature in the discharge area is stable and shows no obvious diurnal variation the conductivity increased in september november showing a lag effect compared to the core area of wetland 4 2 water chemistry and pollution huixian wetland exhibits typical karst water chemical characteristics ford and williams 2007 table 1 the ph of the water samples vary from 6 53 to 9 66 which have medium weak alkalinity and the groundwater water in the wells is slightly negative compared to the other groups the main cation is ca2 followed by mg2 where the main anion is hco3 followed by so4 2 ca2 mg2 and hco3 are mainly derived from the dissolution of carbonate rocks while so4 2 is mainly derived from the oxidation of pyrite and the dissolution of gypsum however gl06 is contaminated by pyrite while the total dissolved solid tds of group1 to 4 are all lower than 250 mg l most groundwater sampling points of the wells were observed to have higher tds than other groups therefore the contents of each component of wells are higher than other groups indicating that the groundwater has undergone stronger dissolution and filtration the concentration of nitrate varies the most in the groundwater measuring 7 59 111 mg l in wet season and 8 28 89 9 mg l in dry season fig 5 collectively 8 samples during the wet season and 13 samples during the dry season have n no3 value above 5 mg l with the highest concentration of nitrate occurring in hx05 111 mg l in wet season and 89 9 mg l in dry season hx05 is located in a dense residential area reflecting the influence of human activities on nitrate pollution in this area nitrate pollution is often caused by atmospheric nitrate fertilizers including synthetic nitrate fertilizers and ammonium fertilizers soil nitrogen manure and septic waste savard et al 2010 most of the water samples in the study area fell within the range of ammonium fertilizers soil nitrogen manure and septic waste fig 6 for example gl07 is in the range of synthetic nitrate fertilizers during the dry season whereas gl05 gl03 during the dry season and gl04 are out of the five typical regions showing a high δ15n no3 value more than 26 the distribution of δ18o values is more concentrated during the dry season than during the wet season similarly the distribution of δ15n value of rivers and lakes is more concentrated during the dry season which might be related to the characteristics of agricultural non point source pollution during summer the spatial distribution of pollution from agricultural non point sources is uneven making the effect of nitrogen from agricultural fertilizers on groundwater vary across different locations gl07 is cave drip water which is mainly affected by atmospheric precipitation and nitrogen from surface soil also δ15n of gl07 2 50 is negative during the dry season while δ18o 16 65 is positive which is consistent with the characteristics of rivers and lakes in the region thus it can be considered that rivers and lakes are dominantly affected by atmospheric precipitation and surface soil nitrogen 4 3 impact of human activities pollution from nitrate mainly occurs in agriculturally developed areas that may also be densely populated gu et al 2013 hamed et al 2013 hamed et al 2014 ncibi et al 2020 generally the causes of wetland pollution differ from place to place with respect to land use practices and other anthropogenic activities this is manifested in two ways chen et al 2019 the first one is that human production and waste enhance wetland water pollution through the hydrological cycle in the wetland cao et al 2018 the other is that human agricultural and infrastructural activities have changed the soil properties li et al 2017 hamed et al 2018 and the recharging conditions of groundwater thus making its chemical composition change accordingly it has been confirmed that the nitrate pollution in the study area mainly comes from ammonium fertilizers soil nitrogen manure and septic waste fig 6 the isosource software developed by phillips and koch 2002 was used to calculate the contribution of different pollution sources the results show that manure and septic waste contribute most to nitrate pollution in the study area the average contribution rate of which is 70 in wet season and 58 in dry season fig 7 the average contribution rate of ammonium fertilizers is 15 in wet season and 22 in dry season and the average contribution rate of soil nitrogen is 15 in wet season and 19 in dry season it further shows that human activities have a great impact on nitrate distribution in the study area the land use map of the study area was classified using satellite imagery from the chinese gaofen gf 1 satellite in december 2016 fig 8 the results show that agriculture is the main land with a great variety of crops and crop rotation peng et al 2018 residential areas are sparse and mostly rural most of the natural lakes and wasteland are converted into fish farms which negatively impacts the water quality as well as the original hydrological cycle conditions in huixian wetland human impacts are most evident during the summer when recharge conveys high concentrations of nitrate from the cultivated karst depressions into the aquifer conversely the fishpond water szy rivers and lakes are relatively lower because of the dilution effect from heavy rainfall during the wet season table 1 fig 8 it should be noted that all well water sampling points are located in residential areas consequently the nitrate concentration and spatial variability are especially high on the other hand nitrate concentration from cave drip water is low during both wet 0 08 mg l and dry seasons 0 17 mg l large areas of cultivated land and residential areas in the center of the wetland contribute to higher nitrate concentrations in rivers and lakes the land around gl06 is mainly forest with sparsely distributed residents as such the nitrate content is relatively low wet season 1 87 mg l dry season 5 04 mg l 4 4 transportation and conversion of nitrate 4 4 1 dilution and mixing effects of nitrate in surface water fig 9 shows the calculated and measured no3 along huixian karst wetland during both wet and dry seasons overall calculated no3 from collected samples show a good correspondence with measured no3 along surface water including szy during the wet season this means that the dilution and mixing effect are dominant during the wet season while other processes such as denitrification occurring in river channels contribute little to the concentration change of no3 from hx03 to hx07 measured no3 is slightly higher than both calculated no3 and initial no3 associated with the frequent agricultural activities during the summer and the mixing of new no3 along the way furthermore from the core area of wetland measured no3 at hx08 is relatively low due to strong biogeochemical action low measured no3 at hx12 indicates the presence of precipitation dilution at gl01 measured no3 is high because of the mixing with the no3 concentrated water coming from the upper stream of huixian river residential areas due to lack of rainfall during the dry season coupled with the impact from agricultural activities nitrate mainly comes from human activities and therefore exhibits a strong spatial variability similarly nitrate concentrations are relatively low in places where human activities are also low such as hx21 and hx24 similarly hx08 also shows low measured no3 concentration due to biogeochemical action during the dry season 4 4 2 transportation and conversion of nitrate in groundwater samples from well water show very high nitrate levels exhibiting wide variance between wells than any other group of samples fig 5 however differences in concentration levels between the seasons are generally small fig 8 consequently it can be said that human activities have little influence on nitrate distribution in groundwater denitrification process in karst aquifers is generally weak because groundwater flows rapidly howard 1985 most well samples have do value above 2 mg l during the wet season which is not conducive for denitrification gillham et al 1978 trudell et al 1986 hx13 has a do value 1 57 mg l between 0 2 mg l and 2 mg l during the wet season which may be affected by denitrification desimone and howes 1998 in addition since water rock interaction tends to enrich δd and δ18o in groundwater both can be used to estimate the residence time of well water due to abundance of rainfall and faster groundwater circulation during the summer δd and δ18o are usually more concentrated and negative during the wet season fig 2 during the dry season the residence time of groundwater is relatively longer with more intense interaction between water and rock making the distribution of δd and δ18o at each sampling point to be more dispersed in general nitrate contamination in well water is more severe in the summer because of agricultural activities fig 2 however the relatively light δd and δ18o indicate that the residence time of groundwater is short in summer which makes nitrate in fertilizers and septic waste easily recharge into groundwater with rainfall fig 10 specially hx06 which is located in the core area of the wetland interacts with surface water frequently making the δd and δ18o heavier this also validates our assumption that evaporation is the main factor affecting the study area during the winter the δd and δ18o are heavier in the western discharge area due to the longer runoff path such as gl03 hx10 and hx11 the nitrate concentrations of hx05 hx18 hx15 and gl08 are relatively higher and the δd and δ18o are relatively lighter in both wet and dry seasons indicating that they are mainly polluted by nearby residents it is obvious that they are also quickly replenished by surface water and respond quickly to surface pollution combined with fig 7 it further indicates that nitrate pollution in the study area is greatly affected by human activities including living and agricultural activities frequent human activities and short groundwater residence time make the groundwater in the wells vulnerable to nitrate pollution and show spatial variability corresponding to human activities in the study area 5 conclusions in this study the dual role of anthropogenic and natural activities in polluting karst wetlands were investigated and thoroughly analyzed huixian karst wetland has a special hydrogeological structure that controls its hydrological and hydrochemical processes and functions the occurrence and distribution of nitrate from human activities as well as the impact of prevailing hydrodynamic conditions on wetland pollution was elucidated results show that the main recharge source of huixian karst wetland is rainfall the groundwater levels temperature and electrical conductivity in the northern karstified areas exhibit strong response to precipitation conversely the central wetland area shows weak response to rainfall but has strong diurnal variation in the western discharge area groundwater levels exhibit rapid variation after storm events but the temperature is generally stable huixian karst wetland exhibits average karst water chemical characteristics which may be associated with degree of karstification as well as strong dissolution and filtration rock water interaction the content of nitrate in water samples is high in the study area nitrate pollution in the study area mainly comes from nh4 in fertilizer and rainfall soil nitrogen animal feces and livestock manure rivers and lakes are mainly affected by atmospheric precipitation and surface soil nitrogen the most widely distributed area in the region is cultivated land residential areas are scattered and mostly rural the nitrate concentration is lower during the wet season of fishpond water szy rivers and lakes because of the dilution effect of heavy rainfall and agricultural activities during the summer all well water sampling points are in residential areas affected by human life the nitrate concentration and spatial variability are special high large areas of cultivated land and residential areas in wetland center contribute to higher nitrate concentrations in rivers and lakes the dilution and mixing effect are dominant during the wet season where other processes such as denitrification occur in conduits thereby influencing the concentration change of no3 in surface water including shiziyan underground river in the dry season nitrate mainly comes from human activities due to the lack of rainfall and runoff from agricultural activities hydrodynamic conditions have great influence on the distribution characteristics of nitrate concentration in groundwater the nitrate content in well water is relatively high and varies widely which is mainly polluted by nearby residents the special hydrological features of karst areas make groundwater vulnerable to pollution in order to reduce nitrate pollution the primary task is to control the pollution source living and agricultural activities are the main causes of nitrate pollution especially manure and septic waste therefore nitrate pollution sources can be controlled by treating human and animal feces and septic waste such as centralizing the disposal of septic waste in addition residents should learn the importance of scientific use of pesticides and fertilizers to avoid their excessive use

1502,karst wetland is a special complex and fragile type of wetland with increasing economic and agricultural activities the negative impacts of human activities on water quality particularly on karst wetland is also increasing in this paper multiple datasets and methods including hydrological hydrochemical and stable isotope data were used to elucidate the distribution and transport of nitrate pollution in huixian karst wetland under the influence of seasonal hydrodynamic changes and human activities hydrodynamic conditions around the wetland during both wet and dry seasons show large differences due to the complex exchange between surface water and groundwater the northern recharge area receives rainfall recharge with rapid responses in groundwater level temperature and electrical conductivity while those responses are relatively stable in the central area where the surface water interacts with groundwater frequently however their diurnal variations are significant in the western drainage area where groundwater always discharges to rivers the groundwater levels show sharp responses after rainfall but their temperatures are stable in addition δ15n and δ18o of nitrate suggest that the nitrate pollution mainly comes from nh4 in fertilizer and rainfall soil nitrogen animal feces and livestock manure the nitrate concentrations of most surface waters are lower during the wet season affected by the dilution and mixing effect of heavy rainfall and agricultural activities nitrate distributions show considerable spatial variability during the dry season especially in the wells located in residential areas which are mainly polluted by nearby residents this study highlights the vulnerability of karst wetlands and presents methods that are significant for ecological

wetland ecological restoration academic innovation base of china university of geosciences wuhan the cations were determined using a plasma emission spectrometer icp oes icap6300 with an accuracy of 0 001 mg l the anions were determined using ion chromatograph ics 2100 with an accuracy of 0 001 mg l the deuterium oxygen isotopes were determined by the picarro l2140 i water isotope analyzer which is based on the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard expressed in δd and δ18o with typical accuracy of 0 3 and 0 08 respectively the determinations of δ15n and δ18o in nitrate were completed at the institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development chinese academy of agricultural sciences gas stable isotope mass spectrometer trace gas concentrator delta v precon was used for determination based on bacterial denitrification pretreatment method overall the accuracy of nitrogen oxygen isotopes is 0 5 3 2 hydrological and meteorological data hydrological and meteorological data of the study area were collected from gauging stations and a weather station in the field the water level temperature and electrical conductivity ec of groundwater were continuously monitored at 9 wells hx05 hx06 hx10 hx11 hx13 hx15 hx16 hx18 hx22 no ec for hx22 using automatic field equipment model 3001 ltc levelogger solinst canada ltd these measurements had been recorded in 30 min steps from april 2018 to september 2019 except hx15 which was limited to june 2019 and hx18 which was limited to february 2019 daily rainfall and average air temperature were recorded by hobo rain gauge from april 2018 to september 2019 3 3 data handing nitrates from different sources have different characteristic values of nitrogen oxygen isotopes thus nitrogen oxygen isotopes can be used to preliminarily identify the source of nitrate pollution in this study the nitrogen and oxygen isotope characteristic values of various nitrate pollution sources in huixian wetland were derived from the study of peng et al 2018 the typical δ15n no3 ranges were 9 to 16 for atmospheric nitrate 5 to 6 for synthetic nitrate fertilizers 11 to 5 for ammonium fertilizers 2 to 10 for soil nitrogen 0 to 26 for manure and septic waste the typical δ18o no3 ranges were 25 5 to 75 for atmospheric nitrate 15 5 to 25 for synthetic nitrate fertilizers 16 to 15 for ammonium fertilizers soil nitrogen manure and septic waste in principle cl is relatively stable in aqueous solutions and can be used to trace the water very well the theoretical value of no3 can be calculated using cl value in surface water cao et al 2012 as follows if the variation of measured no3 is similar to calculated no3 this would imply that the dilution and mixing effect are the controlling factors to the no3 change along the rivers also if the measured no3 is smaller than the calculated no3 this would imply that except for dilution and mixing other processes such as biochemical reactions influence the change of no3 however if the measured no3 is larger than the calculated no3 this would imply that there is an excess of no3 entering into the river compared to cl calculated no 3 i no 3 initial cl i cl initial where no3 initial and cl initial were concentrations of nitrate and chloride respectively at the starting point for sampling along the river cl i was chloride concentration at sampling site i 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological response and hydrodynamic conditions the δd value ranged from 40 86 to 25 09 in wet season and from 34 37 to 13 78 in dry season where the δ18o value ranged from 6 27 to 2 46 in wet season and from 5 77 to 1 70 in dry season deuterium oxygen isotopes of all samples were located below the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 8 88δ18o 17 96 zhu et al 2017 and evenly distributed on both sides of the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 fig 2 indicating that all samples recharge from precipitation and the main factor affecting the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes is evaporation it is worth noting that the deuterium oxygen isotopes of the fishpond water wet season δd 25 09 δ18o 2 46 dry season δd 13 78 δ18o 1 70 deviated from lmwl due to limited mobility and strong evaporation δd and δ18o in the wet season are more concentrated and negative than that in the dry season indicating that evaporation was more intense during the dry season generally the response of groundwater level to rainfall is obvious fig 3 spatially the groundwater level decreases around the northern parts about 154 m to the center wetland about 148 m the fluctuation of groundwater level in the center about 1 m is smaller than that around the outer boundary about 2 m of the wetland in addition groundwater level drops more rapidly after rainstorms from the recharge to discharge area groundwater temperature in the area is mainly affected by atmospheric temperature water bearing medium and precipitation the water temperature is dramatically affected by the air temperature which is high during the summer and low in winter the fluctuation ranges of groundwater temperature 1 6 4 5 c are obviously smaller than that of atmospheric temperature 30 c indicating they have undergone a certain filtering and hysteresis effect the response of groundwater conductivity to rainfall is relatively lagging and the frequency of peak is less than that of groundwater level peak in addition it only takes 3 15 days for groundwater level temperature and conductivity back to the pre rainfall background indicating a relatively short residence time for groundwater the water in wells can be approximated as pore water under large environmental geological conditions according to the hydrograph characteristics of the groundwater monitoring points fig 3 referring to the four possible thermal and hydraulic reactions in the river and sediment water near the river bed during the interaction between groundwater and surface water ma et al 2013 and classification of the dynamic curve of karst groundwater level zou 1995 the groundwater monitoring points are divided into three groups karst area in the north core area in the center and discharge area in the west karst area in the north is represented by hx05 hx16 and hx22 fig 4a whose groundwater level temperature and conductivity have strong response to rainfall the diurnal fluctuation of water level and temperature are not obvious indicating that they are not closely related to surface water the conductivity response of hx05 and hx16 to rainfall decrease caused by rainfall dilution core area in the center is represented by hx06 hx15 and hx18 fig 4b whose temperature and conductivity are less affected by rainfall and the diurnal variation is significant the groundwater level of hx06 is slightly higher than that of hx07 with a value of about 0 5 m consistent with the surface water the δd and δ18o of hx06 are positive fig 2 indicating that it is affected by evaporation the surface water in the wetland center has generally been immobile for years and the diurnal variation of groundwater level and temperature are significant which indicate that the surface water interacts with groundwater frequently the conductivity of hx06 and hx18 reaches high values in june september and continues to increase after rainfall which may be related to agricultural activities in summer discharge area in the west is represented by the hx10 hx11 and hx13 fig 4c which is located near the huixian river the groundwater level rises up and down sharply after rainfall and the trailing phenomenon is not obvious groundwater temperature in the discharge area is stable and shows no obvious diurnal variation the conductivity increased in september november showing a lag effect compared to the core area of wetland 4 2 water chemistry and pollution huixian wetland exhibits typical karst water chemical characteristics ford and williams 2007 table 1 the ph of the water samples vary from 6 53 to 9 66 which have medium weak alkalinity and the groundwater water in the wells is slightly negative compared to the other groups the main cation is ca2 followed by mg2 where the main anion is hco3 followed by so4 2 ca2 mg2 and hco3 are mainly derived from the dissolution of carbonate rocks while so4 2 is mainly derived from the oxidation of pyrite and the dissolution of gypsum however gl06 is contaminated by pyrite while the total dissolved solid tds of group1 to 4 are all lower than 250 mg l most groundwater sampling points of the wells were observed to have higher tds than other groups therefore the contents of each component of wells are higher than other groups indicating that the groundwater has undergone stronger dissolution and filtration the concentration of nitrate varies the most in the groundwater measuring 7 59 111 mg l in wet season and 8 28 89 9 mg l in dry season fig 5 collectively 8 samples during the wet season and 13 samples during the dry season have n no3 value above 5 mg l with the highest concentration of nitrate occurring in hx05 111 mg l in wet season and 89 9 mg l in dry season hx05 is located in a dense residential area reflecting the influence of human activities on nitrate pollution in this area nitrate pollution is often caused by atmospheric nitrate fertilizers including synthetic nitrate fertilizers and ammonium fertilizers soil nitrogen manure and septic waste savard et al 2010 most of the water samples in the study area fell within the range of ammonium fertilizers soil nitrogen manure and septic waste fig 6 for example gl07 is in the range of synthetic nitrate fertilizers during the dry season whereas gl05 gl03 during the dry season and gl04 are out of the five typical regions showing a high δ15n no3 value more than 26 the distribution of δ18o values is more concentrated during the dry season than during the wet season similarly the distribution of δ15n value of rivers and lakes is more concentrated during the dry season which might be related to the characteristics of agricultural non point source pollution during summer the spatial distribution of pollution from agricultural non point sources is uneven making the effect of nitrogen from agricultural fertilizers on groundwater vary across different locations gl07 is cave drip water which is mainly affected by atmospheric precipitation and nitrogen from surface soil also δ15n of gl07 2 50 is negative during the dry season while δ18o 16 65 is positive which is consistent with the characteristics of rivers and lakes in the region thus it can be considered that rivers and lakes are dominantly affected by atmospheric precipitation and surface soil nitrogen 4 3 impact of human activities pollution from nitrate mainly occurs in agriculturally developed areas that may also be densely populated gu et al 2013 hamed et al 2013 hamed et al 2014 ncibi et al 2020 generally the causes of wetland pollution differ from place to place with respect to land use practices and other anthropogenic activities this is manifested in two ways chen et al 2019 the first one is that human production and waste enhance wetland water pollution through the hydrological cycle in the wetland cao et al 2018 the other is that human agricultural and infrastructural activities have changed the soil properties li et al 2017 hamed et al 2018 and the recharging conditions of groundwater thus making its chemical composition change accordingly it has been confirmed that the nitrate pollution in the study area mainly comes from ammonium fertilizers soil nitrogen manure and septic waste fig 6 the isosource software developed by phillips and koch 2002 was used to calculate the contribution of different pollution sources the results show that manure and septic waste contribute most to nitrate pollution in the study area the average contribution rate of which is 70 in wet season and 58 in dry season fig 7 the average contribution rate of ammonium fertilizers is 15 in wet season and 22 in dry season and the average contribution rate of soil nitrogen is 15 in wet season and 19 in dry season it further shows that human activities have a great impact on nitrate distribution in the study area the land use map of the study area was classified using satellite imagery from the chinese gaofen gf 1 satellite in december 2016 fig 8 the results show that agriculture is the main land with a great variety of crops and crop rotation peng et al 2018 residential areas are sparse and mostly rural most of the natural lakes and wasteland are converted into fish farms which negatively impacts the water quality as well as the original hydrological cycle conditions in huixian wetland human impacts are most evident during the summer when recharge conveys high concentrations of nitrate from the cultivated karst depressions into the aquifer conversely the fishpond water szy rivers and lakes are relatively lower because of the dilution effect from heavy rainfall during the wet season table 1 fig 8 it should be noted that all well water sampling points are located in residential areas consequently the nitrate concentration and spatial variability are especially high on the other hand nitrate concentration from cave drip water is low during both wet 0 08 mg l and dry seasons 0 17 mg l large areas of cultivated land and residential areas in the center of the wetland contribute to higher nitrate concentrations in rivers and lakes the land around gl06 is mainly forest with sparsely distributed residents as such the nitrate content is relatively low wet season 1 87 mg l dry season 5 04 mg l 4 4 transportation and conversion of nitrate 4 4 1 dilution and mixing effects of nitrate in surface water fig 9 shows the calculated and measured no3 along huixian karst wetland during both wet and dry seasons overall calculated no3 from collected samples show a good correspondence with measured no3 along surface water including szy during the wet season this means that the dilution and mixing effect are dominant during the wet season while other processes such as denitrification occurring in river channels contribute little to the concentration change of no3 from hx03 to hx07 measured no3 is slightly higher than both calculated no3 and initial no3 associated with the frequent agricultural activities during the summer and the mixing of new no3 along the way furthermore from the core area of wetland measured no3 at hx08 is relatively low due to strong biogeochemical action low measured no3 at hx12 indicates the presence of precipitation dilution at gl01 measured no3 is high because of the mixing with the no3 concentrated water coming from the upper stream of huixian river residential areas due to lack of rainfall during the dry season coupled with the impact from agricultural activities nitrate mainly comes from human activities and therefore exhibits a strong spatial variability similarly nitrate concentrations are relatively low in places where human activities are also low such as hx21 and hx24 similarly hx08 also shows low measured no3 concentration due to biogeochemical action during the dry season 4 4 2 transportation and conversion of nitrate in groundwater samples from well water show very high nitrate levels exhibiting wide variance between wells than any other group of samples fig 5 however differences in concentration levels between the seasons are generally small fig 8 consequently it can be said that human activities have little influence on nitrate distribution in groundwater denitrification process in karst aquifers is generally weak because groundwater flows rapidly howard 1985 most well samples have do value above 2 mg l during the wet season which is not conducive for denitrification gillham et al 1978 trudell et al 1986 hx13 has a do value 1 57 mg l between 0 2 mg l and 2 mg l during the wet season which may be affected by denitrification desimone and howes 1998 in addition since water rock interaction tends to enrich δd and δ18o in groundwater both can be used to estimate the residence time of well water due to abundance of rainfall and faster groundwater circulation during the summer δd and δ18o are usually more concentrated and negative during the wet season fig 2 during the dry season the residence time of groundwater is relatively longer with more intense interaction between water and rock making the distribution of δd and δ18o at each sampling point to be more dispersed in general nitrate contamination in well water is more severe in the summer because of agricultural activities fig 2 however the relatively light δd and δ18o indicate that the residence time of groundwater is short in summer which makes nitrate in fertilizers and septic waste easily recharge into groundwater with rainfall fig 10 specially hx06 which is located in the core area of the wetland interacts with surface water frequently making the δd and δ18o heavier this also validates our assumption that evaporation is the main factor affecting the study area during the winter the δd and δ18o are heavier in the western discharge area due to the longer runoff path such as gl03 hx10 and hx11 the nitrate concentrations of hx05 hx18 hx15 and gl08 are relatively higher and the δd and δ18o are relatively lighter in both wet and dry seasons indicating that they are mainly polluted by nearby residents it is obvious that they are also quickly replenished by surface water and respond quickly to surface pollution combined with fig 7 it further indicates that nitrate pollution in the study area is greatly affected by human activities including living and agricultural activities frequent human activities and short groundwater residence time make the groundwater in the wells vulnerable to nitrate pollution and show spatial variability corresponding to human activities in the study area 5 conclusions in this study the dual role of anthropogenic and natural activities in polluting karst wetlands were investigated and thoroughly analyzed huixian karst wetland has a special hydrogeological structure that controls its hydrological and hydrochemical processes and functions the occurrence and distribution of nitrate from human activities as well as the impact of prevailing hydrodynamic conditions on wetland pollution was elucidated results show that the main recharge source of huixian karst wetland is rainfall the groundwater levels temperature and electrical conductivity in the northern karstified areas exhibit strong response to precipitation conversely the central wetland area shows weak response to rainfall but has strong diurnal variation in the western discharge area groundwater levels exhibit rapid variation after storm events but the temperature is generally stable huixian karst wetland exhibits average karst water chemical characteristics which may be associated with degree of karstification as well as strong dissolution and filtration rock water interaction the content of nitrate in water samples is high in the study area nitrate pollution in the study area mainly comes from nh4 in fertilizer and rainfall soil nitrogen animal feces and livestock manure rivers and lakes are mainly affected by atmospheric precipitation and surface soil nitrogen the most widely distributed area in the region is cultivated land residential areas are scattered and mostly rural the nitrate concentration is lower during the wet season of fishpond water szy rivers and lakes because of the dilution effect of heavy rainfall and agricultural activities during the summer all well water sampling points are in residential areas affected by human life the nitrate concentration and spatial variability are special high large areas of cultivated land and residential areas in wetland center contribute to higher nitrate concentrations in rivers and lakes the dilution and mixing effect are dominant during the wet season where other processes such as denitrification occur in conduits thereby influencing the concentration change of no3 in surface water including shiziyan underground river in the dry season nitrate mainly comes from human activities due to the lack of rainfall and runoff from agricultural activities hydrodynamic conditions have great influence on the distribution characteristics of nitrate concentration in groundwater the nitrate content in well water is relatively high and varies widely which is mainly polluted by nearby residents the special hydrological features of karst areas make groundwater vulnerable to pollution in order to reduce nitrate pollution the primary task is to control the pollution source living and agricultural activities are the main causes of nitrate pollution especially manure and septic waste therefore nitrate pollution sources can be controlled by treating human and animal feces and septic waste such as centralizing the disposal of septic waste in addition residents should learn the importance of scientific use of pesticides and fertilizers to avoid their excessive use

1503,hydrogeochemical models for the prediction of drainage quality from full scale mine waste rock piles are often parameterized using data from small scale laboratory or field experiments of short duration yet many model parameters and processes e g sulfide oxidation rates vary strongly with the spatiotemporal dimensions of the experiment the upscaling of prediction models remains a critical challenge for mine waste management worldwide here we investigate scale dependence in laboratory and field experiments that spanned orders of magnitude in size i e 2 kg to 100 000 kg at the antamina mine in peru normalized drainage mass loading rates systematically decreased with increasing scale irrespective of waste rock type a process based reactive transport model was used to simulate observed rates and reproduce the geochemical composition of drainage across scales long term trends in drainage quality could be quantitatively reproduced when the model was parameterized with mostly scale and experiment specific measured bulk properties or literature values leaving geochemical rate coefficients the sole calibrated model parameters analysis of these fitted parameters revealed that the scale dependence of geochemical rates was largely explained by reactive mineral surface area this work demonstrates that practical drainage quality predictions for full scale waste rock piles can be established from readily available bulk parameters determined at multiple scales keywords scale dependence mine waste rock weathering rates drainage prediction reactive transport modeling 1 introduction sustainable waste rock management is crucial for mining operations around the world hudson edwards and dold 2015 weathering of exposed waste materials can produce low quality acidic and or metal laden drainage that can have detrimental impacts on downstream environments and requires costly treatment amos et al 2015 to manage these potential environmental risks and costs the quantity and quality of drainage from waste materials needs to be predicted long beyond mine closure such prediction requires understanding of the hydrogeochemical processes that underlie drainage generation on industry relevant spatiotemporal scales amos et al 2015 blowes et al 2003 unfortunately the forecasting of waste rock drainage quality on real world spatiotemporal scales remains challenging to date due to site specificity in the generated waste rock and local weathering conditions physicochemical heterogeneity in large waste rock systems and the intricate non linear coupling between chemical kinetics and mass and heat transfer processes jung and navarre sitchler 2018 lahmira et al 2017 lefebvre et al 2001a molson et al 2012 practical technical frameworks to support waste rock management and drainage quality predictions exist typically combining classic static and kinetic testing procedures field scale experiments and geochemical equilibrium or reactive transport models dold 2017 international network for acid prevention inap 2003 li et al 2014 parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 price 2009 seigneur et al 2019 the relatively small scale laboratory static and kinetic tests that form the basis of most prediction efforts often oversimplify variable weathering conditions in the environment and selection of representative waste rock samples for testing is challenging in heterogeneous geological settings parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 price 2009 apparent reaction rate parameters typically depend upon the scale of the experiment with slower rates associated with larger scales malmström et al 2000 it is therefore essential to understand the scale dependence of model parameters before they can be used in drainage predictions for real world large scale waste rock piles scale dependence of parameter values is a consequence of a fundamental limitation of all models parameters can never explicitly describe a real world system on all scales beckie 1996 whereas the real world exists on all scales models divide the real world into dynamics that are explicitly resolved and smaller unresolved dynamics that are parameterized practical larger scale models do not need to resolve smaller scale dynamics but they must account for the effect of unresolved dynamics beckie 1998 for example geochemical models may use a macroscale representation of average molecular dynamics to define equilibrium constants instead of explicitly resolving molecules and their individual interactions in this framework equilibrium constants can be understood as model parameters that account for the large scale effects of molecular scale dynamics parameters are sometimes called effective because they represent the effects of unresolved heterogeneity and sometimes multiple processes on observed larger scale dynamics beckie 1998 the scale of a model determines the burden placed upon model parameters the fewer dynamics that are explicitly resolved the more they must be accounted for by model parameters model parameters are also model dependent the appropriate parameter value is the one that matches model output most closely with observation and thus defined by the model used to determine them reaction rate parameters determined from a kinetic model that explicitly accounts for effects of ph microbiology and mineral heterogeneity will differ from parameters determined with a model that does not malmström et al 2000 it is thus difficult to compare parameters from models that explicitly resolve some processes with others that do not predictive modeling of waste rock drainage is particularly challenging because of the physical and geochemical heterogeneity of mine waste and the multiple coupled processes that affect drainage quantity and quality the practical challenge is to utilize parameters determined from smaller scale relatively homogeneous shorter term laboratory tests in predictive models for more heterogeneous larger scale i e hundreds of meters tall and wide waste rock piles malmström et al 2000 physicochemical properties such as hydraulic conductivity or reactive surface area determined from unrepresentative or small sample sizes and broad particle size distributions ganor et al 2007 malmström et al 2000 plante et al 2014 fail to represent unresolved geochemical and physical transport phenomena and heterogeneity that can be relevant at larger scales including heat and gas transport limitations preferential flow and effects of secondary mineral precipitation on drainage chemistry and porosity birkham et al 2003 lahmira et al 2017 seigneur et al 2019 furthermore an exhaustive spatiotemporal characterization of physicochemical heterogeneity cannot be achieved for full size waste rock storage systems or any physical system dooge 1986 even in the big data era and results are often required at the permitting stage before the piles are constructed in the mine waste context so called scaling factors have been proposed to reconcile differences in parameter values on different scales malmström et al 2000 plante et al 2014 such scaling factors may be considered empirical parameter corrections to account for unresolved variability in bulk averaged physicochemical properties or flow non uniformity the few studies that have investigated scaling phenomena in waste rock include experiments conducted at the aitik malmström et al 2000 strömberg and banwart 1999 tio plante et al 2014 and diavik wilson et al 2018 mines these studies found that i drainage mass loadings and concentrations decrease as the experimental scale increases and ii these differences are related to heterogeneity in particle size temperature hydrological flow drainage ph or a combination thereof malmström et al 2000 plante et al 2014 wilson et al 2018 all the works above considered relatively uniform waste rock types stored under arctic weathering conditions multiple approaches have been used to describe scale dependence of model specific parameters stemming from site specific availability and consistency of data across scales for instance effects of non uniform preferential flow have either been lumped into single hydrological correction factors based on tracer tests malmström et al 2000 integrated into bulk experimental liquid solid ratios plante et al 2014 or reproduced by dual domain models blackmore et al 2018a as a result scaling factors remain poorly verified across sites to date and their use in drainage quality prediction models remains based on limited mechanistic evidence to this end we here exploit previously published hydrogeochemical data from a long term multiscale research program at the antamina mine in peru to study scale dependence in waste rock weathering processes to minimize the confounding influence of model dependence we interpret experiments conducted at multiple scales consistently using a same process based reactive transport model described in seigneur et al 2020 we focus our analysis on the scale dependence of reaction rate parameters that describe kinetic mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions the results lay out a framework to systematically interpret data collected on multiple scales for prediction at longer terms and larger scales 2 methods and materials 2 1 overview of research program the antamina mine located in the peruvian andes at 4400 m altitude fig 1a is one of the world s largest polymetallic open pit mines vriens et al 2019a antamina waste rock spans an unusually wide range of lithologies with similarly heterogeneous physicochemical properties st arnault et al 2020 vriens et al 2018 the climate at antamina is monsoonal with a distinct wet season between october april 1200 mm average annual precipitation although average daily temperatures are relatively stable at 5 c year round since 2005 a collaborative research program at the antamina mine has focused on investigating waste rock weathering mechanisms across a range of experimental scales in this work we consider previously published data from four sets of laboratory and field experiments of increasing complexity and dimension fig 1b scale 1 laboratory humidity cell tests 2 kg of waste rock per test run as sequential weekly flushing cycles for 20 to 40 weeks hirsche et al 2017 scale 2 field barrel kinetic tests st arnault et al 2019 vriens et al 2019c 350 kg of waste rock per barrel exposure to field conditions for 10 yrs scale 3 laboratory column experiments blackmore et al 2018a 2018b 170 kg of stacked mixed composition waste rock per column continuously weathered for 1 yr scale 4 instrumented waste rock piles vriens et al 2019a 2019b 20 000 000 kg mixed composition waste rock per pile field monitored continuously for 10 yrs details on these experiments are provided in the works referenced above and for the humidity cell tests in supporting information section s1 2 2 data selection and mass loading calculations our analysis focuses on the end member waste rock types as defined by the antamina site specific classification vriens et al 2019a reactive intrusive and skarn rock which is sulfide rich and or carbonate poor i e net acid generating versus less reactive hornfels and marble which is sulfide poor and or carbonate rich i e net acid neutralizing the following specific experiments with comparable waste rock types were selected for further analyses offering continuous data sets across the four experimental scales for scale 1 humidity cells hc 5 skarn hc 2 intrusive and hc 7 marble for scale 2 the field barrels fb s1 skarn fb i9 intrusive and fb m1 marble for scale 3 an experimental column with untreated sequentially stacked skarn and marble waste rock and finally for scale 4 experimental waste rock piles 1 2 and 3 which contained predominantly marble intrusive and skarn waste rock respectively vriens et al 2019a for the experimental piles of scale 4 we considered sub lysimeters c which captured drainage percolating the most frontal and exposed batch of waste rock in each experimental pile rather than sub lysimeters a and b that were below waste rock in the back and middle tipping phases of the piles see fig 1 in vriens et al 2019a sub lysimeters c were selected because these produced drainage compositions most similar to the basal drainage from the respective entire experimental piles vriens et al 2019a for the analysis and modeling performed in this work the scale 4 experiments can thus be conceived of as representative for 2 m 2 m 10 m high cuboids 100 000 kg of rock embedded within the 36 m 36 m 10 m high experimental piles blackmore et al 2014 for the waste rock in the considered experiments the mineralogical composition is given in table s1 elemental composition in table s2 and particle size distributions in table s3 mineralogy was quantitatively reconciled with elemental composition data blackmore et al 2018b st arnault et al 2019 vriens et al 2019a 2019b 2019c mineral phases constituting 1 wt of the bulk assemblage were not further considered particle size distributions were converted to mineral specific physical surface area estimates as described in supporting information section s2 the climatic record for the antamina field conditions at experimental scales 2 and 4 is given elsewhere vriens et al 2019a the typical monsoonal precipitation pattern was reproduced at laboratory temperatures for scale 3 blackmore et al 2018a 2018b the humidity cells of scale 1 were run as experimental wetting drying cycles supporting information section s1 which was interpreted as pulsed continuous hydrological flow see below for all experimental scales drainage outflow rates were measured at least once per week in the wet season drainage chemistry samples were collected on a weekly to monthly basis for the various experimental scales for this work we consider drainage ph alkalinity and aqueous concentrations of sulfate ca cu fe mo si and zn the column experiment of scale 3 consisted of three vertically stacked waste rocks i e the drainage carried an aggregate signal of all rock types 63 wt intrusive 37 wt marble waste rock blackmore et al 2018b whereas the experiments of scales 1 2 and 4 consisted of more uniform waste rock types for each experiment empirical mass loading rates were computed by multiplying measured drainage rates and aqueous concentrations and normalizing loading rates to the waste rock mass present in each experiment depending on the temporal resolution of sampling and analyses between 25 and 250 weekly loading rates were calculated per experimental scale and waste rock type over the different experimental durations 2 3 interpretation with reactive transport modeling reactive transport simulations were performed in min3p hpc mayer et al 2002 su et al 2017 the general modeling approach is outlined below details on the model s mathematical formulation and process parameterization are provided elsewhere seigneur et al 2020 all systems were conceptualized as open top and bottom one dimensional columns of different length and width with dominant downward gravity driven percolation of infiltrating precipitation reactive transport was simulated consistently across all experiments using the same formulations for transient unsaturated flow i e richards equation van genuchten relations

model formulae in seigneur et al 2020 table 1 summarizes how these various physicochemical processes were parameterized table 2 contains the geometries and quantitative physical waste rock parameters for the antamina experiments considered in the simulations 2 3 1 physical transport hydraulic behavior at each experimental scale i e outflow rates was simulated first transient recharge applied to the top of the model domains was determined from the drainage outflow records that were reconciled with available precipitation infiltration data vriens et al 2019a for scales 2 4 hydraulic parameters such as porosity hydraulic conductivity and van genuchten parameters were adopted from previous experimental analyses and tracer test modeling blackmore et al 2014 2018a javadi 2019 and minimally adjusted to reproduce the observed outflows tables 1 and 2 for scales 3 and 4 available internal water content measurements were used to verify simulated porewater saturation fig s1 gas and aqueous phase diffusion coefficients as well as dispersivity values were adopted from mayer et al 2002 and are in the range of previous waste rock studies lefebvre et al 2001a ouangrawa et al 2009 the simulation node density 1 node every vertical cm was constant and equal across the simulated experiments the lower boundary conditions for flow simulations for scales 2 4 were specified as a negative hydraulic head and top boundary conditions were specified as the recorded rainwater influxes the continuous infiltration rate at scale 1 was fixed by an average darcy velocity of 1 5 10 9 m s 1 applied to the top boundary for scales 2 and 3 initial head conditions corresponded to the bottom boundary conditions as hydraulic retention times were typically 1 month for experimental scale 4 with hydraulic retention times of 1 year blackmore et al 2018a steady state flow was set throughout the simulations using the bulk porewater saturation as initial residual water content to prevent a wetting up stage in all simulations and at all scales oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures at the top boundary were fixed at atmospheric conditions prevalent at antamina i e 4400 m above sea level 2 3 2 geochemical reactions after satisfactory reproduction of drainage outflow dynamics mineral dissolution precipitation reactions were added to the reactive transport simulations considered mineral phases included the primary sulfides pyrite chalcopyrite sphalerite molybdenite galena calcite the silicates quartz albite anorthite biotite muscovite and wollastonite and secondary phases gypsum ferrihydrite gibbsite powellite wulfenite jarosite and select cu zn oxyhydr oxides mineral abundance was experimentally determined for each experiment in earlier studies tables 1 and s1 infiltrating precipitation was assumed to be pure water in chemical equilibrium with the atmospheric gaseous composition the dissolution and or precipitation of each mineral phase was described by a rate model formulation specific for that phase which was used consistently across all rock types and experimental scales more rapid reversible dissolution precipitation reactions for soluble secondary phases were simulated as reversible reactions subject to thermodynamic constraints mayer et al 2002 1 r m k m eff 1 iap k where rm indicates the mineral reaction rate mol m 3 s 1 iap the ion activity

literature complete oxidation and congruent dissolution of all sulfides of silicates was presumed stoichiometric equations for the considered dissolution precipitation reactions and the corresponding adopted rate expressions are discussed elsewhere seigneur et al 2020 and summarized in the supporting information section s3 to identify the scale dependence of the rate coefficients we must distinguish between unresolved processes and heterogeneity that is incorporated by these parameters versus that which is represented explicitly in the model typically kinetic rate expressions explicitly account for geochemical conditions such as ph dissolved oxygen concentrations of other rate controlling aqueous species reactive surface area or temperature but not or implicitly for all other factors e g microbial catalysis to consistently respect such implicit factors in the model formulation in advance all adopted expressions were augmented with an empirical effective rate coefficient k m eff equal to that incorporated in eq 1 for all kinetic expressions we thus define an effective fitting parameter or scaling factor that accounts for heterogeneity or processes not apparent at the deployed model scale e g because their dynamics are at scales too small or too fast to be resolved for example the rate expression for pyrite oxidation by williamson and rimstidt 1994 was included in the form 2 r pyrite k pyrite eff 10 8 19 o 2 aq 0 5 h 0 11 10 6 07 fe 3 0 93 fe 2 0 4 where r is the rate of pyrite oxidation mol m 3 s 1 the term in brackets the experimentally derived surface rate expressions for abiotic ph dependent pyrite oxidation by o2 as well as fe mol m 2 s 1 and keff an augmented effective coefficient used for model calibration in this case with units of m2 m 3 comparing the variety of adopted rate expressions e g eq 1 and eq 2 the units of the calibrated coefficients keff thus vary with the form of kinetic expression seigneur et al 2020 so that keff can be compared for the same reaction between experiments but not between reactions during simulation effective rate coefficients keff included in both the reversible and augmented kinetic expressions from the literature were manually adjusted in an informal trial and error fashion until a satisfactory fit between simulated and observed outflow geochemistry was obtained once calibrated the values of the effective rate coefficients were fixed for the duration of each simulation so that any simulated variation in effective mineral dissolution rates resulted only from variations in explicitly resolved geochemical conditions within the waste rock principally ph o2 and dissolved fe 2 3 3 assessment of scale dependence the great majority of model parameters mineral abundances porosity grain size and physical characteristics were fixed inputs into the models either adopted from direct measurements in earlier studies for each experiment or from appropriate literature values table 1 and table 2 hydraulic parameters were adjusted to reproduce outflow records but subsequently fixed during calibration of the effective rate coefficients k m eff for geochemical reactions as such the effective rate coefficients keff were the only fitted parameters in the drainage geochemistry simulations and therefore they accounted for the physical and chemical heterogeneity that was not modeled in a simulation this heterogeneity generally increased as the scale of the system increased the scale dependence of overall reaction rates was assessed by comparing the magnitudes of the fitted effective rate coefficients for each mineral phase across experimental scales and contrasting this dependence to the variation of unresolved heterogeneity with scale we assess principal heterogeneity controls on kinetics from reactive surface area mineral specific physical surface area estimated from particle size distributions and system temperature by identifying the scale dependent component of the rate parameter post priori i e after simulation we can approach more intrinsic scale independent rate coefficients 3 results and discussion 3 1 scale dependence of mass loading rates drainage ph and sulfate mass loading rates from the investigated waste rock systems varied by up to four units and four orders of magnitude respectively within and between the experimental scales fig 1c d generally more reactive intrusive and skarn rock generated higher sulfate loading rates and lower drainage ph compared to less reactive marble and hornfels rock across all experimental scales however considerable variation in sulfate loading and ph of drainage from otherwise similar waste rock can also be observed over the experimental scales as indicated by the whiskers in fig 1c such variation is likely explained by factors including i the strongly monsoonal climate and thus variable infiltration rates at antamina and the corresponding flushing of rock at the onset of each wet season vriens et al 2019a 2019b ii initial wash out of oxidation products that accumulated in samples prior to the beginning of experiments or iii gradual increases in solute loading rates observed as a result of acidification of long term field experiments over the course of several years vriens et al 2019a in contrast to larger experiments intra experimental variability in sulfate loading rates and drainage ph was comparatively small for scale 1 humidity cells which contained relatively homogeneous waste rock that was weathered for relatively short periods less than 40 weeks with no seasonal effects in addition decreasing sulfate loading rates are also observed across increasing experimental scales for the same rock type and reactivity class i e decreasing with 2 to 3 orders of magnitude fig 1c despite a similar mineralogy and chemical composition tables s1 s2 this inter experimental variability is observed for reactive intrusive and skarn rock as well as less reactive marble the median drainage ph equally appears to decrease with increasing experimental scales most dramatically for the reactive intrusive rock average drainage ph in the larger scale and longer term experiments is up to two ph units lower compared to the smaller shorter term humidity cell experiments fig 1d because acidity production is mostly associated with sulfide oxidation one may expect an inverse correlation between sulfate loads and drainage ph i e higher sulfate release under acidic conditions yet the data reveals lower average ph at larger experimental scales despite decreasing sulfate loadings suggesting that drainage ph across the experimental scales is controlled by additional processes such as acid buffering reactions or secondary mineral precipitation overall the decreasing variability in empirical sulfate loading rates as indicated by the spread of the distributions whiskers in fig 1c appears weakly proportional to the experimental dimensions alone fig 1b we next use reactive transport simulations as a quantitative tool to further investigate this scale dependence 3 2 reactive transport simulations 3 2 1 simulation of cumulative flow simulated long term drainage rates at all experimental scales agreed quantitatively with the recorded cumulative drainage volumes fig 2 artificial flow for scale 1 for scales 3 and 4 the measured variability of volumetric water contents through time were also well captured by the simulations fig s1 the seasonal variation in outflow characteristic of the antamina mine site was well reproduced for experimental scales 2 and 3 but less so for scale 4 fig 2 this suggests that water residence times in scale 4 1 year compare to 1 month for scales 2 and 3 were long enough to significantly disperse annual infiltration fronts blackmore et al 2014 2018a javadi 2019 the reproduction of seasonal flow variability at smaller scales illustrates the applicability of a single domain uniform flow description and aligns with tracer test results that have shown that matrix flow dominates the hydrological transport at smaller scales preferential flow constitutes 0 5 of flow through field barrels and laboratory columns blackmore et al 2014 2018a the poorer fit for scale 4 reflects the increased flow non uniformity and contribution of preferential flow paths in the more heterogeneous and larger waste rock piles i e a faster response and less flow during the dry season dual domain formulations have been proposed to capture such flow variability in experimental piles at antamina blackmore et al 2018a but they require parameters that are challenging to experimentally constrain for well graded waste rock with poorly defined contrasts in mass transport moreover in preferential flow domains the relative mineral surface areas are smaller larger particles the travel times faster so that the water mineral contact is less than in the matrix accordingly a single domain matrix flow formulation is able to capture flow in the fine fraction that dominates the drainage chemistry signature therefore we consider our calibrated single domain bulk hydraulic formulation satisfactory for the purpose of this study describing the long term drainage composition 3 2 2 simulation of drainage chemistry long term dynamics observed across the various investigated experiments were very dissimilar for the studied waste rock types fig 3 marble rock generally generated stable circumneutral high alkalinity drainage with comparably low concentrations of sulfate ca cu and zn skarn rock equally produced circumneutral drainage over the duration of the experiments but with generally higher sulfate and metal loads in contrast significant drainage acidification was observed in long term experiments with intrusive waste rock scales 2 and 4 drainage ph decreases down to ph 3 over the course of several years in fb i9 and pile 2c with consequential orders of magnitude increases in metal loads while experimental scales 1 and 3 were run for 1 year and may reflect initial flush conditions strong cyclical variation in drainage chemistry was observed in experiments that were run across yearly seasons scales 2 and 4 in all waste rock types fig 3 a detailed description of the short and long term drainage chemistry trends in these experiments as well as the processes underlying these dynamics is provided elsewhere vriens et al 2019a seigneur et al 2020 for the purpose of our analyses it suffices to summarize that at all experimental scales and across all investigated waste rock types the model simulations were able to quantitatively reproduce the observed drainage chemistry dynamics fig 3 seasonal variability in drainage quality at scales 2 and 4 i e over an order of magnitude in sulfate and metals fig 3 is attributable mostly to variation in infiltrating precipitation whereas the hydraulics of scale 2 were accurately captured by the adopted uniform flow formulation fig 2 those of scale 4 were dampened by longer residence times and a lower fraction of the domain actively contributing to flow which directly translated to the muted seasonal drainage chemistry dynamics observed for scale 4 overall the obtained match between measured and simulated drainage chemistries suggests that the adopted process based model formulation is capable of capturing coupled reactive transport dynamics across a wide range of scales and heterogeneity e g drainage ph from 2 to 10 at each scale for each experiment simulated all model parameters except the adopted geochemical effective rate coefficients keff were pre specified and not adjusted to improve the match between simulated and measured drainage chemistry table 1 it is re iterated that these mineral dissolution precipitation rate coefficients were determined only after flow parameters had been calibrated and subsequently kept constant while certainly not all potentially relevant processes have been explicitly represented in the deployed model formulation conceptually case specific fitting is required to account for effects of such unrepresented heterogeneity and processes beckie 1998 including porosity and permeability changes due to mineral precipitation st arnault et al 2020 gas advection amos et al 2009 vriens et al 2018 microbial catalysis blackmore et al 2018b chemical adsorption vriens et al 2019c and surface passivation st arnault et al 2019 e g shrinking core type behavior wilson et al 2018 yet that our simulations enabled a reasonable agreement of the long term trends only by adjusting the kinetic reaction rate parameters suggests that we have represented the most important processes over the range of scales considered we further contextualize the fitted model parameters effective rate coefficients below 3 3 weathering rates and calibrated rate coefficients simulated reaction rates r m and calibrated effective rate coefficients keff across the various experimental scales are provided for select sulfide and silicate phases in table s4 generally total sulfide oxidation rates dominated by pyrite oxidation were highest for intrusive material reaching 6 10 3 3 10 2 2 10 1 and 4 10 1 mol m 3 waste rock day 1 for the most reactive waste rock in scales 1 4 respectively but were orders of magnitude lower in analogue similarly sized experiments with less reactive waste rock that produced neutral drainage in line with lower sulfide abundance sulfide oxidation rates simulated for experiments with variable waste rock types were often not directly proportional to sulfide abundance or apparent from the drainage composition fig 3 mainly because acid buffering mineral dissolution reactions and secondary mineral precipitation reactions occurred simultaneously but at different rates seigneur et al 2020 under neutral drainage conditions simulated sulfide oxidation and acid neutralization reactions occurred stoichiometrically at rates between 10 3 and 10 6 mol m 3 waste rock day 1 these simulated rates quantitatively align with bulk weathering rates at antamina deduced from mass loading rates temperature profiles or pore gas measurements i e converted to molar units 10 4 and 10 7 mol s m 3 waste rock day 1 vriens et al 2019a 2018 further these rates fall within the broad range of weathering rates observed at other mine sites alakangas et al 2010 harries and ritchie 1981 lefebvre et al 2001b malmström et al 2000 sracek et al 2006 strömberg and banwart 1999 although substantial variability in local climate and site specific waste rock properties limits further interpretation more insightful is to compare calibrated effective rate coefficients keff rather than overall rates r m calibrated effective rate coefficients not only varied across waste rock type i e reflective of the mineralogical composition of the waste rock but also for the same waste rock types across experimental scales table s4 the calibrated effective rate coefficients for most sulfide oxidation and silicate dissolution reactions decreased consistently in each waste rock type by up to three orders of magnitude as the experimental scale increased in contrast to the empirical scale dependence observed from the mass loading analysis above fig 1 this comparison of calibrated rate coefficients rather than rates makes the scale dependence formally attributable to geochemical reactivity alone the calibration of our consistent reactive transport formulation yielded plausible geochemical parameter values across different waste rock types using mostly independently and experimentally measured parameters at all scales thereby reducing the uncertainty associated with the non uniqueness of this particular set of calibrated parameters as the calibrated effective rate coefficients for pyrite oxidation and silicate weathering decreased with similar magnitude between one rock type and another table s4 the factors representing geochemical reactivity i e mineral surface area temperature or unresolved processes discussed below appear to underlie the scale dependence for all these mineral phases consistently while such factors representing geochemical reactivity factors may be identified and isolated by controlled experimentation in a laboratory setting in order to characterize and confirm their relative impact on mineral reactivity we instead use a process based accounting of the remaining unresolved processes and heterogeneity represented by the calibrated rate coefficients in the next section 3 4 resolving scale dependence in geochemical rates in the following examination of the calibrated rate coefficients we focus on pyrite which is abundant in all investigated waste rock types and whose dissolution kinetics have been well described in the literature effects of temperature and mineral surface area table 3 are considered because i temperature and particle size distribution data is available from the antamina research program to quantitatively constrain these effects and ii their contributions to scale dependence observed from the calibrated effective rate coefficients keff can be isolated via 3 k m eff a t s m θ m int where at reflects a temperature correction factor dimensionless sm is the specific surface area of a mineral in the bulk waste rock m2 mineral surface m 3 waste rock and θint represents a more intrinsic scaling coefficient dimensionless that aggregates all other processes not explicitly incorporated in the model formulation or quantifiable from available experimental data the calibrated rate coefficient keff has units dependent on the utilized rate expression so that measured waste rock density kg m 3 and porosity m3 m 3 were used to obtain consistent dimensionless units for θint across kinetically described sulfide and silicate phases table s4 3 4 1 effect of temperature variations measured temperature variation between the laboratory and field experiments was approximately 15 c table 3 the effect of this temperature difference on effective rate coefficients can be described by arrhenius equation 4 a t e e a r 1 t 1 t ref where at dimensionless describes the arrhenius correction to the rate coefficient ea kj mol 1 is the activation energy for the considered oxidation reaction t and tref k are the considered and reference temperatures respectively and r the universal gas constant 8 31 j mol 1 k 1 with an activation energy of approximately 39 to 88 kj mol 1 for fe iii and o2 mediated pyrite oxidation reactions nicholson et al 1988 williamson and rimstidt 1994 the correction factor at for pyrite oxidation at 20 c versus 5 c is at most a factor 5 even when considering additional minor influence of temperature on physical transport properties such as fluid or gas density and viscosity this temperature variation alone does not suffice to explain the orders of magnitude difference in calibrated effective rate coefficients table 3 3 4 2 effect of reactive surface area estimated mineral surface areas for the investigated waste rock types decreased by up to two orders of magnitude with increasing experimental scales largely due to a reduced contribution of the fine fraction d10 table 3 in the adopted model formulation reaction rates r were explicitly dependent on bulk mineral abundance but not on their reactive mineral surface area which was implicit in the calibration factor keff seigneur et al 2020 in fact the units of the calibrated effective rate coefficient keff for pyrite m2 m 3 already indicate a surface area component in the fitted effective rate coefficients the relationship between calibrated effective rate coefficients keff and estimated pyrite surface area table 3 demonstrates that decreases in surface area may explain most of the scale dependence observed in geochemical rates for instance the abundance of pyrite in intrusive waste rock was comparable across the experimental scales 2 1 wt 3 7 wt 2 7 wt and 2 7 wt in experimental scales 1 4 respectively so that the orders of magnitude lower bulk reactivity in these experiments fig 1 table 3 is attributed to an increased average particle size and reduced fine fraction i e relatively lower pyrite surface area in larger experiments similar proportionality between mineral surface area and fitted effective rate coefficients keff is observed for other minerals table s4 in line with the general notion that reactive surface area strongly dictates geochemical weathering rates using eq 3 and the correction factors summarized in table 3 more intrinsic scaling coefficients were back calculated for pyrite oxidation rightmost column in table 3 it can be seen that calibrated effective rate coefficients differed over three orders of magnitude across scales but that post priori accounting for effects of temperature and surface area reduced the variation in the intrinsic scaling coefficients θint to less than an order of magnitude for each waste rock type this improved agreement across scales and waste rock types reflects the fact that more system heterogeneity has been resolved 3 4 3 remaining scale discrepancy firstly reactive mineral surface area has been assumed constant in the adopted approach but is known to be variable under evolving drainage conditions e g due to progressing secondary mineral precipitation and surface area passivation petrographic and mineralogical analyses of pristine and weathered antamina waste rock have shown that passivation of sulfide minerals may reduce the exposed surface area of weathered finer grained waste rock with up to 60 st arnault et al 2020 2019 while mineralogical data are typically collected from small and sieved samples they cannot be extrapolated onto larger experiments or generalized to explain scale dependence yet these estimates suggest that at least some of the residual scale dependence in θint i e fractions but not orders of magnitude may be attributed to mineral surface passivation further investigation of the secondary mineral assemblage across scales e g using automated mineralogy and imaging techniques mla qemscan parbhakar fox et al 2011 is warranted when rates are to be expressed as a function of dynamic surface area secondly mineral dissolution rates are strongly coupled to hydraulic transport in the waste rock as solute exchange across the mineral water interface is facilitated by the contact time with percolating drainage for instance finer grained waste rock with elevated relative surface areas may exhibit higher reactivity but simultaneously experiences lower flow velocities due to increased capillary retention malmström et al 2000 of the considered experiments porewater saturation was lower in experimental piles scale 4 than in the laboratory column scale 3 fig s1 and liquid loads ratio of total recharge over total waste rock mass were about one order of magnitude lower in scale 4 than in scale 1 500 to 30 ml water per kg waste rock respectively in other words the experiments were conducted such that smaller experiments had relatively more water introduced to them such discrepancy has previously been invoked to attribute scale dependence of apparent weathering rates to average experimental hydraulics e g water liquid ratios plante et al 2014 but in this work uniform flow parameters had been fitted to drainage rates prior to and independently of geochemical rate parameters as acknowledged above preferential flow may become relevant at larger experimental scales so that unresolved non uniform flow behavior at smaller scales may explain some of the remaining scale dependence in θint i e analogous to a correction factor for the mobile immobile water fraction malmström et al 2000 this hypothesis can be further investigated for instance by i additional multi scale experimentation with consistent relative flushing rates ii direct in situ monitoring of moisture distributions in waste rock piles dimech et al 2019 poisson et al 2009 or iii the application of discretized hydraulic model domains that exhibit distinct geochemical reactivity blackmore et al 2018a finally the minor variation in back calculated intrinsic scaling coefficients θint as shown in table 3 implies a certain level of remaining empiricism in the adopted model a fully resolved mechanistic model would yield constant scaling coefficients truly intrinsic rather than effective that apply at any scale and waste rock type certainly additional unresolved factors such as microbial catalysis or adsorption may have contributed the small remaining scale discrepancy but practical techniques to quantify such processes at the concerned scales are currently lacking in fact real world dynamics can never be fully represented at all scales simultaneously and all models of physical systems must contain model dependent empirical parameters beckie 1996 3 5 predictive capability fundamentally when a narrow range of values for the more intrinsic scaling coefficient θint can be obtained for different waste rock types and experimental scales that suggests that a relatively independent θint may be applied in predictive models for the waste rock types and scales examined albeit never fully exhaustive incremental improvement to express θint as a function of resolved i e measured parameters can enhance the predictive capability of a reactive transport model as a proof of concept we performed a predictive drainage chemistry simulation by extrapolating intrinsic scaling coefficients obtained for experimental scales 1 3 onto a simulation for scale 4 experimental pile 2 for these simulations intrinsic scaling coefficients were calculated for the dissolution reactions of other sulfide and silicate minerals similarly to what was done for pyrite above table s5 subsequently we isolated the minimum average and maximum implicit rate coefficients θint for sulfide and silicate dissolution reactions from the scale 1 3 experiments with similar intrusive waste rock as in experimental pile 2 and reverse engineered effective rate coefficients keff eq 3 that were plugged into the corresponding reaction rate equations seigneur et al 2020 for three predictive simulations i e minimum average and maximum geochemical reactivities for experimental pile 2c respectively all other bulk hydraulic and geochemical parameters in these simulations were otherwise similar and adopted from direct measurements table 1 and table 2 it can be seen from fig 4 that the resulting predicted range of drainage qualities for experimental pile 2c are close to what was observed experimentally adoption of the average intrinsic scaling coefficients θint for sulfide and silicate dissolution reactions yielded a prediction that accurately captured both the long term drainage evolution and perhaps more important for mine wastewater management the timing of drainage quality deterioration best fit scenario in fig 4 however the spread in predicted drainage composition was considerable when minimum and maximum scaling coefficients were used for instance drainage acidification occurred up to 4 years earlier when maximum rather than minimum reactivities i e fastest versus slowest sulfide oxidation rates were used it is thus recommended that predictive simulations of geochemical reactivity when based on back calculation of more intrinsic scaling coefficients are calibrated across scales yet overall these predictive simulations demonstrate long term drainage dynamics may be predicted from mechanistic upscaling of readily available physicochemical parameters collected at smaller scale experiments 4 conclusions synthesis of experimental results from a long term research program at the antamina mine revealed that drainage mass loadings from larger and longer term experiments were less than from smaller shorter experiments with similar waste rock a process based reactive transport model could quantitatively reproduce drainage quantity and quality trends measured in laboratory and field experiments spanning from a 1 kg laboratory scale to 100 000 kg field scale piles during a decade of weathering upon consideration of temperature and particle size effects more intrinsic scaling coefficients determined from different experiments matched each other within an order of magnitude while we accounted for most scale dependence in geochemical reactions over dimensions from 10 cm to 11 m the systems examined do not extend to the scales encountered in full scale piles at mine sites i e hundreds of meters fig 1b gas and heat transport dynamics become particularly relevant in larger scale piles when reaction rates are high and gas transport flow paths are long birkham et al 2003 such as at the questa in new mexico wels et al 2003 mine doyon in quebec lefebvre et al 2001a and rum jungle in australia harries and ritchie 1981 it is similarly expected that preferential flow is more prevalent at larger scales it remains to be tested whether a sufficiently accurate representation of such mass and heat transport mechanisms can account for scale dependence in larger waste rock piles in conclusion it is demonstrated that scale dependence of reaction rate parameters can be source tracked when the processes are properly accounted for and consistently parameterized at each scale of experimentation mechanistic models that explicitly account for these processes and are parameterized experimentally may thus be used to predict waste rock weathering

1503,hydrogeochemical models for the prediction of drainage quality from full scale mine waste rock piles are often parameterized using data from small scale laboratory or field experiments of short duration yet many model parameters and processes e g sulfide oxidation rates vary strongly with the spatiotemporal dimensions of the experiment the upscaling of prediction models remains a critical challenge for mine waste management worldwide here we investigate scale dependence in laboratory and field experiments that spanned orders of magnitude in size i e 2 kg to 100 000 kg at the antamina mine in peru normalized drainage mass loading rates systematically decreased with increasing scale irrespective of waste rock type a process based reactive transport model was used to simulate observed rates and reproduce the geochemical composition of drainage across scales long term trends in drainage quality could be quantitatively reproduced when the model was parameterized with mostly scale and experiment specific measured bulk properties or literature values leaving geochemical rate coefficients the sole calibrated model parameters analysis of these fitted parameters revealed that the scale dependence of geochemical rates was largely explained by reactive mineral surface area this work demonstrates that practical drainage quality predictions for full scale waste rock piles can be established from readily available bulk parameters determined at multiple scales keywords scale dependence mine waste rock weathering rates drainage prediction reactive transport modeling 1 introduction sustainable waste rock management is crucial for mining operations around the world hudson edwards and dold 2015 weathering of exposed waste materials can produce low quality acidic and or metal laden drainage that can have detrimental impacts on downstream environments and requires costly treatment amos et al 2015 to manage these potential environmental risks and costs the quantity and quality of drainage from waste materials needs to be predicted long beyond mine closure such prediction requires understanding of the hydrogeochemical processes that underlie drainage generation on industry relevant spatiotemporal scales amos et al 2015 blowes et al 2003 unfortunately the forecasting of waste rock drainage quality on real world spatiotemporal scales remains challenging to date due to site specificity in the generated waste rock and local weathering conditions physicochemical heterogeneity in large waste rock systems and the intricate non linear coupling between chemical kinetics and mass and heat transfer processes jung and navarre sitchler 2018 lahmira et al 2017 lefebvre et al 2001a molson et al 2012 practical technical frameworks to support waste rock management and drainage quality predictions exist typically combining classic static and kinetic testing procedures field scale experiments and geochemical equilibrium or reactive transport models dold 2017 international network for acid prevention inap 2003 li et al 2014 parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 price 2009 seigneur et al 2019 the relatively small scale laboratory static and kinetic tests that form the basis of most prediction efforts often oversimplify variable weathering conditions in the environment and selection of representative waste rock samples for testing is challenging in heterogeneous geological settings parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 price 2009 apparent reaction rate parameters typically depend upon the scale of the experiment with slower rates associated with larger scales malmström et al 2000 it is therefore essential to understand the scale dependence of model parameters before they can be used in drainage predictions for real world large scale waste rock piles scale dependence of parameter values is a consequence of a fundamental limitation of all models parameters can never explicitly describe a real world system on all scales beckie 1996 whereas the real world exists on all scales models divide the real world into dynamics that are explicitly resolved and smaller unresolved dynamics that are parameterized practical larger scale models do not need to resolve smaller scale dynamics but they must account for the effect of unresolved dynamics beckie 1998 for example geochemical models may use a macroscale representation of average molecular dynamics to define equilibrium constants instead of explicitly resolving molecules and their individual interactions in this framework equilibrium constants can be understood as model parameters that account for the large scale effects of molecular scale dynamics parameters are sometimes called effective because they represent the effects of unresolved heterogeneity and sometimes multiple processes on observed larger scale dynamics beckie 1998 the scale of a model determines the burden placed upon model parameters the fewer dynamics that are explicitly resolved the more they must be accounted for by model parameters model parameters are also model dependent the appropriate parameter value is the one that matches model output most closely with observation and thus defined by the model used to determine them reaction rate parameters determined from a kinetic model that explicitly accounts for effects of ph microbiology and mineral heterogeneity will differ from parameters determined with a model that does not malmström et al 2000 it is thus difficult to compare parameters from models that explicitly resolve some processes with others that do not predictive modeling of waste rock drainage is particularly challenging because of the physical and geochemical heterogeneity of mine waste and the multiple coupled processes that affect drainage quantity and quality the practical challenge is to utilize parameters determined from smaller scale relatively homogeneous shorter term laboratory tests in predictive models for more heterogeneous larger scale i e hundreds of meters tall and wide waste rock piles malmström et al 2000 physicochemical properties such as hydraulic conductivity or reactive surface area determined from unrepresentative or small sample sizes and broad particle size distributions ganor et al 2007 malmström et al 2000 plante et al 2014 fail to represent unresolved geochemical and physical transport phenomena and heterogeneity that can be relevant at larger scales including heat and gas transport limitations preferential flow and effects of secondary mineral precipitation on drainage chemistry and porosity birkham et al 2003 lahmira et al 2017 seigneur et al 2019 furthermore an exhaustive spatiotemporal characterization of physicochemical heterogeneity cannot be achieved for full size waste rock storage systems or any physical system dooge 1986 even in the big data era and results are often required at the permitting stage before the piles are constructed in the mine waste context so called scaling factors have been proposed to reconcile differences in parameter values on different scales malmström et al 2000 plante et al 2014 such scaling factors may be considered empirical parameter corrections to account for unresolved variability in bulk averaged physicochemical properties or flow non uniformity the few studies that have investigated scaling phenomena in waste rock include experiments conducted at the aitik malmström et al 2000 strömberg and banwart 1999 tio plante et al 2014 and diavik wilson et al 2018 mines these studies found that i drainage mass loadings and concentrations decrease as the experimental scale increases and ii these differences are related to heterogeneity in particle size temperature hydrological flow drainage ph or a combination thereof malmström et al 2000 plante et al 2014 wilson et al 2018 all the works above considered relatively uniform waste rock types stored under arctic weathering conditions multiple approaches have been used to describe scale dependence of model specific parameters stemming from site specific availability and consistency of data across scales for instance effects of non uniform preferential flow have either been lumped into single hydrological correction factors based on tracer tests malmström et al 2000 integrated into bulk experimental liquid solid ratios plante et al 2014 or reproduced by dual domain models blackmore et al 2018a as a result scaling factors remain poorly verified across sites to date and their use in drainage quality prediction models remains based on limited mechanistic evidence to this end we here exploit previously published hydrogeochemical data from a long term multiscale research program at the antamina mine in peru to study scale dependence in waste rock weathering processes to minimize the confounding influence of model dependence we interpret experiments conducted at multiple scales consistently using a same process based reactive transport model described in seigneur et al 2020 we focus our analysis on the scale dependence of reaction rate parameters that describe kinetic mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions the results lay out a framework to systematically interpret

rock types were selected for further analyses offering continuous data sets across the four experimental scales for scale 1 humidity cells hc 5 skarn hc 2 intrusive and hc 7 marble for scale 2 the field barrels fb s1 skarn fb i9 intrusive and fb m1 marble for scale 3 an experimental column with untreated sequentially stacked skarn and marble waste rock and finally for scale 4 experimental waste rock piles 1 2 and 3 which contained predominantly marble intrusive and skarn waste rock respectively vriens et al 2019a for the experimental piles of scale 4 we considered sub lysimeters c which captured drainage percolating the most frontal and exposed batch of waste rock in each experimental pile rather than sub lysimeters a and b that were below waste rock in the back and middle tipping phases of the piles see fig 1 in vriens et al 2019a sub lysimeters c were selected because these produced drainage compositions most similar to the basal drainage from the respective entire experimental piles vriens et al 2019a for the analysis and modeling performed in this work the scale 4 experiments can thus be conceived of as representative for 2 m 2 m 10 m high cuboids 100 000 kg of rock embedded within the 36 m 36 m 10 m high experimental piles blackmore et al 2014 for the waste rock in the considered experiments the mineralogical composition is given in table s1 elemental composition in table s2 and particle size distributions in table s3 mineralogy was quantitatively reconciled with elemental composition data blackmore et al 2018b st arnault et al 2019 vriens et al 2019a 2019b 2019c mineral phases constituting 1 wt of the bulk assemblage were not further considered particle size distributions were converted to mineral specific physical surface area estimates as described in supporting information section s2 the climatic record for the antamina field conditions at experimental scales 2 and 4 is given elsewhere vriens et al 2019a the typical monsoonal precipitation pattern was reproduced at laboratory temperatures for scale 3 blackmore et al 2018a 2018b the humidity cells of scale 1 were run as experimental wetting drying cycles supporting information section s1 which was interpreted as pulsed continuous hydrological flow see below for all experimental scales drainage outflow rates were measured at least once per week in the wet season drainage chemistry samples were collected on a weekly to monthly basis for the various experimental scales for this work we consider drainage ph alkalinity and aqueous concentrations of sulfate ca cu fe mo si and zn the column experiment of scale 3 consisted of three vertically stacked waste rocks i e the drainage carried an aggregate signal of all rock types 63 wt intrusive 37 wt marble waste rock blackmore et al 2018b whereas the experiments of scales 1 2 and 4 consisted of more uniform waste rock types for each experiment empirical mass loading rates were computed by multiplying measured drainage rates and aqueous concentrations and normalizing loading rates to the waste rock mass present in each experiment depending on the temporal resolution of sampling and analyses between 25 and 250 weekly loading rates were calculated per experimental scale and waste rock type over the different experimental durations 2 3 interpretation with reactive transport modeling reactive transport simulations were performed in min3p hpc mayer et al 2002 su et al 2017 the general modeling approach is outlined below details on the model s mathematical formulation and process parameterization are provided elsewhere seigneur et al 2020 all systems were conceptualized as open top and bottom one dimensional columns of different length and width with dominant downward gravity driven percolation of infiltrating precipitation reactive transport was simulated consistently across all experiments using the same formulations for transient unsaturated flow i e richards equation van genuchten relations diffusive advective transport of aqueous species gas diffusion and gas liquid partitioning through the porous waste rock i e henry s law in addition to mineral precipitation and dissolution reactions model formulae in seigneur et al 2020 table 1 summarizes how these various physicochemical processes were parameterized table 2 contains the geometries and quantitative physical waste rock parameters for the antamina experiments considered in the simulations 2 3 1 physical transport hydraulic behavior at each experimental scale i e outflow rates was simulated first transient recharge applied to the top of the model domains was determined from the drainage outflow records that were reconciled with available precipitation infiltration data vriens et al 2019a for scales 2 4 hydraulic parameters such as porosity hydraulic conductivity and van genuchten parameters were adopted from previous experimental analyses and tracer test modeling blackmore et al 2014 2018a javadi 2019 and minimally adjusted to reproduce the observed outflows tables 1 and 2 for scales 3 and 4 available internal water content measurements were used to verify simulated porewater saturation fig s1 gas and aqueous phase diffusion coefficients as well as dispersivity values were adopted from mayer et al 2002 and are in the range of previous waste rock studies lefebvre et al 2001a ouangrawa et al 2009 the simulation node density 1 node every vertical cm was constant and equal across the simulated experiments the lower boundary conditions for flow simulations for scales 2 4 were specified as a negative hydraulic head and top boundary conditions were specified as the recorded rainwater influxes the continuous infiltration rate at scale 1 was fixed by an average darcy velocity of 1 5 10 9 m s 1 applied to the top boundary for scales 2 and 3 initial head conditions corresponded to the bottom boundary conditions as hydraulic retention times were typically 1 month for experimental scale 4 with hydraulic retention times of 1 year blackmore et al 2018a steady state flow was set throughout the simulations using the bulk porewater saturation as initial residual water content to prevent a wetting up stage in all simulations and at all scales oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures at the top boundary were fixed at atmospheric conditions prevalent at antamina i e 4400 m above sea level 2 3 2 geochemical reactions after satisfactory reproduction of drainage outflow dynamics mineral dissolution precipitation reactions were added to the reactive transport simulations considered mineral phases included the primary sulfides pyrite chalcopyrite sphalerite molybdenite galena calcite the silicates quartz albite anorthite biotite muscovite and wollastonite and secondary phases gypsum ferrihydrite gibbsite powellite wulfenite jarosite and select cu zn oxyhydr oxides mineral abundance was experimentally determined for each experiment in earlier studies tables 1 and s1 infiltrating precipitation was assumed to be pure water in chemical equilibrium with the atmospheric gaseous composition the dissolution and or precipitation of each mineral phase was described by a rate model formulation specific for that phase which was used consistently across all rock types and experimental scales more rapid reversible dissolution precipitation reactions for soluble secondary phases were simulated as reversible reactions subject to thermodynamic constraints mayer et al 2002 1 r m k m eff 1 iap k where rm indicates the mineral reaction rate mol m 3 s 1 iap the ion activity product k the solubility product from the minteq v4 database and keff an effective empirical rate coefficient mol m 3 s 1 that accounts for all other implicit geochemical conditions e g surface area temperature mineral heterogeneity see below in contrast relatively slow irreversible dissolution reactions for primary sulfides and silicates were incorporated using rate expressions adopted from the literature complete oxidation and congruent dissolution of all sulfides of silicates was presumed stoichiometric equations for the considered dissolution precipitation reactions and the corresponding adopted rate expressions are discussed elsewhere seigneur et al 2020 and summarized in the supporting information section s3 to identify the scale dependence of the rate coefficients we must distinguish between unresolved processes and heterogeneity that is incorporated by these parameters versus that which is represented explicitly in the model typically kinetic rate expressions explicitly account for geochemical conditions such as ph dissolved oxygen concentrations of other rate controlling aqueous species reactive surface area or temperature but not or implicitly for all other factors e g microbial catalysis to consistently respect such implicit factors in the model formulation in advance all adopted expressions were augmented with an empirical effective rate coefficient k m eff equal to that incorporated in eq 1 for all kinetic expressions we thus define an effective fitting parameter or scaling factor that accounts for heterogeneity or processes not apparent at the deployed model scale e g because their dynamics are at scales too small or too fast to be resolved for example the rate expression for pyrite oxidation by williamson and rimstidt 1994 was included in the form 2 r pyrite k pyrite eff 10 8 19 o 2 aq 0 5 h 0 11 10 6 07 fe 3 0 93 fe 2 0 4 where r is the rate of pyrite oxidation mol m 3 s 1 the term in brackets the experimentally derived surface rate expressions for abiotic ph dependent pyrite oxidation by o2 as well as fe mol m 2 s 1 and keff an augmented effective coefficient used for model calibration in this case with units of m2 m 3 comparing the variety of adopted rate expressions e g eq 1 and eq 2 the units of the calibrated coefficients keff thus vary with the form of kinetic expression seigneur et al 2020 so that keff can be compared for the same reaction between experiments but not between reactions during simulation effective rate coefficients keff included in both the reversible and augmented kinetic expressions from the literature were manually adjusted in an informal trial and error fashion until a satisfactory fit between simulated and observed outflow geochemistry was obtained once calibrated the values of the effective rate coefficients were fixed for the duration of each simulation so that any simulated variation in effective mineral dissolution rates resulted only from variations in explicitly resolved geochemical conditions within the waste rock principally ph o2 and dissolved fe 2 3 3 assessment of scale dependence the great majority of model parameters mineral abundances porosity grain size and physical characteristics were fixed inputs into the models either adopted from direct measurements in earlier studies for each experiment or from appropriate literature values table 1 and table 2 hydraulic parameters were adjusted to reproduce outflow records but subsequently fixed during calibration of the effective rate coefficients k m eff for geochemical reactions as such the effective rate coefficients keff were the only fitted parameters in the drainage geochemistry simulations and therefore they accounted for the physical and chemical heterogeneity that was not modeled in a simulation this heterogeneity generally increased as the scale of the system increased the scale dependence of overall reaction rates was assessed by comparing the magnitudes of the fitted effective rate coefficients for each mineral phase across experimental scales and contrasting this dependence to the variation of unresolved heterogeneity with scale we assess principal heterogeneity controls on kinetics from reactive surface area mineral specific physical surface area estimated from particle size distributions and system temperature by identifying the scale dependent component of the rate parameter post priori i e after simulation we can approach more intrinsic scale independent rate coefficients 3 results and discussion 3 1 scale dependence of mass loading rates drainage ph and sulfate mass loading rates from the investigated waste rock systems varied by up to four units and four orders of magnitude respectively within and between the experimental scales fig 1c d generally more reactive intrusive and skarn rock generated higher sulfate loading rates and lower drainage ph compared to less reactive marble and hornfels rock across all experimental scales however considerable variation in sulfate loading and ph of drainage from otherwise similar waste rock can also be observed over the experimental scales as indicated by the whiskers in fig 1c such variation is likely explained by factors including i the strongly monsoonal climate and thus variable infiltration rates at antamina and the corresponding flushing of rock at the onset of each wet season vriens et al 2019a 2019b ii initial wash out of oxidation products that accumulated in samples prior to the beginning of experiments or iii gradual increases in solute loading rates observed as a result of acidification of long term field experiments over the course of several years vriens et al 2019a in contrast to larger experiments intra experimental variability in sulfate loading rates and drainage ph was comparatively small for scale 1 humidity cells which contained relatively homogeneous waste rock that was weathered for relatively short periods less than 40 weeks with no seasonal effects in addition decreasing sulfate loading rates are also observed across increasing experimental scales for the same rock type and reactivity class i e decreasing with 2 to 3 orders of magnitude fig 1c despite a similar mineralogy and chemical composition tables s1 s2 this inter experimental variability is observed for reactive intrusive and skarn rock as well as less reactive marble the median drainage ph equally appears to decrease with increasing experimental scales most dramatically for the reactive intrusive rock average drainage ph in the larger scale and longer term experiments is up to two ph units lower compared to the smaller shorter term humidity cell experiments fig 1d because acidity production is mostly associated with sulfide oxidation one may expect an inverse correlation between sulfate loads and drainage ph i e higher sulfate release under acidic conditions yet the data reveals lower average ph at larger experimental scales despite decreasing sulfate loadings suggesting that drainage ph across the experimental scales is controlled by additional processes such as acid buffering reactions or secondary mineral precipitation overall the decreasing variability in empirical sulfate loading rates as indicated by the spread of the distributions whiskers in fig 1c appears weakly proportional to the experimental dimensions alone fig 1b we next use reactive transport simulations as a quantitative tool to further investigate this scale dependence 3 2 reactive transport simulations 3 2 1 simulation of cumulative flow simulated long term drainage rates at all experimental scales agreed quantitatively with the recorded cumulative drainage volumes fig 2 artificial flow for scale 1 for scales 3 and 4 the measured variability of volumetric water contents through time were also well captured by the simulations fig s1 the seasonal variation in outflow characteristic of the antamina mine site was well reproduced for experimental scales 2 and 3 but less so for scale 4 fig 2 this suggests that water residence times in scale 4 1 year compare to 1 month for scales 2 and 3 were long enough to significantly disperse annual infiltration fronts blackmore et al 2014 2018a javadi 2019 the reproduction of seasonal flow variability at smaller scales illustrates the applicability of a single domain uniform flow description and aligns with tracer test results that have shown that matrix flow dominates the hydrological transport at smaller scales preferential flow constitutes 0 5 of flow through field barrels and laboratory columns blackmore et al 2014 2018a the poorer fit for scale 4 reflects the increased flow non uniformity and contribution of preferential flow paths in the more heterogeneous and larger waste rock piles i e a faster response and less flow during the dry season dual domain formulations have been proposed to capture such flow variability in experimental piles at antamina blackmore et al 2018a but they require parameters that are challenging to experimentally constrain for well graded waste rock with poorly defined contrasts in mass transport moreover in preferential flow domains the relative mineral surface areas are smaller larger particles the travel times faster so that the water mineral contact is less than in the matrix accordingly a single domain matrix flow formulation is able to capture flow in the fine fraction that dominates the drainage chemistry signature therefore we consider our calibrated single domain bulk hydraulic formulation satisfactory for the purpose of this study describing the long term drainage composition 3 2 2 simulation of drainage chemistry long term dynamics observed across the various investigated experiments were very dissimilar for the studied waste rock types fig 3 marble rock generally generated stable circumneutral high alkalinity drainage with comparably low concentrations of sulfate ca cu and zn skarn rock equally produced circumneutral drainage over the duration of the experiments but with generally higher sulfate and metal loads in contrast significant drainage acidification was observed in long term experiments with intrusive waste rock scales 2 and 4 drainage ph decreases down to ph 3 over the course of several years in fb i9 and pile 2c with consequential orders of magnitude increases in metal loads while experimental scales 1 and 3 were run for 1 year and may reflect initial flush conditions strong cyclical variation in drainage chemistry was observed in experiments that were run across yearly seasons scales 2 and 4 in all waste rock types fig 3 a detailed description of the short and long term drainage chemistry trends in these experiments as well as the processes underlying these dynamics is provided elsewhere vriens et al 2019a seigneur et al 2020 for the purpose of our analyses it suffices to summarize that at all experimental scales and across all investigated waste rock types the model simulations were able to quantitatively reproduce the observed drainage chemistry dynamics fig 3 seasonal variability in drainage quality at scales 2 and 4 i e over an order of magnitude in sulfate and metals fig 3 is attributable mostly to variation in infiltrating precipitation whereas the hydraulics of scale 2 were accurately captured by the adopted uniform flow formulation fig 2 those of scale 4 were dampened by longer residence times and a lower fraction of the domain actively contributing to flow which directly translated to the muted seasonal drainage chemistry dynamics observed for scale 4 overall the obtained match between measured and simulated drainage chemistries suggests that the adopted process based model formulation is capable of capturing coupled reactive transport dynamics across a wide range of scales and heterogeneity e g drainage ph from 2 to 10 at each scale for each experiment simulated all model parameters except the adopted geochemical effective rate coefficients keff were pre specified and not adjusted to improve the match between simulated and measured drainage chemistry table 1 it is re iterated that these mineral dissolution precipitation rate coefficients were determined only after flow parameters had been calibrated and subsequently kept constant while certainly not all potentially relevant processes have been explicitly represented in the deployed model formulation conceptually case specific fitting is required to account for effects of such unrepresented heterogeneity and processes beckie 1998 including porosity and permeability changes due to mineral precipitation st arnault et al 2020 gas advection amos et al 2009 vriens et al 2018 microbial catalysis blackmore et al 2018b chemical adsorption vriens et al 2019c and surface passivation st arnault et al 2019 e g shrinking core type behavior wilson et al 2018 yet that our simulations enabled a reasonable agreement of the long term trends only by adjusting the kinetic reaction rate parameters suggests that we have represented the most important processes over the range of scales considered we further contextualize the fitted model parameters effective rate coefficients below 3 3 weathering rates and calibrated rate coefficients simulated reaction rates r m and calibrated effective rate coefficients keff across the various experimental scales are provided for select sulfide and silicate phases in table s4 generally total sulfide oxidation rates dominated by pyrite oxidation were highest for intrusive material reaching 6 10 3 3 10 2 2 10 1 and 4 10 1 mol m 3 waste rock day 1 for the most reactive waste rock in scales 1 4 respectively but were orders of magnitude lower in analogue similarly sized experiments with less reactive waste rock that produced neutral drainage in line with lower sulfide abundance sulfide oxidation rates simulated for experiments with variable waste rock types were often not directly proportional to sulfide abundance or apparent from the drainage composition fig 3 mainly because acid buffering mineral dissolution reactions and secondary mineral precipitation reactions occurred simultaneously but at different rates seigneur et al 2020 under neutral drainage conditions simulated sulfide oxidation and acid neutralization reactions occurred stoichiometrically at rates between 10 3 and 10 6 mol m 3 waste rock day 1 these simulated rates quantitatively align with bulk weathering rates at antamina deduced from mass loading rates temperature profiles or pore gas measurements i e converted to molar units 10 4 and 10 7 mol s m 3 waste rock day 1 vriens et al 2019a 2018 further these rates fall within the broad range of weathering rates observed at other mine sites alakangas et al 2010 harries and ritchie 1981 lefebvre et al 2001b malmström et al 2000 sracek et al 2006 strömberg and banwart 1999 although substantial variability in local climate and site specific waste rock properties limits further interpretation more insightful is to compare calibrated effective rate coefficients keff rather than overall rates r m calibrated effective rate coefficients not only varied across waste rock type i e reflective of the mineralogical composition of the waste rock but also for the same waste rock types across experimental scales table s4 the calibrated effective rate coefficients for most sulfide oxidation and silicate dissolution reactions decreased consistently in each waste rock type by up to three orders of magnitude as the experimental scale increased in contrast to the empirical scale dependence observed from the mass loading analysis above fig 1 this comparison of calibrated rate coefficients rather than rates makes the scale dependence formally attributable to geochemical reactivity alone the calibration of our consistent reactive transport formulation yielded plausible geochemical parameter values across different waste rock types using mostly independently and experimentally measured parameters at all scales thereby reducing the uncertainty associated with the non uniqueness of this particular set of calibrated parameters as the calibrated effective rate coefficients for pyrite oxidation and silicate weathering decreased with similar magnitude between one rock type and another table s4 the factors representing geochemical reactivity i e mineral surface area temperature or unresolved processes discussed below appear to underlie the scale dependence for all these mineral phases consistently while such factors representing geochemical reactivity factors may be identified and isolated by controlled experimentation in a laboratory setting in order to characterize and confirm their relative impact on mineral reactivity we instead use a process based accounting of the remaining unresolved processes and heterogeneity represented by the calibrated rate coefficients in the next section 3 4 resolving scale dependence in geochemical rates in the following examination of the calibrated rate coefficients we focus on pyrite which is abundant in all investigated waste rock types and whose dissolution kinetics have been well described in the literature effects of temperature and mineral surface area table 3 are considered because i temperature and particle size distribution data is available from the antamina research program to quantitatively constrain these effects and ii their contributions to scale dependence observed from the calibrated effective rate coefficients keff can be isolated via 3 k m eff a t s m θ m int where at reflects a temperature correction factor dimensionless sm is the specific surface area of a mineral in the bulk waste rock m2 mineral surface m 3 waste rock and θint represents a more intrinsic scaling coefficient dimensionless that aggregates all other processes not explicitly incorporated in the model formulation or quantifiable from available experimental data the calibrated rate coefficient keff has units dependent on the utilized rate expression so that measured waste rock density kg m 3 and porosity m3 m 3 were used to obtain consistent dimensionless units for θint across kinetically described sulfide and silicate phases table s4 3 4 1 effect of temperature variations measured temperature variation between the laboratory and field experiments was approximately 15 c table 3 the effect of this temperature difference on effective rate coefficients can be described by arrhenius equation 4 a t e e a r 1 t 1 t ref where at dimensionless describes the arrhenius correction to the rate coefficient ea kj mol 1 is the activation energy for the considered oxidation reaction t and tref k are the considered and reference temperatures respectively and r the universal gas constant 8 31 j mol 1 k 1 with an activation energy of approximately 39 to 88 kj mol 1 for fe iii and o2 mediated pyrite oxidation reactions nicholson et al 1988 williamson and rimstidt 1994 the correction factor at for pyrite oxidation at 20 c versus 5 c is at most a factor 5 even when considering additional minor influence of temperature on physical transport properties such as fluid or gas density and viscosity this temperature variation alone does not suffice to explain the orders of magnitude difference in calibrated effective rate coefficients table 3 3 4 2 effect of reactive surface area estimated mineral surface areas for the investigated waste rock types decreased by up to two orders of magnitude with increasing experimental scales largely due to a reduced contribution of the fine fraction d10 table 3 in the adopted model formulation reaction rates r were explicitly dependent on bulk mineral abundance but not on their reactive mineral surface area which was implicit in the calibration factor keff seigneur et al 2020 in fact the units of the calibrated effective rate coefficient keff for pyrite m2 m 3 already indicate a surface area component in the fitted effective rate coefficients the relationship between calibrated effective rate coefficients keff and estimated pyrite surface area table 3 demonstrates that decreases in surface area may explain most of the scale dependence observed in geochemical rates for instance the abundance of pyrite in intrusive waste rock was comparable across the experimental scales 2 1 wt 3 7 wt 2 7 wt and 2 7 wt in experimental scales 1 4 respectively so that the orders of magnitude lower bulk reactivity in these experiments fig 1 table 3 is attributed to an increased average particle size and reduced fine fraction i e relatively lower pyrite surface area in larger experiments similar proportionality between mineral surface area and fitted effective rate coefficients keff is observed for other minerals table s4 in line with the general notion that reactive surface area strongly dictates geochemical weathering rates using eq 3 and the correction factors summarized in table 3 more intrinsic scaling coefficients were back calculated for pyrite oxidation rightmost column in table 3 it can be seen that calibrated effective rate coefficients differed over three orders of magnitude across scales but that post priori accounting for effects of temperature and surface area reduced the variation in the intrinsic scaling coefficients θint to less than an order of magnitude for each waste rock type this improved agreement across scales and waste rock types reflects the fact that more system heterogeneity has been resolved 3 4 3 remaining scale discrepancy firstly reactive mineral surface area has been assumed constant in the adopted approach but is known to be variable under evolving drainage conditions e g due to progressing secondary mineral precipitation and surface area passivation petrographic and mineralogical analyses of pristine and weathered antamina waste rock have shown that passivation of sulfide minerals may reduce the exposed surface area of weathered finer grained waste rock with up to 60 st arnault et al 2020 2019 while mineralogical data are typically collected from small and sieved samples they cannot be extrapolated onto larger experiments or generalized to explain scale dependence yet these estimates suggest that at least some of the residual scale dependence in θint i e fractions but not orders of magnitude may be attributed to mineral surface passivation further investigation of the secondary mineral assemblage across scales e g using automated mineralogy and imaging techniques mla qemscan parbhakar fox et al 2011 is warranted when rates are to be expressed as a function of dynamic surface area secondly mineral dissolution rates are strongly coupled to hydraulic transport in the waste rock as solute exchange across the mineral water interface is facilitated by the contact time with percolating drainage for instance finer grained waste rock with elevated relative surface areas may exhibit higher reactivity but simultaneously experiences lower flow velocities due to increased capillary retention malmström et al 2000 of the considered experiments porewater saturation was lower in experimental piles scale 4 than in the laboratory column scale 3 fig s1 and liquid loads ratio of total recharge over total waste rock mass were about one order of magnitude lower in scale 4 than in scale 1 500 to 30 ml water per kg waste rock respectively in other words the experiments were conducted such that smaller experiments had relatively more water introduced to them such discrepancy has previously been invoked to attribute scale dependence of apparent weathering rates to average experimental hydraulics e g water liquid ratios plante et al 2014 but in this work uniform flow parameters had been fitted to drainage rates prior to and independently of geochemical rate parameters as acknowledged above preferential flow may become relevant at larger experimental scales so that unresolved non uniform flow behavior at smaller scales may explain some of the remaining scale dependence in θint i e analogous to a correction factor for the mobile immobile water fraction malmström et al 2000 this hypothesis can be further investigated for instance by i additional multi scale experimentation with consistent relative flushing rates ii direct in situ monitoring of moisture distributions in waste rock piles dimech et al 2019 poisson et al 2009 or iii the application of discretized hydraulic model domains that exhibit distinct geochemical reactivity blackmore et al 2018a finally the minor variation in back calculated intrinsic scaling coefficients θint as shown in table 3 implies a certain level of remaining empiricism in the adopted model a fully resolved mechanistic model would yield constant scaling coefficients truly intrinsic rather than effective that apply at any scale and waste rock type certainly additional unresolved factors such as microbial catalysis or adsorption may have contributed the small remaining scale discrepancy but practical techniques to quantify such processes at the concerned scales are currently lacking in fact real world dynamics can never be fully represented at all scales simultaneously and all models of physical systems must contain model dependent empirical parameters beckie 1996 3 5 predictive capability fundamentally when a narrow range of values for the more intrinsic scaling coefficient θint can be obtained for different waste rock types and experimental scales that suggests that a relatively independent θint may be applied in predictive models for the waste rock types and scales examined albeit never fully exhaustive incremental improvement to express θint as a function of resolved i e measured parameters can enhance the predictive capability of a reactive transport model as a proof of concept we performed a predictive drainage chemistry simulation by extrapolating intrinsic scaling coefficients obtained for experimental scales 1 3 onto a simulation for scale 4 experimental pile 2 for these simulations intrinsic scaling coefficients were calculated for the dissolution reactions of other sulfide and silicate minerals similarly to what was done for pyrite above table s5 subsequently we isolated the minimum average and maximum implicit rate coefficients θint for sulfide and silicate dissolution reactions from the scale 1 3 experiments with similar intrusive waste rock as in experimental pile 2 and reverse engineered effective rate coefficients keff eq 3 that were plugged into the corresponding reaction rate equations seigneur et al 2020 for three predictive simulations i e minimum average and maximum geochemical reactivities for experimental pile 2c respectively all other bulk hydraulic and geochemical parameters in these simulations were otherwise similar and adopted from direct measurements table 1 and table 2 it can be seen from fig 4 that the resulting predicted range of drainage qualities for experimental pile 2c are close to what was observed experimentally adoption of the average intrinsic scaling coefficients θint for sulfide and silicate dissolution reactions yielded a prediction that accurately captured both the long term drainage evolution and perhaps more important for mine wastewater management the timing of drainage quality deterioration best fit scenario in fig 4 however the spread in predicted drainage composition was considerable when minimum and maximum scaling coefficients were used for instance drainage acidification occurred up to 4 years earlier when maximum rather than minimum reactivities i e fastest versus slowest sulfide oxidation rates were used it is thus recommended that predictive simulations of geochemical reactivity when based on back calculation of more intrinsic scaling coefficients are calibrated across scales yet overall these predictive simulations demonstrate long term drainage dynamics may be predicted from mechanistic upscaling of readily available physicochemical parameters collected at smaller scale experiments 4 conclusions synthesis of experimental results from a long term research program at the antamina mine revealed that drainage mass loadings from larger and longer term experiments were less than from smaller shorter experiments with similar waste rock a process based reactive transport model could quantitatively reproduce drainage quantity and quality trends measured in laboratory and field experiments spanning from a 1 kg laboratory scale to 100 000 kg field scale piles during a decade of weathering upon consideration of temperature and particle size effects more intrinsic scaling coefficients determined from different experiments matched each other within an order of magnitude while we accounted for most scale dependence in geochemical reactions over dimensions from 10 cm to 11 m the systems examined do not extend to the scales encountered in full scale piles at mine sites i e hundreds of meters fig 1b gas and heat transport dynamics become particularly relevant in larger scale piles when reaction rates are high and gas transport flow paths are long birkham et al 2003 such as at the questa in new mexico wels et al 2003 mine doyon in quebec lefebvre et al 2001a and rum jungle in australia harries and ritchie 1981 it is similarly expected that preferential flow is more prevalent at larger scales it remains to be tested whether a sufficiently accurate representation of such mass and heat transport mechanisms can account for scale dependence in larger waste rock piles in conclusion it is demonstrated that scale dependence of reaction rate parameters can be source tracked when the processes are properly accounted for and consistently parameterized at each scale of experimentation mechanistic models that explicitly account for these processes and are parameterized experimentally may thus be used to predict waste rock weathering

1504,in situ thermal treatment istt technologies can be used to remove mass from non aqueous phase liquid napl source zones ensuring the vaporization of napl and the capture of vapors are crucial and numerical models are useful for understanding the processes that affect performance to help improve design and operation in this paper a two dimensional model that combines a continuum approach based on finite difference for heat transfer with a macroscopic invasion percolation macro ip approach for gas migration was developed to simulate thermal conductive heating tch applications at the field scale this approach simulates heat transport and gas migration but is different than a traditional continuum multiphase approach mass recovery for 60 randomly generated realizations under three degrees of heterogeneity of the permeability field were simulated the mass recovery curves had an overall similar shape for the various permeability fields however a wider range of completion times was observed for domains with a higher permeability variance results also showed that napl pools that were highly saturated deep and away from the heaters needed more heating time to be depleted and that total napl mass was not a good indicator of completion time the completion time was positively correlated with the maximum value of the mixed spatial moment of napl saturation about the heaters in the lateral and vertical direction and the napl pool with the highest moment could increase the heating time by as much as 35 this effect was most notable in simulations with a high permeability variance and suggests the potential to reduce heating time by locating the largest napl pools and placing tch heaters accordingly 1 introduction in situ thermal treatment istt technologies have the potential to remove volatile and semi volatile organic compounds vocs and svocs from the subsurface these technologies including electrical resistance heating erh and thermal conductive heating tch rely on increasing the temperature of the subsurface to near the water boiling point or higher to achieve mass removal it has been reported that istt technologies can be more effective than fluid injection based remediation technologies to treat heterogeneous geology kingston et al 2014 mcguire et al 2006 stroo et al 2012 because their performance is mainly governed by electrical and thermal conductivity which are typically less spatially variable than hydraulic conductivity predicting the duration required for istt applications to remove non aqueous phase liquid napl at field sites is challenging not only is the rate and extent of napl removal affected by the delivery and transport of energy heat in the subsurface it is also affected by the rate at which gas steam and vaporized vocs is produced and captured for the application of istt at sites impacted by volatile napls over 90 of voc mass from a treatment zone is removed in the gas phase heron et al 2005 2013 vermeulen and mcgee 2000 and the majority of that mass is recovered during the co boiling stage burghardt and kueper 2008 zhao et al 2014 co boiling or steam distillation plays an important role in removing vocs and svocs as it allows the production of gas at a temperature lower than the boiling point of either water or the napl nilsson et al 2011 tzovolou et al 2011 therefore although a common criterion for terminating heating is reaching a specified temperature and maintaining it for a defined period parker et al 2017 uncertainty associated with napl distribution as well as variations in temperature due to heat transport water boiling and co boiling complicate the relationship between measured temperatures and the achievement of treatment goals numerical modelling can be a useful tool for

ip krol et al 2011a molnar et al 2019 mumford et al 2010 a wide range of critical gas saturation values from 0 005 to 0 38 has been reported sheng et al 1999 a value of s gcr 0 15 was selected for this study and a sensitivity test showed that values of s gcr between 0 05 and 0 35 had a minor influence on the duration and shape of mass recovery curves and affected the completion time by less than 4 under heterogeneous conditions at the scale of this study adjacent gas occupied cells with gas saturations greater than s gcr are treated as one gas cluster for a gas cluster with multiple

solving a system of equations such that 1 mass is conserved 2 local p c s w relationships for all the cells are satisfied and 3 gas pressure after the redistribution is constant throughout the cells if two clusters coalesce the mass is also redistributed within the new joint cluster in addition the moles of gas phase voc and steam in each cluster are tracked by assuming a uniform gas phase voc concentration within each cluster as more gas is generated the macro ip algorithm is triggered if any gas cluster can be identified and the expansion mobilization and fragmentation of gas clusters are simulated using the macro ip algorithm described by mumford et al 2010 and krol et al 2011a similar processes have also been applied in other macro ip studies to simulate capillary dominated flow in the presence of gravity force with the assumption of negligible viscous force glass et al 2001 glass and yarrington 2003 molnar et al 2019 in these approaches invasion sites represent sub regions of the porous medium rather than individual pores and entry thresholds are modified to account for differences in water pressure with depth although gas movement can be more complicated under different conditions gas production during tch is expected to result in negligible viscous forces in addition on account of the larger cells used in this study than the previous studies a residual gas saturation of 0 14 is defined in the model to represent trapped gas in cells that have undergone imbibition e g mobilization and fragmentation the continuum approach and macro ip approach are coupled using a similar scheme to that presented by molnar et al 2019 at the beginning of every time step the energy equations are solved implicitly using a block centered finite difference scheme to determine the temperature distribution locations of any co boiling cells and amount of gas that is vaporized in every co boiling cell next any vaporized gas is moved based on the macro ip algorithm to determine the distribution of gas saturation finally thermal properties including the thermal conductivity and heat capacity are updated explicitly at the end of the time step the temperature distribution simulated by the model has been verified against an analytical solution for heat conduction crank 1975 assuming a water saturated condition fig s1 in the supplementary material the approach of simulating napl water co boiling has been validated against laboratory experiments and can properly simulate the gas production and napl depletion rate during heating xie et al 2019 in addition the gas movement module of this model has also been verified by comparing to the co2 injection experiment conducted by glass et al 2001 3 field scale model application 3 1 domain construction 2d vertical planes 20 m 5 m vertical were extracted from three dimensional 3d simulations conducted by alexandra et al 2012 to provide the permeability fields and initial trichloroethene tce saturation fields as a representative dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl five heaters and co located gas extractors are employed in the simulations fig 1 which fully penetrate the vertical dimension and are spaced 5 m apart in the horizontal direction a no flux boundary condition for heat transfer is applied to all the external boundaries hence no heat losses from the domain occur a constant heat influx condition is set to the heaters the power input for the heaters at the left and right boundaries is reduced to half of that applied to the interior heaters to accommodate the external boundary condition the top and bottom boundaries are assumed to be impermeable to gas flow the model assumes passive extraction from extractors heron et al 1998 and vacuum is not applied therefore the model starts to remove mass from the domain only when a gas cluster is connected to an extractor cell once a gas cluster is connected to an extractor any gas mass generated in that cluster will not expand the cluster but will be collected by the extractor and removed from the domain if a cluster is connected to two extractors the gas mass is assumed to be recovered by both 50 each 3 2 simulations three 3d tce dnapl releases under three degrees of heterogeneity were investigated by alexandra et al 2012 the three degrees of heterogeneity were represented by three values of the variance of ln k the variance of ln k included values of 1 2 and 4 referred to here as low medium and high variance cases and all had a mean ln k of 27 6 which corresponds to a mean hydraulic conductivity of approximately 1 10 5 m s twenty independent 2d sections were extracted from each of the three 3d cases to facilitate a multiple realization approach and provide a measure of variability within a degree of heterogeneity for comparison to variability between degrees of heterogeneity ten sections were selected equal spaced parallel to the x axis of the 3d domain from 3 2 m to 17 6 m and another ten sections were selected equal spaced parallel to the y axis of the 3d domain from 3 2 m to 17 6 m the average saturation over the entire domain dnapl volume pore volume of the domain for each individual realization varies from 0 0099 to 0 0171 for the low variance case 0 0095 to 0 0186 for the medium variance case and 0 0039 to 0 0233 for the high variance case simulations presented in this paper are generated under the following primary assumptions 1 no gas is present prior to heating 2 porosity ϕ thermal conductivity of saturated soil λ sat and thermal conductivity of dry soil λ dry are uniform throughout the domain 3 the influence of napl on thermal conductivity is neglected 4 the napl phase is immobile during heating 5 water pressures are hydrostatic 6 partitioning between gas and water is neglected the cell size employed is 0 1 m by 0 05 m which is within the range of cell sizes used in previous macro ip studies mumford et al 2015 the power applied to the heaters is lower than field applications because of the 2d model configuration however the power applied results in an average power density of 80 w m3 which is relevant in practice heron et al 2013 2015 heating lasts for 80 days at which point no tce dnapl remains in the domain in any of the realizations other input parameters are listed in table 1 a typical simulation takes approximately 3 h to complete on an intel core i7 desktop 4 results and discussion 4 1 example tch simulation an example realization from the medium variance permeability field is presented in this section the initial tce saturation and permeability distribution can be found in fig 1 snapshots of temperature tce saturation and gas saturation are presented in fig 2 the co boiling of tce and water around the heaters starts after approximately 10 days once phase change occurs the temperature distribution starts to become variable due to the energy sinks generated by latent heat at earlier time the variability in temperature is minimal and is overshadowed by the high temperature gradient around the heaters because of the high temperatures tce dnapl around the heaters is depleted in a relatively short time at this point gas clusters normally would not extend far from the heaters because they could easily be captured by the co located extractors fig 2i it is important to note that convective heat transfer caused by groundwater flow which is not accounted for in this model can alter the temperature distribution from that shown here and potentially affect the mass recovery in coarse materials once the temperature reaches the boiling point of water around the heaters those areas start to dry out and the steam is recovered by the extractors these dry zones can serve as spatial expansions of the extractors which enhances the recovery of the gas phase voc heron et al 2013 at a later stage of heating tce dnapl in areas between the heaters starts to co boil as gas is produced during co boiling the movement of that gas is governed by the permeability field and the gas tends to move laterally into the extractors instead of upwards towards the ground surface it should be noted that due to the 2d heating configuration of the model domain and the co location of extractors and heaters contaminant vapor will not escape and potentially condense outside the heated treatment zone if vaporized contaminants were not captured by extractors in an istt application condensation could limit treatment and further extend completion times during co boiling highly saturated tce pools need longer heating time to be depleted due to the high energy consumption during phase change for example the tce pool in the bottom left corner of the domain takes the longest time to be depleted fig 2h and results in mass recovery tailing after 59 days a relatively cooler zone located at approximately 1 5 x 3 5 m and 4 z 5 m fig 2d is created due to the presence of this dnapl pool in comparison with other parts of the domain between heaters this pool was finally removed when enough energy was conducted to the area at 75 4 days after 80 days of heating the temperature of the heaters exceeds 700 c and the center line between the heaters reaches approximately 100 c a total of 153 6 kwh m3 of energy was used to treat this realization which is in agreement with previous studies of tch heron et al 2013 kingston et al 2014 by the end of the simulation an energy balance shows that approximately 36 of the inputted energy was carried by vapors and removed from the domain approximately 32 of the initial water volume and 99 26 of the initial dnapl volume were removed after the 80 days of treatment the time at which the realization reaches its maximum cumulative mass recovery is defined as the completion time t c 75 4 days in this example it is important to note that this model does not account for partitioning of tce to the aqueous and sorbed phases which would extend the completion time although the removal of vocs from dnapl through the production and capture of a gas phase would be the dominant removal mechanism at dnapl impacted sites accounting for aqueous and sorbed vocs may be important to reach treatment goals at some sites particularly those with lower soil and groundwater concentration restoration targets 4 2 influence of heterogeneity on completion times the cumulative mass recovery curves for all 60 simulations 20 from each heterogeneity level are presented in fig 3a the general shapes of these curves are not significantly different for all these simulations voc mass starts to be recovered at approximately 10 days because that is the time when the tce dnapl around the heaters reaches the co boiling temperature the mass recovery curves start rising with a relatively steep slope after 10 days because there are no heat losses from the boundaries of these simulations and the temperature gradient around the heaters is high while the beginning of voc recovery was similar across all simulations the completion times varied from 55 to 80 days this variation is important for istt applications where energy costs associated with extended operation are a practical concern the histograms of completion times are shown in fig 4 although the distributions of completion times for all three cases are skewed towards shorter times tailing does occur in realizations from all three heterogeneity levels this tailing is more frequent for the high variance permeability and represents up to approximately one third of the total operation time similar tailing behaviors have been observed by parker et al 2017 in multiple istt applications and those authors employed a statistical model to determine the termination time for heating in contrast the model in this study links the site geology and gas movement to mass recovery fig 3b shows the comparison of the normalized mass recovery curves from the simulations to six tch sites presented by parker et al 2017 for each curve the x axis is normalized to the time when the mass recovery reaches its maximum rate δtpeak which is an approximation of the time for the site to reach the co boiling point parker et al 2017 the shapes of the simulated curves show good agreement with the real site data and indicate that the modelling approach used in this study is able to simulate the local co boiling behavior as well as the global mass recovery two sites presented by parker et al 2017 sites 5 and 6 show more significant tailing effect than the simulations this increased tailing could be caused by uneven heating or heat losses and no attempt was made to calibrate the model to represent any particular site 4 3 influence of dnapl architecture on completion times with an assumption of negligible heat losses the architecture of the dnapl distribution which stems largely from the variance in permeability is the main factor governing the tailing behaviors several of the high permeability variance realizations show particularly longer completion times than other realizations because more heterogeneous permeability distributions result in a higher frequency of dnapl pools alexandra et al 2012 being able to identify the causes for tailing can help improve the design and decision making for istt applications the spatial moments of the dnapl distribution boroumand and abriola 2015 essaid and hess 1993 are used here to investigate the correlation between the completion time and napl architecture due to the fact that heaters divide the domain into multiple subareas the minimum distance from a napl occupied cell to a heater is defined as 9 x min x x h where x is the x coordinate of a napl occupied cell and x h is the array of x coordinates of all the heaters the modified moment of order i j is then defined as 10 m ij ϕ ρ n s n x z x i z j dxdydz the modified moment of order 0 m 00 represents the total napl mass in the realization and the relationship between completion time and m 00 is presented in fig 5a realizations with greater total mass are inclined to have longer completion times however the correlation is not very distinct specifically for the low and medium variance cases because the pool structures in the domain cannot be captured by the total mass hence estimating total mass may not be sufficient to estimate the required operation time in practice the previous example tch simulation fig 2 demonstrated that high saturation pools dictate the completion time to explore the relationship between the completion time and each individual pool we define adjacent dnapl occupied cells as a dnapl cluster and computed the modified moments of each dnapl cluster m ij separately thus m 00 represents the mass of a dnapl cluster and a dnapl pool would have a higher m 00 than a region of dnapl residual in addition higher order moments can be used to examine the relative location of a dnapl cluster in the domain correspondingly the dnapl clusters that are far away from the heaters would have a high m 10 the dnapl clusters that are deep in the domain would have a high m 01 and the dnapl clusters that are both deep and far away from the heaters would have a high m 11 for each realization the moments m 00 m 10 m 01 and m 11 for every dnapl cluster were calculated for each type of moment the dnapl cluster that had the maximum value of that moment was compared to the completion time among these four moments the maximum m 11 for each realization shows the best correlation and a linear relationship with completion time fig 5b this demonstrates that the dnapl pool with the maximum m 11 will likely be removed last under this heating configuration and will dictate the completion time there are three factors that account for this 1 areas of greater distance from heaters are subjected to lower temperature gradients than areas near heaters 2 deeper areas have higher co boiling points than shallower areas and 3 higher dnapl mass areas require more energy for vaporization these factors all contribute to a longer heating time 5 summary and conclusions a numerical model was developed to simulate key processes affecting the removal of napl and recovery of vaporized vocs during tch applications at the field scale the developed model uses a continuum approach to simulate heat conduction and a macro ip algorithm to simulate gas movement in these simulations significant lateral movement of gas is observed during co boiling and the resulting gas distribution is subject to the permeability distribution napl distribution and locations of the heaters the simulation results show that the shapes of mass recovery curves for different variance permeability fields are not substantially different however the completion time has a relatively wide range across all 60 simulations among which higher variance permeability fields have wider ranges of completion time that is sites with a higher permeability variance are more likely to experience tailing of voc mass recovery during heating by tch in addition tailing behavior is observed for all permeability variances despite the insulated boundary condition which is attributed to the presence of dnapl pools for the heating configuration used in this study moment analysis shows that the maximum value of the mixed moment of napl saturation about the heaters in the lateral and vertical direction i e associated with high saturation pools that are deep and away from the heaters is linearly correlated with the completion time this has important implications for field scale istt applications and demonstrates that locating the pool with this maximum moment can help determine the heating time locating this pool may also be a strategy for reducing the duration of heating in field applications especially for situations in which one dnapl pool would dominate the completion time if istt applications were designed to specifically target this pool a balance between additional site investigation costs associated with finding this pool and reduced operating costs associated with shorter completion times would be required the results of this study also demonstrate the potential of using coupled continuum and macro ip models of heat and mass transport to simulate istt applications further research is required to incorporate additional key processes including

1504,in situ thermal treatment istt technologies can be used to remove mass from non aqueous phase liquid napl source zones ensuring the vaporization of napl and the capture of vapors are crucial and numerical models are useful for understanding the processes that affect performance to help improve design and operation in this paper a two dimensional model that combines a continuum approach based on finite difference for heat transfer with a macroscopic invasion percolation macro ip approach for gas migration was developed to simulate thermal conductive heating tch applications at the field scale this approach simulates heat transport and gas migration but is different than a traditional continuum multiphase approach mass recovery for 60 randomly generated realizations under three degrees of heterogeneity of the permeability field were simulated the mass recovery curves had an overall similar shape for the various permeability fields however a wider range of completion times was observed for domains with a higher permeability variance results also showed that napl pools that were highly saturated deep and away from the heaters needed more heating time to be depleted and that total napl mass was not a good indicator of completion time the completion time was positively correlated with the maximum value of the mixed spatial moment of napl saturation about the heaters in the lateral and vertical direction and the napl pool with the highest moment could increase the heating time by as much as 35 this effect was most notable in simulations with a high permeability variance and suggests the potential to reduce heating time by locating the largest napl pools and placing tch heaters accordingly 1 introduction in situ thermal treatment istt technologies have the potential to remove volatile and semi volatile organic compounds vocs and svocs from the subsurface these technologies including electrical resistance heating erh and thermal conductive heating tch rely on increasing the temperature of the subsurface to near the water boiling point or higher to achieve mass removal it has been reported that istt technologies can be more effective than fluid injection based remediation technologies to treat heterogeneous geology kingston et al 2014 mcguire et al 2006 stroo et al 2012 because their performance is mainly governed by electrical and thermal conductivity which are typically less spatially variable than hydraulic conductivity predicting the duration required for istt applications to remove non aqueous phase liquid napl at field sites is challenging not only is the rate and extent of napl removal affected by the delivery and transport of energy heat in the subsurface it is also affected by the rate at which gas steam and vaporized vocs is produced and captured for the application of istt at sites impacted by volatile napls over 90 of voc mass from a treatment zone is removed in the gas phase heron et al 2005 2013 vermeulen and mcgee 2000 and the majority of that mass is recovered during the co boiling stage burghardt and kueper 2008 zhao et al 2014 co boiling or steam distillation plays an important role in removing vocs and svocs as it allows the production of gas at a temperature lower than the boiling point of either water or the napl nilsson et al 2011 tzovolou et al 2011 therefore although a common criterion for terminating heating is reaching a specified temperature and maintaining it for a defined period parker et al 2017 uncertainty associated with napl distribution as well as variations in temperature due to heat transport water boiling and co boiling complicate the relationship between measured temperatures and the achievement of treatment goals numerical modelling can be a useful tool for

saturation of 0 14 is defined in the model to represent trapped gas in cells that have undergone imbibition e g mobilization and fragmentation the continuum approach and macro ip approach are coupled using a similar scheme to that presented by molnar et al 2019 at the beginning of every time step the energy equations are solved implicitly using a block centered finite difference scheme to determine the temperature distribution locations of any co boiling cells and amount of gas that is vaporized in every co boiling cell next any vaporized gas is moved based on the macro ip algorithm to determine the distribution of gas saturation finally thermal properties including the thermal conductivity and heat capacity are updated explicitly at the end of the time step the temperature distribution simulated by the model has been verified against an analytical solution for heat conduction crank 1975 assuming a water saturated condition fig s1 in the supplementary material the approach of simulating napl water co boiling has been validated against laboratory experiments and can properly simulate the gas production and napl depletion rate during heating xie et al 2019 in addition the gas movement module of this model has also been verified by comparing to the co2 injection experiment conducted by glass et al 2001 3 field scale model application 3 1 domain construction 2d vertical planes 20 m 5 m vertical were extracted from three dimensional 3d simulations conducted by alexandra et al 2012 to provide the permeability fields and initial trichloroethene tce saturation fields as a representative dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl five heaters and co located gas extractors are employed in the simulations fig 1 which fully penetrate the vertical dimension and are spaced 5 m apart in the horizontal direction a no flux boundary condition for heat transfer is applied to all the external boundaries hence no heat losses from the domain occur a constant heat influx condition is set to the heaters the power input for the heaters at the left and right boundaries is reduced to half of that applied to the interior heaters to accommodate the external boundary condition the top and bottom boundaries are assumed to be impermeable to gas flow the model assumes passive extraction from extractors heron et al 1998 and vacuum is not applied therefore the model starts to remove mass from the domain only when a gas cluster is connected to an extractor cell once a gas cluster is connected to an extractor any gas mass generated in that cluster will not expand the cluster but will be collected by the extractor and removed from the domain if a cluster is connected to two extractors the gas mass is assumed to be recovered by both 50 each 3 2 simulations three 3d tce dnapl releases under three degrees of heterogeneity were investigated by alexandra et al 2012 the three degrees of heterogeneity were represented by three values of the variance of ln k the variance of ln k included values of 1 2 and 4 referred to here as low medium and high variance cases and all had a mean ln k of 27 6 which corresponds to a mean hydraulic conductivity of approximately 1 10 5 m s twenty independent 2d sections were extracted from each of the three 3d cases to facilitate a multiple realization approach and provide a measure of variability within a degree of heterogeneity for comparison to variability between degrees of heterogeneity ten sections were selected equal spaced parallel to the x axis of the 3d domain from 3 2 m to 17 6 m and another ten sections were selected equal spaced parallel to the y axis of the 3d domain from 3 2 m to 17 6 m the average saturation over the entire domain dnapl volume pore volume of the domain for each individual realization varies from 0 0099 to 0 0171 for the low variance case 0 0095 to 0 0186 for the medium variance case and 0 0039 to 0 0233 for the high variance case simulations presented in this paper are generated under the following primary assumptions 1 no gas is present prior to heating 2 porosity ϕ thermal conductivity of saturated soil λ sat and thermal conductivity of dry soil λ dry are uniform throughout the domain 3 the influence of napl on thermal conductivity is neglected 4 the napl phase is immobile during heating 5 water pressures are hydrostatic 6 partitioning between gas and water is neglected the cell size employed is 0 1 m by 0 05 m which is within the range of cell sizes used in previous macro ip studies mumford et al 2015 the power applied to the heaters is lower than field applications because of the 2d model configuration however the power applied results in an average power density of 80 w m3 which is relevant in practice heron et al 2013 2015 heating lasts for 80 days at which point no tce dnapl remains in the domain in any of the realizations other input parameters are listed in table 1 a typical simulation takes approximately 3 h to complete on an intel core i7 desktop 4 results and discussion 4 1 example tch simulation an example realization from the medium variance permeability field is presented in this section the initial tce saturation and permeability distribution can be found in fig 1 snapshots of temperature tce saturation and gas saturation are presented in fig 2 the co boiling of tce and water around the heaters starts after approximately 10 days once phase change occurs the temperature distribution starts to become variable due to the energy sinks generated by latent heat at earlier time the variability in temperature is minimal and is overshadowed by the high temperature gradient around the heaters because of the high temperatures tce dnapl around the heaters is depleted in a relatively short time at this point gas clusters normally would not extend far from the heaters because they could easily be captured by the co located extractors fig 2i it is important to note that convective heat transfer caused by groundwater flow which is not accounted for in this model can alter the temperature distribution from that shown here and potentially affect the mass recovery in coarse materials once the temperature reaches the boiling point of water around the heaters those areas start to dry out and the steam is recovered by the extractors these dry zones can serve as spatial expansions of the extractors which enhances the recovery of the gas phase voc heron et al 2013 at a later stage of heating tce dnapl in areas between the heaters starts to co boil as gas is produced during co boiling the movement of that gas is governed by the permeability field and the gas tends to move laterally into the extractors instead of upwards towards the ground surface it should be noted that due to the 2d heating configuration of the model domain and the co location of extractors and heaters contaminant vapor will not escape and potentially condense outside the heated treatment zone if vaporized contaminants were not captured by extractors in an istt application condensation could limit treatment and further extend completion times during co boiling highly saturated tce pools need longer heating time to be depleted due to the high energy consumption during phase change for example the tce pool in the bottom left corner of the domain takes the longest time to be depleted fig 2h and results in mass recovery tailing after 59 days a relatively cooler zone located at approximately 1 5 x 3 5 m and 4 z 5 m fig 2d is created due to the presence of this dnapl pool in comparison with other parts of the domain between heaters this pool was finally removed when enough energy was conducted to the area at 75 4 days after 80 days of heating the temperature of the heaters exceeds 700 c and the center line between the heaters reaches approximately 100 c a total of 153 6 kwh m3 of energy was used to treat this realization which is in agreement with previous studies of tch heron et al 2013 kingston et al 2014 by the end of the simulation an energy balance shows that approximately 36 of the inputted energy was carried by vapors and removed from the domain approximately 32 of the initial water volume and 99 26 of the initial dnapl volume were removed after the 80 days of treatment the time at which the realization reaches its maximum cumulative mass recovery is defined as the completion time t c 75 4 days in this example it is important to note that this model does not account for partitioning of tce to the aqueous and sorbed phases which would extend the completion time although the removal of vocs from dnapl through the production and capture of a gas phase would be the dominant removal mechanism at dnapl impacted sites accounting for aqueous and sorbed vocs may be important to reach treatment goals at some sites particularly those with lower soil and groundwater concentration restoration targets 4 2 influence of heterogeneity on completion times the cumulative mass recovery curves for all 60 simulations 20 from each heterogeneity level are presented in fig 3a the general shapes of these curves are not significantly different for all these simulations voc mass starts to be recovered at approximately 10 days because that is the time when the tce dnapl around the heaters reaches the co boiling temperature the mass recovery curves start rising with a relatively steep slope after 10 days because there are no heat losses from the boundaries of these simulations and the temperature gradient around the heaters is high while the beginning of voc recovery was similar across all simulations the completion times varied from 55 to 80 days this variation is important for istt applications where energy costs associated with extended operation are a practical concern the histograms of completion times are shown in fig 4 although the distributions of completion times for all three cases are skewed towards shorter times tailing does occur in realizations from all three heterogeneity levels this tailing is more frequent for the high variance permeability and represents up to approximately one third of the total operation time similar tailing behaviors have been observed by parker et al 2017 in multiple istt applications and those authors employed a statistical model to determine the termination time for heating in contrast the model in this study links the site geology and gas movement to mass recovery fig 3b shows the comparison of the normalized mass recovery curves from the simulations to six tch sites presented by parker et al 2017 for each curve the x axis is normalized to the time when the mass recovery reaches its maximum rate δtpeak which is an approximation of the time for the site to reach the co boiling point parker et al 2017 the shapes of the simulated curves show good agreement with the real site data and indicate that the modelling approach used in this study is able to simulate the local co boiling behavior as well as the global mass recovery two sites presented by parker et al 2017 sites 5 and 6 show more significant tailing effect than the simulations this increased tailing could be caused by uneven heating or heat losses and no attempt was made to calibrate the model to represent any particular site 4 3 influence of dnapl architecture on completion times with an assumption of negligible heat losses the architecture of the dnapl distribution which stems largely from the variance in permeability is the main factor governing the tailing behaviors several of the high permeability variance realizations show particularly longer completion times than other realizations because more heterogeneous permeability distributions result in a higher frequency of dnapl pools alexandra et al 2012 being able to identify the causes for tailing can help improve the design and decision making for istt applications the spatial moments of the dnapl distribution boroumand and abriola 2015 essaid and hess 1993 are used here to investigate the correlation between the completion time and napl architecture due to the fact that heaters divide the domain into multiple subareas the minimum distance from a napl occupied cell to a heater is defined as 9 x min x x h where x is the x coordinate of a napl occupied cell and x h is the array of x coordinates of all the heaters the modified moment of order i j is then defined as 10 m ij ϕ ρ n s n x z x i z j dxdydz the modified moment of order 0 m 00 represents the total napl mass in the realization and the relationship between completion time and m 00 is presented in fig 5a realizations with greater total mass are inclined to have longer completion times however the correlation is not very distinct specifically for the low and medium variance cases because the pool structures in the domain cannot be captured by the total mass hence estimating total mass may not be sufficient to estimate the required operation time in practice the previous example tch simulation fig 2 demonstrated that high saturation pools dictate the completion time to explore the relationship between the completion time and each individual pool we define adjacent dnapl occupied cells as a dnapl cluster and computed the modified moments of each dnapl cluster m ij separately thus m 00 represents the mass of a dnapl cluster and a dnapl pool would have a higher m 00 than a region of dnapl residual in addition higher order moments can be used to examine the relative location of a dnapl cluster in the domain correspondingly the dnapl clusters that are far away from the heaters would have a high m 10 the dnapl clusters that are deep in the domain would have a high m 01 and the dnapl clusters that are both deep and far away from the heaters would have a high m 11 for each realization the moments m 00 m 10 m 01 and m 11 for every dnapl cluster were calculated for each type of moment the dnapl cluster that had the maximum value of that moment was compared to the completion time among these four moments the maximum m 11 for each realization shows the best correlation and a linear relationship with completion time fig 5b this demonstrates that the dnapl pool with the maximum m 11 will likely be removed last under this heating configuration and will dictate the completion time there are three factors that account for this 1 areas of greater distance from heaters are subjected to lower temperature gradients than areas near heaters 2 deeper areas have higher co boiling points than shallower areas and 3 higher dnapl mass areas require more energy for vaporization these factors all contribute to a longer heating time 5 summary and conclusions a numerical model was developed to simulate key processes affecting the removal of napl and recovery of vaporized vocs during tch applications at the field scale the developed model uses a continuum approach to simulate heat conduction and a macro ip algorithm to simulate gas movement in these simulations significant lateral movement of gas is observed during co boiling and the resulting gas distribution is subject to the permeability distribution napl distribution and locations of the heaters the simulation results show that the shapes of mass recovery curves for different variance permeability fields are not substantially different however the completion time has a relatively wide range across all 60 simulations among which higher variance permeability fields have wider ranges of completion time that is sites with a higher permeability variance are more likely to experience tailing of voc mass recovery during heating by tch in addition tailing behavior is observed for all permeability variances despite the insulated boundary condition which is attributed to the presence of dnapl pools for the heating configuration used in this study moment analysis shows that the maximum value of the mixed moment of napl saturation about the heaters in the lateral and vertical direction i e associated with high saturation pools that are deep and away from the heaters is linearly correlated with the completion time this has important implications for field scale istt applications and demonstrates that locating the pool with this maximum moment can help determine the heating time locating this pool may also be a strategy for reducing the duration of heating in field applications especially for situations in which one dnapl pool would dominate the completion time if istt applications were designed to specifically target this pool a balance between additional site investigation costs associated with finding this pool and reduced operating costs associated with shorter completion times would be required the results of this study also demonstrate the potential of using coupled continuum and macro ip models of heat and mass transport to simulate istt applications further research is required to incorporate additional key processes including
