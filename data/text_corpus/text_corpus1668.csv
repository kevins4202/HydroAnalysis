8340,study region pearl river basin prb in south china study focus this study aims to assess future socioeconomic drought events under a changing climate over the study region variable infiltration capacity vic model is used to simulate the streamflow in the prb during the period of 2020 2099 and 48 projected precipitation datasets from general circulation models gcms are selected to drive the vic model at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution then the minimum in stream water requirement miwr of the prb is determined and trend analysis of the simulated streamflow is conducted socioeconomic drought index sedi is used to detect the occurrence of socioeconomic drought event and further the impact of the reservoirs in the prb on drought analysis is evaluated new hydrological insights for the region based on any dataset nearly one hundred socioeconomic drought events at different severity levels can be identified in the prb however most of them especially those at severe and extreme levels can be mitigated through reservoir operation i e reserving at least 40 of the total manageable storage capacity tmsc in the reservoirs overall this study can improve the recognition of future socioeconomic drought events which is of great value for our society to effectively assess the impacts of climate change and water projects on sustainable water resources utilization in such river basins keywords sedi climate change gcm vic model pearl river basin 1 introduction drought is a natural hazard that usually occurs across a relatively large spatial temporal scale according to american meteorological society 2013 four categories of drought can be defined namely meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic drought respectively a great number of previous research works have studied the former three categories of drought and a lot of drought indices have been developed or proposed in the past decades e g palmer 1965 heim 2002 shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2010 moorhead et al 2015 lin et al 2017 sun et al 2019 some representative drought indices include standardized precipitation index spi palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei standardized runoff index sri and so on however for the fourth category i e socioeconomic drought several indices have been proposed since 2015 e g mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016 shi et al 2018 tu et al 2018 guo et al 2019a 2019b normally the occurrence of socioeconomic drought is in association with water supply and water demand against the minimum in stream water requirement miwr in the earlier years several studies e g fraser et al 2008 bosongo et al 2014 maia et al 2015 eklund and seaquist 2015 have begun to discuss the socioeconomic characteristics impacts of drought for example fraser et al 2008 provided a preliminary step to quantify socioeconomic characteristics of drought sensitive regions in china bosongo et al 2014 analyzed the socioeconomic impacts of droughts in the middle zambezi river basin eklund and seaquist 2015 emphasized the importance of understanding drought from both physical and socioeconomic perspectives similar to the other three categories of drought several relevant drought indices have been developed to describe socioeconomic drought for example mehran et al 2015 firstly developed the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri for evaluating socioeconomic drought however this index cannot describe drought duration then guo et al 2019a further proposed an improved msrri imsrri in order to consider reservoir operation processes and the relationship between water supply and demand in addition shi et al 2018 proposed another index named socioeconomic drought index sedi through synthetically considering water deficit and duration of a socioeconomic drought event tu et al 2018 developed a framework of multivariate design of socioeconomic drought and the main properties include duration severity and peak all the above indices and methods can provide new ways of assessing socioeconomic drought events for a given region however none of these indices and methods focused on the whole pearl river basin prb in south china namely the study area of this study it is worth noting that global water demand has greatly increased in the past decades and will probably keep increasing at least in the near future because of continuous population growth and rapid economic development e g chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 which may lead to the occurrence of more socioeconomic drought events e g smirnov et al 2016 trinh et al 2017 furthermore climate change is recognized as a crucial factor that may have non negligible impacts on socioeconomic drought a changing climate may significantly influence water supply mainly from streamflow because even a slight climate change may cause a significant change in water cycle e g vicuna et al 2013 shi and wang 2015 lee et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 at the global scale many regions around the world will probably face the challenges of more frequent and severe hydrological extremes such as drought e g hirabayashi et al 2008 shi et al 2015 schwalm et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2019 specifically for china the difference of economic loss caused by drought disasters may reach 100 billion chinese yuan under two global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c su et al 2018 at the regional scale for the prb a number of previous studies on climate change have been conducted e g niu and chen 2010 fischer et al 2013 niu 2013 niu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2019b li et al 2020 dai et al 2020 for example niu et al 2014 investigated the historical extreme hydrological events over the prb during 1952 2000 through exploring the teleconnections between two climatic patterns and hydrological processes moreover in future the projected climate extremes over the prb during 2011 2050 indicated that the eastern and western parts would be warmer and drier fischer et al 2013 wang et al 2018 reported that the severity and variability of drought were expected to increase in this century in most regions of the prb mainly due to an increase in evapotranspiration wang et al 2019b applied a climate model to assess the effects of urbanization and global climate change in the pearl river delta and found that global climate change would increase the extreme heat stress level in this region however none of these studies on the whole prb focused on the assessment of future socioeconomic drought events from the above it is known that none of the previous studies on climate change over the whole prb focused on socioeconomic drought while none of the previous studies on socioeconomic drought focused on the whole prb therefore in order to fill such gaps this study aims to assess the future socioeconomic drought events under climate change over the prb the sedi proposed by shi et al 2018 will be adopted for analysis because it has been validated over the east river basin erb which is a sub basin of the prb in the following section 2 briefly introduces the methodologies used in this study i e the sedi and vic model section 3 describes the study area i e the prb and research data and section 4 presents the detailed results and discussion including 1 the miwr value of the prb 2 trend analysis of the future streamflow 3 identification of future socioeconomic drought events 4 impact of reservoirs and 5 limitations finally the major conclusions of this study are summarized in section 5 overall the outcomes of this study can provide valuable information for decision makers e g a better recognition of socioeconomic drought under a changing climate a reference for sustainable water resources management and a guideline of designing reservoir operation schemes 2 methodology fig 1 shows the technology roadmap of this study the first step is collection of various data such as the global circulation model gcm output the socioeconomic data e g population data and gross domestic product gdp data the historical streamflow data the reservoir operation data and so on second the miwr value of a given river basin which is regarded as the critical variable in identifying drought occurrence and duration is determined by analyzing the historical streamflow data and the projected future water demand see subsection 2 1 for details third the future streamflow is simulated with variable infiltration capacity vic model see subsection 2 2 for details and the gcm output and future socioeconomic drought events can then be identified by comparing the simulated streamflow data and the miwr value shi et al 2018 fourth different percentages of the used reservoir storage capacity are discussed to investigate the impact of reservoir operation on reducing the number of identified future socioeconomic drought events 2 1 socioeconomic drought index sedi the sedi proposed by shi et al 2018 which has been proved to be effective in the erb is adopted in this study to identify future socioeconomic drought events at the monthly scale the steps of the sedi calculation are as follows first the miwr value of a given river basin is calculated and used as the threshold value to identify drought occurrence and duration second the monthly streamflow data either the observed or simulated data are used to identify drought month through calculating the monthly difference between the monthly streamflow data and the corresponding miwr value a month with the monthly difference smaller than 0 i e water deficit will be regarded as a drought month third the cumulative water deficit is derived from the monthly water deficit and a drought event will continue until the cumulative water deficit turns into a non negative value then the drought duration i e the number of continuous drought months and water shortage i e the largest cumulative water deficit during the drought period of a drought event can be identified finally for an identified drought event the sedi value can be obtained through integrating the impacts of water shortage level wsl and drought duration level ddl the definition of the sedi value is as follows 1 s e d i max d d l w s l where the ddl and wsl both have four values i e 1 2 3 and 4 table 1 and the sedi value is defined as the larger one of the ddl and wsl values therefore the sedi also has four values i e 1 2 3 and 4 corresponding to the four levels of socioeconomic drought that is sedi 1 for slight level sedi 2 for moderate level sedi 3 for severe level and sedi 4 for extreme level more details of this index can be found in shi et al 2018 and only the following two aspects related to this index are further highlighted in this study first it is important to calculate the miwr value for a given river basin which is a vital component of the sedi the miwr is also regarded as the threshold value to sustain different functions e g water quality ecology navigation and water intake wu and chen 2013 which can be expressed as follows 2 m i w r max q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 q s where q 1 is the required value for maintaining water quality q 2 is the required value for ecology q 3 is the required value for navigation q s is the required value for preventing seawater intrusion and q 4 is the required value for water intake among these the values of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 are assumed to be invariable over time and their values can be obtained from past assessments of annual water resources by contrast the q s value is highly related to population growth and economic development and thus is assumed to be changeable over time shi et al 2018 using per capita gdp and population as two indicators chen et al 2015 have developed a long term water demand projection model based on multivariate linear regression method which has been proved to be applicable for regions such as hong kong the united kingdom the erb and the prb therefore in this study the miwr value of the study area which denotes the future water demand of the study area can be calculated with this model under different scenarios moreover in order to maintain the healthy life of a river the q s value is suggested to be no more than 30 of river discharge e g zuo 2011 shi et al 2018 second the definitions of the sedi on four levels i e slight moderate severe and extreme are the same as those in shi et al 2018 as well as the cutoff values of different wsl and ddl values table 1 for the wsl determination reservoir storage percentage rsp which is a variable related to typical reservoir storage usually equal to the effective storage capacity of a reservoir in a given river basin denver water 2002 is used as an indicator to classify different levels it is worth noting that the rsp can be calculated as the absolute value of the largest cumulative water deficit divided by the typical reservoir storage in this study the total manageable storage capacity tmsc of the reservoirs in a given river basin is used as the typical reservoir storage and therefore the dam data from the global reservoir and dam grand database lehner et al 2011 is also collected for calculating the tmsc value see subsection 3 2 for details for the ddl determination a socioeconomic drought event at the quarterly 1 3 months semi annual 4 6 months annual 7 12 months or longer more than one year scale is assigned the values of 1 2 3 and 4 respectively 2 2 variable infiltration capacity vic model vic model liang et al 1994 a macroscale land surface hydrological model that can solve full water and energy balances is used to simulate the future streamflow for identification of socioeconomic drought events vic model is originally developed by liang et al 1994 and further improved by hamman et al 2018 vic model uses the variable infiltration curve zhao et al 1980 which allows for the representation of sub grid variability in soil storage capacity and infiltration capacity and the parameterization of baseflow as a nonlinear recession curve from the bottom soil layer todini 1996 vic model can share a number of basic features with other land surface models that are commonly coupled to the gcms rvic model a source to sink model that can solve the saint venant equations is used as a post processor with vic model to separately simulate the routing of streamflow e g lohmann et al 1996 1998 vic model has been successfully applied to a lot of the large river basins around the world e g nijssen et al 2001 christensen et al 2004 andreadis et al 2005 niu and chen 2010 bao et al 2012 niu et al 2014 wang et al 2019a specifically for the prb two previous studies i e niu and chen 2010 niu et al 2014 indicated that the streamflow simulations from vic model were basically comparable to the observations from ten hydrological stations over the prb the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients for most of the ten hydrological stations were higher than 0 80 and the relative biases were generally within the range of 0 25 which can satisfy the performance ratings suggested by moriasi et al 2007 moreover niu et al 2017 examined the multi scale streamflow variability responses to precipitation over 16 headwater catchments over the prb using vic model and wang et al 2019a proposed an operation based reservoir scheme integrated with vic model to simulate the storage and outflow variations of reservoirs at the daily time step therefore this study directly uses the parameters obtained from the previous studies e g niu and chen 2010 niu et al 2014 to run vic model and rvic model over the prb and then the future streamflow under different climate change scenarios can be obtained 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the pearl river is the second largest river in china in terms of river discharge flowing through six provinces in south china fig 2 the prb consists of four parts i e the west river the north river the east river and the pearl river delta with the total drainage area of 453 690 km2 table 2 the annual average precipitation of the prb is 1 480 mm about 80 of which occurs from april to september moreover the precipitation over the prb are distributed with highly spatial temporal heterogeneities which may easily cause regional hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts e g niu and chen 2010 niu et al 2014 the long term annual average discharges of the whole prb and the prb excluding the pearl river delta are 10 518 m3 s and 9 525 m3 s respectively e g niu and chen 2010 and the details of the four parts are listed in table 2 more than 18 000 reservoirs have been constructed over the prb however there are only 41 large reservoirs with a reservoir capacity larger than 0 1 km3 e g the longtan reservoir i e 27 3 km3 in the west river basin wrb the feilaixia reservoir i e 1 9 km3 in the north river basin nrb and the xinfengjiang reservoir i e 13 9 km3 in the erb fig 2 the two pie diagrams in fig 2 indicate the 41 large reservoirs classified by the total storage capacity and main use in percent respectively it is worth noting that the two main uses of the large reservoirs in the prb are hydroelectricity 46 and irrigation 39 3 2 data our previous study i e shi et al 2018 has indicated that comparing against the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change ar4 the fourth assessment report gcms the ipcc ar5 the fifth assessment report gcms will provide a more optimistic estimation on future drought situation as a result in order to assess the possible worst case situation of future drought this study only selects the projected precipitation datasets derived from the outputs of 16 ar4 gcms during 1951 2099 see table 3 in this study the 16 ar4 gcms under three climate change scenarios i e special report on emissions scenario sres a1b a2 b1 are selected ipcc 2007 and therefore there will be 48 projected precipitation datasets derived from the 16 ar4 gcm outputs with 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution wood et al 2004 meehl et al 2007 moreover the soil and vegetation parameters extracted from the study of nijssen et al 2001 are used as the inputs of vic model to provide the simulated streamflow at the daily scale and the monthly simulated streamflow can be derived from the daily values the vegetation data are from the 1 km vegetation database on the basis of avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer data hansen et al 2000 the soil texture and soil bulk density are from the 5 min fao unesco food and agriculture united nations educational scientific and cultural organization digital soil map of the world and the wise world inventory of soil emission potentials pedon database the remaining soil parameters are obtained based on the study of cosby et al 1984 furthermore in order to explore the impact of reservoirs on drought analysis the grand database lehner et al 2011 is collected to calculate the tmsc value of the reservoirs in the prb in this database for each dam and related reservoir the basic information includes name year of completion longitude latitude height storage capacity installed capacity catchment area main use and so on however since the manageable storage capacity of a reservoir is not available in this database this study roughly assumes that the manageable storage capacity is equal to the total storage capacity of a reservoir as mentioned above this study only considers the 41 large reservoir with a reservoir capacity larger than 0 1 km3 in the prb by the year 2010 see fig 2 and thus the tmsc value is about 79 km3 which is regarded as the stored water in these reservoirs when the flood season ends 4 results and discussion 4 1 the miwr of the prb the miwr of the prb can be computed with eq 2 as the rivers in the pearl river delta are all small ones this study only considers the other three parts of the prb i e the wrb the nrb and the erb table 4 lists the estimated values of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 obtained from previous studies e g the required value for water quality prbwrpb et al 2000 lee et al 2007 ecology prbwrpb et al 2000 zhang et al 2010 navigation song and huang 2006 lee et al 2007 and seawater intrusion prevention wu et al 2001 liu et al 2013 it is worth noting that the q 3 value of the wrb is not available however this missing q 3 value would not be large enough to affect the miwr value of the prb this is because the required water for navigation will not be larger than that for maintaining water quality for the same river i e the q 1 value is 1 800 m3 s so that the total q 3 value will not be larger than 2 200 1 800 190 210 m3 s therefore the maximum value among q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 is 2 533 m3 s in the prb which is assumed to be a constant value in future furthermore the q s value will change over time because the regional water demand will increase due to population growth and economic development in future this will also lead to the change of the miwr value base on the estimated socioeconomic data e g population data and the gdp data of the six provinces i e guangdong guangxi yunnan guizhou hunan and jiangxi in south china within the boundary of the prb during 2020 2099 chen et al 2015 firstly projected the annual water demand in each of the six parts under three projection scenarios which represent the high medium and low development levels respectively then the annual water demand in the whole prb can be obtained by summing up the projected values of the annual water demand in these six parts for example under the medium scenario the annual water demand in the prb will keep increasing before the year 2075 followed by a declining trend from 2075 to 2099 similarly under the high scenario the annual water demand in the prb will keep increasing before the year 2085 and then decrease from 2085 to 2099 then combining with the maximum value of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 i e 2 533 m3 s the miwr value of the prb under the three projection scenarios for each year during 2020 2099 is computed fig 3 to assess future socioeconomic drought events on the average level the miwr values under the medium scenario are selected and the maximum q s value of 2 873 m3 s under this scenario is found in the year 2075 comparing with the annual average river discharge of the prb excluding the pearl river delta i e 9 525 m3 s table 2 the maximum q s value under this scenario accounts for 30 2 2 873 9 525 of the total river discharge which is quite close to the limited value i e 30 as a result other q s values under this scenario will meet the requirement for the water intake restriction since they are all smaller than the maximum q s value 4 2 tendency of future streamflow based on the future streamflow simulated with vic model and each of the 48 projected precipitation datasets tendency of the future streamflow in the prb is analyzed at the annual scale for each year during 2020 2099 using the mann kendall trend test method e g mann 1945 kendall 1975 thiel 1950 sen 1968 von storch and navarra 1995 shi et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2020 fig 4 shows the slopes of the detected trends for all the 48 datasets and the shadows indicate the statistically significant slopes at the significance level of p 0 1 it is observed that the slopes of the detected trends vary greatly among different datasets i e 1 68 to 3 89 mm year under a1b scenario 1 34 to 5 33 mm year under a2 scenario and 1 60 to 4 98 mm year under b1 scenario respectively in addition most of the 48 selected datasets i e 37 48 77 show the increasing trends and there are 12 13 and 12 datasets under a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively among them 20 datasets i e 20 37 54 1 show statistically significant increasing trends p 0 1 see fig 4 by contrast the remaining 11 datasets i e there are 4 a1b 3 a2 and 4 b1 respectively show the opposite trends among which the declining trend of only one dataset csiro mk3 0 1 is statistically significant p 0 1 see fig 4 specifically the largest increasing tendency i e 5 33 mm year is found in one dataset ukmo hadcm3 1 under a2 scenario while one dataset csiro mk3 0 1 under a1b scenario shows the largest declining tendency i e 1 68 mm year see fig 4 it is worth noting that the results of trend analysis of the future streamflow in the prb are generally similar to those in the erb shi et al 2018 that is for the future streamflow simulated with the 48 selected datasets at the annual scale the number of datasets showing the increasing trends is larger than that showing the declining trends it would be good if the future streamflow were evenly distributed in space and time unfortunately as significant spatial temporal variability exists in streamflow distribution there is often a mismatch between water supply and demand when coupled with population growth and economic development e g anctil and coulibaly 2004 tootle and piechota 2006 rubio alvarez and mcphee 2010 chen et al 2016 therefore the obtained results of trend analysis of the future streamflow in the prb do not mean that there must be fewer socioeconomic drought events from 2020 to 2099 especially at the monthly scale and thus the next subsection will conduct further analyses on assessing future socioeconomic drought events at the monthly scale 4 3 assessing future socioeconomic drought events based on the miwr values of the prb under the medium projection scenario fig 3 the simulated monthly streamflow in the prb and the sedi proposed by shi et al 2018 this study identifies the socioeconomic drought events from 2020 to 2099 and the relevant analyses are as follows first fig 5 a c present the numbers of the identified future socioeconomic drought events at different severity levels under the three selected scenarios and the results are rather different among various datasets for the total numbers of all the identified events the values fluctuate within the range of 73 105 for all the 48 datasets which are 75 101 a1b 73 105 a2 and 79 102 b1 respectively specifically the maximum i e 105 in the dataset of giss model e r 1 2 and minimum values i e 73 in the dataset of cnrm cm3 1 are both found under a2 scenario however for the mean of the total numbers under each of the selected scenarios the values are 89 a1b 87 a2 and 89 b1 respectively which are nearly on the same magnitude comparing with the mean values in the erb i e 100 a1b 99 a2 and 102 b1 respectively shi et al 2018 the situation of future socioeconomic drought events in the prb seems better at least in terms of the total number nevertheless with reference to the number of the identified extreme events for all the 48 datasets the overall percentage is 22 in the prb which is twice of that in the erb i e 11 for the same datasets moreover severe socioeconomic drought events account for the similar overall percentage 38 in the prb to that in the erb i e 35 for the same datasets as a result the situation of future socioeconomic drought events in the prb seems worse in terms of extreme socioeconomic drought events as mentioned above under a changing climate the occurrence of hydrological extremes such as drought at the global scale will probably be more frequent and the severity will be higher e g schwalm et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2019 this seems to be applicable to the situation of the whole prb second fig 5d presents the longest drought durations of the identified socioeconomic drought event for all the 48 datasets the mean value of all the 48 identified longest drought durations is 28 months in the prb which is lower than that in the erb i e 33 months shi et al 2018 and the mean values under the three selected scenarios are 26 a1b 34 a2 and 25 b1 respectively specifically in the erb the longest drought duration of the identified socioeconomic drought events is 93 months under a1b scenario i e in the dataset of csiro mk3 0 1 however under the same scenario the longest drought duration is only 34 months in the prb it indicates that some identified socioeconomic drought events in the erb may be mitigated through inter basin water planning and management for example the west to east water diversion project being constructed in guangdong province can transfer water from the wrb to the erb to release the pressure of water shortage in the erb in addition the top three values of all the 48 identified longest drought durations are all found in the datasets under a2 scenario i e 61 months miroc3 2 medres 1 59 months gfdl cm2 1 1 and 58 months cnrm cm3 1 respectively this is mainly due to that the a2 scenario represents high emission scenario with more evaporation and less surface runoff e g wang et al 2009 third for each of the 48 datasets the largest rsp value is calculated to present the most serious water shortage and the relevant results are listed in table 5 for all the 48 datasets the largest rsp values fluctuate within the range of 0 92 2 93 for the three selected scenarios the largest rsp values fluctuate within the ranges of 0 92 2 71 a1b 0 93 2 93 a2 and 0 96 1 79 b1 respectively and the corresponding mean values are 1 49 1 62 and 1 32 respectively moreover it is worth noting that most i e 40 48 83 of the largest rsp values are larger than 1 0 table 5 which indicates that there will still be water deficits in such cases even if the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb is run out as a result more reservoirs are needed to increase the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb and that is why some large reservoirs e g the datengxia project with the total storage capacity of 3 7 km3 have been either planned or under construction in recent years e g zhang et al 2020 4 4 impact of reservoirs previous studies e g chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 xu et al 2017 2019 revealed that reservoir is of great importance to sustainable water resources utilization and thus the impact of the reservoirs in the prb on mitigating socioeconomic drought events is further investigated in this subsection fig 6 shows the monthly available water volume of the reservoirs in the prb during 2020 2099 for two representative datasets which are ukmo hadcm3 1 under a1b scenario i e the best case the largest rsp 0 92 and cnrm cm3 1 under a2 scenario i e the worst case the largest rsp 2 93 respectively the red dashed lines in fig 6a and b denote the situation that the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb i e 79 km3 is run out for the selected dataset under a1b scenario the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb seems to be enough to meet future water demand because the blue line in fig 6a is above the red dashed line by contrast for the selected dataset under a2 scenario part of the blue line is below the red dashed line which indicates that the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb i e 79 km3 is still not enough to alleviate some socioeconomic drought events with serious water shortage see fig 6b furthermore it is roughly assumed in this study that the manageable storage capacity of a reservoir is equal to its total storage capacity which will certainly overestimate the role of the reservoir in water supply actually the available water volume of the reservoirs in the prb when the flood season ends is usually less than the tmsc value i e 79 km3 and this can affect the results of future drought analysis to a certain extent to quantify this impact the numbers of the identified future socioeconomic drought events considering different used percentages of the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb is calculated and further discussed for all the 48 datasets and the interval of the used percentage of the tmsc is 10 the relevant results are shown in fig 7 i e the red circles denote the datasets under a1b scenario the blue squares denote the datasets under a2 scenario and the green triangles denote the datasets under b1 scenario respectively to facilitate analysis the mean value of the numbers of the identified future socioeconomic drought events is calculated for each of the used percentages of the tmsc i e 0 10 20 30 100 and it is clear that the mean values present an overall declining trend along with the increase of the used percentage of the tmsc see the gray dashed line in fig 7 which can be divided into three phases with the average slopes of 0 61 1 07 and 0 60 respectively see the three black lines in fig 7 the r 2 values are all over 0 97 indicating quite high goodness of fit the two cutoff values of the three phases are found within the range of 30 40 and 80 90 respectively known from fig 7 only fewer than 20 socioeconomic drought events are still remaining on average when more than 80 of the tmsc is used however it may not be practical to reserve so much water because the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb has already been overestimated if only focusing on extreme and severe events the suggested value of the used percentages of the tmsc will reduce to 40 in this circumstance there will be 2 3 and 1 extreme socioeconomic drought events and 8 9 and 9 severe socioeconomic drought events during 2020 2099 under a1b a2 b1 scenarios respectively since it is an acceptable result this study suggests that at least 40 of the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb should be reserved when the flood season ends 4 5 limitations taking the prb as a larger study area than the erb shi et al 2018 this study further validates the effectiveness of the sedi in humid regions with reservoir operation however this study still has the following limitations first when calculating the miwr which is one of the key variables to calculate the sedi the values of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 are assumed to be invariable over time this may be oversimplified because the q 1 for water quality and q 2 for ecology values can have seasonal variations e g olias et al 2004 huang et al 2014 therefore further studies can be conducted to investigate the potential impacts on the process of socioeconomic drought event identification second since the rsp is another key variable to calculate the sedi whether the sedi is applicable in arid semi arid regions or regions without reservoir operation may need more validations in future studies one option is to replace the rsp with a generalized value of regional water supply which can be simply considered as the total available water resources in a given region third the successful applications of the sedi at the monthly scale do not mean that this index will also be effective at smaller time scales e g ten day scale and daily scale generally the smaller the time scale the more significant the alternation between dryness and wetness for example a heavy rainfall event may possibly interrupt a socioeconomic drought event and thus how to evaluate the impact on drought persistence is an important issue in further studies fourth although a number of studies on socioeconomic drought have been conducted its physical mechanism is still unclear which is worth thorough investigation one option is to analyze the relationships of socioeconomic drought with atmospheric characteristics e g air temperature air pressure and wind field main climatic patterns e g el niño southern oscillation enso and sea surface temperature 5 conclusions this study assesses the future socioeconomic drought events under climate change over the prb in south china during 2020 2099 using the index i e the sedi proposed by shi et al 2018 the major findings of this study are summarized as follows first this study provides the miwr value of the prb for each year from 2020 to 2099 which can be used as a criterion of sustainable water resources utilization in this river basin second the trend analysis of the future streamflow simulated with vic model and 48 datasets is conducted in the prb and the results indicate that the number of datasets showing the increasing trends is larger than that showing the declining trends in this river basin third this study identifies future socioeconomic drought events in the prb during 2020 2099 and the results indicate that the situation in the prb is better than that in the erb fourth this study explores the impact of the reservoirs on drought analysis in the prb and suggests reserving at least 40 of the tmsc in the reservoirs in order to mitigate most of the identified future socioeconomic drought events at severe and extreme levels overall the sedi and the obtained results of the identified socioeconomic drought events can improve the recognition of drought from a socioeconomic perspective which would be of great

8340,study region pearl river basin prb in south china study focus this study aims to assess future socioeconomic drought events under a changing climate over the study region variable infiltration capacity vic model is used to simulate the streamflow in the prb during the period of 2020 2099 and 48 projected precipitation datasets from general circulation models gcms are selected to drive the vic model at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution then the minimum in stream water requirement miwr of the prb is determined and trend analysis of the simulated streamflow is conducted socioeconomic drought index sedi is used to detect the occurrence of socioeconomic drought event and further the impact of the reservoirs in the prb on drought analysis is evaluated new hydrological insights for the region based on any dataset nearly one hundred socioeconomic drought events at different severity levels can be identified in the prb however most of them especially those at severe and extreme levels can be mitigated through reservoir operation i e reserving at least 40 of the total manageable storage capacity tmsc in the reservoirs overall this study can improve the recognition of future socioeconomic drought events which is of great value for our society to effectively assess the impacts of climate change and water projects on sustainable water resources utilization in such river basins keywords sedi climate change gcm vic model pearl river basin 1 introduction drought is a natural hazard that usually occurs across a relatively large spatial temporal scale according to american meteorological society 2013 four categories of drought can be defined namely meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic drought respectively a great number of previous research works have studied the former three categories of drought and a lot of drought indices have been developed or proposed in the past decades e g palmer 1965 heim 2002 shukla and wood 2008 vicente serrano et al 2010 moorhead et al 2015 lin et al 2017 sun et al 2019 some representative drought indices include standardized precipitation index spi palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei standardized runoff index sri and so on however for the fourth category i e socioeconomic drought several indices have been proposed since 2015 e g mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016 shi et al 2018 tu et al 2018 guo et al 2019a 2019b normally the occurrence of socioeconomic drought is in association with water supply and water demand against the minimum in stream water requirement miwr in the earlier years several studies e g fraser et al 2008 bosongo et al 2014 maia et al 2015 eklund and seaquist 2015 have begun to discuss the socioeconomic characteristics impacts of drought for example fraser et al 2008 provided a preliminary step to quantify socioeconomic characteristics of drought sensitive regions in china bosongo et al 2014 analyzed the socioeconomic impacts of droughts in the middle zambezi river basin eklund and seaquist 2015 emphasized the importance of understanding drought from both physical and socioeconomic perspectives similar to the other three categories of drought several relevant drought indices have been developed to describe socioeconomic drought for example mehran et al 2015 firstly developed the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri for evaluating socioeconomic drought however this index cannot describe drought duration then guo et al 2019a further proposed an improved msrri imsrri in order to consider reservoir operation processes and the relationship between water supply and demand in addition shi et al 2018 proposed another index named socioeconomic drought index sedi through synthetically considering water deficit and duration of a socioeconomic drought event tu et al 2018 developed a framework of multivariate design of socioeconomic drought and the main properties include duration severity and peak all the above indices and methods can provide new ways of assessing socioeconomic drought events for a given region however none of these indices and methods focused on the whole pearl river basin prb in south china namely the study area of this study it is worth noting that global water demand has greatly increased in the past decades and will probably keep increasing at least in the near future because of continuous population growth and rapid economic development e g chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 which may lead to the occurrence of more socioeconomic drought events e g smirnov et al 2016 trinh et al 2017 furthermore climate change is recognized as a crucial factor that may have non negligible impacts on socioeconomic drought a changing climate may significantly influence water supply mainly from streamflow because even a slight climate change may cause a significant change in water cycle e g vicuna et al 2013 shi and wang 2015 lee et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 at the global scale many regions around the world will probably face the challenges of more frequent and severe hydrological extremes such as drought e g hirabayashi et al 2008 shi et al 2015 schwalm et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2019 specifically for china the difference of economic loss caused by drought disasters may reach 100 billion chinese yuan under two global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c su et al 2018 at the regional scale for the prb a number of previous studies on climate change have been conducted e g niu and chen 2010 fischer et al 2013 niu 2013 niu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2019b li et al 2020 dai et al 2020 for example niu et al 2014 investigated the historical extreme hydrological events over the prb during 1952 2000 through exploring the teleconnections between two climatic patterns and hydrological processes moreover in future the projected climate extremes over the prb during 2011 2050 indicated that the eastern and western parts would be warmer and drier fischer et al 2013 wang et al 2018 reported that the severity and variability of drought were expected to increase in this century in most regions of the prb mainly due to an increase in evapotranspiration wang et al 2019b applied a climate model to assess the effects of urbanization and global climate change in the pearl river delta and found that global climate change would increase the extreme heat stress level in this region however none of these studies on the whole prb focused on the assessment of future socioeconomic drought events from the above it is known that none of the previous studies on climate change over the whole prb focused on socioeconomic drought while none of the previous studies on socioeconomic drought focused on the whole prb therefore in order to fill such gaps this study aims to assess the future socioeconomic drought events under climate change over the prb the sedi proposed by shi et al 2018 will be adopted for analysis because it has been validated over the east river basin erb which is a sub basin of the prb in the following section 2 briefly introduces the methodologies used in this study i e the sedi and vic model section 3 describes the study area i e the prb and research data and section 4 presents the detailed results and discussion including 1 the miwr value of the prb 2 trend analysis of the future streamflow 3 identification of future socioeconomic drought events 4 impact of reservoirs and 5 limitations finally the major conclusions of this study are summarized in section 5 overall the outcomes of this study can provide valuable information for decision makers e g a better recognition of socioeconomic drought under a changing climate a reference for sustainable water resources management and a guideline of designing reservoir operation schemes 2 methodology fig 1 shows the technology roadmap of this study the first step is collection of various data such as the global circulation model gcm output the socioeconomic data e g population data and gross domestic product gdp data the historical streamflow data the reservoir operation data and so on second the miwr value of a given river basin which is regarded as the critical variable in identifying drought occurrence and duration is determined by analyzing the historical streamflow data and the projected future water demand see subsection 2 1 for details third the future streamflow is simulated with variable infiltration capacity vic model see subsection 2 2 for details and the gcm output and future socioeconomic drought events can then be identified by comparing the simulated streamflow data and the miwr value shi et al 2018 fourth different percentages of the used reservoir storage capacity are discussed to investigate the impact of reservoir operation on reducing the number of identified future socioeconomic drought events 2 1 socioeconomic drought index sedi the sedi proposed by shi et al 2018 which has been proved to be effective in the erb is adopted in this study to identify future socioeconomic drought events at the monthly scale the steps of the sedi calculation are as follows first the miwr value of a given river basin is calculated and used as the threshold value to identify drought occurrence and duration second the monthly streamflow data either the observed or simulated data are used to identify drought month through calculating the monthly difference between the monthly streamflow data and the corresponding miwr value a month with the monthly difference smaller than 0 i e water deficit will be regarded as a drought month third the cumulative water deficit is derived from the monthly water deficit and a drought event will continue until the cumulative water deficit turns into a non negative value then the drought duration i e the number of continuous drought months and water shortage i e the largest cumulative water deficit during the drought period of a drought event can be identified finally for an identified drought event the sedi value can be obtained through integrating the impacts of water shortage level wsl and drought duration level ddl the definition of the sedi value is as follows 1 s e d i max d d l w s l where the ddl and wsl both have four values i e 1 2 3 and 4 table 1 and the sedi value is defined as the larger one of the ddl and wsl values therefore the sedi also has four values i e 1 2 3 and 4 corresponding to the four levels of socioeconomic drought that is sedi 1 for slight level sedi 2 for moderate level sedi 3 for severe level and sedi 4 for extreme level more details of this index can be found in shi et al 2018 and only the following two aspects related to this index are further highlighted in this study first it is important to calculate the miwr value for a given river basin which is a vital component of the sedi the miwr is also regarded as the threshold value to sustain different functions e g water quality ecology navigation and water intake wu and chen 2013 which can be expressed as follows 2 m i w r max q 1 q 2 q 3 q 4 q s where q 1 is the required value for maintaining water quality q 2 is the required value for ecology q 3 is the required value for navigation q s is the required value for preventing seawater intrusion and q 4 is the required value for water intake among these the values of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 are assumed to be invariable over time and their values can be obtained from past assessments of annual water resources by contrast the q s value is highly related to population growth and economic development and thus is assumed to be changeable over time shi et al 2018 using per capita gdp and population as two indicators chen et al 2015 have developed a long term water demand projection model based on multivariate linear regression method which has been proved to be applicable for regions such as hong kong the united kingdom the erb and the prb therefore in this study the miwr value of the study area which denotes the future water demand of the study area can be calculated with this model under different scenarios moreover in order to maintain the healthy life of a river the q s value is suggested to be no more than 30 of river discharge e g zuo 2011 shi et al 2018 second the definitions of the sedi on four levels i e slight moderate severe and extreme are the same as those in shi et al 2018 as well as the cutoff values of different wsl and ddl values table 1 for the wsl determination reservoir storage percentage rsp which is a variable related to typical reservoir storage usually equal to the effective storage capacity of a reservoir in a given river basin denver water 2002 is used as an indicator to classify different levels it is worth noting that the rsp can be calculated as the absolute value of the largest cumulative water deficit divided by the typical reservoir storage in this study the total manageable storage capacity tmsc of the reservoirs in a given river basin is used as the typical reservoir storage and therefore the dam data from the global reservoir and dam grand database lehner et al 2011 is also collected for calculating the tmsc value see subsection 3 2 for details for the ddl determination a socioeconomic drought event at the quarterly 1 3 months semi annual 4 6 months annual 7 12 months or longer more than one year scale is assigned the values of 1 2 3 and 4 respectively 2 2 variable infiltration capacity vic model vic model liang et al 1994 a macroscale land surface hydrological model that can solve full water and energy balances is used to simulate the future streamflow for identification of socioeconomic drought events vic model is originally developed by liang et al 1994 and further improved by hamman et al 2018 vic model uses the variable infiltration curve zhao et al 1980 which allows for the representation of sub grid variability in soil storage capacity and infiltration capacity and the parameterization of baseflow as a nonlinear recession curve from the bottom soil layer todini 1996 vic model can share a number of basic features with other land surface models that are commonly coupled to the gcms rvic model a source to sink model that can solve the saint venant equations is used as a post processor with vic model to separately simulate the routing of streamflow e g lohmann et al 1996 1998 vic model has been successfully applied to a lot of the large river basins around the world e g nijssen et al 2001 christensen et al 2004 andreadis et al 2005 niu and chen 2010 bao et al 2012 niu et al 2014 wang et al 2019a specifically for the prb two previous studies i e niu and chen 2010 niu et al 2014 indicated that the streamflow simulations from vic model were basically comparable to the observations from ten hydrological stations over the prb the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients for most of the ten hydrological stations were higher than 0 80 and the relative biases were generally within the range of 0 25 which can satisfy the performance ratings suggested by moriasi et al 2007 moreover niu et al 2017 examined the multi scale streamflow variability responses to precipitation over 16 headwater catchments over the prb using vic model and wang et al 2019a proposed an operation based reservoir scheme integrated with vic model to simulate the storage and outflow variations of reservoirs at the daily time step therefore this study directly uses the parameters obtained from the previous studies e g niu and chen 2010 niu et al 2014 to run vic model and rvic model over the prb and then the future streamflow under different climate change scenarios can be obtained 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the pearl river is the second largest river in china in terms of river discharge flowing through six provinces in south china fig 2 the prb consists of four parts i e the west river the north river the east river and the pearl river delta with the total drainage area of 453 690 km2 table 2 the annual average precipitation of the prb is 1 480 mm about 80 of which occurs from april to september moreover the precipitation over the prb are distributed with highly spatial temporal heterogeneities which may easily cause regional hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts e g niu and chen 2010 niu et al 2014 the long term annual average discharges of the whole prb and the prb excluding the pearl river delta are 10 518 m3 s and 9 525 m3 s respectively e g niu and chen 2010 and the details of the four parts are listed in table 2 more than 18 000 reservoirs have been constructed over the prb however there are only 41 large reservoirs with a reservoir capacity larger than 0 1 km3 e g the longtan reservoir i e 27 3 km3 in the west river basin wrb the feilaixia reservoir i e 1 9 km3 in the north river basin nrb and the xinfengjiang reservoir i e 13 9 km3 in the erb fig 2 the two pie diagrams in fig 2 indicate the 41 large reservoirs classified by the total storage capacity and main use in percent respectively it is worth noting that the two main uses of the large reservoirs in the prb are hydroelectricity 46 and irrigation 39 3 2 data our previous study i e shi et al 2018 has indicated that comparing against the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change ar4 the fourth assessment report gcms the ipcc ar5 the fifth assessment report gcms will provide a more optimistic estimation on future drought situation as a result in order to assess the possible worst case situation of future drought this study only selects the projected precipitation datasets derived from the outputs of 16 ar4 gcms during 1951 2099 see table 3 in this study the 16 ar4 gcms under three climate change scenarios i e special report on emissions scenario sres a1b a2 b1 are selected ipcc 2007 and therefore there will be 48 projected precipitation datasets derived from the 16 ar4 gcm outputs with 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution wood et al 2004 meehl et al 2007 moreover the soil and vegetation parameters extracted from the study of nijssen et al 2001 are used as the inputs of vic model to provide the simulated streamflow at the daily scale and the monthly simulated streamflow can be derived from the daily values the vegetation data are from the 1 km vegetation database on the basis of avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer data hansen et al 2000 the soil texture and soil bulk density are from the 5 min fao unesco food and agriculture united nations educational scientific and cultural organization digital soil map of the world and the wise world inventory of soil emission potentials pedon database the remaining soil parameters are obtained based on the study of cosby et al 1984 furthermore in order to explore the impact of reservoirs on drought analysis the grand database lehner et al 2011 is collected to calculate the tmsc value of the reservoirs in the prb in this database for each dam and related reservoir the basic information includes name year of completion longitude latitude height storage capacity installed capacity catchment area main use and so on however since the manageable storage capacity of a reservoir is not available in this database this study roughly assumes that the manageable storage capacity is equal to the total storage capacity of a reservoir as mentioned above this study only considers the 41 large reservoir with a reservoir capacity larger than 0 1 km3 in the prb by the year 2010 see fig 2 and thus the tmsc value is about 79 km3 which is regarded as the stored water in these reservoirs when the flood season ends 4 results and discussion 4 1 the miwr of the prb the miwr of the prb can be computed with eq 2 as the rivers in the pearl river delta are all small ones this study only considers the other three parts of the prb i e the wrb the nrb and the erb table 4 lists the estimated values of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 obtained from previous studies e g the required value for water quality prbwrpb et al 2000 lee et al 2007 ecology prbwrpb et al 2000 zhang et al 2010 navigation song and huang 2006 lee et al 2007 and seawater intrusion prevention wu et al 2001 liu et al 2013 it is worth noting that the q 3 value of the wrb is not available however this missing q 3 value would not be large enough to affect the miwr value of the prb this is because the required water for navigation will not be larger than that for maintaining water quality for the same river i e the q 1 value is 1 800 m3 s so that the total q 3 value will not be larger than 2 200 1 800 190 210 m3 s therefore the maximum value among q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 is 2 533 m3 s in the prb which is assumed to be a constant value in future furthermore the q s value will change over time because the regional water demand will increase due to population growth and economic development in future this will also lead to the change of the miwr value base on the estimated socioeconomic data e g population data and the gdp data of the six provinces i e guangdong guangxi yunnan guizhou hunan and jiangxi in south china within the boundary of the prb during 2020 2099 chen et al 2015 firstly projected the annual water demand in each of the six parts under three projection scenarios which represent the high medium and low development levels respectively then the annual water demand in the whole prb can be obtained by summing up the projected values of the annual water demand in these six parts for example under the medium scenario the annual water demand in the prb will keep increasing before the year 2075 followed by a declining trend from 2075 to 2099 similarly under the high scenario the annual water demand in the prb will keep increasing before the year 2085 and then decrease from 2085 to 2099 then combining with the maximum value of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 i e 2 533 m3 s the miwr value of the prb under the three projection scenarios for each year during 2020 2099 is computed fig 3 to assess future socioeconomic drought events on the average level the miwr values under the medium scenario are selected and the maximum q s value of 2 873 m3 s under this scenario is found in the year 2075 comparing with the annual average river discharge of the prb excluding the pearl river delta i e 9 525 m3 s table 2 the maximum q s value under this scenario accounts for 30 2 2 873 9 525 of the total river discharge which is quite close to the limited value i e 30 as a result other q s values under this scenario will meet the requirement for the water intake restriction since they are all smaller than the maximum q s value 4 2 tendency of future streamflow based on the future streamflow simulated with vic model and each of the 48 projected precipitation datasets tendency of the future streamflow in the prb is analyzed at the annual scale for each year during 2020 2099 using the mann kendall trend test method e g mann 1945 kendall 1975 thiel 1950 sen 1968 von storch and navarra 1995 shi et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2020 fig 4 shows the slopes of the detected trends for all the 48 datasets and the shadows indicate the statistically significant slopes at the significance level of p 0 1 it is observed that the slopes of the detected trends vary greatly among different datasets i e 1 68 to 3 89 mm year under a1b scenario 1 34 to 5 33 mm year under a2 scenario and 1 60 to 4 98 mm year under b1 scenario respectively in addition most of the 48 selected datasets i e 37 48 77 show the increasing trends and there are 12 13 and 12 datasets under a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively among them 20 datasets i e 20 37 54 1 show statistically significant increasing trends p 0 1 see fig 4 by contrast the remaining 11 datasets i e there are 4 a1b 3 a2 and 4 b1 respectively show the opposite trends among which the declining trend of only one dataset csiro mk3 0 1 is statistically significant p 0 1 see fig 4 specifically the largest increasing tendency i e 5 33 mm year is found in one dataset ukmo hadcm3 1 under a2 scenario while one dataset csiro mk3 0 1 under a1b scenario shows the largest declining tendency i e 1 68 mm year see fig 4 it is worth noting that the results of trend analysis of the future streamflow in the prb are generally similar to those in the erb shi et al 2018 that is for the future streamflow simulated with the 48 selected datasets at the annual scale the number of datasets showing the increasing trends is larger than that showing the declining trends it would be good if the future streamflow were evenly distributed in space and time unfortunately as significant spatial temporal variability exists in streamflow distribution there is often a mismatch between water supply and demand when coupled with population growth and economic development e g anctil and coulibaly 2004 tootle and piechota 2006 rubio alvarez and mcphee 2010 chen et al 2016 therefore the obtained results of trend analysis of the future streamflow in the prb do not mean that there must be fewer socioeconomic drought events from 2020 to 2099 especially at the monthly scale and thus the next subsection will conduct further analyses on assessing future socioeconomic drought events at the monthly scale 4 3 assessing future socioeconomic drought events based on the miwr values of the prb under the medium projection scenario fig 3 the simulated monthly streamflow in the prb and the sedi proposed by shi et al 2018 this study identifies the socioeconomic drought events from 2020 to 2099 and the relevant analyses are as follows first fig 5 a c present the numbers of the identified future socioeconomic drought events at different severity levels under the three selected scenarios and the results are rather different among various datasets for the total numbers of all the identified events the values fluctuate within the range of 73 105 for all the 48 datasets which are 75 101 a1b 73 105 a2 and 79 102 b1 respectively specifically the maximum i e 105 in the dataset of giss model e r 1 2 and minimum values i e 73 in the dataset of cnrm cm3 1 are both found under a2 scenario however for the mean of the total numbers under each of the selected scenarios the values are 89 a1b 87 a2 and 89 b1 respectively which are nearly on the same magnitude comparing with the mean values in the erb i e 100 a1b 99 a2 and 102 b1 respectively shi et al 2018 the situation of future socioeconomic drought events in the prb seems better at least in terms of the total number nevertheless with reference to the number of the identified extreme events for all the 48 datasets the overall percentage is 22 in the prb which is twice of that in the erb i e 11 for the same datasets moreover severe socioeconomic drought events account for the similar overall percentage 38 in the prb to that in the erb i e 35 for the same datasets as a result the situation of future socioeconomic drought events in the prb seems worse in terms of extreme socioeconomic drought events as mentioned above under a changing climate the occurrence of hydrological extremes such as drought at the global scale will probably be more frequent and the severity will be higher e g schwalm et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2019 this seems to be applicable to the situation of the whole prb second fig 5d presents the longest drought durations of the identified socioeconomic drought event for all the 48 datasets the mean value of all the 48 identified longest drought durations is 28 months in the prb which is lower than that in the erb i e 33 months shi et al 2018 and the mean values under the three selected scenarios are 26 a1b 34 a2 and 25 b1 respectively specifically in the erb the longest drought duration of the identified socioeconomic drought events is 93 months under a1b scenario i e in the dataset of csiro mk3 0 1 however under the same scenario the longest drought duration is only 34 months in the prb it indicates that some identified socioeconomic drought events in the erb may be mitigated through inter basin water planning and management for example the west to east water diversion project being constructed in guangdong province can transfer water from the wrb to the erb to release the pressure of water shortage in the erb in addition the top three values of all the 48 identified longest drought durations are all found in the datasets under a2 scenario i e 61 months miroc3 2 medres 1 59 months gfdl cm2 1 1 and 58 months cnrm cm3 1 respectively this is mainly due to that the a2 scenario represents high emission scenario with more evaporation and less surface runoff e g wang et al 2009 third for each of the 48 datasets the largest rsp value is calculated to present the most serious water shortage and the relevant results are listed in table 5 for all the 48 datasets the largest rsp values fluctuate within the range of 0 92 2 93 for the three selected scenarios the largest rsp values fluctuate within the ranges of 0 92 2 71 a1b 0 93 2 93 a2 and 0 96 1 79 b1 respectively and the corresponding mean values are 1 49 1 62 and 1 32 respectively moreover it is worth noting that most i e 40 48 83 of the largest rsp values are larger than 1 0 table 5 which indicates that there will still be water deficits in such cases even if the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb is run out as a result more reservoirs are needed to increase the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb and that is why some large reservoirs e g the datengxia project with the total storage capacity of 3 7 km3 have been either planned or under construction in recent years e g zhang et al 2020 4 4 impact of reservoirs previous studies e g chen et al 2016 shi et al 2019 xu et al 2017 2019 revealed that reservoir is of great importance to sustainable water resources utilization and thus the impact of the reservoirs in the prb on mitigating socioeconomic drought events is further investigated in this subsection fig 6 shows the monthly available water volume of the reservoirs in the prb during 2020 2099 for two representative datasets which are ukmo hadcm3 1 under a1b scenario i e the best case the largest rsp 0 92 and cnrm cm3 1 under a2 scenario i e the worst case the largest rsp 2 93 respectively the red dashed lines in fig 6a and b denote the situation that the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb i e 79 km3 is run out for the selected dataset under a1b scenario the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb seems to be enough to meet future water demand because the blue line in fig 6a is above the red dashed line by contrast for the selected dataset under a2 scenario part of the blue line is below the red dashed line which indicates that the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb i e 79 km3 is still not enough to alleviate some socioeconomic drought events with serious water shortage see fig 6b furthermore it is roughly assumed in this study that the manageable storage capacity of a reservoir is equal to its total storage capacity which will certainly overestimate the role of the reservoir in water supply actually the available water volume of the reservoirs in the prb when the flood season ends is usually less than the tmsc value i e 79 km3 and this can affect the results of future drought analysis to a certain extent to quantify this impact the numbers of the identified future socioeconomic drought events considering different used percentages of the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb is calculated and further discussed for all the 48 datasets and the interval of the used percentage of the tmsc is 10 the relevant results are shown in fig 7 i e the red circles denote the datasets under a1b scenario the blue squares denote the datasets under a2 scenario and the green triangles denote the datasets under b1 scenario respectively to facilitate analysis the mean value of the numbers of the identified future socioeconomic drought events is calculated for each of the used percentages of the tmsc i e 0 10 20 30 100 and it is clear that the mean values present an overall declining trend along with the increase of the used percentage of the tmsc see the gray dashed line in fig 7 which can be divided into three phases with the average slopes of 0 61 1 07 and 0 60 respectively see the three black lines in fig 7 the r 2 values are all over 0 97 indicating quite high goodness of fit the two cutoff values of the three phases are found within the range of 30 40 and 80 90 respectively known from fig 7 only fewer than 20 socioeconomic drought events are still remaining on average when more than 80 of the tmsc is used however it may not be practical to reserve so much water because the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb has already been overestimated if only focusing on extreme and severe events the suggested value of the used percentages of the tmsc will reduce to 40 in this circumstance there will be 2 3 and 1 extreme socioeconomic drought events and 8 9 and 9 severe socioeconomic drought events during 2020 2099 under a1b a2 b1 scenarios respectively since it is an acceptable result this study suggests that at least 40 of the tmsc of the reservoirs in the prb should be reserved when the flood season ends 4 5 limitations taking the prb as a larger study area than the erb shi et al 2018 this study further validates the effectiveness of the sedi in humid regions with reservoir operation however this study still has the following limitations first when calculating the miwr which is one of the key variables to calculate the sedi the values of q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 are assumed to be invariable over time this may be oversimplified because the q 1 for water quality and q 2 for ecology values can have seasonal variations e g olias et al 2004 huang et al 2014 therefore further studies can be conducted to investigate the potential impacts on the process of socioeconomic drought event identification second since the rsp is another key variable to calculate the sedi whether the sedi is applicable in arid semi arid regions or regions without reservoir operation may need more validations in future studies one option is to replace the rsp with a generalized value of regional water supply which can be simply considered as the total available water resources in a given region third the successful applications of the sedi at the monthly scale do not mean that this index will also be effective at smaller time scales e g ten day scale and daily scale generally the smaller the time scale the more significant the alternation between dryness and wetness for example a heavy rainfall event may possibly interrupt a socioeconomic drought event and thus how to evaluate the impact on drought persistence is an important issue in further studies fourth although a number of studies on socioeconomic drought have been conducted its physical mechanism is still unclear which is worth thorough investigation one option is to analyze the relationships of socioeconomic drought with atmospheric characteristics e g air temperature air pressure and wind field main climatic patterns e g el niño southern oscillation enso and sea surface temperature 5 conclusions this study assesses the future socioeconomic drought events under climate change over the prb in south china during 2020 2099 using the index i e the sedi proposed by shi et al 2018 the major findings of this study are summarized as follows first this study provides the miwr value of the prb for each year from 2020 to 2099 which can be used as a criterion of sustainable water resources utilization in this river basin second the trend analysis of the future streamflow simulated with vic model and 48 datasets is conducted in the prb and the results indicate that the number of datasets showing the increasing trends is larger than that showing the declining trends in this river basin third this study identifies future socioeconomic drought events in the prb during 2020 2099 and the results indicate that the situation in the prb is better than that in the erb fourth this study explores the impact of the reservoirs on drought analysis in the prb and suggests reserving at least 40 of the tmsc in the reservoirs in order to mitigate most of the identified future socioeconomic drought events at severe and extreme levels overall the sedi and the obtained results of the identified socioeconomic drought events can improve the recognition of drought from a socioeconomic perspective which would be of great value for our society to effectively assess the impacts of climate change and water projects on sustainable water resources utilization credit authorship contribution statement suning liu formal

8341,study region the ungauged agriculturally dominated la vi river basin vietnam study focus groundwater abstraction for food and industrial production is increasing globally putting pressure on groundwater resources and associated ecosystems in many countries monitoring of abstraction is poorly organised resulting in a paucity of data particularly in developing regions therefore alternative approaches to estimate groundwater withdrawals are necessary in this study two soft data approaches for indirect catchment scale groundwater abstraction estimation are developed using 1 local knowledge through a qualitative field survey of groundwater level fluctuations and groundwater withdrawals and 2 land use data combined with local knowledge on cropping and irrigation practices new hydrological insights for the region the approaches are tested and applied for the la vi river basin for the 2016 dry season total dry season estimated abstractions of 31 07 106 m3 and 36 19 106 m3 resulted from the two approaches the advantage of the second approach is the spatial distribution of the estimated groundwater abstraction aligning highly intensive abstractions with intensive agricultural areas despite high uncertainty in both estimates this quantitative estimate gives valuable information for water managers and the relatively good agreement between the methods provides trust in the estimates the approaches are cost effective and computationally simple solutions for estimating groundwater abstraction in data poor regions keywords groundwater abstraction soft data irrigation domestic consumption 1 introduction over the last half century there has been a significant expansion in global groundwater abstraction to satisfy water demand and food security for the growing population llamas and martínez santos 2005 wada et al 2010 qureshi 2011 rasul 2016 the resulting consequences include declining groundwater tables degradation in groundwater quality due to pollution from agricultural use of fertilisers and pesticides and seawater intrusion llamas and martínez santos 2005 giordano 2009 von rohden et al 2010 nazemi and wheater 2015 in many developing countries in particular there is a rapid change in land use from natural landscapes to farmland or urban areas resulting in strongly exploited groundwater systems giordano 2009 as governmental regulation is lacking llamas and martinez 2005 however due to the relatively long response times of aquifers to external pressures there is often potential for appropriate regulation to be established before groundwater systems are irreversibly impacted cuthbert et al 2019 but knowledge of both groundwater use and availability is imperative for this adaptive management groundwater abstraction data in particular is essential for groundwater management and development qureshi et al 2010 cheema et al 2014 rasul 2016 however groundwater abstractions are difficult to estimate accurately especially in developing countries where insufficient groundwater monitoring infrastructure exists giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 where groundwater monitoring infrastructure is insufficient alternative data sources can be used to estimate groundwater withdrawals also called soft data alternative information relevant for estimating groundwater abstraction includes local knowledge of aquifer and land use practices or upscaled statistical data seibert and mcdonnell 2002 although the use of soft data can provide a useful information source several assumptions are typically needed when using this information quantitatively for example maréchal et al 2006 used land use data in combination with a determined consumption rate i e amount of water irrigated per unit area for estimating the amount of groundwater extracted for irrigation on paddy rice at a pilot watershed the authors assumed the absence of base flow to the streams and that agriculture was the unique groundwater user when estimating groundwater abstraction qureshi et al 2003 estimated unrecorded groundwater abstractions for the whole of pakistan by upscaling the relationship between unit energy consumption per volume pumped they assumed that sampled wells were representative of the whole study area despite these examples few studies take advantage of non traditional sources of information this study investigates the use of local knowledge in multiple approaches for estimating groundwater abstractions in ungauged catchments in support of sustainable agricultural development two approaches were developed using 1 local knowledge through a qualitative field farmer survey of groundwater level fluctuations and groundwater withdrawals and 2 land use data combined with local knowledge on cropping and irrigation practices the first is essentially a groundwater balance based approach which estimates groundwater abstraction as the rest term of a groundwater balance equation while all other components including recharge change in groundwater storage and groundwater base flow to streams were estimated by a combination of upscaled measurements and modelling in contrast the land use based approach estimated groundwater abstraction for irrigation domestic use and livestock farming based on land use maps and population for demonstration of the advantages and limitations of these two approaches we applied them to the la vi river catchment in south central coastal vietnam for the 2016 dry season january to august as the dry season is the period critical for the groundwater system to supply irrigation water the catchment is ungauged i e there is no surface or groundwater monitoring while its agriculture relies on extensive irrigation from groundwater 2 study area the la vi catchment is located in the coastal province of binh dinh vietnam fig 1 it covers an area of approximately 100 km2 and has an elevation ranging from 4 to 395 m there are five administrative communities within the catchment the small town of ngo may large parts of the two communes cat hiep and cat trinh and small parts of the cat hanh and binh thuan communes vu et al 2018 approximately 37 500 people live in the catchment land use in the study area is dominated by agriculture which covers 78 of the catchment area while forest residential bare land and water body cover 15 3 3 7 3 4 and 0 2 respectively fig 2 the typical crops cultivated in the catchment are annual crops of rice peanut cassava and vegetables and perennial crops of mango acacia and coconut hoa et al 2015 there are seven soil types within the catchment niapp 2006 sandy rhodic and haplic acrisols xa and ba are dominant covering 50 and 37 respectively of the catchment with other sandy soils covering 0 8 8 of the area the unconfined aquifer has a thickness of 0 40 m typically 5 20 m and is underlain by a granitic basement rock beneath the whole catchment do 1987 the catchment has a tropical climate with an annual rainfall of 1 300 2 600 mm for the period 1986 2015 source an nhon station vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration only approximately 25 falls during the dry season months january till august the strong seasonal distribution of the precipitation produces large fluctuations in groundwater levels do 1987 with the highest groundwater table at the end of the rainy season december and the lowest at the end of the dry season august groundwater is extracted from thousands of private shallow dug unmonitored wells distributed throughout the catchment which serve as the main source of water for irrigation domestic water use and small livestock farming the la vi river and its tributaries drain the aquifer and discharge excess surface runoff during high precipitation events the river is intermittent ungauged and typically flows from september to april vu et al 2018 the river has a weir located approximately 1 km downstream of the outlet fig 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater balance based approach this approach derives the total abstraction from a catchment groundwater balance equation after all other components of the groundwater balance have been estimated fig 3 based on knowledge of local cropping patterns and qualitative survey results appendix a 1 we assume that dry season groundwater abstraction is approximately equal to annual groundwater extraction therefore all components of the groundwater balance are estimated for the dry season the first step was to subtract the annual maximum and minimum depth to groundwater as estimated by 77 farmers and recorded in the qualitative survey appendix a 1 from the elevation extracted from digital elevation model dem next these referenced levels at 77 wells were interpolated step 1a and 2a fig 3 using radial basis functions as implemented in the python package scipy virtanen et al 2019 differencing between the interpolated maximum and minimum groundwater levels resulted in a spatially distributed estimate of the change in the groundwater level δh step 3a fig 3 from the wet to the dry season however as the annual maximum and minimum groundwater levels were not measured but estimated by farmers a normal distributed error with a standard deviation σ of 1 m was assumed to account for the uncertainty in these estimations next each maximum and minimum well water level was sampled 100 times from its error distribution these levels were constrained such that they were not higher than the surface elevation or lower than the aquifer bottom consequently the corresponding change in groundwater level δh for the 100 samples of 77 well water levels was determined based on the radial basis interpolation and subtraction of the interpolated levels from the interpolated change in water level the mean was calculated from the 100 estimated maps of change in groundwater levels the standard deviation of the mean change in groundwater level at each pixel was also calculated to provide an estimate of the error in the water level change for areas where interpolated groundwater levels fell below the bottom of the aquifer no significant groundwater resource was assumed these areas were not accounted for in the catchment wide groundwater abstraction calculation fig 4 next step 4a fig 3 the change in aquifer storage δs was estimated by multiplying the annual change in the groundwater level with the specific yield of each soil type calculated as the difference between measured porosity and field capacity johnson 1967 appendix a 2 dry season net recharge to groundwater for the whole catchment area was estimated using the raster based water balance model wetspass m abdollahi et al 2017 wetspass m uses spatially distributed data on land use soil texture depth to groundwater topography and climatic data i e rainfall potential evapotranspiration number of rainy days wind speed and average temperature as inputs land use was obtained from supervised classification of sentinel 2a imagery of 13 february and 9 october 2016 tran et al 2018 fig 2 and soil texture was estimated based on the soil map nguyen and thach 2018 monthly groundwater levels were estimated by linearly interpolating from the minimum august up to the maximum december and back down to the minimum august monthly climatic data were estimated by averaging the daily measured data for 2016 from the an nhon national weather station located approximately 15 km away from the catchment source vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration wetspass m simulated the monthly distributed net recharge surface runoff and actual evapotranspiration for 2016 net seasonal recharge was estimated by summing the dry season january to august monthly values catchment wide dry season river base flow was estimated by upscaling and extrapolating temporal trends in flow vu et al 2018 simulated temporal fluxes from the groundwater into the la vi at three points along the river for the period november 2015 to march 2016 s1 s2 and s3 in fig 1 the trends in flux at each site were linearly extrapolated to estimate monthly groundwater fluxes to the river until august two semi circles were defined with their centre at the location of s1 and their radiuses the distance between s1 and the middle points between s2 and s3 respectively fig 1 the sum of the dry season base flow january to august at each point was assigned for the whole reach finally the total base flow was obtained by summing up the product of the length and assigned flux rate of all the stream segments which was then divided by the catchment area to obtain one catchment wide value of dry season base flow all estimated water balance components were used to calculate dry season groundwater abstraction step 5a fig 3 assuming a closed watershed the groundwater balance equates the sources positive net recharge sinks groundwater base flow to rivers actual evapotranspiration or negative net recharge and groundwater abstraction and changes in groundwater storage arranging the groundwater balance equation to estimate groundwater abstraction yields 1 δ h s y n e t r b f g a where δh is change in groundwater level sy is specific yield netr is net recharge to groundwater bf is groundwater base flow to streams and ga is groundwater abstraction for anthropogenic purposes all the terms are expressed as depths of water l δh sy and netr are distributed estimates while bf is a catchment average value hence the resulting ga is a catchment average result the arcgis esri 2015 tool modelbuilder was used to bring all the inputs and gis functions into a single framework feeding outputs of one function as inputs to another in sequence as shown in fig 3 spatial analyses were done on raster maps with a resolution of 10 m 3 2 land use based approach in this approach distributed estimates of groundwater abstractions for irrigation domestic use and livestock farming were calculated based on land use statistical information and qualitative survey results the amount of groundwater used for irrigation was estimated step 1b fig 3 from the land use map fig 2 and the rate of irrigation ra irr monthly irrigation rates for each crop were estimated in two ways 1 based on data from the qualitative survey appendix a 1 table a2 and 2 from information from the agricultural science institute for southern coastal of vietnam asisov using guidelines from the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 combined with experiments of water requirements of local crops for each stage after planting appendix a 3 some crops are planted in rotation resulting in a total of 11 agricultural land use classes and four other classes appendix a 3 two approaches were employed for developing a map of catchment population density step 2b fig 3 1 250 m resolution grid data of population source ec jrc and ciesin and 2 google earth imagery for the google earth approach a point was put on every house in the catchment this point map was converted to a raster 250 m resolution population distribution map by multiplying the number of households in each cell with the number of people per household which was taken as the average number of people reported in all households surveyed in the qualitative survey appendix a 1 table a1 both population density maps were downscaled to 10 m grid resolution using the aggregate tool in arcgis the amount of groundwater abstracted on average per person per unit area for domestic use ra dom was calculated using survey data appendix a 1 of the average volume of water consumed per person rc m3 and the percentage of water provided by groundwater pgw as 2 r a d o m r c p g w a where a is the area of a raster cell of 10 by 10 m for water usage in the residential land use cells of ngo may town pgw was assumed to be 50 based on information from the qualitative survey a spatially distributed raster map of groundwater abstraction for domestic use gadom m step 3b fig 3 was then estimated using the population density in each cell multiplied by the average groundwater consumption rate per person per area using the resample tool in arcgis bilinear interpolation as 3 g a d o m p o p d e n r a d o m the results of the qualitative survey were used to determine average household size average number of animals per farm and groundwater use for livestock from this information the ratio of people to animals in each community was calculated and this ratio was used to convert population density to a livestock density map nani step 4b fig 3 both population density maps described above were tested resulting in two maps of animal density step 5b fig 3 the spatial distribution raster of groundwater abstracted for use by livestock animals gafar was then estimated from the density of animals multiplied by the average consumption rate of each animal as 4 g a f a r n a n i r a f a r finally total groundwater consumption ga was calculated step 6b fig 3 by summing the abstractions for irrigation gairr domestic use gadom and livestock farming gafar in modelbuilder as 5 g a i r r g a d o m g a f a r g a 3 3 uncertainty analyses uncertainties and errors enter the results from errors associated with the original input data and are propagated through the calculation processes errors associated with inputs resulting from measurements estimation and determination processes or a combination of them were estimated either in absolute form as its possible discrepancy or in relative form as the proportion of the determined values depending on how each input was estimated e g directly measured or modelled the errors of the inputs directly measured or estimated e g groundwater levels were assigned absolute values of potential errors of each particular measurement or estimation errors in crop irrigation rates resulting from categorical classification of crops were estimated as the difference in irrigation rate for each crop with the maximum and minimum value for others crops with which it could have been confused e g peanut would be confused with cassava and some kinds of vegetables when classifying land use and determining its irrigation rate for population and irrigation rates which have more than one possible value the most reasonable value was selected while other possible values were used for determining the errors the error of the specific yield was based on the possible range as reported in johnson 1967 where an input had more than one method for determining its error e g irrigation rates the largest error was used the error propagation toolbox in arcgis heuvelink et al 1999 miller 2015 was used for estimating how the errors would propagate through the calculation process and result in a final absolute error estimate the propagated errors are calculated using standard equations for propagation of error as described in taylor 1997 relative errors were then calculated by dividing the absolute errors by their estimated values the use of standard error propagation is conservative as it assumes that the errors are independent i e no spatial correlation exists the result from the first approach groundwater balance based was a catchment average value therefore the error was also estimated as an average value for the whole catchment for the second method errors were estimated both spatially distributed and as catchment average values estimated errors associated with every single input of each method are summarised in table 1 and are propagated through the groundwater abstraction calculation process 4 results 4 1 groundwater balance based abstraction the qualitative survey appendix a 1 showed that the highest groundwater table typically occurred at the end of the rainy season in december with the groundwater depths spatially varying up to a maximum 1 4 m below ground surface see table a1 the groundwater level dropped 1 6 9 8 m to its lowest level at the end of dry season in august larger variations were typically observed in upland areas close to the water divide in mountainous areas there were no observations of groundwater depths from the survey therefore the elevation of the groundwater table could not be determined and was treated as no data in approximately 10 of the catchment fig 4 both interpolated minimum and maximum groundwater levels mimicked the surface topography the largest variations in groundwater level about 13 m were observed at the north west edge of the catchment fig 4 conversely a small variation of about 1 5 m was observed in parts of the lowlands near the stream network specific yield was approximately consistent throughout the catchment standard deviation of 0 01 therefore the spatial pattern of change in groundwater storage mirrored the variation in groundwater table elevation total estimated change in groundwater storage over the dry season was estimated at 73 13 106 m3 the total net recharge component of the dry season water balance was estimated at 10 30 106 m3 where the negative indicates transpiration by vegetation from groundwater the spatial recharge pattern fig 5 showed relatively high transpiration in the central part of the catchment particularly for the lowland areas near the river in contrast positive values were observed in the upland areas in the west and north east where the depth to groundwater is greater summing up the fluxes for the base flow active months from january to august gave a total flux of 34 76 106 m3 for the whole catchment which is equivalent to a specific discharge of 350 mm base flow increased from upstream to downstream decreased from the rainy to the dry season and ceased in may table 2 scaling the total flux to the area with data in fig 4 resulted in a base flow of 31 76 106 m3 this leaves 31 07 106 m3 as groundwater abstraction estimated on basis of the groundwater balance therefore groundwater abstraction accounted for 43 of the change in groundwater storage 4 2 land use based groundwater abstraction the surveyed results showed that the maximum consumption rate was for vegetables e g cucumber and chilli with rates of 11 625 m3 ha annually as they are seasonally planted in rotation and normally require irrigation the whole year 75 8732 m3 ha of this amount was consumed during the dry season january to august conversely mango required the least water for irrigation needing only 3303 m3 ha annually as it requires water for only five months typically from january to may intensive irrigation occurs during the dry season contributing to at least 75 of annual groundwater extraction the irrigation estimates based on the fao guidelines were smaller than the estimates from the surveyed results table 3 the exception was cassava which the survey showed is a low income crop planted in remote hilly areas or in rotation with other crops and not irrigated the dry season groundwater abstraction for irrigation obtained from land use data and irrigation rates of crops from the qualitative survey showed intensive irrigation in the centre of the valley and no abstraction at the edges of the catchment and in ngo may town highest groundwater consumption rates of 873 mm 8732 m3 ha were observed at places where other annual plants vegetables are planted low abstractions of 361 mm 3614 m3 ha were observed at places where paddy rice is planted three times per year irrigation is applied only for the second season of the year from june to august an estimated 36 19 106 m3 of groundwater was extracted for irrigation over the whole catchment the spatial pattern of groundwater abstraction for irrigation based on the fao irrigation rate was similar to the consumption rate from the qualitative survey however the amounts of groundwater abstractions were different the highest abstraction rate of 467 mm 4672 m3 ha was observed where perennial plants mango and coconut are planted while lower abstractions of 101 mm 1010 m3 ha were estimated when paddy rice was planted together with peanut a total estimated 24 37 106 m3 of groundwater was extracted for irrigation over the whole catchment population data from the two sources showed a large range of 50 to 2500 persons km2 for the rural areas ngo may had a higher population density of 5 000 10 000 persons km2 the population distribution from both sources was similar using the extrapolated point map of houses in the catchment multiplied by average number of people per household from the survey fig 6 resulted in a total of 37 475 people while according to the global population data for 2015 the area has a population of 51 590 the qualitative survey showed that livestock density in the rural communities was 2 5 times lower than population density while the number of animals for the small town of ngo may was assumed to be zero the qualitative survey showed a spatially constant per capita water consumption of 0 1 m3 day for both people and livestock animals with the percentage of water supplied from groundwater pgw varying spatially all the water consumption for domestic use in the rural communities of the catchment was supplied by groundwater no tap water in ngo may 50 of the population and animals were assumed to rely on groundwater supplies groundwater consumption for domestic use and livestock farming was estimated to drop to around 50 70 in the second half of the dry season due to the unavailability of groundwater in some areas the spatial pattern of groundwater consumed for domestic use and livestock farming was similar to the population distribution using population data converted from the interpolated point map of houses the total amount of groundwater extracted for domestic use was 0 69 106 m3 for dry season abstractions of 100 130 mm 100 000 130 000 m3 day km2 were observed at the ngo may town while just 10 50 mm 10 000 50 000 m3 day km2 were observed in rural areas when the downscaled global population data were used the total domestic use was 0 95 106 m3 the rates for livestock farming consumption in rural areas that were based on the survey were a 2 5 times lower than the rates for domestic use overall the groundwater abstraction estimated using irrigation rates stated by farmers in the qualitative survey results was approximately 50 higher than the estimates using the fao guidelines officially adopted by the local agricultural institute regardless of which source of population information was used table 4 as expected groundwater abstraction was spatially variable fig 7 depending on land use abstraction rates as high as 1000 mm 10 000 m3 ha were observed in the valleys in the centre of the catchment 4 3 uncertainty assessment for the groundwater balance based approach an absolute error of 42 65 106 m3 was calculated equalling a relative error of 137 of the estimate this error together with the estimated groundwater abstraction of 31 07 106 m3 resulted in a potential range of 0 73 72 106 m3 of groundwater abstraction for the whole catchment for the land use based approach spatially distributed errors of 0 873 mm 0 8 732 m3 ha were estimated in general lower errors of less than 200 mm 2000 m3 ha were observed in residential areas where the water was extracted only for domestic use and livestock farming the average estimated relative error was 176 with 6 74 and 100 of the catchment area having relative errors smaller than 50 100 and 250 respectively as the groundwater abstraction for error estimation was 36 19 106 m3 a resulting range of 0 99 90 106 m3 was obtained for the groundwater abstraction for the land use based approach this range was larger and entirely covered the range for the groundwater balance based approach 0 73 72 106 m3 5 discussion groundwater consumption is increasing globally yet our understanding of groundwater budgets in most of the world s aquifers lacks behind giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 dryland e g south asia and african sub saharan systems are especially prone to the impacts of anthropogenic pressures with growing demands on groundwater resources for irrigation yet even less is typically known about them shah et al 2007 here we investigated a dryland region in which there has been rapid conversion of bare land to agricultural land use over the past decade a majority of the crops require irrigation from groundwater heavily impacting groundwater storage and recharge however there is no regulation of the groundwater extracted from the approximately 8000 private wells in the la vi river catchment similar to the conditions found in most of the developing world giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 the results show that in the catchment groundwater abstraction to meet the domestic agricultural and livestock needs of the local population is by far the largest contributor to change in aquifer water storage the simple approaches used to estimate and compare the magnitude of groundwater abstraction in this basin provide a model for the many other data poor dryland basins experiencing intensive groundwater withdrawals and potential climate change pressures the absence of monitoring means that it is impossible to know the exact amount of groundwater withdrawn although benefits of soft data are clear disadvantages and uncertainties have been recorded including the limited measurements for setting up and calibrating models or external influences on parameters cheema et al 2014 comparison of the two methods tested in this study provides useful guidance on additional advantages and uncertainties of using available soft data sources for example the groundwater balance based approach estimated the groundwater abstraction as the rest term of the balance equation as the other terms could be estimated on the basis of soft or hard data however this approach provided only a single catchment average value for the groundwater abstraction as the base flow could not be estimated in a distributed manner information about the groundwater characteristics such as the specific yield and change in groundwater level was limited hence there was considerable uncertainty in the change in groundwater storage inaccuracy in interpolation of the groundwater level from point data also contributed significantly to the error as the relative error in the change in groundwater level was estimated to be 143 compared to the relative error of 38 in the specific yield it is apparent that this method is highly dependent on the accuracy of the groundwater level estimation the land use based approach has the advantage of providing spatially distributed results as it takes into account spatial information and knowledge on irrigation and domestic and livestock consumers when estimating groundwater abstractions the direct link between the land use and abstraction makes the land use based approach extremely useful in scenarios analyses supporting decision making processes regarding water allocation problems letcher et al 2007 in addition the spatially distributed result makes it more suitable for use in a groundwater flow model however this approach depends on the accuracy of the data and methods for land use mapping letcher et al 2007 and mixed land use and seasonal changes that make remote sensing image classification difficult hurtt et al 2006 water consumption rates are notoriously hard to quantify both for crop irrigation rates zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and for residential water demand arbués et al 2003 the variation in the estimated irrigation rate for each crop and between crops possibly occurring within the classified land use class created the greatest uncertainty in this method in our study area with estimated relative errors of up to 180 although uncertainty in some parameters such as population density was high their impact on the overall groundwater abstraction estimate was limited for example population density from two different sources differed by 40 however the abstraction in the dry season for domestic use and livestock farming was small 2 5 compared to irrigation 97 5 and the error in the population estimate has therefore a relatively small effect on the total error moreover the combination of two options for estimating the irrigation rate and two options for the population density resulted in four spatially distributed abstraction results which help to confirm the relative reliability of estimates for both approaches the arcgis modelbuilder tool was advantageous for automating the estimation process this also allows easy updates on data and analyses of impact on groundwater extraction from land use change considering the global pressure on groundwater resources due to agriculture and especially in developing areas shah et al 2007 giordano 2009 there is a high need for approaches for estimation and monitoring of groundwater abstractions supporting improved and more sustainable groundwater use approaches need to support water managers and be commensurate with the financial social and organisational constraints of a region the methods tested in this study provided relatively inexpensive and computationally simple but quantitative estimates of groundwater abstraction from this study it follows that approaches based on remotely sensed land use have considerable advantages to reduce uncertainties ground truthing of land use e g types of crops and rotation and more detailed sampling of farmers irrigation practices e g number and type of wells irrigation scheduling and techniques used is imperative automated groundwater level and discharge monitoring for limited but representative practices would greatly augment qualitative data sources 6 conclusion the global concern about the exploitation of groundwater requires local action on improving the quantitative estimates of groundwater abstraction where groundwater monitoring infrastructure is lacking soft data has great potential to add valuable information in this study we elucidated the advantages and uncertainties associated with groundwater abstraction estimates using two combinations of land use demographic statistics agricultural guidelines and direct local knowledge although the uncertainty of the quantitative estimates of abstraction was on the order of magnitude of the estimates themselves there was nevertheless relatively

australian research council appendix a a 1 qualitative field survey a qualitative field survey at 77 farms was conducted between 20 and 25 october 2015 using a questionnaire fig a1 farmers were asked about the purpose of well use the level and month of minimum and maximum groundwater depth the daily average duration of pumping for each month of the year the area of land they irrigate and the applied cropping patterns i e single crop or crop rotation the number of persons per farming household the average per person domestic use rc m3 day the percentage of water consumption provided by groundwater pgw and the number of livestock per farm the depth to groundwater was also concurrently measured using an electric water level meter and the pumping rate was estimated at each farm by volumetric meter and clock generally intensive groundwater abstraction was reported during the dry season from january to august particularly for the main cropping period from the end of december to the beginning of april table a1 accounting for up to 70 of total annual abstraction smaller abstractions were observed at wells used for domestic demand only with 5 10 m3 of water pumped per month while larger abstractions were reported for wells for irrigation and multiple purposes monthly average abstractions increased from roughly 65 m3 up to 330 m3 per well from the beginning of the wet season september until mid dry season may fig a2 in the second half of the dry season may to august the abstractions dropped significantly although total water use for domestic purposes and livestock farming was constant with time the amount of groundwater used for these purposes dropped at the end of the dry season june to august fig a3 as some wells dried out and water use was satisfied by other sources e g surface water and bottled water areal groundwater consumption rates were the same for per animal as for per person and the amount of water used for domestic purposes and livestock farming reduced towards the end of the dry season because some productive wells dry out the monthly irrigation rate for each crop was calculated by dividing the amount of groundwater abstracted by the area irrigated table a2 irrigation was the dominant water use accounting for 84 of the total annual abstraction while domestic use and livestock farming e g cows and pigs consumed 11 and 5 of the total respectively fig a3 annual average per well groundwater abstraction was 1800 m3 yr per well for satisfying the total demands of water for domestic use livestock farming and irrigation a 2 porosity and field capacity estimation the soil map extended with field soil surveys and sampling resulted in the classification of seven soil types porosity and field capacity were experimentally estimated for soil samples from 11 locations porosity was indirectly calculated as a function of the experimented parameters of particle density pycnometer method bulk density core method and field capacity was experimentally determined as the water content retained at the suction pressure of 0 33 bar pressure outflow method due to the limitation in number of soil samples each soil type was assigned a unique value of porosity and field capacity respectively by averaging all values of its soil samples table a3 the specific yield was then calculated as the difference of the porosity and the field capacity

8341,study region the ungauged agriculturally dominated la vi river basin vietnam study focus groundwater abstraction for food and industrial production is increasing globally putting pressure on groundwater resources and associated ecosystems in many countries monitoring of abstraction is poorly organised resulting in a paucity of data particularly in developing regions therefore alternative approaches to estimate groundwater withdrawals are necessary in this study two soft data approaches for indirect catchment scale groundwater abstraction estimation are developed using 1 local knowledge through a qualitative field survey of groundwater level fluctuations and groundwater withdrawals and 2 land use data combined with local knowledge on cropping and irrigation practices new hydrological insights for the region the approaches are tested and applied for the la vi river basin for the 2016 dry season total dry season estimated abstractions of 31 07 106 m3 and 36 19 106 m3 resulted from the two approaches the advantage of the second approach is the spatial distribution of the estimated groundwater abstraction aligning highly intensive abstractions with intensive agricultural areas despite high uncertainty in both estimates this quantitative estimate gives valuable information for water managers and the relatively good agreement between the methods provides trust in the estimates the approaches are cost effective and computationally simple solutions for estimating groundwater abstraction in data poor regions keywords groundwater abstraction soft data irrigation domestic consumption 1 introduction over the last half century there has been a significant expansion in global groundwater abstraction to satisfy water demand and food security for the growing population llamas and martínez santos 2005 wada et al 2010 qureshi 2011 rasul 2016 the resulting consequences include declining groundwater tables degradation in groundwater quality due to pollution from agricultural use of fertilisers and pesticides and seawater intrusion llamas and martínez santos 2005 giordano 2009 von rohden et al 2010 nazemi and wheater 2015 in many developing countries in particular there is a rapid change in land use from natural landscapes to farmland or urban areas resulting in strongly exploited groundwater systems giordano 2009 as governmental regulation is lacking llamas and martinez 2005 however due to the relatively long response times of aquifers to external pressures there is often potential for appropriate regulation to be established before groundwater systems are irreversibly impacted cuthbert et al 2019 but knowledge of both groundwater use and availability is imperative for this adaptive management groundwater abstraction data in particular is essential for groundwater management and development qureshi et al 2010 cheema et al 2014 rasul 2016 however groundwater abstractions are difficult to estimate accurately especially in developing countries where insufficient groundwater monitoring infrastructure exists giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 where groundwater monitoring infrastructure is insufficient alternative data sources can be used to estimate groundwater withdrawals also called soft data alternative information relevant for estimating groundwater abstraction includes local knowledge of aquifer and land use practices or upscaled statistical data seibert and mcdonnell 2002 although the use of soft data can provide a useful information source several assumptions are typically needed when using this information quantitatively for example maréchal et al 2006 used land use data in combination with a determined consumption rate i e amount of water irrigated per unit area for estimating the amount of groundwater extracted for irrigation on paddy rice at a pilot watershed the authors assumed the absence of base flow to the streams and that agriculture was the unique groundwater user when estimating groundwater abstraction qureshi et al 2003 estimated unrecorded groundwater abstractions for the whole of pakistan by upscaling the relationship between unit energy consumption per volume pumped they assumed that sampled wells were representative of the whole study area despite these examples few studies take advantage of non traditional sources of information this study investigates the use of local knowledge in multiple approaches for estimating groundwater abstractions in ungauged catchments in support of sustainable agricultural development two approaches were developed using 1 local knowledge through a qualitative field farmer survey of groundwater level fluctuations and groundwater withdrawals and 2 land use data combined with local knowledge on cropping and irrigation practices the first is essentially a groundwater balance based approach which estimates groundwater abstraction as the rest term of a groundwater balance equation while all other components including recharge change in groundwater storage and groundwater base flow to streams were estimated by a combination of upscaled measurements and modelling in contrast the land use based approach estimated groundwater abstraction for irrigation domestic use and livestock farming based on land use maps and population for demonstration of the advantages and limitations of these two approaches we applied them to the la vi river catchment in south central coastal vietnam for the 2016 dry season january to august as the dry season is the period critical for the groundwater system to supply irrigation water the catchment is ungauged i e there is no surface or groundwater monitoring while its agriculture relies on extensive irrigation from groundwater 2 study area the la vi catchment is located in the coastal province of binh dinh vietnam fig 1 it covers an area of approximately 100 km2 and has an elevation ranging from 4 to 395 m there are five administrative communities within the catchment the small town of ngo may large parts of the two communes cat hiep and cat trinh and small parts of the cat hanh and binh thuan communes vu et al 2018 approximately 37 500 people live in the catchment land use in the study area is dominated by agriculture which covers 78 of the catchment area while forest residential bare land and water body cover 15 3 3 7 3 4 and 0 2 respectively fig 2 the typical crops cultivated in the catchment are annual crops of rice peanut cassava and vegetables and perennial crops of mango acacia and coconut hoa et al 2015 there are seven soil types within the catchment niapp 2006 sandy rhodic and haplic acrisols xa and ba are dominant covering 50 and 37 respectively of the catchment with other sandy soils covering 0 8 8 of the area the unconfined aquifer has a thickness of 0 40 m typically 5 20 m and is underlain by a granitic basement rock beneath the whole catchment do 1987 the catchment has a tropical climate with an annual rainfall of 1 300 2 600 mm for the period 1986 2015 source an nhon station vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration only approximately 25 falls during the dry season months january till august the strong seasonal distribution of the precipitation produces large fluctuations in groundwater levels do 1987 with the highest groundwater table at the end of the rainy season december and the lowest at the end of the dry season august groundwater is extracted from thousands of private shallow dug unmonitored wells distributed throughout the catchment which serve as the main source of water for irrigation domestic water use and small livestock farming the la vi river and its tributaries drain the aquifer and discharge excess surface runoff during high precipitation events the river is intermittent ungauged and typically flows from september to april vu et al 2018 the river has a weir located approximately 1 km downstream of the outlet fig 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater balance based approach this approach derives the total abstraction from a catchment groundwater balance equation after all other components of the groundwater balance have been estimated fig 3 based on knowledge of local cropping patterns and qualitative survey results appendix a 1 we assume that dry season groundwater abstraction is approximately equal to annual groundwater extraction therefore all components of the groundwater balance are estimated for the dry season the first step was to subtract the annual maximum and minimum depth to groundwater as estimated by 77 farmers and recorded in the qualitative survey appendix a 1 from the elevation extracted from digital elevation model dem next these referenced levels at 77 wells were interpolated step 1a and 2a fig 3 using radial basis functions as implemented in the python package scipy virtanen et al 2019 differencing between the interpolated maximum and minimum groundwater levels resulted in a spatially distributed estimate of the change in the groundwater level δh step 3a fig 3 from the wet to the dry season however as the annual maximum and minimum groundwater levels were not measured but estimated by farmers a normal distributed error with a standard deviation σ of 1 m was assumed to account for the uncertainty in these estimations next each maximum and minimum well water level was sampled 100 times from its error distribution these levels were constrained such that they were not higher than the surface elevation or lower than the aquifer bottom consequently the corresponding change in groundwater level δh for the 100 samples of 77 well water levels was determined based on the radial basis interpolation and subtraction of the interpolated levels from the interpolated change in water level the mean was calculated from the 100 estimated maps of change in groundwater levels the standard deviation of the mean change in groundwater level at each pixel was also calculated to provide an estimate of the error in the water level change for areas where interpolated groundwater levels fell below the bottom of the aquifer no significant groundwater resource was assumed these areas were not accounted for in the catchment wide groundwater abstraction calculation fig 4 next step 4a fig 3 the change in aquifer storage δs was estimated by multiplying the annual change in the groundwater level with the specific yield of each soil type calculated as the difference between measured porosity and field capacity johnson 1967 appendix a 2 dry season net recharge to groundwater for the whole catchment area was estimated using the raster based water balance model wetspass m abdollahi et al 2017 wetspass m uses spatially distributed data on land use soil texture depth to groundwater topography and climatic data i e rainfall potential evapotranspiration number of rainy days wind speed and average temperature as inputs land use was obtained from supervised classification of sentinel 2a imagery of 13 february and 9 october 2016 tran et al 2018 fig 2 and soil texture was estimated based on the soil map nguyen and thach 2018 monthly groundwater levels were estimated by linearly interpolating from the minimum august up to the maximum december and back down to the minimum august monthly climatic data were estimated by averaging the daily measured data for 2016 from the an nhon national weather station located approximately 15 km away from the catchment source vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration wetspass m simulated the monthly distributed net recharge surface runoff and actual evapotranspiration for 2016 net seasonal recharge was estimated by summing the dry season january to august monthly values catchment wide dry season river base flow was estimated by upscaling and extrapolating temporal trends in flow vu et al 2018 simulated temporal fluxes from the groundwater into the la vi at three points along the river for the period november 2015 to march 2016 s1 s2 and s3 in fig 1 the trends in flux at each site were linearly extrapolated to estimate monthly groundwater fluxes to the river until august two semi circles were defined with their centre at the location of s1 and their radiuses the distance between s1 and the middle points between s2 and s3 respectively fig 1 the sum of the dry season base flow january to august at each point was assigned for the whole reach finally the total base flow was obtained by summing up the product of the length and assigned flux rate of all the stream segments which was then divided by the catchment area to obtain one catchment wide value of dry season base flow all estimated water balance components were used to calculate dry season groundwater abstraction step 5a fig 3 assuming a closed watershed the groundwater balance equates the sources positive net recharge sinks groundwater base flow to rivers actual evapotranspiration or negative net recharge and groundwater abstraction and changes in groundwater storage arranging the groundwater balance equation to estimate groundwater abstraction yields 1 δ h s y n e t r b f g a where δh is change in groundwater level sy is specific yield netr is net recharge to groundwater bf is groundwater base flow to streams and ga is groundwater abstraction for anthropogenic purposes all the terms are expressed as depths of water l δh sy and netr are distributed estimates while bf is a catchment average value hence the resulting ga is a catchment average result the arcgis esri 2015 tool modelbuilder was used to bring all the inputs and gis functions into a single framework feeding outputs of one function as inputs to another in sequence as shown in fig 3 spatial analyses were done on raster maps with a resolution of 10 m 3 2 land use based approach in this approach distributed estimates of groundwater abstractions for irrigation domestic use and livestock farming were calculated based on land use statistical information and qualitative survey results the amount of groundwater used for irrigation was estimated step 1b fig 3 from the land use map fig 2 and the rate of irrigation ra irr monthly irrigation rates for each crop were estimated in two ways 1 based on data from the qualitative survey appendix a 1 table a2 and 2 from information from the agricultural science institute for southern coastal of vietnam asisov using guidelines from the food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 combined with experiments of water requirements of local crops for each stage after planting appendix a 3 some crops are planted in rotation resulting in a total of 11 agricultural land use classes and four other classes appendix a 3 two approaches were employed for developing a map of catchment population density step 2b fig 3 1 250 m resolution grid data of population source ec jrc and ciesin and 2 google earth imagery for the google earth approach a point was put on every house in the catchment this point map was converted to a raster 250 m resolution population distribution map by multiplying the number of households in each cell with the number of people per household which was taken as the average number of people reported in all households surveyed in the qualitative survey appendix a 1 table a1 both population density maps were downscaled to 10 m grid resolution using the aggregate tool in arcgis the amount of groundwater abstracted on average per person per unit area for domestic use ra dom was calculated using survey data appendix a 1 of the average volume of water consumed per person rc m3 and the percentage of water provided by groundwater pgw as 2 r a d o m r c p g w a where a is the area of a raster cell of 10 by 10 m for water usage in the residential land use cells of ngo may town pgw was assumed to be 50 based on information from the qualitative survey a spatially distributed raster map of groundwater abstraction for domestic use gadom m step 3b fig 3 was then estimated using the population density in each cell multiplied by the average groundwater consumption rate per person per area using the resample tool in arcgis bilinear interpolation as 3 g a d o m p o p d e n r a d o m the results of the qualitative survey were used to determine average household size average number of animals per farm and groundwater use for livestock from this information the ratio of people to animals in each community was calculated and this ratio was used to convert population density to a livestock density map nani step 4b fig 3 both population density maps described above were tested resulting in two maps of animal density step 5b fig 3 the spatial distribution raster of groundwater abstracted for use by livestock animals gafar was then estimated from the density of animals multiplied by the average consumption rate of each animal as 4 g a f a r n a n i r a f a r finally total groundwater consumption ga was calculated step 6b fig 3 by summing the abstractions for irrigation gairr domestic use gadom and livestock farming gafar in modelbuilder as 5 g a i r r g a d o m g a f a r g a 3 3 uncertainty analyses uncertainties and errors enter the results from errors associated with the original input data and are propagated through the calculation processes errors associated with inputs resulting from measurements estimation and determination processes or a combination of them were estimated either in absolute form as its possible discrepancy or in relative form as the proportion of the determined values depending on how each input was estimated e g directly measured or modelled the errors of the inputs directly measured or estimated e g groundwater levels were assigned absolute values of potential errors of each particular measurement or estimation errors in crop irrigation rates resulting from categorical classification of crops were estimated as the difference in irrigation rate for each crop with the maximum and minimum value for others crops with which it could have been confused e g peanut would be confused with cassava and some kinds of vegetables when classifying land use and determining its irrigation rate for population and irrigation rates which have more than one possible value the most reasonable value was selected while other possible values were used for determining the errors the error of the specific yield was based on the possible range as reported in johnson 1967 where an input had more than one method for determining its error e g irrigation rates the largest error was used the error propagation toolbox in arcgis heuvelink et al 1999 miller 2015 was used for estimating how the errors would propagate through the calculation process and result in a final absolute error estimate the propagated errors are calculated using standard equations for propagation of error as described in taylor 1997 relative errors were then calculated by dividing the absolute errors by their estimated values the use of standard error propagation is conservative as it assumes that the errors are independent i e no spatial correlation exists the result from the first approach groundwater balance based was a catchment average value therefore the error was also estimated as an average value for the whole catchment for the second method errors were estimated both spatially distributed and as catchment average values estimated errors associated with every single input of each method are summarised in table 1 and are propagated through the groundwater abstraction calculation process 4 results 4 1 groundwater balance based abstraction the qualitative survey appendix a 1 showed that the highest groundwater table typically occurred at the end of the rainy season in december with the groundwater depths spatially varying up to a maximum 1 4 m below ground surface see table a1 the groundwater level dropped 1 6 9 8 m to its lowest level at the end of dry season in august larger variations were typically observed in upland areas close to the water divide in mountainous areas there were no observations of groundwater depths from the survey therefore the elevation of the groundwater table could not be determined and was treated as no data in approximately 10 of the catchment fig 4 both interpolated minimum and maximum groundwater levels mimicked the surface topography the largest variations in groundwater level about 13 m were observed at the north west edge of the catchment fig 4 conversely a small variation of about 1 5 m was observed in parts of the lowlands near the stream network specific yield was approximately consistent throughout the catchment standard deviation of 0 01 therefore the spatial pattern of change in groundwater storage mirrored the variation in groundwater table elevation total estimated change in groundwater storage over the dry season was estimated at 73 13 106 m3 the total net recharge component of the dry season water balance was estimated at 10 30 106 m3 where the negative indicates transpiration by vegetation from groundwater the spatial recharge pattern fig 5 showed relatively high transpiration in the central part of the catchment particularly for the lowland areas near the river in contrast positive values were observed in the upland areas in the west and north east where the depth to groundwater is greater summing up the fluxes for the base flow active months from january to august gave a total flux of 34 76 106 m3 for the whole catchment which is equivalent to a specific discharge of 350 mm base flow increased from upstream to downstream decreased from the rainy to the dry season and ceased in may table 2 scaling the total flux to the area with data in fig 4 resulted in a base flow of 31 76 106 m3 this leaves 31 07 106 m3 as groundwater abstraction estimated on basis of the groundwater balance therefore groundwater abstraction accounted for 43 of the change in groundwater storage 4 2 land use based groundwater abstraction the surveyed results showed that the maximum consumption rate was for vegetables e g cucumber and chilli with rates of 11 625 m3 ha annually as they are seasonally planted in rotation and normally require irrigation the whole year 75 8732 m3 ha of this amount was consumed during the dry season january to august conversely mango required the least water for irrigation needing only 3303 m3 ha annually as it requires water for only five months typically from january to may intensive irrigation occurs during the dry season contributing to at least 75 of annual groundwater extraction the irrigation estimates based on the fao guidelines were smaller than the estimates from the surveyed results table 3 the exception was cassava which the survey showed is a low income crop planted in remote hilly areas or in rotation with other crops and not irrigated the dry season groundwater abstraction for irrigation obtained from land use data and irrigation rates of crops from the qualitative survey showed intensive irrigation in the centre of the valley and no abstraction at the edges of the catchment and in ngo may town highest groundwater consumption rates of 873 mm 8732 m3 ha were observed at places where other annual plants vegetables are planted low abstractions of 361 mm 3614 m3 ha were observed at places where paddy rice is planted three times per year irrigation is applied only for the second season of the year from june to august an estimated 36 19 106 m3 of groundwater was extracted for irrigation over the whole catchment the spatial pattern of groundwater abstraction for irrigation based on the fao irrigation rate was similar to the consumption rate from the qualitative survey however the amounts of groundwater abstractions were different the highest abstraction rate of 467 mm 4672 m3 ha was observed where perennial plants mango and coconut are planted while lower abstractions of 101 mm 1010 m3 ha were estimated when paddy rice was planted together with peanut a total estimated 24 37 106 m3 of groundwater was extracted for irrigation over the whole catchment population data from the two sources showed a large range of 50 to 2500 persons km2 for the rural areas ngo may had a higher population density of 5 000 10 000 persons km2 the population distribution from both sources was similar using the extrapolated point map of houses in the catchment multiplied by average number of people per household from the survey fig 6 resulted in a total of 37 475 people while according to the global population data for 2015 the area has a population of 51 590 the qualitative survey showed that livestock density in the rural communities was 2 5 times lower than population density while the number of animals for the small town of ngo may was assumed to be zero the qualitative survey showed a spatially constant per capita water consumption of 0 1 m3 day for both people and livestock animals with the percentage of water supplied from groundwater pgw varying spatially all the water consumption for domestic use in the rural communities of the catchment was supplied by groundwater no tap water in ngo may 50 of the population and animals were assumed to rely on groundwater supplies groundwater consumption for domestic use and livestock farming was estimated to drop to around 50 70 in the second half of the dry season due to the unavailability of groundwater in some areas the spatial pattern of groundwater consumed for domestic use and livestock farming was similar to the population distribution using population data converted from the interpolated point map of houses the total amount of groundwater extracted for domestic use was 0 69 106 m3 for dry season abstractions of 100 130 mm 100 000 130 000 m3 day km2 were observed at the ngo may town while just 10 50 mm 10 000 50 000 m3 day km2 were observed in rural areas when the downscaled global population data were used the total domestic use was 0 95 106 m3 the rates for livestock farming consumption in rural areas that were based on the survey were a 2 5 times lower than the rates for domestic use overall the groundwater abstraction estimated using irrigation rates stated by farmers in the qualitative survey results was approximately 50 higher than the estimates using the fao guidelines officially adopted by the local agricultural institute regardless of which source of population information was used table 4 as expected groundwater abstraction was spatially variable fig 7 depending on land use abstraction rates as high as 1000 mm 10 000 m3 ha were observed in the valleys in the centre of the catchment 4 3 uncertainty assessment for the groundwater balance based approach an absolute error of 42 65 106 m3 was calculated equalling a relative error of 137 of the estimate this error together with the estimated groundwater abstraction of 31 07 106 m3 resulted in a potential range of 0 73 72 106 m3 of groundwater abstraction for the whole catchment for the land use based approach spatially distributed errors of 0 873 mm 0 8 732 m3 ha were estimated in general lower errors of less than 200 mm 2000 m3 ha were observed in residential areas where the water was extracted only for domestic use and livestock farming the average estimated relative error was 176 with 6 74 and 100 of the catchment area having relative errors smaller than 50 100 and 250 respectively as the groundwater abstraction for error estimation was 36 19 106 m3 a resulting range of 0 99 90 106 m3 was obtained for the groundwater abstraction for the land use based approach this range was larger and entirely covered the range for the groundwater balance based approach 0 73 72 106 m3 5 discussion groundwater consumption is increasing globally yet our understanding of groundwater budgets in most of the world s aquifers lacks behind giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 dryland e g south asia and african sub saharan systems are especially prone to the impacts of anthropogenic pressures with growing demands on groundwater resources for irrigation yet even less is typically known about them shah et al 2007 here we investigated a dryland region in which there has been rapid conversion of bare land to agricultural land use over the past decade a majority of the crops require irrigation from groundwater heavily impacting groundwater storage and recharge however there is no regulation of the groundwater extracted from the approximately 8000 private wells in the la vi river catchment similar to the conditions found in most of the developing world giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 the results show that in the catchment groundwater abstraction to meet the domestic agricultural and livestock needs of the local population is by far the largest contributor to change in aquifer water storage the simple approaches used to estimate and compare the magnitude of groundwater abstraction in this basin provide a model for the many other data poor dryland basins experiencing intensive groundwater withdrawals and potential climate change pressures the absence of monitoring means that it is impossible to know the exact amount of groundwater withdrawn although benefits of soft data are clear disadvantages and uncertainties have been recorded including the limited measurements for setting up and calibrating models or external influences on parameters cheema et al 2014 comparison of the two methods tested in this study provides useful guidance on additional advantages and uncertainties of using available soft data sources for example the groundwater balance based approach estimated the groundwater abstraction as the rest term of the balance equation as the other terms could be estimated on the basis of soft or hard data however this approach provided only a single catchment average value for the groundwater abstraction as the base flow could not be estimated in a distributed manner information about the groundwater characteristics such as the specific yield and change in groundwater level was limited hence there was considerable uncertainty in the change in groundwater storage inaccuracy in interpolation of the groundwater level from point data also contributed significantly to the error as the relative error in the change in groundwater level was estimated to be 143 compared to the relative error of 38 in the specific yield it is apparent that this method is highly dependent on the accuracy of the groundwater level estimation the land use based approach has the advantage of providing spatially distributed results as it takes into account spatial information and knowledge on irrigation and domestic and livestock consumers when estimating groundwater abstractions the direct link between the land use and abstraction makes the land use based approach extremely useful in scenarios analyses supporting decision making processes regarding water allocation problems letcher et al 2007 in addition the spatially distributed result makes it more suitable for use in a groundwater flow model however this approach depends on the accuracy of the data and methods for land use mapping letcher et al 2007 and mixed land use and seasonal changes that make remote sensing image classification difficult hurtt et al 2006 water consumption rates are notoriously hard to quantify both for crop irrigation rates zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and for residential water demand arbués et al 2003 the variation in the estimated irrigation rate for each crop and between crops possibly occurring within the classified land use class created the greatest uncertainty in this method in our study area with estimated relative errors of up to 180 although uncertainty in some parameters such as population density was high their impact on the overall groundwater abstraction estimate was limited for example population density from two different sources differed by 40 however the abstraction in the dry season for domestic use and livestock farming was small 2 5 compared to irrigation 97 5 and the error in the population estimate has therefore a relatively small effect on the total error moreover the combination of two options for estimating the irrigation rate and two options for the population density resulted in four spatially distributed abstraction results which help to confirm the relative reliability of estimates for both approaches the arcgis modelbuilder tool was advantageous for automating the estimation process this also allows easy updates on data and analyses of impact on groundwater extraction from land use change considering the global pressure on groundwater resources due to agriculture and especially in developing areas shah et al 2007 giordano 2009 there is a high need for approaches for estimation and monitoring of groundwater abstractions supporting improved and more sustainable groundwater use approaches need to support water managers and be commensurate with the financial social and organisational constraints of a region the methods tested in this study provided relatively inexpensive and computationally simple but quantitative estimates of groundwater abstraction from this study it follows that approaches based on remotely sensed land use have considerable advantages to reduce uncertainties ground truthing of land use e g types of crops and rotation and more detailed sampling of farmers irrigation practices e g number and type of wells irrigation scheduling and techniques used is imperative automated groundwater level and discharge monitoring for limited but representative practices would greatly augment qualitative data sources 6 conclusion the global concern about the exploitation of groundwater requires local action on improving the quantitative estimates of groundwater abstraction where groundwater monitoring infrastructure is lacking soft data has great potential to add valuable information in this study we elucidated the advantages and uncertainties associated with groundwater abstraction estimates using two combinations of land use demographic statistics agricultural guidelines and direct local knowledge although the uncertainty of the quantitative estimates of abstraction was on the order of magnitude of the estimates themselves there was nevertheless relatively good agreement between the approaches both providing trust in the overall approach and showing the usefulness of method comparison of the soft data used in this study the accuracy of the estimates of the groundwater level have shown to be of large influence on the total uncertainty future work in this region should include development of future land use demographic and climate change scenarios to better understand necessary regulation and management of water supplies the current work combined with such scenarios would serve as an important template for development of groundwater management in

australian research council appendix a a 1 qualitative field survey a qualitative field survey at 77 farms was conducted between 20 and 25 october 2015 using a questionnaire fig a1 farmers were asked about the purpose of well use the level and month of minimum and maximum groundwater depth the daily average duration of pumping for each month of the year the area of land they irrigate and the applied cropping patterns i e single crop or crop rotation the number of persons per farming household the average per person domestic use rc m3 day the percentage of water consumption provided by groundwater pgw and the number of livestock per farm the depth to groundwater was also concurrently measured using an electric water level meter and the pumping rate was estimated at each farm by volumetric meter and clock generally intensive groundwater abstraction was reported during the dry season from january to august particularly for the main cropping period from the end of december to the beginning of april table a1 accounting for up to 70 of total annual abstraction smaller abstractions were observed at wells used for domestic demand only with 5 10 m3 of water pumped per month while larger abstractions were reported for wells for irrigation and multiple purposes monthly average abstractions increased from roughly 65 m3 up to 330 m3 per well from the beginning of the wet season september until mid dry season may fig a2 in the second half of the dry season may to august the abstractions dropped significantly although total water use for domestic purposes and livestock farming was constant with time the amount of groundwater used for these purposes dropped at the end of the dry season june to august fig a3 as some wells dried out and water use was satisfied by other sources e g surface water and bottled water areal groundwater consumption rates were the same for per animal as for per person and the amount of water used for domestic purposes and livestock farming reduced towards the end of the dry season because some productive wells dry out the monthly irrigation rate for each crop was calculated by dividing the amount of groundwater abstracted by the area irrigated table a2 irrigation was the dominant water use accounting for 84 of the total annual abstraction while domestic use and livestock farming e g cows and pigs consumed 11 and 5 of the total respectively fig a3 annual average per well groundwater abstraction was 1800 m3 yr per well for satisfying the total demands of water for domestic use livestock farming and irrigation a 2 porosity and field capacity estimation the soil map extended with field soil surveys and sampling resulted in the classification of seven soil types porosity and field capacity were experimentally estimated for soil samples from 11 locations porosity was indirectly calculated as a function of the experimented parameters of particle density pycnometer method bulk density core method and field capacity was experimentally determined as the water content retained at the suction pressure of 0 33 bar pressure outflow method due to the limitation in number of soil samples each soil type was assigned a unique value of porosity and field capacity respectively by averaging all values of its soil samples table a3 the specific yield was then calculated as the difference of the porosity and the field capacity

8342,study region the study was conducted in the northern atlantic coastal plain aquifer system in the eastern usa study focus groundwater ph and redox conditions are fundamental chemical characteristics controlling the distribution of many contaminants of concern for drinking water or the ecological health of receiving waters in this study ph and redox conditions were modeled and mapped in a complex layered aquifer system machine learning methods boosted regression trees were applied to data from 3000 to 5000 wells predicted ph and the probability of anoxic conditions defined by three thresholds of dissolved oxygen 0 5 1 and 2 mg l were mapped at the 1 km2 scale for each of 10 regional aquifer layers new hydrological insights for the region maps depict the extent of acidic groundwater and oxic conditions in the shallow unconfined surficial aquifer and in unconfined recharge proximal areas of underlying aquifers in contrast to alkaline and anoxic groundwater elsewhere geographic patterns and influential predictors including elevation overlying confining units thickness and simulated groundwater age and flux are consistent with prior understanding of the processes controlling ph and redox in the aquifer system the model based maps support robust estimates of aquifer proportions either areal or volumetric likely to contain groundwater of a specified quality or be vulnerable to specific ph or redox sensitive contaminants the machine learning methods were an effective tool to map groundwater quality at the regional scale keywords groundwater age northern atlantic coastal plain ph dissolved oxygen machine learning groundwater quality redox conditions 1 introduction understanding where contaminants occur at the regional scale in aquifers is essential for the effective management of groundwater resources and for the evaluation of the risk to drinking water supplies the distribution of many contaminants of concern for human health and ecological effects depends on geochemical conditions within aquifers specifically ph and redox conditions although they are fundamental characteristics of groundwater ph and redox conditions typically are not included when groundwater quality is evaluated for vulnerability or risk assessments because adequate information on their spatial distribution within aquifers is lacking panagopoulos et al 2006 machiwal et al 2018 in this study we demonstrate the use of machine learning methods to model and map ph and redox conditions from existing data in the northern atlantic coastal plain nacp aquifer system in the eastern usa groundwater from the nacp aquifer system is heavily used for water supply and discharges to sensitive coastal waters such chesapeake bay the largest estuary in the usa thus conditions controlling contaminants in the aquifer system are of great interest for human and ecological health arsenic manganese and nitrate are some of the constituents of human health and ecological concern in groundwater that are affected by ph or redox conditions arsenic and manganese are among the most common geogenic contaminants in aquifers in the united states and occur globally at concentrations of concern for human health nordstrom 2002 fendorf et al 2010 frisbie et al 2012 desimone et al 2014 welch et al 2000 high manganese concentrations occur in groundwater under reducing conditions because manganese in its reduced ii ionic state is more soluble than in its oxidized iv state langmuir 1997 homoncik et al 2010 bondu et al 2018 high arsenic concentrations can occur in groundwater in both reducing and oxidizing conditions through different processes reductive dissolution of iron and manganese oxides releasing arsenic in its reduced iii state desorption of its oxidized v form in high ph oxidizing conditions or oxidation of arsenic containing sulfide minerals smedley and kinneburgh 2002 buschmann et al 2007 amini et al 2008 ph and redox conditions also affect other geogenic drinking water contaminants that can occur in groundwater such as radium selenium and uranium white et al 1991 langmuir 1978 smedley and kinneburgh 2002 szabo et al 2005a 2005b coyte et al 2018 nitrate a widespread contaminant from agriculture and human waste disposal with human health and ecological consequences persists in groundwater unless microbiologically attenuated under anoxic conditions green et al 2008 rivett et al 2008 burow et al 2010 the presence of oxic or anoxic conditions also can determine whether anthropogenic organic compounds such as chlorinated solvents and gasoline hydrocarbons can be degraded or will persist as toxic contaminants suarez and rifai 1999 chapelle 2001 thus ph and redox conditions through their influence on mineral solubility oxidation reduction reactions ion exchange and microbiological processes are important factors to consider when investigating the distribution of many geogenic and anthropogenic contaminants in groundwater ph also affects the aesthetic quality of drinking water and is a factor in determining its corrosivity a recommended acceptable range of ph for drinking water supplies is 6 5 8 5 u s environmental protection agency 2017 world health organization 2017 the ph of groundwater in poorly buffered aquifer materials such as quartz rich unconsolidated sediments and some crystalline rocks can be below this range and is typically so in parts of the nacp aquifer system lang and swedberg 1990 desimone et al 2009 brown et al 2019 the potential for low ph potentially corrosive water to mobilize lead or other metals from pipes and plumbing is a serious concern particularly for people served by private drinking water wells which typically do not receive the treatment provided to public water supplies to minimize corrosivity and attain acceptable ph values ainsworth et al 2004 pieper et al 2015 2018 belitz et al 2016 kennedy 2019 an estimated 1 8 million people were served by private wells in the nacp aquifer system in 2005 maupin and arnold 2010 machine learning methods when combined with large spatially distributed data sets provide a means of mapping chemical characteristics of groundwater that have been difficult to extrapolate beyond point measurements at wells because of the heterogeneity of hydrogeologic systems the patchy distribution of sources and the complex processes that alter groundwater chemistry along flow paths large distances between data points resulting from the expense of sampling the deep subsurface also are typical of regional groundwater chemistry data sets sparse data have made it difficult to map groundwater quality without basing such maps on some underlying feature such as geology an approach that necessarily gives prominence to one or a small number of the many factors influencing groundwater chemistry or using purely interpolative methods such as kriging alley 1993 kirkwood et al 2016 recent studies have shown that machine learning methods can be used to map chemical constituents and characteristics of groundwater including arsenic chloride manganese nitrate specific conductance dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids in diverse hydrogeologic settings using existing data sets of groundwater chemistry and features that describe geology hydrology anthropogenic inputs and other explanatory factors rodriguez gliano et al 2014 nolan et al 2015 tesoriero et al 2015 ayotte et al 2016 ransom et al 2017 rosecranz et al 2017a 2017b erickson et al 2018 knoll et al 2019 koch et al 2019 knierim et al 2019 unlike the process based approaches traditionally used to model groundwater data numerical models that simulate flow or geochemical models that predict equilibrium constituent concentrations machine learning models find patterns of occurrence in large data sets and use these patterns to make predictions without knowledge of underlying processes machine learning methods are well suited to modeling groundwater quality because they make no assumptions about the underlying statistical distribution of the parameter being modeled the response variable allow complex relations and correlations among explanatory and response variables can handle missing data outliers and many types of explanatory variables and can yield accurate predictive models khalil et al 2005 elith et al 2008 kuhn and johnson 2013 the nacp aquifer system fig 1 is a complex layered system of 10 regional aquifers composed of fluvial deltaic and marine sediments the aquifer system provides about half of the water used for public and domestic supply in a densely populated region of nearly 21 million people along the eastern usa coast as well as water for industrial and agricultural purposes masterson et al 2016a redox and ph sensitive constituents including manganese arsenic nitrate and in some areas radium and gross alpha radioactivity are among the most frequently found drinking water contaminants in groundwater bolton 2000 denver et al 2014 lindsey and belitz 2016 at the regional scale water quality varies systematically along flow paths with a well documented geochemical evolution that includes changes in ph dissolved oxygen major ions and some trace elements back and barnes 1965 back 1966 chapelle 1983 chapelle and knobel 1983 knobel et al 1998 brown et al 2019 thus maps of the regional and depth dependent distribution of ph and redox conditions in the nacp aquifer system would be valuable tools to identify areas more or less vulnerable to drinking water contaminants in this study we apply machine learning methods to model and map ph and dissolved oxygen as a measure of redox conditions in the nacp aquifer system the maps provide a three dimensional depiction of geochemical conditions and the geographic locations of those parts of the aquifer system potentially vulnerable to ph and redox sensitive contaminants the models are built using the boosted regression trees brt machine learning algorithm which has been shown to provide accurate and unbiased predictions in a variety of environmental applications including groundwater chemistry and hydrology martin et al 2014 nolan et al 2015 naghibi et al 2016 wang et al 2016 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 giri et al 2019 knoll et al 2019 explanatory variables predictors provided to the brt algorithm for model development describe the surficial geology hydrology chemistry physical characteristics anthropogenic influence metrics from a groundwater flow model and groundwater residence times influential predictors in the final models are examined to investigate how the models conform to prior understanding of the processes controlling ph and redox conditions in the aquifer system and the uncertainty and limitations of predictions are evaluated the machine learning methods are found to provide an effective means of mapping regional groundwater quality in this complex layered aquifer system 2 study area the study area within the northern atlantic coastal plain aquifer system area occupies approximately 76 000 square kilometers km2 of land area along the eastern coast of the usa extending from long island new york to northeastern north carolina fig 1 the climate is temperate and humid topography is generally flat to gently rolling with maximum elevations of about 150 meters m a number of major river valleys dissect the land surface and are flooded at the coastline forming estuaries such as chesapeake and delaware bays ator et al 2005 land use overall is classified as undeveloped including forest and wetland 57 agriculture 30 and developed 13 with proportionately more extensive areas of developed land in the north and more agriculture on the delmarva peninsula in the center of the study area masterson et al 2016a groundwater is used for public and domestic supply agriculture industry and commercial use withdrawals from the aquifer system were about 1500 million gallons per day mgal d in 2010 maupin et al 2014 groundwater from the nacp aquifer system supplies 44 about 1000 mgal d of the total withdrawals for public and domestic supply in the region and supplies about 500 mgal d for industrial and agricultural use masterson et al 2016a the nacp aquifer system is composed of unconsolidated to partially consolidated layers of sand silt clay and gravel of early cretaceous to holocene age and fluvial deltaic and marine origin trapp 1992 mcfarland 2010 masterson et al 2013 the layered sediments dip and thicken east and southward from a western boundary zone with adjacent igneous and metamorphic rocks the fall zone to the atlantic continental shelf fig 1 they overlie consolidated precambrian to paleozoic age bedrock and range in thickness from 0 near the fall zone to more than 1000 m offshore within the complex wedge of sedimentary layers permeable sand and gravel sediments form aquifers and low permeability layers of silt and clay form confining units fig 1 regionally 19 hydrogeologic units are recognized 10 aquifers and 9 interlayered confining units trapp 1992 masterson et al 2013 table 1 from shallowest to deepest the aquifers are the surficial aquifer 1 the upper chesapeake aquifer 3 the lower chesapeake aquifer 5 the piney point aquifer 7 the aquia aquifer 9 the monmouth mt laurel aquifer 11 the matawan aquifer 13 the magothy aquifer 15 the potomac patapsco aquifer 17 and the potomac patuxent aquifer 19 numbers designate hydrogeologic unit in order from land surface only the thin surficial aquifer which extends across the study area is completely unconfined the 9 underlying aquifers are buried beneath low permeability confining layers table 1 except where they outcrop or subcrop along their western edges near the fall zone or in incised stream valleys maps of the regional aquifers and their confined areas are provided in the supplementary information withdrawals for water supply when aggregated across the entire nacp aquifer system are largest from the surficial lower chesapeake magothy potomac patapsco and potomac patuxent aquifers together these five aquifers accounted for 84 of total withdrawals in 2008 masterson et al 2016a table 1 within regions however each of the 10 aquifers is important for water supply for example the piney point aquifer provided nearly half of the groundwater withdrawals for water supply in the study area in north carolina the aquia aquifer provided 17 of withdrawals in the maryland western shore area and the magothy aquifer provided 70 of withdrawals on long island new york where it is thick and mostly unconfined groundwater in the confined aquifers of the nacp system generally flows eastwards from outcrop subcrop recharge areas towards the coast or towards large rivers and estuaries in modern times flow in underlying layers also is downward and radially towards large pumping centers in the surficial aquifer recharge occurs across the land surface and flow is to local streams as well as to coastal water bodies approximately 98 of annually recharged groundwater flows through the surficial aquifer and residence times are short typically less than 50 years ekwurzel et al 1994 szabo et al 1996 masterson et al 2016a in the deeper underlying aquifer groundwater ranges in residence time from less than 50 years to tens of thousands of years szabo et al 1996 nelms et al 2003 groundwater chemistry reflects aquifer lithology and flow system dynamics in the surficial aquifer groundwater is generally oxic acidic and dilute except in poorly drained lowland areas along the coast or other areas of organic rich sediments reflecting the quartz rich siliciclastic lithology and short flow paths ator et al 2005 denver et al 2014 major ion chemistry is variable and influenced by anthropogenic inputs knobel et al 1998 ator 2008 fleming et al 2017 in the underlying aquifers systemic changes are exhibited as groundwater flows from outcrop subcrop recharge areas to distal and deep parts of aquifers these changes which result from dissolution precipitation reactions and ion exchange include increases in ph and total dissolved solids and changes in major ion chemistry from ca mg hco3 to na hco3 to na cl type chapelle 1983 chapelle and knobel 1983 knobel et al 1998 brown et al 2019 the underlying aquifers are primarily anoxic outside of the outcrop subcrop recharge areas and iron reducing sulfate reducing and methanogenic conditions are present within the anoxic zones pucci et al 1992 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 brown et al 2019 3 materials and methods 3 1 ph and dissolved oxygen data data from 5236 wells for ph and from 3387 wells for dissolved oxygen served as the response variable data in the models fig 1 the data were from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system database nwis 85 of ph and 100 of dissolved oxygen data the u s environmental protection agency safe drinking water information system sdwis 12 6 of ph data u s environmental protection agency 2013 and several state agencies 2 4 of ph data most 92 of the data were from samples collected between 1988 and 2018 these data were compiled as part of a national data aggregation by the usgs in support of multiple water quality investigations erickson et al 2019 the remainder of data 8 were from samples collected from 1968 to 1987 in the state of virginia which were added to increase data density in the southern part of the study area the additional data in virginia were compiled directly from the usgs nwis database u s geological survey 2019 mcfarland 2010 all samples were untreated groundwater the data were from a variety of well types as a consequence of being collected for numerous individual projects and purposes but were about evenly split between supply wells public domestic and other uses and monitoring wells only wells with depth and open interval information adequate to assign them to a regional aquifer were used and wells of depths 3 m were excluded the ph and dissolved oxygen data were reviewed to eliminate values with obvious data entry errors or extreme and unlikely values of ph ph 2 or 10 data clearly representing saline water chloride concentration 10 000 milligrams per liter mg l also were omitted for dissolved oxygen the numerical concentration data were then recoded into binary categorical classes of greater than or less than three threshold concentrations 0 5 1 and 2 mg l the water quality data are available in an accompanying data release desimone and pope 2020 and are plotted by aquifer in the supplementary material 3 2 predictor variables a total of 104 predictor variables were provided as input to the machine learning models table 2 these were spatial variables describing the surficial hydrogeology hydrology climate precipitation chemistry soil properties topography land cover and anthropogenic influence in the study area variables describing geographic location and vertical position of the well and variables based on a regional groundwater flow model the 104 variable set was reduced from an initially larger set of nearly 200 variables by eliminating correlated variables variables of little influence in preliminary models and variables at spatial scales that did not conform well to the spatial scale of the prediction grid or study area data sources and detailed information about the final set of input predictor variables and any pre processing applied is provided in the supplementary material variables were attributed to wells and prediction grid points the central locations of 1 km2 grid cells by one of three methods depending on the type of variable 1 variable values were aggregated within 500 m circular buffer areas surrounding the well or prediction grid point location for most variables that characterized conditions at the land surface for example recharge soil properties or land use for variables aggregated within buffer areas in this way values were area weighted means for numeric variables or percentages within the areas for categorical variables 2 point extraction was used for surface variables that varied little at the scale of the 500 m buffer for example surficial hydrogeology or surface variables that varied smoothly across high resolution data sets for example temperature and precipitation data for variables attributed by point extraction the value of the variable at the location of the well or prediction grid point was determined by intersecting well or prediction grid data points with the variable s source data layer 3 variables from the regional groundwater flow model and simulated groundwater residence time age were attributed to wells by setting them equal to the values of the 1 6 km2 1 mi2 model grid cell in which the well was located in the groundwater flow model each aquifer layer corresponded to a separate model layer masterson et al 2013 pope et al 2016 the flow model variables attributed to wells were the ones corresponding to the aquifer layer in which the well depth and open interval placed the well this characteristic of the well corresponded to its aquifer designation and was also used as a categorical predictor variable to attribute variables from the groundwater flow model and residence time variables to the prediction grid points the prediction grid and flow model grid were first intersected area weighted averages of values from the model grid cell values within the prediction grid cells were then calculated and assigned to the prediction grid points at the center of each prediction grid cell long term averages were used for variables such as precipitation chemistry and land use that represent temporally changing conditions at land surface during modern times the rationale for this approach was as follows although groundwater ph and dissolved oxygen may respond to short term e g annual changes in surface conditions the modern time period for which time varying information is available for surface variables is small years to decades compared to the time scales over which groundwater has resided within most of the regional flow system decades to millennia additionally our data were collected over multi decadal time scales and were not sufficiently dense to parse out temporal variation linked to changing surface conditions within modern times in model development or prediction for variables from the groundwater flow model that varied over time such as total flux two time periods were included predevelopment which represented the time period prior to 1900 and current conditions which represented the time period of 2014 2018 3 3 machine learning models the boosted regression trees method brt friedman 2001 2002 was used to fit machine learning models to the ph and dissolved oxygen data as implemented in the gbm package v 2 1 5 ridgeway 2019 of r v 3 5 1 r core team 2018 brt is an additive ensemble decision tree method in which each successive tree is fit to the residuals of the previous model while minimizing a loss function and a fraction of the new tree s predictions is added to the predictions from the previous trees elith et al 2008 hastie et al 2009 kuhn and johnson 2013 bagging meaning that only part of the training data is used to develop each new tree introduces a random element that improves accuracy and speed friedman 2002 we chose the brt method for this study for several reasons the brt method has been shown to produce highly accurate models for regional mapping it is resistant to outliers and the inclusion of non informative predictors it can accommodate missing data and interactions among variables and it is widely used easily applied through well documented r packages and relatively simple to explain hastie et al 2009 kuhn and johnson 2013 brt has been successful in predicting groundwater nitrate nolan et al 2015 ransom et al 2017 knoll et al 2019 arsenic ayotte et al 2016 erickson et al 2018 and ph and redox conditions tesoriero et al 2015 rosecranz et al 2017a 2017b and other aspects of groundwater chemistry and hydrology naghibi et al 2016 wang et al 2016 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 and compares well to other machine learning methods in these applications nolan et al 2015 naghibi et al 2016 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 knoll et al 2019 brt may be used for both regression problems and classification problems by specifying the loss function that is minimized during model fitting for ph we fit a regression model and for dissolved oxygen we fit classification models the gaussian and bernoulli distributions were chosen from among the options for loss functions in the gbm package for simplicity and computational efficiency the gaussian distribution also is appropriate when outliers are not prominent as was the case in our ph data set the bernoulli distribution is appropriate for binary classification problems such as posed by the dissolved oxygen models four tuning parameters control brt model structure and complexity the number of trees n trees which controls the number of iterations of the sequential process the tree or interaction depth which specifies the maximum number of splits per tree the learning rate or shrinkage which specifies the additive contribution of each new tree and the minimum number of observations per terminal node min obsinnode machine learning models like brt can overfit to produce models that are too closely tuned to the development data set such models do not generalize well and may predict poorly when applied to new data the need to avoid overfitting was particularly relevant to our study because our heterogeneous data were collected for a wide variety of purposes and may contain local patterns that are not representative of large scale regional patterns in water quality several steps were incorporated into the model development to minimize overfitting and to evaluate the performance of the models to new data the data sets were divided into randomly selected training 80 and holdout 20 subsets table 3 so that model performance with new data not used in model development could be evaluated cross validation was used to identify the best fit model to the training data in cross validation multiple models are developed on subsets of the training data and fit statistics aggregated for each set of tuning parameters kuhn and johnson 2013 cross validation served the purpose of a separate validation data subset in our modeling approach the best fit models were then simplified by selecting simpler model parameters and reducing the number of predictor variables data partitioning into training and holdout subsets and cross validation to identify the best fit models to the training data were implemented with the caret package in r kuhn 2008 v 6 0 81 the createdatapartition function which preserves the distribution of the original undivided data set was used for data partitioning for categorical variables data points are randomly selected from within classes of the response variable for numeric variables data points are randomly selected from within quantiles of the response variable kuhn 2008 consequently training and testing data sets were very similar table 3 median and mean ph were 6 38 and 6 41 respectively for both training and holdout data the standard deviation was 1 32 for the training data and 1 33 for the holdout data dissolved oxygen concentrations were split 33 67 43 57 and 49 51 by the modeled thresholds of 0 5 1 and 2 mg l for both training and holdout data table 3 model performance was evaluated for 980 possible combinations of the four brt tuning parameters through 10 fold cross validation model performance for each combination of tuning parameters was summarized from 10 training and holdout resamples of the training data kuhn 2008 kuhn and johnson 2013 the measure of model performance in cross validation tuning was the root mean square error rmse for regression models and accuracy for classification models for the classification models the best fit models identified with the maximum accuracy in cross validation tuning also were found to have the maximum two models or second highest one model kappa values kappa is an alternative metric that can be a better measure of performance for unbalanced data sets e g data sets with substantially unequal class membership kuhn and johnson 2013 the ranges of tuning parameters tested were n trees 500 5000 varying by 500 interaction depth 2 14 by 2 shrinkage 0 002 0 014 by 0 002 and min obsinnode 8 10 by 2 bag fraction the proportion of the training data selected without replacement for the development of each tree was set at the default value of 0 5 a probability threshold of 0 5 was used to distinguish positive from negative outcomes in the dissolved oxygen models for the purposes of calculating model fit statistics the same 104 predictor variables were used for the initial tuning of all four models to simplify model parameters models with cross validation rmse or accuracy within one standard error 1se of that of the best fit model were identified using the onese function of the caret package breiman et al 1984 kuhn 2008 kuhn and johnson 2013 these models were ranked by complexity where simpler models were considered those of lower interaction depth fewer observations in terminal nodes lower shrinkage and fewer trees tuning parameters were selected corresponding to those of the simplest model among the 1se models the brt model using these parameters was refit to the full data set of all training observations and the 104 predictor variables to yield a simpler model than the best fit model the models were further simplified using the recursive feature elimination rfe method in caret kuhn 2019 to identify variables that had negligible effect on model performance the rfe method removes variables one at a time in reverse order of their predictor variable importance and determines the model performance with the remaining variables model performance was measured by rmse for ph and by the area under the roc receiver operating characteristic curve auc for dissolved oxygen variable influence was calculated by the gbm r package as the contribution of each variable in reducing the loss function friedman 2001 ridgeway 2019 resampling was incorporated with 10 fold cross validation plots of rmse or auc versus variable number were inspected for the ph model the final set of predictors were chosen as those yielding the lowest rmse value for the dissolved oxygen models the highest auc values were associated with sets of about 70 or more variables but in fact auc appeared essentially unchanging in plots for data sets of more than about 50 variables thus final variable data sets were selected for the dissolved oxygen models as those near the point on plots where auc started to consistently decrease upon removal of additional variables variable influence was calculated using the gbm r package and is based on the frequency with which a predictor is used in tree splits and from the resulting improvement in model predictions elith et al 2008 ridgeway 2019 3 4 prediction mapping and uncertainty ph and redox conditions were mapped across the study area by applying the final models to predictor variables evaluated at cells of a 1 km2 grid for each of the 10 regional aquifers for redox conditions the maps represent the probability of anoxic conditions as represented by one of three thresholds of dissolved oxygen concentration 0 5 1 and 2 mg l maps based on one threshold concentration 1 mg l were selected for presentation maps of the remaining thresholds are provided as supplementary material each aquifer was represented by a single depth that corresponded to the vertical midpoint of the aquifer for the surficial aquifer the prediction elevation was the vertical midpoint between the simulated water table masterson et al 2016b and the elevation of the next highest underlying hydrogeologic unit an aquifer or confining unit the prediction elevation was incorporated into the model by setting it equal to the screen bottom elevation variable and by calculating the corresponding value for the well depth variable other variables that varied by regional aquifer such as thickness of the overlying confining units and groundwater flux variables also were set equal to the values for each aquifer thus the 10 aquifer predictions represented sloping surfaces that mimicked the sloping geometry of each aquifer and reflected the water quality of a well installed and open to the aquifer down to the elevation of these surfaces a sensitivity analysis for this approach was performed by making additional predictions at each grid point at vertical locations 25 and 75 of the aquifer thickness from the top of each aquifer or top of the saturated zone for the surficial aquifer the uncertainty of predicted values was estimated using the bootstrapping method of ransom et al 2017 to calculate prediction intervals for the ph model predictions and confidence intervals for the dissolved oxygen model predicted probabilities the training data were resampled with replacement to create 199 bootstrap samples and models were fit to each sample of the training data using the tuning parameters of the final model used for prediction because these 199 models were each developed on a different sample of the training data set they differed in terms of the actual model parameters e g the tree splitting variables and levels and thus yielded a set of 199 different predictions for each grid point ransom et al 2017 to include the additional source of error associated with model fit and thereby calculate prediction intervals for ph a randomly selected value from the training data residuals was subtracted from each bootstrap prediction for the dissolved oxygen model predictions confidence intervals rather than prediction intervals were calculated because confidence intervals are more informative for logistic models having a binary response variable ransom et al 2017 the relative prediction intervals ph model or confidence intervals dissolved oxygen models were calculated at the 90 level from the quantiles of the bootstrap predictions for each prediction grid point ransom et al 2017 schwartz et al 2006 maps of predicted values and prediction or confidence intervals show only the land areas of the aquifers all 10 of the regional aquifers extend beneath the incised coastal embayments and offshore onto the continental shelf masterson et al 2013 although many of the predictor variables were available no water quality data were available to train the model in these areas thus summary statistics for predictions as reported here are only for land extents of aquifers however predictions were made for the entire areal extents of the aquifers and are included in the accompanying data release desimone and pope 2020 the map figures also show only 9 of the 10 regional aquifers omitting the matawan aquifer the matawan aquifer underlies and is similar to the monmouth mt laurel aquifer it is the least important in terms of water use masterson et al 2016a pope et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance and evaluation the final brt model for ph used 28 predictors and the final brt models for dissolved oxygen used 47 53 predictors thus of the 104 predictors used in the model tuning step about three fourths were eliminated for the ph model and about half were eliminated for the dissolved oxygen models metaparameters ranged from 1000 to 4500 for n trees 4 8 for interaction depth and 0 002 to 0 012 for shrinkage min obsinnode was 10 for all 4 models these metaparameters are consistent with the approach of using low learning rates shrinkage and large numbers of trees to avoid overfitting and to reduce model instability friedman 2001 elith et al 2008 ridgeway 2019 metaparameters and fit statistics for the final brt models are given in table 4 measures of performance for the ph model include rmse ph units a measure of the average error and r2 a measure of correlation between predicted and observed values plotted in the supplementary information the rmse and r2 for the final ph model when fit to the entire training data set were 0 475 and 0 871 respectively a better evaluation of model performance is the fit to the holdout data because the holdout data were not used to train or simplify the model the final model rmse of 0 622 and r2 of 0 783 for the holdout data indicated more error than for the training data as expected from applying the model to new data but still demonstrated a good model fit the overall percent bias was low 0 001 for training data and 0 703 for holdout data but the model tended to overpredict low ph values 4 and underpredict high ph values 8 this can be a characteristic of tree based models because of values in the terminal nodes of the trees are averaged to make predictions kuhn and johnson 2013 the rmse for the training data increased and r2 decreased as the model was simplified from the best fit values 0 384 and 0 917 respectively to the values for the 1se model with simpler metaparameters 0 449 to 0 886 to the values for the final model as expected because the simpler models are less closely tied to the training data the rmse and r2 for the holdout data however were very similar for all three stages of model development 0 796 0 788 and 0 783 for rmse and 0 605 0 616 and 0 622 for best fit 1se and final models respectively thus the simplification process did not appear to compromise the ph model s ability to predict to new data the three dissolved oxygen models predict the probability of anoxic conditions specifically the probability of concentrations below each model s threshold concentration measures of performance for these models are based on the frequency of correct assignment to the classes of below event or above non event the threshold concentration a cutoff of 0 5 probability is used to make the assignment accuracy the overall percent of correct classifications for events or non events for the three final models ranged from 0 877 to 0 903 for the training data and from 0 804 to 0 837 for the holdout data accuracy can be misleadingly high for unbalanced data sets because a high accuracy could be generated by chance or by simply classifying most observations into the majority class kuhn and johnson 2013 rosecranz et al 2017b the kappa statistic corrects for this possibility and is an alternative measure of the agreement between predicted and observed classes a value of 0 indicates no agreement and 1 indicates perfect agreement viera and garrett 2005 kuhn and johnson 2013 kappa ranged from 0 716 to 0 800 for training data and from 0 607 to 0 655 for the holdout data table 4 the kappa values for the holdout data are just within a range 0 61 to 0 8 considered to represent substantial agreement viera and garrett 2005 accuracy for the training data decreased in the progression from the best fit model to the simpler 1se and final models whereas holdout accuracy was nearly unchanged for the 0 5 and 2 mg l threshold models and increased slightly for the 1 mg l threshold model values provided in the supplementary information training data kappa also decreased from best fit to simpler models whereas holdout kappa was nearly unchanged or increased slightly thus like for the ph models model simplification did not alter the predictive capability of the dissolved oxygen models and may have improved it slightly for the 1 mg l threshold model sensitivity the correct classification of anoxic conditions was lower than specificity the correct classification of oxic conditions for both training and holdout data for all three models table 4 the auc fit statistic or the area under the roc curve incorporates both sensitivity and specificity and takes into account all possible cutoffs of probability for class assignment a value of 0 5 essentially reflects agreement due to chance and a value of 1 represents perfect agreement between predicted and observed classes fawcett 2006 auc ranged from 0 931 to 0 967 for training data and from 0 874 to 0 890 for hold out data the auc along with the other fit statistics indicates good agreement between predicted and observed class assignments for the dissolved oxygen models 4 2 mapped ph and redox predictions maps of predicted ph and the predicted probability of anoxic conditions fig 2 show that acidic groundwater and oxic conditions extend throughout the surficial aquifer and occur in unconfined areas of the underlying aquifers alkaline and anoxic groundwater is generally present elsewhere in the confined and distal parts of aquifers three representative aquifers the surficial lower chesapeake and potomac patapsco aquifers are shown in fig 2 maps of all aquifers and dissolved oxygen models are provided in the supplementary information in the surficial aquifer the ph of groundwater in 90 of the aquifer area was predicted to be lower than the recommended range of 6 5 8 5 for drinking water u s environmental protection agency 2017 world health organization 2017 fig 2a one third 33 of the surficial aquifer area was predicted to have very low ph values of less than 5 5 for the surficial aquifer volumetric percentages 87 less than 6 5 and 32 less than 5 5 were similar to areal percentages in the underlying lower chesapeake and potomac patapsco aquifers areas predicted to have ph lower than the recommended range 25 and 7 respectively roughly coincided with the unconfined parts of the aquifers along their northwestern boundaries in new jersey delaware and maryland and for the potomac patapsco aquifer on long island new york volumetric percentages of lower chesapeake and potomac patapsco aquifers with low ph 17 and 2 respectively were smaller than the areal percentages because of the wedge shaped aquifer geometries and greater aquifer thicknesses in distal confined areas as compared to the proximal unconfined areas higher ph values in the confined parts of the underlying aquifers result from geochemical reactions with aquifer materials along flow paths knobel et al 1998 in the potomac patapsco aquifer an area of predicted low ph extends within the confined area of the aquifer in the maryland western shore area this is consistent with observations and is likely related to aquifer lithology coarse grain size quartz rich mineralogy low calcareous material content and the presence of pyrite back and barnes 1965 back 1966 bolton 2000 ator 2008 only small areas of any of the regional aquifers were predicted to have ph higher than the recommended range at values greater than ph 8 5 these 2 3 by area were in the aquia monmouth mt laurel and matawan aquifers which are almost entirely confined table 1 the predicted distributions of redox conditions represented by the probability of dissolved oxygen concentrations less than 1 mg l fig 2b were generally similar to the geographic patterns in predicted ph reflecting the depletion of the oxygen in precipitation recharge along flow paths a threshold of 0 5 is applied to the probability values to categorize values as oxic or anoxic across the surficial aquifer oxic conditions were predicted in two thirds 68 of its areal extent anoxic conditions were predicted in the surficial aquifer in low lying areas of eastern north carolina in the southern delmarva peninsula and along the coast of new jersey in the underlying lower chesapeake and potomac patapsco aquifers oxic conditions were predicted in 23 and 6 respectively of aquifer areas and 18 and 1 5 respectively of the aquifer volumes in most of the other aquifers oxic conditions were predicted in less than 5 of the aquifer areas or volumes all near the aquifers proximal recharge areas more extensive areas of predicted oxic conditions in the upper chesapeake and piney point aquifers in the virginia western shore area may reflect the presence of incised stream channels that provide recharge windows into the underlying otherwise confined aquifers on long island predicted oxic conditions in confined areas of the magothy and potomac patapsco aquifers may be a result of the low data density for the deeper aquifers in this area in general the patterns of predicted ph and redox conditions shown in the model based maps are consistent with the distribution of ph and dissolved oxygen reported in many studies of groundwater quality in the nacp aquifer system based on well data back and barnes 1965 back 1966 chapelle and knobel 1983 knobel et al 1998 ator et al 2005 ator 2008 mcfarland 2010 denver et al 2014 brown et al 2019 the prediction distribution of oxic conditions from the brt models also was comparable to predictions made with a parsimonious logistic regression model for parts of the study area in delaware maryland and virginia tesoriero et al 2015 the model based maps provide the added benefit of supporting robust estimates of the proportions of aquifers either areal or volumetric likely to contain groundwater of a specified quality aquifer proportions are valuable tools for regional water quality assessments belitz et al 2010 and when map based are enhanced by information about the geographic locations where specific conditions occur ph and redox conditions together control the solubility and mobility of some common groundwater quality constituents and drinking water contaminants as evidenced by the use of eh ph diagrams to describe the stability fields of trace metals in natural waters langmuir 1997 model results of predicted ph and the probability of anoxic conditions can be combined to map these joint conditions as an example the predicted occurrence of oxic anoxic acidic circumneutral and alkaline conditions is shown in fig 3 based on the 2 mg l dissolved oxygen model and ph categories of 6 5 6 5 8 and 8 such maps could be produced as needed from model results for conditions that are specifically appropriate for contaminants of interest the condition of dissolved oxygen 2 mg l and ph 6 5 the acidic and oxic category of fig 3 has been associated with elevated concentrations of lead in groundwater sources of drinking water in the atlantic and gulf coastal plain aquifers which include aquifers from the study area brown et al 2019 areas of the regional aquifers with acidic and oxic conditions as defined by these threshold values were predicted to occur in 52 of the surficial aquifer and 0 1 14 of underlying aquifers fig 3 proportions by volume were 57 for the surficial aquifer and 0 1 11 for the underlying aquifers applications such as these of the modeling results could be used to target aquifer areas for enhanced monitoring and risk assessment to specific contaminants of concern 4 3 examination of predictors five predictor variables the 10th percentile of simulated groundwater residence time age 10th perc aqlay the thickness of overlying confining units thkovr aqlay cu the elevation of the bottom of the well screen screen bot elev ft total simulated groundwater flux under predevelopment conditions flxt aqlay pre and the multi order hydrologic position variable dsd9 were among the top 10 most influential predictors in all four models and included the top two or three predictors in each model fig 4 a complete listing of variable importance and maps of selected influential predictor variables are provided in supplementary material together the combined influence of these five variables accounted for about 50 of the relative influence of all variables in the ph model and 32 44 of the relative influence of all variables in the dissolved oxygen models four of the variables excluding dsd9 are closely and conceptually related to position along groundwater flow paths thus their role as top predictors suggests that the models are capturing the important process based patterns that are understood from previous studies to control the distribution of ph and dissolved oxygen in the nacp aquifer system partial dependence plots pdps show that the relation between these top five predictors and the response variable is similar in all four models pdps depict the average change in the model response when all variables except the variable of interest are held at their observed values greenwell 2017 predicted ph and the predicted probability of reduced oxygen conditions increase with increasing simulated groundwater residence time age 10th perc aqlay with increasing thickness of overlying confining units thkovr aqlay cu and with decreasing elevation of the bottom of the well screen screen bot elev ft all measures of increased distance from recharge either temporally or physically along groundwater flow paths within the aquifer system fig 5 see the supplementary information for plots for all models and for additional variables predicted values decrease with increasing simulated groundwater flux flxt aqlay pre this relation reflects the lower ph and high dissolved oxygen concentrations in the surficial aquifer through which most of the groundwater flux in the aquifer system occurs and in those parts of lower aquifers that are hydraulically connected to the surficial flow system dsd9 is a hydrologic position variable belitz et al 2019 based on the surface drainage network of 9th order streams in the study area dsd9 quantifies the distance from the upland boundary to the coast as modulated by the locations of large estuarine bays it is positively related to predicted ph and to the probability of reduced oxygen conditions this suggests that like the other four top predictors dsd9 is capturing regional scale information about position in the groundwater flow system it may be acting as a measure of distance along deep groundwater flow paths which are directed towards the large incised estuaries as well as towards the coastline masterson et al 2016b other highly influential variables in the ph model include the long term average ph of precipitation ph 30yr 85 11 rank 4 a state based locational variable state zone rank 5 and aquifer aquifer designation rank 7 the relation of predicted ph with ph 30yr 85 11 in a pdp plot is positive as expected however the range of the ph 30yr 85 11 variable was slight about 0 25 ph units and its role in the model may have been partly due to patterns related to groundwater flow hydrogeology or some other characteristic that is captured by the predominantly north south and east west increasing patterns of ph 30yr 85 11 values across the study area the pdp plot of state zone shows lower predicted ph in new jersey and the western shore of maryland than in other parts of the study area this may reflect the prevalence of highly permeable and deeply weathered quartzose sediments and for maryland the other lithologic characteristics previously described in those areas that have little capacity to alter low ph precipitation ator et al 2005 differences among categories of the aquifer designation variable showed lower ph in the surficial upper chesapeake and lower chesapeake aquifers which are unconfined or have relatively large unconfined areas than in other aquifers generally lower ph also was shown in the magothy potomac patapsco and potomac patuxent aquifers which may be due to the unconfined areas of the magothy aquifer on long island and the predominantly fluvial deltaic origin of the potomac patapsco and potomac patuxent aquifers in contrast to the marine origin of the overlying aquifers table 1 in the dissolved oxygen models two soil variables surg hy mean and surg hgd mean a variable designating confinement confined aqlay distance from the fall zone dist fallz ft and a hydrology based climate variable rech reitz et mean were among the top 10 highly influential predictors the surg hy mean rank 6 7 and 9 variable represents hydric soils or soils that are periodically saturated and anerobic and the surg hgd mean variable rank 8 16 and 19 represents soils of hydrologic group d which are soils with a very slow infiltration rate such as clay rich soils or soils with a shallow water table national resources conservation service 2009 wieczorek 2014 these soil types are more widespread along the coastline of new jersey in the southern delmarva peninsula and hydric soils only in the low lying areas of eastern north carolina where anoxic conditions were predicted in the surficial aquifer fig 2b the predicted probability of reduced oxygen conditions in all three models was positively related to the presence of these soil types this association could be due to reduced dissolved oxygen in recharge from reaction with soil organic matter or could be related to aquifer sediment organic matter content of which soil type is an indicator feinstein and thomas 2009 the predicted probability of reduced oxygen conditions also increased with dist fallz ft rank 5 7 and 11 dist fallz ft is a broad measure of distance along groundwater flow paths but also may characterize the location of the lowlands of coastal north carolina because the aquifer is wide and distance from the fall zone is relatively large near the coast in this area the relations of predicted probability with rech reitz et mean rank 5 8 and 21 which is annual evapotranspiration rate estimated nationally from streamflow were complex and not monotonic the relatively large number of predictors in the dissolved oxygen models 47 53 and to a lesser extent the 28 variables in the ph models include multiple variables that are related correlations between variables are acceptable in brt models but can make it difficult to see general patterns in variable influence because the influence of some factors may be split among multiple variables we combined groups of variables to make a general comparison of variable influence within and among the models fig 6 group names are defined in table 2 recognizing that it was not possible to define completely independent groups in terms of the factors being represented and that the groups are unequal in variable numbers this comparison suggests several qualitative generalities about the models variables representing position in the three dimensional flow system appeared generally more important than variables describing surface characteristics an exception is that soil variables were important for dissolved oxygen with the individual soil variables of high influence suggesting that the drainage capacity of soils is important precipitation chemistry variables were important for ph but not nearly as important as groundwater age which was by far the most influential group of variables for the ph model the lower influence of groundwater age variables in the dissolved oxygen models is perhaps surprising but it may be explained by the disparities between the time scales and flow path distances over which dissolved oxygen is depleted in nacp groundwater as compared to the large range of simulated ages of groundwater whereas ph continues to increase over long flow paths dissolved oxygen is depleted more rapidly and concentrations are relatively unchanging as groundwater age and distance along flow paths continue to increase such a pattern was observed in the aquia aquifer by chapelle and knobel 1983 the reduced role of groundwater age in the dissolved oxygen models as compared to the ph model may also reflect the finer spatial scale of controls such as soil characteristics on dissolved oxygen concentrations where it is still present 4 4 uncertainty and limitations the uncertainty of model and mapping results was investigated by estimating 90 prediction or confidence intervals for predicted values at prediction grid points using a bootstrap approach fig 7 histograms of intervals and maps for all aquifers are provided in the supplementary information prediction intervals which include the error associated with model fit to specific prediction points as well as average error associated with the model were determined for predicted ph confidence intervals which are more informative for a binary response value were determined for the predicted probabilities of dissolved oxygen concentrations less than threshold values for ph in all aquifers the mean width of the prediction interval was 1 72 ph units the median was 1 70 and the interquartile range iqr was 0 23 prediction intervals for ph were widest in the three shallowest aquifers the surficial aquifer upper chesapeake and lower chesapeake aquifers mean width 1 74 1 79 but overall there was little difference among aquifers with the mean prediction interval width of individual aquifers ranging from 1 68 to 1 79 the mean and median confidence intervals for the predicted probability of dissolved oxygen less than threshold values were 0 22 and 0 19 for the 0 5 mg l model 0 16 and 0 11 for the 1 mg l model and 0 16 and 0 11 for the 2 mg l model as for the ph model the dissolved oxygen model confidence intervals were generally wider for the three shallowest aquifers than the other aquifers the apparent greater uncertainty of the predicted values in the surficial aquifer than in the underlying aquifers may be due to the greater variability in ph and dissolved oxygen concentrations and the greater heterogeneity of conditions that influence these parameters in the surficial aquifer geographically prediction and confidence intervals were widest in north carolina where data were sparse and for dissolved oxygen especially in the unconfined parts of aquifers where concentrations are more frequently greater than thresholds the heterogeneity of influential conditions conditions not captured by predictors included in the model and data sparsity in some geographic areas suggest that model results would be best used to depict regional patterns rather than to predict ph and redox conditions at specific site locations a limitation of the approach taken in this study is that a single prediction is made for each aquifer layer at the midpoint of its thickness whereas the aquifer layers except for the surficial aquifer can be hundreds of meters thick or more the sensitivity of predicted values to the vertical location of the prediction was investigated by making predictions at two additional vertical locations that bracketed the midpoint positioned at 25 and 75 of the aquifer thickness as measured from the top of each aquifer from top of the saturated zone for the surficial aquifer this was implemented by changing the two predictor variables that captured vertical location well depth well depth and elevation of the bottom of the well screen screen bot elev ft the results of this sensitivity test were evaluated in terms of the differences between the predicted values at the midpoint and at the two additional locations for each point in the 1 km2 grid in general the differences were surprisingly small the mean absolute difference at the 25 and 75 depths from the midpoint prediction were 0 04 and 0 03 ph units respectively and the mean absolute differences for the predicted probability of reduced oxygen concentrations for the 3 models at the 25 and 75 depths were 0 007 0 012 and 0 006 0 088 respectively histograms of differences are provided in the supplementary information thus although vertical location as represented by the screen bot elev ft and well depth variables were highly influential predictors in the models their range at individual prediction points was not large enough to substantially change model predictions overall geographically the areas of greatest difference were in the unconfined parts of underlying units along the fall zone although this was not the location of greatest aquifer thickness for any of the aquifer layers it may be that vertical location was more important in these areas because they were areas of rapid change in groundwater chemistry after recharge it could also be that the density of data in the area better defined vertical variations in ph and dissolved oxygen than in the deeper and more distal parts of aquifers the effect of vertical location could be further investigated by changing other predictors that would be expected to vary in the vertical dimension within aquifers such as simulated groundwater flux and simulated groundwater residence time these were not varied in this sensitivity test because they were based on the groundwater flow model which assigned one value to the entire thickness of each aquifer at each geographic location 5 conclusions in this study we applied machine learning methods to model and map groundwater ph and redox conditions in the northern atlantic coastal plain a layered aquifer system along the eastern coast of the usa the predicted distributions of ph and anoxic or oxic groundwater as represented by dissolved oxygen concentrations below three threshold values agreed well with the documented patterns that result from the geochemical evolution of groundwater along flow paths the model based maps can be used to estimate the areal or volumetric proportions of aquifers likely to contain groundwater of a specified quality in this way they provide tools for regional water quality assessments and identify geographic areas with specific ph or redox conditions the models could be improved by increased data density in the southern part of the study area where water quality data were sparse or by further investigation of vertical variation of both predictors and response variables in thick aquifers examination of the predictor variables showed that the most influential for both ph and dissolved oxygen models included those characterizing position within the three dimensional aquifer system with respect to travel time confinement and depth and distance from groundwater recharge areas surface characteristics also were among the most influential especially for the dissolved oxygen models and specifically variables describing soil drainage thus although the models are not process based they are to some extent interpretable and consistent with prior understanding of the important processes controlling ph and redox conditions in the nacp aquifer system it is not possible to be certain that the influence of variables is due to process based causal type relations however because variables may be surrogates for other factors not captured in the predictor data but that are successfully used by the machine learning algorithm to optimize model fit geographic patterns of occurrence and influential predictors in the models of ph and dissolved oxygen are similar in the nacp aquifer system because both ph and redox conditions evolve with groundwater flow the commonality of influential predictor variables and the similarity in the direction of their influence suggests that in future studies it might be possible to model the common occurrence of ph and redox conditions as a multi level categorical response variable such models could be used to target the specific conditions that are associated with contaminants such as trace metals whose mobility and occurrence is controlled by the combination of these conditions in aquifers we expect that the models and maps produced in this study would be most useful for regional scale applications to better understand the distribution of ph and redox sensitive constituents these uses could include vulnerability assessments of drinking water sources to contaminants such as arsenic manganese and lead or applications to quantify the potential groundwater contribution of excess nitrate to coastal waters results of this study demonstrate that the machine learning methods especially

8342,study region the study was conducted in the northern atlantic coastal plain aquifer system in the eastern usa study focus groundwater ph and redox conditions are fundamental chemical characteristics controlling the distribution of many contaminants of concern for drinking water or the ecological health of receiving waters in this study ph and redox conditions were modeled and mapped in a complex layered aquifer system machine learning methods boosted regression trees were applied to data from 3000 to 5000 wells predicted ph and the probability of anoxic conditions defined by three thresholds of dissolved oxygen 0 5 1 and 2 mg l were mapped at the 1 km2 scale for each of 10 regional aquifer layers new hydrological insights for the region maps depict the extent of acidic groundwater and oxic conditions in the shallow unconfined surficial aquifer and in unconfined recharge proximal areas of underlying aquifers in contrast to alkaline and anoxic groundwater elsewhere geographic patterns and influential predictors including elevation overlying confining units thickness and simulated groundwater age and flux are consistent with prior understanding of the processes controlling ph and redox in the aquifer system the model based maps support robust estimates of aquifer proportions either areal or volumetric likely to contain groundwater of a specified quality or be vulnerable to specific ph or redox sensitive contaminants the machine learning methods were an effective tool to map groundwater quality at the regional scale keywords groundwater age northern atlantic coastal plain ph dissolved oxygen machine learning groundwater quality redox conditions 1 introduction understanding where contaminants occur at the regional scale in aquifers is essential for the effective management of groundwater resources and for the evaluation of the risk to drinking water supplies the distribution of many contaminants of concern for human health and ecological effects depends on geochemical conditions within aquifers specifically ph and redox conditions although they are fundamental characteristics of groundwater ph and redox conditions typically are not included when groundwater quality is evaluated for vulnerability or risk assessments because adequate information on their spatial distribution within aquifers is lacking panagopoulos et al 2006 machiwal et al 2018 in this study we demonstrate the use of machine learning methods to model and map ph and redox conditions from existing data in the northern atlantic coastal plain nacp aquifer system in the eastern usa groundwater from the nacp aquifer system is heavily used for water supply and discharges to sensitive coastal waters such chesapeake bay the largest estuary in the usa thus conditions controlling contaminants in the aquifer system are of great interest for human and ecological health arsenic manganese and nitrate are some of the constituents of human health and ecological concern in groundwater that are affected by ph or redox conditions arsenic and manganese are among the most common geogenic contaminants in aquifers in the united states and occur globally at concentrations of concern for human health nordstrom 2002 fendorf et al 2010 frisbie et al 2012 desimone et al 2014 welch et al 2000 high manganese concentrations occur in groundwater under reducing conditions because manganese in its reduced ii ionic state is more soluble than in its oxidized iv state langmuir 1997 homoncik et al 2010 bondu et al 2018 high arsenic concentrations can occur in groundwater in both reducing and oxidizing conditions through different processes reductive dissolution of iron and manganese oxides releasing arsenic in its reduced iii state desorption of its oxidized v form in high ph oxidizing conditions or oxidation of arsenic containing sulfide minerals smedley and kinneburgh 2002 buschmann et al 2007 amini et al 2008 ph and redox conditions also affect other geogenic drinking water contaminants that can occur in groundwater such as radium selenium and uranium white et al 1991 langmuir 1978 smedley and kinneburgh 2002 szabo et al 2005a 2005b coyte et al 2018 nitrate a widespread contaminant from agriculture and human waste disposal with human health and ecological consequences persists in groundwater unless microbiologically attenuated under anoxic conditions green et al 2008 rivett et al 2008 burow et al 2010 the presence of oxic or anoxic conditions also can determine whether anthropogenic organic compounds such as chlorinated solvents and gasoline hydrocarbons can be degraded or will persist as toxic contaminants suarez and rifai 1999 chapelle 2001 thus ph and redox conditions through their influence on mineral solubility oxidation reduction reactions ion exchange and microbiological processes are important factors to consider when investigating the distribution of many geogenic and anthropogenic contaminants in groundwater ph also affects the aesthetic quality of drinking water and is a factor in determining its corrosivity a recommended acceptable range of ph for drinking water supplies is 6 5 8 5 u s environmental protection agency 2017 world health organization 2017 the ph of groundwater in poorly buffered aquifer materials such as quartz rich unconsolidated sediments and some crystalline rocks can be below this range and is typically so in parts of the nacp aquifer system lang and swedberg 1990 desimone et al 2009 brown et al 2019 the potential for low ph potentially corrosive water to mobilize lead or other metals from pipes and plumbing is a serious concern particularly for people served by private drinking water wells which typically do not receive the treatment provided to public water supplies to minimize corrosivity and attain acceptable ph values ainsworth et al 2004 pieper et al 2015 2018 belitz et al 2016 kennedy 2019 an estimated 1 8 million people were served by private wells in the nacp aquifer system in 2005 maupin and arnold 2010 machine learning methods when combined with large spatially distributed data sets provide a means of mapping chemical characteristics of groundwater that have been difficult to extrapolate beyond point measurements at wells because of the heterogeneity of hydrogeologic systems the patchy distribution of sources and the complex processes that alter groundwater chemistry along flow paths large distances between data points resulting from the expense of sampling the deep subsurface also are typical of regional groundwater chemistry data sets sparse data have made it difficult to map groundwater quality without basing such maps on some underlying feature such as geology an approach that necessarily gives prominence to one or a small number of the many factors influencing groundwater chemistry or using purely interpolative methods such as kriging alley 1993 kirkwood et al 2016 recent studies have shown that machine learning methods can be used to map chemical constituents and characteristics of groundwater including arsenic chloride manganese nitrate specific conductance dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids in diverse hydrogeologic settings using existing data sets of groundwater chemistry and features that describe geology hydrology anthropogenic inputs and other explanatory factors rodriguez gliano et al 2014 nolan et al 2015 tesoriero et al 2015 ayotte et al 2016 ransom et al 2017 rosecranz et al 2017a 2017b erickson et al 2018 knoll et al 2019 koch et al 2019 knierim et al 2019 unlike the process based approaches traditionally used to model groundwater data numerical models that simulate flow or geochemical models that predict equilibrium constituent concentrations machine learning models find patterns of occurrence in large data sets and use these patterns to make predictions without knowledge of underlying processes machine learning methods are well suited to modeling groundwater quality because they make no assumptions about the underlying statistical distribution of the parameter being modeled the response variable allow complex relations and correlations among explanatory and response variables can handle missing data outliers and many types of explanatory variables and can yield accurate predictive models khalil et al 2005 elith et al 2008 kuhn and johnson 2013 the nacp aquifer system fig 1 is a complex layered system of 10 regional aquifers composed of fluvial deltaic and marine sediments the aquifer system provides about half of the water used for public and domestic supply in a densely populated region of nearly 21 million people along the eastern usa coast as well as water for industrial and agricultural purposes masterson et al 2016a redox and ph sensitive constituents including manganese arsenic nitrate and in some areas radium and gross alpha radioactivity are among the most frequently found drinking water contaminants in groundwater bolton 2000 denver et al 2014 lindsey and belitz 2016 at the regional scale water quality varies systematically along flow paths with a well documented geochemical evolution that includes changes in ph dissolved oxygen major ions and some trace elements back and barnes 1965 back 1966 chapelle 1983 chapelle and knobel 1983 knobel et al 1998 brown et al 2019 thus maps of the regional and depth dependent distribution of ph and redox conditions in the nacp aquifer system would be valuable tools to identify areas more or less vulnerable to drinking water contaminants in this study we apply machine learning methods to model and map ph and dissolved oxygen as a measure of redox conditions in the nacp aquifer system the maps provide a three dimensional depiction of geochemical conditions and the geographic locations of those parts of the aquifer system potentially vulnerable to ph and redox sensitive contaminants the models are built using the boosted regression trees brt machine learning algorithm which has been shown to provide accurate and unbiased predictions in a variety of environmental applications including groundwater chemistry and hydrology martin et al 2014 nolan et al 2015 naghibi et al 2016 wang et al 2016 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 giri et al 2019 knoll et al 2019 explanatory variables predictors provided to the brt algorithm for model development describe the surficial geology hydrology chemistry physical characteristics anthropogenic influence metrics from a groundwater flow model and groundwater residence times influential predictors in the final models are examined to investigate how the models conform to prior understanding of the processes controlling ph and redox conditions in the aquifer system and the uncertainty and limitations of predictions are evaluated the machine learning methods are found to provide an effective means of mapping regional groundwater quality in this complex layered aquifer system 2 study area the study area within the northern atlantic coastal plain aquifer system area occupies approximately 76 000 square kilometers km2 of land area along the eastern coast of the usa extending from long island new york to northeastern north carolina fig 1 the climate is temperate and humid topography is generally flat to gently rolling with maximum elevations of about 150 meters m a number of major river valleys dissect the land surface and are flooded at the coastline forming estuaries such as chesapeake and delaware bays ator et al 2005 land use overall is classified as undeveloped including forest and wetland 57 agriculture 30 and developed 13 with proportionately more extensive areas of developed land in the north and more agriculture on the delmarva peninsula in the center of the study area masterson et al 2016a groundwater is used for public and domestic supply agriculture industry and commercial use withdrawals from the aquifer system were about 1500 million gallons per day mgal d in 2010 maupin et al 2014 groundwater from the nacp aquifer system supplies 44 about 1000 mgal d of the total withdrawals for public and domestic supply in the region and supplies about 500 mgal d for industrial and agricultural use masterson et al 2016a the nacp aquifer system is composed of unconsolidated to partially consolidated layers of sand silt clay and gravel of early cretaceous to holocene age and fluvial deltaic and marine origin trapp 1992 mcfarland 2010 masterson et al 2013 the layered sediments dip and thicken east and southward from a western boundary zone with adjacent igneous and metamorphic rocks the fall zone to the atlantic continental shelf fig 1 they overlie consolidated precambrian to paleozoic age bedrock and range in thickness from 0 near the fall zone to more than 1000 m offshore within the complex wedge of sedimentary layers permeable sand and gravel sediments form aquifers and low permeability layers of silt and clay form confining units fig 1 regionally 19 hydrogeologic units are recognized 10 aquifers and 9 interlayered confining units trapp 1992 masterson et al 2013 table 1 from shallowest to deepest the aquifers are the surficial aquifer 1 the upper chesapeake aquifer 3 the lower chesapeake aquifer 5 the piney point aquifer 7 the aquia aquifer 9 the monmouth mt laurel aquifer 11 the matawan aquifer 13 the magothy aquifer 15 the potomac patapsco aquifer 17 and the potomac patuxent aquifer 19 numbers designate hydrogeologic unit in order from land surface only the thin surficial aquifer which extends across the study area is completely unconfined the 9 underlying aquifers are buried beneath low permeability confining layers table 1 except where they outcrop or subcrop along their western edges near the fall zone or in incised stream valleys maps of the regional aquifers and their confined areas are provided in the supplementary information withdrawals for water supply when aggregated across the entire nacp aquifer system are largest from the surficial lower chesapeake magothy potomac patapsco and potomac patuxent aquifers together these five aquifers accounted for 84 of total withdrawals in 2008 masterson et al 2016a table 1 within regions however each of the 10 aquifers is important for water supply for example the piney point aquifer provided nearly half of the groundwater withdrawals for water supply in the study area in north carolina the aquia aquifer provided 17 of withdrawals in the maryland western shore area and the magothy aquifer provided 70 of withdrawals on long island new york where it is thick and mostly unconfined groundwater in the confined aquifers of the nacp system generally flows eastwards from outcrop subcrop recharge areas towards the coast or towards large rivers and estuaries in modern times flow in underlying layers also is downward and radially towards large pumping centers in the surficial aquifer recharge occurs across the land surface and flow is to local streams as well as to coastal water bodies approximately 98 of annually recharged groundwater flows through the surficial aquifer and residence times are short typically less than 50 years ekwurzel et al 1994 szabo et al 1996 masterson et al 2016a in the deeper underlying aquifer groundwater ranges in residence time from less than 50 years to tens of thousands of years szabo et al 1996 nelms et al 2003 groundwater chemistry reflects aquifer lithology and flow system dynamics in the surficial aquifer groundwater is generally oxic acidic and dilute except in poorly drained lowland areas along the coast or other areas of organic rich sediments reflecting the quartz rich siliciclastic lithology and short flow paths ator et al 2005 denver et al 2014 major ion chemistry is variable and influenced by anthropogenic inputs knobel et al 1998 ator 2008 fleming et al 2017 in the underlying aquifers systemic changes are exhibited as groundwater flows from outcrop subcrop recharge areas to distal and deep parts of aquifers these changes which result from dissolution precipitation reactions and ion exchange include increases in ph and total dissolved solids and changes in major ion chemistry from ca mg hco3 to na hco3 to na cl type chapelle 1983 chapelle and knobel 1983 knobel et al 1998 brown et al 2019 the underlying aquifers are primarily anoxic outside of the outcrop subcrop recharge areas and iron reducing sulfate reducing and methanogenic conditions are present within the anoxic zones pucci et al 1992 mcmahon and chapelle 2008 brown et al 2019 3 materials and methods 3 1 ph and dissolved oxygen data data from 5236 wells for ph and from 3387 wells for dissolved oxygen served as the response variable data in the models fig 1 the data were from the u s geological survey usgs national water information system database nwis 85 of ph and 100 of dissolved oxygen data the u s environmental protection agency safe drinking water information system sdwis 12 6 of ph data u s environmental protection agency 2013 and several state agencies 2 4 of ph data most 92 of the data were from samples collected between 1988 and 2018 these data were compiled as part of a national data aggregation by the usgs in support of multiple water quality investigations erickson et al 2019 the remainder of data 8 were from samples collected from 1968 to 1987 in the state of virginia which were added to increase data density in the southern part of the study area the additional data in virginia were compiled directly from the usgs nwis database u s geological survey 2019 mcfarland 2010 all samples were untreated groundwater the data were from a variety of well types as a consequence of being collected for numerous individual projects and purposes but were about evenly split between supply wells public domestic and other uses and monitoring wells only wells with depth and open interval information adequate to assign them to a regional aquifer were used and wells of depths 3 m were excluded the ph and dissolved oxygen data were reviewed to eliminate values with obvious data entry errors or extreme and unlikely values of ph ph 2 or 10 data clearly representing saline water chloride concentration 10 000 milligrams per liter mg l also were omitted for dissolved oxygen the numerical concentration data were then recoded into binary categorical classes of greater than or less than three threshold concentrations 0 5 1 and 2 mg l the water quality data are available in an accompanying data release desimone and pope 2020 and are plotted by aquifer in the supplementary material 3 2 predictor variables a total of 104 predictor variables were provided as input to the machine learning models table 2 these were spatial variables describing the surficial hydrogeology hydrology climate precipitation chemistry soil properties topography land cover and anthropogenic influence in the study area variables describing geographic location and vertical position of the well and variables based on a regional groundwater flow model the 104 variable set was reduced from an initially larger set of nearly 200 variables by eliminating correlated variables variables of little influence in preliminary models and variables at spatial scales that did not conform well to the spatial scale of the prediction grid or study area data sources and detailed information about the final set of input predictor variables and any pre processing applied is provided in the supplementary material variables were attributed to wells and prediction grid points the central locations of 1 km2 grid cells by one of three methods depending on the type of variable 1 variable values were aggregated within 500 m circular buffer areas surrounding the well or prediction grid point location for most variables that characterized conditions at the land surface for example recharge soil properties or land use for variables aggregated within buffer areas in this way values were area weighted means for numeric variables or percentages within the areas for categorical variables 2 point extraction was used for surface variables that varied little at the scale of the 500 m buffer for example surficial hydrogeology or surface variables that varied smoothly across high resolution data sets for example temperature and precipitation data for variables attributed by point extraction the value of the variable at the location of the well or prediction grid point was determined by intersecting well or prediction grid data points with the variable s source data layer 3 variables from the regional groundwater flow model and simulated groundwater residence time age were attributed to wells by setting them equal to the values of the 1 6 km2 1 mi2 model grid cell in which the well was located in the groundwater flow model each aquifer layer corresponded to a separate model layer masterson et al 2013 pope et al 2016 the flow model variables attributed to wells were the ones corresponding to the aquifer layer in which the well depth and open interval placed the well this characteristic of the well corresponded to its aquifer designation and was also used as a categorical predictor variable to attribute variables from the groundwater flow model and residence time variables to the prediction grid points the prediction grid and flow model grid were first intersected area weighted averages of values from the model grid cell values within the prediction grid cells were then calculated and assigned to the prediction grid points at the center of each prediction grid cell long term averages were used for variables such as precipitation chemistry and land use that represent temporally changing conditions at land surface during modern times the rationale for this approach was as follows although groundwater ph and dissolved oxygen may respond to short term e g annual changes in surface conditions the modern time period for which time varying information is available for surface variables is small years to decades compared to the time scales over which groundwater has resided within most of the regional flow system decades to millennia additionally our data were collected over multi decadal time scales and were not sufficiently dense to parse out temporal variation linked to changing surface conditions within modern times in model development or prediction for variables from the groundwater flow model that varied over time such as total flux two time periods were included predevelopment which represented the time period prior to 1900 and current conditions which represented the time period of 2014 2018 3 3 machine learning models the boosted regression trees method brt friedman 2001 2002 was used to fit machine learning models to the ph and dissolved oxygen data as implemented in the gbm package v 2 1 5 ridgeway 2019 of r v 3 5 1 r core team 2018 brt is an additive ensemble decision tree method in which each successive tree is fit to the residuals of the previous model while minimizing a loss function and a fraction of the new tree s predictions is added to the predictions from the previous trees elith et al 2008 hastie et al 2009 kuhn and johnson 2013 bagging meaning that only part of the training data is used to develop each new tree introduces a random element that improves accuracy and speed friedman 2002 we chose the brt method for this study for several reasons the brt method has been shown to produce highly accurate models for regional mapping it is resistant to outliers and the inclusion of non informative predictors it can accommodate missing data and interactions among variables and it is widely used easily applied through well documented r packages and relatively simple to explain hastie et al 2009 kuhn and johnson 2013 brt has been successful in predicting groundwater nitrate nolan et al 2015 ransom et al 2017 knoll et al 2019 arsenic ayotte et al 2016 erickson et al 2018 and ph and redox conditions tesoriero et al 2015 rosecranz et al 2017a 2017b and other aspects of groundwater chemistry and hydrology naghibi et al 2016 wang et al 2016 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 and compares well to other machine learning methods in these applications nolan et al 2015 naghibi et al 2016 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 knoll et al 2019 brt may be used for both regression problems and classification problems by specifying the loss function that is minimized during model fitting for ph we fit a regression model and for dissolved oxygen we fit classification models the gaussian and bernoulli distributions were chosen from among the options for loss functions in the gbm package for simplicity and computational efficiency the gaussian distribution also is appropriate when outliers are not prominent as was the case in our ph data set the bernoulli distribution is appropriate for binary classification problems such as posed by the dissolved oxygen models four tuning parameters control brt model structure and complexity the number of trees n trees which controls the number of iterations of the sequential process the tree or interaction depth which specifies the maximum number of splits per tree the learning rate or shrinkage which specifies the additive contribution of each new tree and the minimum number of observations per terminal node min obsinnode machine learning models like brt can overfit to produce models that are too closely tuned to the development data set such models do not generalize well and may predict poorly when applied to new data the need to avoid overfitting was particularly relevant to our study because our heterogeneous data were collected for a wide variety of purposes and may contain local patterns that are not representative of large scale regional patterns in water quality several steps were incorporated into the model development to minimize overfitting and to evaluate the performance of the models to new data the data sets were divided into randomly selected training 80 and holdout 20 subsets table 3 so that model performance with new data not used in model development could be evaluated cross validation was used to identify the best fit model to the training data in cross validation multiple models are developed on subsets of the training data and fit statistics aggregated for each set of tuning parameters kuhn and johnson 2013 cross validation served the purpose of a separate validation data subset in our modeling approach the best fit models were then simplified by selecting simpler model parameters and reducing the number of predictor variables data partitioning into training and holdout subsets and cross validation to identify the best fit models to the training data were implemented with the caret package in r kuhn 2008 v 6 0 81 the createdatapartition function which preserves the distribution of the original undivided data set was used for data partitioning for categorical variables data points are randomly selected from within classes of the response variable for numeric variables data points are randomly selected from within quantiles of the response variable kuhn 2008 consequently training and testing data sets were very similar table 3 median and mean ph were 6 38 and 6 41 respectively for both training and holdout data the standard deviation was 1 32 for the training data and 1 33 for the holdout data dissolved oxygen concentrations were split 33 67 43 57 and 49 51 by the modeled thresholds of 0 5 1 and 2 mg l for both training and holdout data table 3 model performance was evaluated for 980 possible combinations of the four brt tuning parameters through 10 fold cross validation model performance for each combination of tuning parameters was summarized from 10 training and holdout resamples of the training data kuhn 2008 kuhn and johnson 2013 the measure of model performance in cross validation tuning was the root mean square error rmse for regression models and accuracy for classification models for the classification models the best fit models identified with the maximum accuracy in cross validation tuning also were found to have the maximum two models or second highest one model kappa values kappa is an alternative metric that can be a better measure of performance for unbalanced data sets e g data sets with substantially unequal class membership kuhn and johnson 2013 the ranges of tuning parameters tested were n trees 500 5000 varying by 500 interaction depth 2 14 by 2 shrinkage 0 002 0 014 by 0 002 and min obsinnode 8 10 by 2 bag fraction the proportion of the training data selected without replacement for the development of each tree was set at the default value of 0 5 a probability threshold of 0 5 was used to distinguish positive from negative outcomes in the dissolved oxygen models for the purposes of calculating model fit statistics the same 104 predictor variables were used for the initial tuning of all four models to simplify model parameters models with cross validation rmse or accuracy within one standard error 1se of that of the best fit model were identified using the onese function of the caret package breiman et al 1984 kuhn 2008 kuhn and johnson 2013 these models were ranked by complexity where simpler models were considered those of lower interaction depth fewer observations in terminal nodes lower shrinkage and fewer trees tuning parameters were selected corresponding to those of the simplest model among the 1se models the brt model using these parameters was refit to the full data set of all training observations and the 104 predictor variables to yield a simpler model than the best fit model the models were further simplified using the recursive feature elimination rfe method in caret kuhn 2019 to identify variables that had negligible effect on model performance the rfe method removes variables one at a time in reverse order of their predictor variable importance and determines the model performance with the remaining variables model performance was measured by rmse for ph and by the area under the roc receiver operating characteristic curve auc for dissolved oxygen variable influence was calculated by the gbm r package as the contribution of each variable in reducing the loss function friedman 2001 ridgeway 2019 resampling was incorporated with 10 fold cross validation plots of rmse or auc versus variable number were inspected for the ph model the final set of predictors were chosen as those yielding the lowest rmse value for the dissolved oxygen models the highest auc values were associated with sets of about 70 or more variables but in fact auc appeared essentially unchanging in plots for data sets of more than about 50 variables thus final variable data sets were selected for the dissolved oxygen models as those near the point on plots where auc started to consistently decrease upon removal of additional variables variable influence was calculated using the gbm r package and is based on the frequency with which a predictor is used in tree splits and from the resulting improvement in model predictions elith et al 2008 ridgeway 2019 3 4 prediction mapping and uncertainty ph and redox conditions were mapped across the study area by applying the final models to predictor variables evaluated at cells of a 1 km2 grid for each of the 10 regional aquifers for redox conditions the maps represent the probability of anoxic conditions as represented by one of three thresholds of dissolved oxygen concentration 0 5 1 and 2 mg l maps based on one threshold concentration 1 mg l were selected for presentation maps of the remaining thresholds are provided as supplementary material each aquifer was represented by a single depth that corresponded to the vertical midpoint of the aquifer for the surficial aquifer the prediction elevation was the vertical midpoint between the simulated water table masterson et al 2016b and the elevation of the next highest underlying hydrogeologic unit an aquifer or confining unit the prediction elevation was incorporated into the model by setting it equal to the screen bottom elevation variable and by calculating the corresponding value for the well depth variable other variables that varied by regional aquifer such as thickness of the overlying confining units and groundwater flux variables also were set equal to the values for each aquifer thus the 10 aquifer predictions represented sloping surfaces that mimicked the sloping geometry of each aquifer and reflected the water quality of a well installed and open to the aquifer down to the elevation of these surfaces a sensitivity analysis for this approach was performed by making additional predictions at each grid point at vertical locations 25 and 75 of the aquifer thickness from the top of each aquifer or top of the saturated zone for the surficial aquifer the uncertainty of predicted values was estimated using the bootstrapping method of ransom et al 2017 to calculate prediction intervals for the ph model predictions and confidence intervals for the dissolved oxygen model predicted probabilities the training data were resampled with replacement to create 199 bootstrap samples and models were fit to each sample of the training data using the tuning parameters of the final model used for prediction because these 199 models were each developed on a different sample of the training data set they differed in terms of the actual model parameters e g the tree splitting variables and levels and thus yielded a set of 199 different predictions for each grid point ransom et al 2017 to include the additional source of error associated with model fit and thereby calculate prediction intervals for ph a randomly selected value from the training data residuals was subtracted from each bootstrap prediction for the dissolved oxygen model predictions confidence intervals rather than prediction intervals were calculated because confidence intervals are more informative for logistic models having a binary response variable ransom et al 2017 the relative prediction intervals ph model or confidence intervals dissolved oxygen models were calculated at the 90 level from the quantiles of the bootstrap predictions for each prediction grid point ransom et al 2017 schwartz et al 2006 maps of predicted values and prediction or confidence intervals show only the land areas of the aquifers all 10 of the regional aquifers extend beneath the incised coastal embayments and offshore onto the continental shelf masterson et al 2013 although many of the predictor variables were available no water quality data were available to train the model in these areas thus summary statistics for predictions as reported here are only for land extents of aquifers however predictions were made for the entire areal extents of the aquifers and are included in the accompanying data release desimone and pope 2020 the map figures also show only 9 of the 10 regional aquifers omitting the matawan aquifer the matawan aquifer underlies and is similar to the monmouth mt laurel aquifer it is the least important in terms of water use masterson et al 2016a pope et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance and evaluation the final brt model for ph used 28 predictors and the final brt models for dissolved oxygen used 47 53 predictors thus of the 104 predictors used in the model tuning step about three fourths were eliminated for the ph model and about half were eliminated for the dissolved oxygen models metaparameters ranged from 1000 to 4500 for n trees 4 8 for interaction depth and 0 002 to 0 012 for shrinkage min obsinnode was 10 for all 4 models these metaparameters are consistent with the approach of using low learning rates shrinkage and large numbers of trees to avoid overfitting and to reduce model instability friedman 2001 elith et al 2008 ridgeway 2019 metaparameters and fit statistics for the final brt models are given in table 4 measures of performance for the ph model include rmse ph units a measure of the average error and r2 a measure of correlation between predicted and observed values plotted in the supplementary information the rmse and r2 for the final ph model when fit to the entire training data set were 0 475 and 0 871 respectively a better evaluation of model performance is the fit to the holdout data because the holdout data were not used to train or simplify the model the final model rmse of 0 622 and r2 of 0 783 for the holdout data indicated more error than for the training data as expected from applying the model to new data but still demonstrated a good model fit the overall percent bias was low 0 001 for training data and 0 703 for holdout data but the model tended to overpredict low ph values 4 and underpredict high ph values 8 this can be a characteristic of tree based models because of values in the terminal nodes of the trees are averaged to make predictions kuhn and johnson 2013 the rmse for the training data increased and r2 decreased as the model was simplified from the best fit values 0 384 and 0 917 respectively to the values for the 1se model with simpler metaparameters 0 449 to 0 886 to the values for the final model as expected because the simpler models are less closely tied to the training data the rmse and r2 for the holdout data however were very similar for all three stages of model development 0 796 0 788 and 0 783 for rmse and 0 605 0 616 and 0 622 for best fit 1se and final models respectively thus the simplification process did not appear to compromise the ph model s ability to predict to new data the three dissolved oxygen models predict the probability of anoxic conditions specifically the probability of concentrations below each model s threshold concentration measures of performance for these models are based on the frequency of correct assignment to the classes of below event or above non event the threshold concentration a cutoff of 0 5 probability is used to make the assignment accuracy the overall percent of correct classifications for events or non events for the three final models ranged from 0 877 to 0 903 for the training data and from 0 804 to 0 837 for the holdout data accuracy can be misleadingly high for unbalanced data sets because a high accuracy could be generated by chance or by simply classifying most observations into the majority class kuhn and johnson 2013 rosecranz et al 2017b the kappa statistic corrects for this possibility and is an alternative measure of the agreement between predicted and observed classes a value of 0 indicates no agreement and 1 indicates perfect agreement viera and garrett 2005 kuhn and johnson 2013 kappa ranged from 0 716 to 0 800 for training data and from 0 607 to 0 655 for the holdout data table 4 the kappa values for the holdout data are just within a range 0 61 to 0 8 considered to represent substantial agreement viera and garrett 2005 accuracy for the training data decreased in the progression from the best fit model to the simpler 1se and final models whereas holdout accuracy was nearly unchanged for the 0 5 and 2 mg l threshold models and increased slightly for the 1 mg l threshold model values provided in the supplementary information training data kappa also decreased from best fit to simpler models whereas holdout kappa was nearly unchanged or increased slightly thus like for the ph models model simplification did not alter the predictive capability of the dissolved oxygen models and may have improved it slightly for the 1 mg l threshold model sensitivity the correct classification of anoxic conditions was lower than specificity the correct classification of oxic conditions for both training and holdout data for all three models table 4 the auc fit statistic or the area under the roc curve incorporates both sensitivity and specificity and takes into account all possible cutoffs of probability for class assignment a value of 0 5 essentially reflects agreement due to chance and a value of 1 represents perfect agreement between predicted and observed classes fawcett 2006 auc ranged from 0 931 to 0 967 for training data and from 0 874 to 0 890 for hold out data the auc along with the other fit statistics indicates good agreement between predicted and observed class assignments for the dissolved oxygen models 4 2 mapped ph and redox predictions maps of predicted ph and the predicted probability of anoxic conditions fig 2 show that acidic groundwater and oxic conditions extend throughout the surficial aquifer and occur in unconfined areas of the underlying aquifers alkaline and anoxic groundwater is generally present elsewhere in the confined and distal parts of aquifers three representative aquifers the surficial lower chesapeake and potomac patapsco aquifers are shown in fig 2 maps of all aquifers and dissolved oxygen models are provided in the supplementary information in the surficial aquifer the ph of groundwater in 90 of the aquifer area was predicted to be lower than the recommended range of 6 5 8 5 for drinking water u s environmental protection agency 2017 world health organization 2017 fig 2a one third 33 of the surficial aquifer area was predicted to have very low ph values of less than 5 5 for the surficial aquifer volumetric percentages 87 less than 6 5 and 32 less than 5 5 were similar to areal percentages in the underlying lower chesapeake and potomac patapsco aquifers areas predicted to have ph lower than the recommended range 25 and 7 respectively roughly coincided with the unconfined parts of the aquifers along their northwestern boundaries in new jersey delaware and maryland and for the potomac patapsco aquifer on long island new york volumetric percentages of lower chesapeake and potomac patapsco aquifers with low ph 17 and 2 respectively were smaller than the areal percentages because of the wedge shaped aquifer geometries and greater aquifer thicknesses in distal confined areas as compared to the proximal unconfined areas higher ph values in the confined parts of the underlying aquifers result from geochemical reactions with aquifer materials along flow paths knobel et al 1998 in the potomac patapsco aquifer an area of predicted low ph extends within the confined area of the aquifer in the maryland western shore area this is consistent with observations and is likely related to aquifer lithology coarse grain size quartz rich mineralogy low calcareous material content and the presence of pyrite back and barnes 1965 back 1966 bolton 2000 ator 2008 only small areas of any of the regional aquifers were predicted to have ph higher than the recommended range at values greater than ph 8 5 these 2 3 by area were in the aquia monmouth mt laurel and matawan aquifers which are almost entirely confined table 1 the predicted distributions of redox conditions represented by the probability of dissolved oxygen concentrations less than 1 mg l fig 2b were generally similar to the geographic patterns in predicted ph reflecting the depletion of the oxygen in precipitation recharge along flow paths a threshold of 0 5 is applied to the probability values to categorize values as oxic or anoxic across the surficial aquifer oxic conditions were predicted in two thirds 68 of its areal extent anoxic conditions were predicted in the surficial aquifer in low lying areas of eastern north carolina in the southern delmarva peninsula and along the coast of new jersey in the underlying lower chesapeake and potomac patapsco aquifers oxic conditions were predicted in 23 and 6 respectively of aquifer areas and 18 and 1 5 respectively of the aquifer volumes in most of the other aquifers oxic conditions were predicted in less than 5 of the aquifer areas or volumes all near the aquifers proximal recharge areas more extensive areas of predicted oxic conditions in the upper chesapeake and piney point aquifers in the virginia western shore area may reflect the presence of incised stream channels that provide recharge windows into the underlying otherwise confined aquifers on long island predicted oxic conditions in confined areas of the magothy and potomac patapsco aquifers may be a result of the low data density for the deeper aquifers in this area in general the patterns of predicted ph and redox conditions shown in the model based maps are consistent with the distribution of ph and dissolved oxygen reported in many studies of groundwater quality in the nacp aquifer system based on well data back and barnes 1965 back 1966 chapelle and knobel 1983 knobel et al 1998 ator et al 2005 ator 2008 mcfarland 2010 denver et al 2014 brown et al 2019 the prediction distribution of oxic conditions from the brt models also was comparable to predictions made with a parsimonious logistic regression model for parts of the study area in delaware maryland and virginia tesoriero et al 2015 the model based maps provide the added benefit of supporting robust estimates of the proportions of aquifers either areal or volumetric likely to contain groundwater of a specified quality aquifer proportions are valuable tools for regional water quality assessments belitz et al 2010 and when map based are enhanced by information about the geographic locations where specific conditions occur ph and redox conditions together control the solubility and mobility of some common groundwater quality constituents and drinking water contaminants as evidenced by the use of eh ph diagrams to describe the stability fields of trace metals in natural waters langmuir 1997 model results of predicted ph and the probability of anoxic conditions can be combined to map these joint conditions as an example the predicted occurrence of oxic anoxic acidic circumneutral and alkaline conditions is shown in fig 3 based on the 2 mg l dissolved oxygen model and ph categories of 6 5 6 5 8 and 8 such maps could be produced as needed from model results for conditions that are specifically appropriate for contaminants of interest the condition of dissolved oxygen 2 mg l and ph 6 5 the acidic and oxic category of fig 3 has been associated with elevated concentrations of lead in groundwater sources of drinking water in the atlantic and gulf coastal plain aquifers which include aquifers from the study area brown et al 2019 areas of the regional aquifers with acidic and oxic conditions as defined by these threshold values were predicted to occur in 52 of the surficial aquifer and 0 1 14 of underlying aquifers fig 3 proportions by volume were 57 for the surficial aquifer and 0 1 11 for the underlying aquifers applications such as these of the modeling results could be used to target aquifer areas for enhanced monitoring and risk assessment to specific contaminants of concern 4 3 examination of predictors five predictor variables the 10th percentile of simulated groundwater residence time age 10th perc aqlay the thickness of overlying confining units thkovr aqlay cu the elevation of the bottom of the well screen screen bot elev ft total simulated groundwater flux under predevelopment conditions flxt aqlay pre and the multi order hydrologic position variable dsd9 were among the top 10 most influential predictors in all four models and included the top two or three predictors in each model fig 4 a complete listing of variable importance and maps of selected influential predictor variables are provided in supplementary material together the combined influence of these five variables accounted for about 50 of the relative influence of all variables in the ph model and 32 44 of the relative influence of all variables in the dissolved oxygen models four of the variables excluding dsd9 are closely and conceptually related to position along groundwater flow paths thus their role as top predictors suggests that the models are capturing the important process based patterns that are understood from previous studies to control the distribution of ph and dissolved oxygen in the nacp aquifer system partial dependence plots pdps show that the relation between these top five predictors and the response variable is similar in all four models pdps depict the average change in the model response when all variables except the variable of interest are held at their observed values greenwell 2017 predicted ph and the predicted

aquifer system fig 5 see the supplementary information for plots for all models and for additional variables predicted values decrease with increasing simulated groundwater flux flxt aqlay pre this relation reflects the lower ph and high dissolved oxygen concentrations in the surficial aquifer through which most of the groundwater flux in the aquifer system occurs and in those parts of lower aquifers that are hydraulically connected to the surficial flow system dsd9 is a hydrologic position variable belitz et al 2019 based on the surface drainage network of 9th order streams in the study area dsd9 quantifies the distance from the upland boundary to the coast as modulated by the locations of large estuarine bays it is positively related to predicted ph and to the probability of reduced oxygen conditions this suggests that like the other four top predictors dsd9 is capturing regional scale information about position in the groundwater flow system it may be acting as a measure of distance along deep groundwater flow paths which are directed towards the large incised estuaries as well as towards the coastline masterson et al 2016b other highly influential variables in the ph model include the long term average ph of precipitation ph 30yr 85 11 rank 4 a state based locational variable state zone rank 5 and aquifer aquifer designation rank 7 the relation of predicted ph with ph 30yr 85 11 in a pdp plot is positive as expected however the range of the ph 30yr 85 11 variable was slight about 0 25 ph units and its role in the model may have been partly due to patterns related to groundwater flow hydrogeology or some other characteristic that is captured by the predominantly north south and east west increasing patterns of ph 30yr 85 11 values across the study area the pdp plot of state zone shows lower predicted ph in new jersey and the western shore of maryland than in other parts of the study area this may reflect the prevalence of highly permeable and deeply weathered quartzose sediments and for maryland the other lithologic characteristics previously described in those areas that have little capacity to alter low ph precipitation ator et al 2005 differences among categories of the aquifer designation variable showed lower ph in the surficial upper chesapeake and lower chesapeake aquifers which are unconfined or have relatively large unconfined areas than in other aquifers generally lower ph also was shown in the magothy potomac patapsco and potomac patuxent aquifers which may be due to the unconfined areas of the magothy aquifer on long island and the predominantly fluvial deltaic origin of the potomac patapsco and potomac patuxent aquifers in contrast to the marine origin of the overlying aquifers table 1 in the dissolved oxygen models two soil variables surg hy mean and surg hgd mean a variable designating confinement confined aqlay distance from the fall zone dist fallz ft and a hydrology based climate variable rech reitz et mean were among the top 10 highly influential predictors the surg hy mean rank 6 7 and 9 variable represents hydric soils or soils that are periodically saturated and anerobic and the surg hgd mean variable rank 8 16 and 19 represents soils of hydrologic group d which are soils with a very slow infiltration rate such as clay rich soils or soils with a shallow water table national resources conservation service 2009 wieczorek 2014 these soil types are more widespread along the coastline of new jersey in the southern delmarva peninsula and hydric soils only in the low lying areas of eastern north carolina where anoxic conditions were predicted in the surficial aquifer fig 2b the predicted probability of reduced oxygen conditions in all three models was positively related to the presence of these soil types this association could be due to reduced dissolved oxygen in recharge from reaction with soil organic matter or could be related to aquifer sediment organic matter content of which soil type is an indicator feinstein and thomas 2009 the predicted probability of reduced oxygen conditions also increased with dist fallz ft rank 5 7 and 11 dist fallz ft is a broad measure of distance along groundwater flow paths but also may characterize the location of the lowlands of coastal north carolina because the aquifer is wide and distance from the fall zone is relatively large near the coast in this area the relations of predicted probability with rech reitz et mean rank 5 8 and 21 which is annual evapotranspiration rate estimated nationally from streamflow were complex and not monotonic the relatively large number of predictors in the dissolved oxygen models 47 53 and to a lesser extent the 28 variables in the ph models include multiple variables that are related correlations between variables are acceptable in brt models but can make it difficult to see general patterns in variable influence because the influence of some factors may be split among multiple variables we combined groups of variables to make a general comparison of variable influence within and among the models fig 6 group names are defined in table 2 recognizing that it was not possible to define completely independent groups in terms of the factors being represented and that the groups are unequal in variable numbers this comparison suggests several qualitative generalities about the models variables representing position in the three dimensional flow system appeared generally more important than variables describing surface characteristics an exception is that soil variables were important for dissolved oxygen with the individual soil variables of high influence suggesting that the drainage capacity of soils is important precipitation chemistry variables were important for ph but not nearly as important as groundwater age which was by far the most influential group of variables for the ph model the lower influence of groundwater age variables in the dissolved oxygen models is perhaps surprising but it may be explained by the disparities between the time scales and flow path distances over which dissolved oxygen is depleted in nacp groundwater as compared to the large range of simulated ages of groundwater whereas ph continues to increase over long flow paths dissolved oxygen is depleted more rapidly and concentrations are relatively unchanging as groundwater age and distance along flow paths continue to increase such a pattern was observed in the aquia aquifer by chapelle and knobel 1983 the reduced role of groundwater age in the dissolved oxygen models as compared to the ph model may also reflect the finer spatial scale of controls such as soil characteristics on dissolved oxygen concentrations where it is still present 4 4 uncertainty and limitations the uncertainty of model and mapping results was investigated by estimating 90 prediction or confidence intervals for predicted values at prediction grid points using a bootstrap approach fig 7 histograms of intervals and maps for all aquifers are provided in the supplementary information prediction intervals which include the error associated with model fit to specific prediction points as well as average error associated with the model were determined for predicted ph confidence intervals which are more informative for a binary response value were determined for the predicted probabilities of dissolved oxygen concentrations less than threshold values for ph in all aquifers the mean width of the prediction interval was 1 72 ph units the median was 1 70 and the interquartile range iqr was 0 23 prediction intervals for ph were widest in the three shallowest aquifers the surficial aquifer upper chesapeake and lower chesapeake aquifers mean width 1 74 1 79 but overall there was little difference among aquifers with the mean prediction interval width of individual aquifers ranging from 1 68 to 1 79 the mean and median confidence intervals for the predicted probability of dissolved oxygen less than threshold values were 0 22 and 0 19 for the 0 5 mg l model 0 16 and 0 11 for the 1 mg l model and 0 16 and 0 11 for the 2 mg l model as for the ph model the dissolved oxygen model confidence intervals were generally wider for the three shallowest aquifers than the other aquifers the apparent greater uncertainty of the predicted values in the surficial aquifer than in the underlying aquifers may be due to the greater variability in ph and dissolved oxygen concentrations and the greater heterogeneity of conditions that influence these parameters in the surficial aquifer geographically prediction and confidence intervals were widest in north carolina where data were sparse and for dissolved oxygen especially in the unconfined parts of aquifers where concentrations are more frequently greater than thresholds the heterogeneity of influential conditions conditions not captured by predictors included in the model and data sparsity in some geographic areas suggest that model results would be best used to depict regional patterns rather than to predict ph and redox conditions at specific site locations a limitation of the approach taken in this study is that a single prediction is made for each aquifer layer at the midpoint of its thickness whereas the aquifer layers except for the surficial aquifer can be hundreds of meters thick or more the sensitivity of predicted values to the vertical location of the prediction was investigated by making predictions at two additional vertical locations that bracketed the midpoint positioned at 25 and 75 of the aquifer thickness as measured from the top of each aquifer from top of the saturated zone for the surficial aquifer this was implemented by changing the two predictor variables that captured vertical location well depth well depth and elevation of the bottom of the well screen screen bot elev ft the results of this sensitivity test were evaluated in terms of the differences between the predicted values at the midpoint and at the two additional locations for each point in the 1 km2 grid in general the differences were surprisingly small the mean absolute difference at the 25 and 75 depths from the midpoint prediction were 0 04 and 0 03 ph units respectively and the mean absolute differences for the predicted probability of reduced oxygen concentrations for the 3 models at the 25 and 75 depths were 0 007 0 012 and 0 006 0 088 respectively histograms of differences are provided in the supplementary information thus although vertical location as represented by the screen bot elev ft and well depth variables were highly influential predictors in the models their range at individual prediction points was not large enough to substantially change model predictions overall geographically the areas of greatest difference were in the unconfined parts of underlying units along the fall zone although this was not the location of greatest aquifer thickness for any of the aquifer layers it may be that vertical location was more important in these areas because they were areas of rapid change in groundwater chemistry after recharge it could also be that the density of data in the area better defined vertical variations in ph and dissolved oxygen than in the deeper and more distal parts of aquifers the effect of vertical location could be further investigated by changing other predictors that would be expected to vary in the vertical dimension within aquifers such as simulated groundwater flux and simulated groundwater residence time these were not varied in this sensitivity test because they were based on the groundwater flow model which assigned one value to the entire thickness of each aquifer at each geographic location 5 conclusions in this study we applied machine learning methods to model and map groundwater ph and redox conditions in the northern atlantic coastal plain a layered aquifer system along the eastern coast of the usa the predicted distributions of ph and anoxic or oxic groundwater as represented by dissolved oxygen concentrations below three threshold values agreed well with the documented patterns that result from the geochemical evolution of groundwater along flow paths the model based maps can be used to estimate the areal or volumetric proportions of aquifers likely to contain groundwater of a specified quality in this way they provide tools for regional water quality assessments and identify geographic areas with specific ph or redox conditions the models could be improved by increased data density in the southern part of the study area where water quality data were sparse or by further investigation of vertical variation of both predictors and response variables in thick aquifers examination of the predictor variables showed that the most influential for both ph and dissolved oxygen models included those characterizing position within the three dimensional aquifer system with respect to travel time confinement and depth and distance from groundwater recharge areas surface characteristics also were among the most influential especially for the dissolved oxygen models and specifically variables describing soil drainage thus although the models are not process based they are to some extent interpretable and consistent with prior understanding of the important processes controlling ph and redox conditions in the nacp aquifer system it is not possible to be certain that the influence of variables is due to process based causal type relations however because variables may be surrogates for other factors not captured in the predictor data but that are successfully used by the machine learning algorithm to optimize model fit geographic patterns of occurrence and influential predictors in the models of ph and dissolved oxygen are similar in the nacp aquifer system because both ph and redox conditions evolve with groundwater flow the commonality of influential predictor variables and the similarity in the direction of their influence suggests that in future studies it might be possible to model the common occurrence of ph and redox conditions as a multi level categorical response variable such models could be used to target the specific conditions that are associated with contaminants such as trace metals whose mobility and occurrence is controlled by the combination of these conditions in aquifers we expect that the models and maps produced in this study would be most useful for regional scale applications to better understand the distribution of ph and redox sensitive constituents these uses could include vulnerability assessments of drinking water sources to contaminants such as arsenic manganese and lead or applications to quantify the potential groundwater contribution of excess nitrate to coastal waters results of this study demonstrate that the machine learning methods especially

anthropogenic modifications of drainage networks and climate change finding and implementing effective remedies is hard in developed countries due to the presence of several constraints optimal flood management in complex river networks is then a way to reduce flood hazard at a relatively low cost compared to structural measures hence optimal operation rules for floodgates at an existing control

engineering department in charge of flood management and have been implemented in the flood forecasting early warning system of the regional civil protection office new hydrological insights the

bacchiglione river network nearby and through the historical city of padova veneto region italy which comprises several natural and man made channels the area has been subject to severe flooding in the past and in the recent years as well viero et al 2013 zanetti 2013 flood hazard is mainly due to the fact that the maximum conveyance capacity of the major rivers progressively reduces downstream of padova martini et al 2004 furthermore the widespread presence of burrowing animals like the myocastor coypus sofia et al 2017a viero et al 2013 poses severe threats to the reliability of levees in the recent years the situation progressively worsened due to massive urbanization anthropogenic modifications of drainage networks and climate change alfieri et al 2015 2017 blöschl et al 2017 2019 mel et al 2013 miller and hutchins 2017 pijl et al 2018 senatore et al 2011 sofia et al 2014 2017 sofia and tarolli 2017 importantly flood prone areas are densely populated and subject to intense industrial and agricultural activities roder et al 2017 the proper operation of sluice gates at an existing control structure which allows diverting part of the bacchiglione discharge into the brenta river can play a crucial role in balancing the discharge load in the different branches of the brenta bacchiglione river network downstream of padova thus reducing hydraulic hazard in a vast highly exposed area optimization of the river network is achieved through the definition of specific operation rules that are the result of an off line analysis such operation rules are static in the sense that their real time application i e in the course of a flood event is only based on the knowledge of simultaneous flow variables at different locations within the river network and does not require any model based evaluation to achieve optimal flood control the chance of pursuing such a simplified design is justified given the specific configuration of the problem at hand indeed the control structure subject to optimization is located in the terminal part of the river course where the duration of flood waves is relatively long and effects associated to flow unsteadiness are negligible furthermore static rules are easier to understand and put into practice for the non scientific staff in charge of managing the control structures in the river network the definition of optimal operation rules has been pursued in accordance and cooperation with the civil engineering department in charge of flood management in the brenta bacchiglione river network indeed end users engagement is important for the effective adoption of modelling analysis outcomes horne et al 2016 furthermore these rules were implemented using available features of the 2def two dimensional hydrodynamic model in the image early warning system that is operational at the civil protection office in charge of flood forecasting thus providing flood predictions that are coherent with the flood management actually performed 2 material and methods 2 1 the brenta bacchiglione river network nearby the city of padova the city of padova is surrounded by two major rivers named brenta and bacchiglione and by a set of channels interconnected by a variety of control structures fig 1 the brenta river with a basin of about 1600 km2 can convey more than 2500 m3 s at the outlet of its mountain basin at bassano del grappa about 60 km north of padova in the stretch between bassano del grappa and padova the brenta river is wide and somewhere braided close to padova the brenta river becomes narrower as it is confined within relatively high artificial levees north of the city centre it receives water from the muson dei sassi river basin of about 300 km2 flow rates up to 100 m3 s and then it flows south east reaching the adriatic sea near brondolo south of the venice lagoon downstream of padova the maximum discharge the brenta river can convey reduces to about 1500 m3 s martini et al 2004 the bacchiglione river with a basin of more than 1300 km2 located in the pre alps north of the city of vicenza mazzoleni et al 2017 viero 2018 can convey a water discharge of up to 800 m3 s at the south east edge of the city of padova before reaching padova the bacchiglione river receives the flow form the brentella canal dug in the 1314 and now used to divert part of the brenta discharge into the bacchiglione river during the dry season at padova the bacchiglione is divided into three courses battaglia canal dug in 1200 a d for drainage and navigation purposes that flows south towards the euganean hills tronco maestro channel the early course of the bacchiglione river that flows north and enters the historical centre of the city and changes its name in piovego canal when it enters the city scaricatore canal dug in the late 1800 as flood channel that flows east towards the voltabarozzo control structure where in turn it is divided in the roncajette river actually the bacchiglione main course downstream of padova and in the artificial s gregorio canal the s gregorio canal flows into the piovego canal and then in the brenta river downstream of padova the roncajette river flows south east collects the drainage waters of the cagnola channel and finally merges with the brenta river about 6 km upstream of the mouth in the adriatic sea some historical notes until less than two centuries ago the bacchiglione river was still passing through the historic centre of padova following a winding and relatively narrow path tronco maestro in fig 1 downstream of padova it was flowing south east with the name of roncajette river unfortunately the city was subject to frequent floods in order to fix this issue in 1830 the austrian government decided to build the 4 km long scaricatore canal to keep the bacchiglione floodwaters outside the city of padova the scaricatore canal is actually an artificial cutoff aimed at conveying the bacchiglione discharge to the roncajette river directly fig 1 due to an incorrect design this canal was unable to convey the maximum flow rates of the bacchiglione river during the disastrous flood occurred in 1882 therefore in the 1930s according to the design of luigi gasparini the scaricatore canal was enlarged and from the voltabarozzo control structure green square in fig 1 see also fig 2 the new s gregorio canal was dug with the aim of diverting part of the bacchiglione floodwaters towards the last segment of the piovego canal and then to the brenta river in this way hydraulic hazard was mitigated in both the city centre of padova and downstream along the course of the roncajette river consider that in times of low flow water levels are kept constant at 12 0 m above the sea level asl for the bacchiglione upstream of the voltabarozzo control structure and at 8 3 m asl for the brenta river upstream of the strà control structure red square n 9 in fig 1 through a proper operation of the sluice gates at the two control structures current network operation during flood events in the course of flood events the secondary channels are disconnected from the primary network i e the brenta and bacchiglione rivers in particular with reference to fig 1 gates are closed at the inlet of the brentella canal 1 of the battaglia canal 2 and of the tronco maestro channel 3 in addition gates are closed at the outlet of the piovego channel just upstream of the s gregorio confluence 4 and at the confluence of the old branch of the bacchiglione within the roncajette river at ca nordio 5 the s gregorio and piovego canals thus perform as a unique flood canal hereinafter denoted as sgp canal the drainage of the city centre of padova is guaranteed by the secondary channel network that through the s massimo gates 6 conveys drainage waters south east through the inverted siphon 7 under the s gregorio canal towards the pumping station of ca nordio 5 which allows pumping a flow rate of up to 40 m3 s into the roncajette river the tainter gates on the piovego canal at noventa padovana 8 which normally controls the water level in the whole city centre of padova are completely opened during flood events to facilitate discharging water from bacchiglione to brenta similarly the sluice gates on the brenta river at strà 9 which normally controls the water level in the downstream segment of the piovego canal for navigation purposes are completely open to limit backwater effects along the upstream brenta river and above all in the piovego canal whose levees are relatively low the voltabarozzo control structure the voltabarozzo control structure denoted hereinafter as vcs is a crucial element for flood management nearby and downstream of padova indeed it allows controlling the fraction of the bacchiglione flow rate to be diverted through the s gregorio piovego sgp canal toward the brenta river thus increasing the maximum conveyance of the bacchiglione close to padova and balancing the discharge load in the brenta and bacchiglione rivers downstream of padova the vcs is made up of two distinct multi gate facilities fig 2 the regolatore is used to control the water level just upstream of the structure and the flow rate in the roncajette river it is equipped with four 7 20 m wide sluice gates that can be opened up to 6 75 m above the bottom level located at 5 70 m asl the scaricatore is used to divert part of the bacchiglione flow rate into the sgp canal toward the brenta river it is equipped with two 7 20 m wide sluice gates that can be opened up to 7 0 m above the same bottom level of 5 70 m asl the management of the six gates of the the vcs is actually manual and is accomplished depending on the water levels measured just upstream and downstream of the control structure and those of the brenta river at strà 2 2 the 2def hydrodynamic model in the present study the simulation of flood events in the complex river and channel network described above is accomplished using the 2def hydrodynamic model defina 2000 2003 viero et al 2013 the model solves the full two dimensional 2d shallow water equations swes on unstructured triangular meshes the 2def model enforces a statistical subgrid approach for bottom elevations defina et al 1994 defina 2000 which allows for a physically based accurate and stable treatment of wetting and drying processes on very irregular topographies d alpaos and defina 2007 the swes are solved using a semi implicit staggered finite element method based on a mixed eulerian lagrangian approach defina 2003 the depth integrated horizontal dispersion stresses are evaluated using the boussinesq approximation stansby 2003 and the eddy viscosity is computed according to uittenbogaard and van vossen 2004 the 2def model has been improved in the years to simulate levee breaches viero et al 2013 to account for interactions between free surface flow and saturated flow in the topsoil layer viero et al 2014 transport of pollutants and evaluation of transport time scales viero and defina 2016 anisotropy in bottom resistance due to oriented roughness viero and valipour 2017 and anisotropic effects due to buildings and obstacles in urban areas ferrari and viero 2020 viero 2019 the model also allows coupling 2d elements with 1d channels the latter being used to model the flow in regular 1d river reaches and within the minor channel network a set of specific 1d links allows modelling possible overtopping of levees the presence of sills and the operations of hydraulic facilities and devices such as gated flow controls and pump stations d alpaos and defina 2007 martini et al 2004 viero et al 2013 viero and defina 2017 2019 2 3 model set up for the brenta bacchiglione river network a computational mesh was set up to describe the study area fig 3 the model includes the tesina river from bolzano vicentino the retrone river from s agostino the bacchiglione river from viale diaz north of the city center of vicenza the brenta river from barzizza north of the historical town of bassano del grappa and the muson dei sassi river from castelfranco veneto all these watercourses can be seen as tributaries of brenta river which flows into the adriatic sea near brondolo south of the venice lagoon fig 3 the model includes some external flood prone areas such as the city of vicenza along the bacchiglione river and some floodplains along the brenta river north of padova the mesh geometry and topography were set up using aerial images and data from lidar and multi beam surveys technical maps and cross sections www pcn minambiente it mattm and https idt2 regione veneto it we paid particular attention to pick the correct elevations of levees and to include in the model the different hydraulic structures properly the domain is discretized with about 30000 2d triangular elements and 24000 nodes 2600 1d channel elements and 5300 1d links 1d channel elements are used to model straight river reaches with simple i e not compound sections and to account for the presence of small channels dissecting the urban and rural areas which play an important role on the propagation of flood waves over initially dry areas most of the 1d links are used to model levees and embankments that in case of overflowing are expected to force sub to super critical transition i e critical condition other 1d links are deputed to model sluice gates and pump stations the model was calibrated and tested by simulating the most severe flood events occurred in the years 2009 2014 for a total of 5 flood events as boundary conditions we prescribed hourly flow rates recorded at the upstream cross sections at bolzano vicentino viale diaz s agostino barzizza and castelfranco veneto and water levels of the adriatic sea measured close to brondolo mel and lionello 2016 measured data were provided by the regional agency for environmental protection of the veneto region arpav which maintains a network of several gauging stations for water levels and flow rates within the basin flow rates discharged within the main rivers by the pumping stations of the external drainage network were provided by the land reclamation authority brenta bacchiglione sea levels were provided by centro previsioni e segnalazioni maree of the venice municipality in simulating past flood events for model calibration and testing we force the model to reproduce the actual discharge partitioning performed at the vcs according to the gate operations performed and recorded by the civil engineering department in charge of the gate management the model is calibrated by trial and errors to obtain a suitable set of roughness coefficients for the different river reaches and zones i e riverbeds banks floodplains etc for a total of 40 model parameters the accuracy of the model was then checked by comparing the model results with time series of water levels measured at eight gauging stations located along the course of the brenta and bacchiglione rivers and against point measurements of discharge performed by arpav using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp in the course of most of the considered flood events adcp measurements were carried out at downstream sections of the rivers where flow velocity is within the operating range of the instrument model errors in terms of water levels at the flood peak are generally lower than 20 cm at all the gauging stations the maximum relative error in terms of discharges is 8 we took great care to maximize the model robustness and accuracy as well as to optimize the mesh to reduce simulation times as the 2def model impementation described herein is the hydrodynamic core of the image flood forecasting and early warning system operational at the centro

mountain basins of the bacchiglione and the brenta rivers the spatial and temporal dynamics of meteorological forcing including precipitation fields is evaluated using spatial geostatistical interpolation via kriging techniques of observed data series the rainfall fraction actually involved in the generation of flood waves is based on suitable water balance equations benettin et al 2013 the river basins are divided into sub catchments for which vegetated and urban impervious fractions are evaluated from remote sensing data and simulated separately in the vegetated fraction infiltration to the root zone is split into evapotranspiration subsurface flow and groundwater recharge in the urban areas all the incoming rainfall is assumed to produce runoff but an initial fraction of the total runoff is diverted to water treatment plants for every reach and at the outlet of the basins the hydrologic response is computed using the convolution between the spatial and temporal distribution of the effective rainfall and the geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph rinaldo and rodriguez iturbe 1996 rinaldo et al 2006 which depends on the distributions of the residence times in the different flow paths of the basin the calibration parameters of the hydrological model can be subdivided into three categories i parameters related to soil properties and runoff production ii dynamical parameters related to transport processes within hillslopes and channels and iii vegetation parameters that define evapotranspiration rates and long term soil atmosphere interactions the calibration set of model parameters is computed using a markov chain monte carlo approach vrugt et al 2009 to obtain the best fit between modelled and measured discharge time series at the basin outlets and at inner gauged sections as well for example the model for the bacchiglione basin at viale diaz fig 3 has been calibrated from september 2010 to december 2015 for the entire calibration period the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is up to 0 96 and the root mean square error rmse is 5 2 m3 s nse 0 95 and rmse 8 3 m3 s for flow rates greater than 20 m3 s 12 probability of exceedance nse 0 78 and rmse 23 1 for flow rates greater than 100 m3 s 1 probability of exceedance passadore et al 2018 the discharge hydrographs predicted by the hydrological model are then provided as inflow boundary conditions to the 2def hydrodynamic model that simulates the propagation of flood waves in the river network and in case of overflowing the flooding of adjacent areas 3 definition of optimal operation rules for the voltabarozzo control structure 3 1 premises it has first to be noted that the discharge along the sgp canal q sgp depends on the opening of the scaricatore gates on the upstream water level and on the flow rate in the brenta river at strà that determines the downstream water level for the sgp canal furthermore the levees of the piovego canal are relatively low and in case of high downstream levels q sgp must be further limited to avoid overflowing and possible levee failures along the downstream reach of the piovego canal as a first step the hydrodynamic model has been used to evaluate the importance of unsteady effects on the propagation of flood waves within the considered channel networks it is known in fact that accounting for hydraulic interactions in complex river systems remains an open challenge for systemic flood risk management in particular when flow unsteadiness plays a crucial role ciullo et al 2019 di baldassarre et al 2009 fortunately the typical duration of flood wave along the brenta and bacchiglione rivers at padova is long compared to the transit time in the downstream branches this makes unsteady effects negligible in the management of the vcs then the hydrodynamic model has been used to compute under steady flow conditions the maximum flow rate that the sgp can discharge into the brenta river i e with the scaricatore gates completely open and avoiding levee overflowing as a function of the water level upstream of the vcs and of the flow rates in the brenta river upstream of the piovego confluence q bre ups fig 4 on the one hand the discharge divertable through the sgp canal q sgp can be increased by increasing the water level upstream of the vcs h ups which entails on the other hand reducing the levee freeboard along the scaricatore canal in addition due to backwater effects the maximum divertable discharge reduces for increasing q bre ups thanks to the joint operation of the regolatore and the scaricatore facilities water levels upstream of the vcs can be modified to some extent and compatibly with levee elevations also for fixed flow rate values this gives additional flexibility to the entire control system if compared with the case of lateral floodgates only with this in mind the goal is to define a set of optimal operation rules for the vcs to minimize the flood risk for both the city of padova and the downstream flood prone areas 3 2 minimization of flood risk we started by observing that the flood risk in the whole system is minimum when it is equally distributed in the different branches of the channel network and in the adjacent areas by analysing the maximum discharge capacity in the different reaches of the channel network using the 2def hydrodynamic model and according to the civil engineering department in charge of flood management five risk classes have been defined fig 5 each risk class corresponds to a specific range of four variables 1 the flow rate in the roncajette river q ron to account for the flood hazard in the roncajette river and on the adjacent areas 2 the flow rate in the brenta river downstream of the piovego confluence q bre dwns q bre ups q sgp to account for flood hazard in its lower reach and on the adjacent areas 3 the water level upstream of the vcs h ups to account for flood hazard along the scaricatore canal and on the adjacent areas 4 the minimum levee freeboard along the sgp canal to account for flood hazard along the canal and on the adjacent areas note that for the sgp canal the levee freeboard is used in place of the flow rate as here the relationship between level and discharge is not a one to one function due to the variable downstream water level that depends on the brenta flow rate based on how the classes have been determined it can be assumed that for a given risk class flood risk is reasonably equivalent in all the parts of the system indeed the definition of such risk classes is made by accounting for the risk of overflowing in the different branches of the principal channel network and also for exposure and vulnerability in the adjacent areas given the scope of the present study exposure vulnerability and in turn hydraulic risk in areas adjacent to the river network were not evaluated according to a rigorous quantitative procedure besides the results provided by the hydrodynamic models in terms of levee freeboard we relied on qualitative expert based evaluations i e technicians of the civil engineering department to account for the quantity and quality of exposed assets their vulnerability and the probability of levee failures we believe that expert based considerations are appropriate for the specific case study because levee failures driven by piping cannot be predicted deterministically d oria et al 2019 mazzoleni et al 2014 michelazzo et al 2018 and the presence of animal burrows is becoming increasingly important orlandini et al 2015 palladino et al 2020 viero et al 2013 it is also known that economic implications of flood risk go beyond the direct damages that are typically considered and a thorough quantitative assessment is still an open challenge koks 2018 koks et al 2019 norén et al 2016 3 3 determining optimal operation rules the optimization of the system to achieve minimum flood risk consists in managing the sluice gates so as to remain within the lowest possible risk class to this purpose we designed a specific algorithm that at a given time step determines the opening of the six gates of the vcs to minimize flood risk based on water levels and discharges at specific locations within the river network which can be identified as known variables at each time step the known variables are the discharges flowing in the bacchiglione river q bac and in the brenta river upstream of the piovego confluence q bre ups whereas the discharges in the roncajette river and in the sgp canal q ron and q sgp respectively the water level upstream of the vcs h ups and the minimum levee freeboard along the sgp canal are free variables that depend on the gate operations mass conservation at confluences entails q bac q ron q sgp and q bre dwns q bre ups q sgp in the exploratory phase of the study the algorithm is coupled with the 2def hydrodynamic model to test its effectiveness through the simulation of past flood events chosen a time step of one hour for the simulations a sensitivity analysis did not show any advantage associated with using smaller time steps the algorithm determines the gate opening of vcs based on known variables that in this case are computed by the 2def model then it drives the 2def model to simulate flood propagation with the prescribed gate opening until the next time step the use of a calibrated hydrodynamic model assures that the obtained solution in terms of free variables is plausible in designing the operation of the vcs two different relevant cases can be identified 1 for q bac 100 m3 s the scaricatore gates are kept closed according to the previous management of the vcs the regolatore gates are operated to keep the upstream water level h ups equal to 12 m asl 2 for q bac 100 m3 s the scaricatore gates should be partially opened to achieve flood risk minimization in this case the algorithm first attempts to recover the lower risk class in terms of q ron by discharging the excess flow through the sgp canal toward the brenta river while keeping h ups and q bre dwns within the same risk class fig 4 in general within a given risk class the flow rate through the roncajette river q ron is given the maximum value within the class range so as to minimize the upstream water level h ups and the total discharge in the downstream reach of the brenta river q bre dwns the last control concerns the minimum levee freeboard along the sgp canal if a freeboard is out of range the algorithm determines the needed closure of the scaricatore gates if it is not possible to keep the three free variables within the same risk class the algorithm assumes for q ron the value associated to the higher risk class a summary of the operation rules for the gates of the vcs for an increasing discharge of the bacchiglione river is shown in fig 6 as previously described when the algorithm cannot keep all the free variables within the same risk class the flow rate in the roncajette river is increased first an example of vcs management is shown in fig 7 for the rising limb of a typical flood wave in the bacchiglione river blue line as long as the bacchiglione flow rate q bac is lower than the 100 m3 s threshold risk class 1 light blue the upstream water level h ups is 12 00 m asl and the scaricatore gates remain closed q sgp 0 once q bac exceeds the 100 m3 s threshold risk class 2 green the scaricatore gates open to maintain q ron fixed at 100 m3 s and h ups 12 00 m asl q sgp increases accordingly when this is no longer possible because of the increase of q bac q ron is allowed to rise up to 200 m3 s once q ron exceeds 200 m3 s risk class 3 yellow first h ups rises up to 13 00 m asl then q ron increases up to 350 m3 s at this point h ups rises again up to 13 50 m asl and q ron up to 500 m3 s risk class 4 orange finally h ups can increase up to 14 m asl reaching the maximum flow rate divertable through the sgp canal q sgp and the exceeding flow rate is totally discharged into the roncajette river q ron 500 m3 s risk class 5 red the effectiveness of the operation rules has been tested by simulating the whole year 2009 during which some relevant flood events occurred the algorithm succeeded in determining the gate opening along the entire the simulated period such that all the variables of interest fully satisfy the management criteria summarized in figs 5 and 6 figure 8 shows the management of the vcs for the flood event occurred between 28 4 2009 and 1 5 2009 when the flow rates of the brenta and the bacchiglione rivers upstream of the city of padova exceeded 650 m3 s and 350 m3 s respectively interestingly in this case the flow rate diverted through the sgp canal q sgp was limited by the large flow rate of the brenta river q bre dwns 800 m3 s risk class 2 as a consequence it was not possible to increase the water level upstream of voltabarozzo intentionally to further increase q sgp hence during this flood event h ups remained fixed at 12 00 m asl even at the flood peak in the roncajette river 4 implementation of the operation rules in the image ews the final goal of the present study was to implement the optimal operation rules in the image early warning system described in sect 2 4 so as to simulate the management of the vcs correctly in real time flood forecast taking advantage of the static nature of the operation rules for the vcs we used specific 1d links implemented in the 2def hydrodynamic model to reproduce the gate operations described in sect 3 3 directly i e without using any external algorithm specifically in the 2def model we modelled each sluice gate using an available type of 1d link which operates the gate to maintain a prescribed upstream water level i e a target level the two sluice gates of the scaricatore were given a target level of 12 00 m asl so that they remain close for h ups 12 00 and progressively open for h ups 12 00 m asl for the regolatore gates a target level of 11 95 m asl was assigned to the first gate and its width selected so that a discharge of 100 m3 s determines an upstream level of 12 m asl with the gate completely open in this way when the first discharge threshold q ron 100 m3 s is reached h ups 12 00 m asl and the scaricatore gates start to open thus diverting the exceeding discharge to the sgp canal for a further increase of q bac h ups increase as well thus determining the opening of the second regolatore gate whose target level was set to 12 05 m asl and so on obviously the width of each gate of the regolatore facility was modified with respect to the actual width without changing the total width of the four sluice gates the additional controls concerning the minimum levee freeboard along the sgp canal and the maximum discharge within the downstream reach of the brenta river were implemented by connecting in series two fictitious gates downstream of the two scaricatore gates these fictitious gates close progressively when target levels are reached along the sgp canal and the brenta river thus limiting q sgp in order to keep q bre dwns and the minimum freeboard within the range of the associated risk class the model set up implemented within the image ews produces almost the same results as the procedure described in sect 3 3 as shown in fig 7 where dashed lines refer to the simplified image implementation of the operation rules the image implementation have been verified thoroughly by simulating 26 flood events occurred between 2010 and 2014 table 1 in simulating these flood events the image ews was forced using measured rainfall and meteorological data figures from 9 to 12 show the model results for 4 significant flood events characterized by increasing intensity and which cover different sorts of gate operations a detailed description of the specific operations rules applied in each case is reported in the figure captions the procedure implemented in the ews shows two slight deviations with respect to the algorithm described in sect 3 3 the former is described in the caption of fig 10 the latter in the caption of fig 12 yet the difference in terms of discharge partitioning is negligible 5 conclusions this research focuses on optimizing the operation of the hydraulic network of the city of padova and in particular of the voltabarozzo control structure which allows diverting waters from the bacchiglione river to the brenta river the operation rules allow determining the flow rate to be diverted and the water level upstream of the voltabarozzo control structure as a function of simultaneous values of discharge flowing in the bacchiglione and brenta rivers the principle behind flood management is the minimization of hydraulic risk which consists in distributing the risk in the different parts of the hydraulic network equally the goal is achieved by defining five risk classes accounting for hydraulic load at various locations along the reaches and for hydraulic hazard exposure and vulnerability of assets in the adjacent flood prone areas for each risk class a specific range is defined for discharges and minimum levee freeboard in the main branches of the channel network the operation rules have been tested by simulating several recent flood events furthermore they have been implemented in the image early warning system which is operational at the regional office in charge of flood forecasting to provide accurate real time predictions of discharges water levels levee freeboard and possible flooding along the brenta bacchiglione river network and over the adjacent areas the present work was developed in collaboration with the local civil engineering department in charge of flood management so as to take advantage of the direct knowledge of the technicians in charge of flood management as well as to create trust in the result of the work by those who have to put into practice the management rules we highlight that the operation rules described herein refer to the current configuration of the river and channel network in case of improvements of the hydraulic network as for example levee heightening the risk classes should be re defined to account for the modified reduced risk similarly in case of emergency situations or sudden accidents such as a levee collapse e g the levee breach formed in the roncajette river during the november 2010 flood event viero et al 2013 the management of the voltabarozzo control structure should adapt to the particular situation in order to minimize the discharge load in the damaged branch of the network e g yang et al 2020 further applications of the 2def hydrodynamic model with optimal operation of the voltabarozzo control structure should aim at evaluating the effects of additional interventions such as levee rise in the most critical segments of the channel network and the construction of the padova venezia waterway to be used beside navigation to divert part of the brenta river from downstream of strà directly to the venice lagoon martini et al 2004 mel et al 2019 2020 the proposed approach which uses hydrodynamic modelling and expert based knowledge to determine an equal distribution of flood risk in a river network allows minimizing flood risk through optimal operation of existing control structures without significant additional costs the suggested approach can be adapted and applied to different contexts accounting for the peculiarities of each specific river network but keeping the basic principles unchanged finally we remark the importance of collaborating with public institutions and with the technicians in charge of managing the river networks to promote exchange of knowledge and expertise and to maximize the practical

future arnell and gosling 2016 dottori et al 2018 jongman 2018 ward et al 2017 this can be ascribed to different factors as for example climatic change sedimentation anthropogenic modifications of

bacchiglione river network nearby and through the historical city of padova veneto region italy which comprises several natural and man made channels the area has been subject to severe flooding in the past and in the recent years as well viero et al 2013 zanetti 2013 flood hazard is mainly due to the fact that the maximum conveyance capacity of the major rivers progressively reduces downstream of padova martini et al 2004 furthermore the widespread presence of burrowing animals like the myocastor coypus sofia et al 2017a viero et al 2013 poses severe threats to the reliability of levees in the recent years the situation progressively worsened due to massive urbanization anthropogenic modifications of drainage networks and climate change alfieri et al 2015 2017 blöschl et al 2017 2019 mel et al 2013 miller and hutchins 2017 pijl et al 2018 senatore et al 2011 sofia et al 2014 2017 sofia and tarolli 2017 importantly flood prone areas are densely populated and subject to intense industrial and agricultural activities roder et al 2017 the proper operation of sluice gates at an existing control structure which allows diverting part of the bacchiglione discharge into the brenta river can play a crucial role in balancing the discharge load in the different branches of the brenta bacchiglione river network downstream of padova thus reducing hydraulic hazard in a vast highly exposed area optimization of the river network is achieved through the definition of specific operation rules that are the result of an off line analysis such operation rules are static in the sense that their real time application i e in the course of a flood event is only based on the knowledge of simultaneous flow variables at different locations within the river network and does not require any model based evaluation to achieve optimal flood control the chance of pursuing such a simplified design is justified given the specific configuration of the problem at hand indeed the control structure subject to optimization is located in the terminal part of the river course where the duration of flood waves is relatively long and effects associated to flow unsteadiness are negligible furthermore static rules are easier to understand and put into practice for the non scientific staff in charge of managing the control structures in the river network the definition of optimal operation rules has been pursued in accordance and cooperation with the civil engineering department in charge of flood management in the brenta bacchiglione river network indeed end users engagement is important for the effective adoption of modelling analysis outcomes horne et al 2016 furthermore these rules were implemented using available features of the 2def two dimensional hydrodynamic model in the image early warning system that is operational at the civil protection office in charge of flood forecasting thus providing flood predictions that are coherent with the flood management actually performed 2 material and methods 2 1 the brenta bacchiglione river network nearby the city of padova the city of padova is surrounded by two major rivers named brenta and bacchiglione and by a set of channels interconnected by a variety of control structures fig 1 the brenta river with a basin of about 1600 km2 can convey more than 2500 m3 s at the outlet of its mountain basin at bassano del grappa about 60 km north of padova in the stretch between bassano del grappa and padova the brenta river is wide and somewhere braided close to padova the brenta river becomes narrower as it is confined within relatively high artificial levees north of the city centre it receives water from the muson dei sassi river basin of about 300 km2 flow rates up to 100 m3 s and then it flows south east reaching the adriatic sea near brondolo south of the venice lagoon downstream of padova the maximum discharge the brenta river can convey reduces to about 1500 m3 s martini et al 2004 the bacchiglione river with a basin of more than 1300 km2 located in the pre alps north of the city of vicenza mazzoleni et al 2017 viero 2018 can convey a water discharge of up to 800 m3 s at the south east edge of the city of padova before reaching padova the bacchiglione river receives the flow form the brentella canal dug in the 1314 and now used to divert part of the brenta discharge into the bacchiglione river during the dry season at padova the bacchiglione is divided into three courses battaglia canal dug in 1200 a d for drainage and navigation purposes that flows south towards the euganean hills tronco maestro channel the early course of the bacchiglione river that flows north and enters the historical centre of the city and changes its name in piovego canal when it enters the city scaricatore canal dug in the late 1800 as flood channel that flows east towards the voltabarozzo control structure where in turn it is divided in the roncajette river actually the bacchiglione main course downstream of padova and in the artificial s gregorio canal the s gregorio canal flows into the piovego canal and then in the brenta river downstream of padova the roncajette river flows south east collects the drainage waters of the cagnola channel and finally merges with the brenta river about 6 km upstream of the mouth in the adriatic sea some historical notes until less than two centuries ago the bacchiglione river was still passing through the historic centre of padova following a winding and relatively narrow path tronco maestro in fig 1 downstream of padova it was flowing south east with the name of roncajette river unfortunately the city was subject to frequent floods in order to fix this issue in 1830 the austrian government decided to build the 4 km long scaricatore canal to keep the bacchiglione floodwaters outside the city of padova the scaricatore canal is actually an artificial cutoff aimed at conveying the bacchiglione discharge to the roncajette river directly fig 1 due to an incorrect design this canal was unable to convey the maximum flow rates of the bacchiglione river during the disastrous flood occurred in 1882 therefore in the 1930s according to the design of luigi gasparini the scaricatore canal was enlarged and from the voltabarozzo control structure green square in fig 1 see also fig 2 the new s gregorio canal was dug with the aim of diverting part of the bacchiglione floodwaters towards the last segment of the piovego canal and then to the brenta river in this way hydraulic hazard was mitigated in both the city centre of padova and downstream along the course of the roncajette river consider that in times of low flow water levels are kept constant at 12 0 m above the sea level asl for the bacchiglione upstream of the voltabarozzo control structure and at 8 3 m asl for the brenta river upstream of the strà control structure red square n 9 in fig 1 through a proper operation of the sluice gates at the two control structures current network operation during flood events in the course of flood events the secondary channels are disconnected from the primary network i e the brenta and bacchiglione rivers in particular with reference to fig 1 gates are closed at the inlet of the brentella canal 1 of the battaglia canal 2 and of the tronco maestro channel 3 in addition gates are closed at the outlet of the piovego channel just upstream of the s gregorio confluence 4 and at the confluence of the old branch of the bacchiglione within the roncajette river at ca nordio 5 the s gregorio and piovego canals thus perform as a unique flood canal hereinafter denoted as sgp canal the drainage of the city centre of padova is guaranteed by the secondary channel network that through the s massimo gates 6 conveys drainage waters south east through the inverted siphon 7 under the s gregorio canal towards the pumping station of ca nordio 5 which allows pumping a flow rate of up to 40 m3 s into the roncajette river the tainter gates on the piovego canal at noventa padovana 8 which normally controls the water level in the whole city centre of padova are completely opened during flood events to facilitate discharging water from bacchiglione to brenta similarly the sluice gates on the brenta river at strà 9 which normally controls the water level in the downstream segment of the piovego canal for navigation purposes are completely open to limit backwater effects along the upstream brenta river and above all in the piovego canal whose levees are relatively low the voltabarozzo control structure the voltabarozzo control structure denoted hereinafter as vcs is a crucial element for flood management nearby and downstream of padova indeed it allows controlling the fraction of the bacchiglione flow rate to be diverted through the s gregorio piovego sgp canal toward the brenta river thus increasing the maximum conveyance of the bacchiglione close to padova and balancing the discharge load in the brenta and bacchiglione rivers downstream of padova the vcs is made up of two distinct multi gate facilities fig 2 the regolatore is used to control the water level just upstream of the structure and the flow rate in the roncajette river it is equipped with four 7 20 m wide sluice gates that can be opened up to 6 75 m above the bottom level located at 5 70 m asl the scaricatore is used to divert part of the bacchiglione flow rate into the sgp canal toward the brenta river it is equipped with two 7 20 m wide sluice gates that can be opened up to 7 0 m above the same bottom level of 5 70 m asl the management of the six gates of the the vcs is actually manual and is accomplished depending on the water levels measured just upstream and downstream of the control structure and those of the brenta river at strà 2 2 the 2def hydrodynamic model in the present study the simulation of flood events in the complex river and channel network described above is accomplished using the 2def hydrodynamic model defina 2000 2003 viero et al 2013 the model solves the full two dimensional 2d shallow water equations swes on unstructured triangular meshes the 2def model enforces a statistical subgrid approach for bottom elevations defina et al 1994 defina 2000 which allows for a physically based accurate and stable treatment of wetting and drying processes on very irregular topographies d alpaos and defina 2007 the swes are solved using a semi implicit staggered finite element method based on a mixed eulerian lagrangian approach defina 2003 the depth integrated horizontal dispersion stresses are evaluated using the boussinesq approximation stansby 2003 and the eddy viscosity is computed according to uittenbogaard and van vossen 2004 the 2def model has been improved in the years to simulate levee breaches viero et al 2013 to account for interactions between free surface flow and saturated flow in the topsoil layer viero et al 2014 transport of pollutants and evaluation of transport time scales viero and defina 2016 anisotropy in bottom resistance due to oriented roughness viero and valipour 2017 and anisotropic effects due to buildings and

set up to describe the study area fig 3 the model includes the tesina river from bolzano vicentino the retrone river from s agostino the bacchiglione river from viale diaz north of the city center of vicenza the brenta river from barzizza north of the historical town of bassano del grappa and the muson dei sassi river from castelfranco veneto all these watercourses can be seen as tributaries of brenta river which flows into the adriatic sea near brondolo south of the venice lagoon fig 3 the model includes some external flood prone areas such as the city of vicenza along the bacchiglione river and some floodplains along the brenta river north of padova the mesh geometry and topography were set up using aerial images and data from lidar and multi beam surveys technical maps and cross sections www pcn minambiente it mattm and https idt2 regione veneto it we paid particular attention to pick the correct elevations of levees and to include in the model the different hydraulic structures properly the domain is discretized with about 30000 2d triangular elements and 24000 nodes 2600 1d channel elements and 5300 1d links 1d channel elements are used to model straight river reaches with simple i e not compound sections and to account for the presence of small channels dissecting the urban and rural areas which play an important role on the propagation of flood waves over initially dry areas most of the 1d links are used to model levees and embankments that in case of overflowing are expected to force sub to super critical transition i e critical condition other 1d links are deputed to model sluice gates and pump stations the model was calibrated and tested by simulating the most severe flood events occurred in the years 2009 2014 for a total of 5 flood events as boundary conditions we prescribed hourly flow rates recorded at the upstream cross sections at bolzano vicentino viale diaz s agostino barzizza and castelfranco veneto and water levels of the adriatic sea measured close to brondolo mel and lionello 2016 measured data were provided by the regional agency for environmental protection of the veneto region arpav which maintains a network of several gauging stations for water levels and flow rates within the basin flow rates discharged within the main rivers by the pumping stations of the external drainage network were provided by the land reclamation authority brenta bacchiglione sea levels were provided by centro previsioni e segnalazioni maree of the venice municipality in simulating past flood events for model calibration and testing we force the model to reproduce the actual discharge partitioning performed at the vcs according to the gate operations performed and recorded by the civil engineering department in charge of the gate management the model is calibrated by trial and errors to obtain a suitable set of roughness coefficients for the different river reaches and zones i e riverbeds banks floodplains etc for a total of 40 model parameters the accuracy of the model was then checked by comparing the model results with time series of water levels measured at eight gauging stations located along the course of the brenta and bacchiglione rivers and against point measurements of discharge performed by arpav using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp in the course of most of the considered flood events adcp measurements were carried out at downstream sections of the rivers where flow velocity is within the operating range of the instrument model errors in terms of water levels at the flood peak are generally lower than 20 cm at all the gauging stations the maximum relative error in terms of discharges is 8 we took great care to maximize the model robustness and accuracy as well as to optimize the mesh to reduce simulation times as the 2def model impementation described herein is the hydrodynamic core of the image flood forecasting and early warning system operational at the centro funzionale decentrato cfd of the veneto region the public office in charge of flood forecasting crestani et al 2018 mel et al 2018 ronco et al 2016 2 4 the image early warning system for the brenta bacchiglione rivers as already anticipated the above implementation of the 2def hydrodynamic model is part of a flood forecasting and early warning system ews developed since 2015 for the cfd office of the veneto region and named image interface and model for the alert and management of flood events the need of an effective ews for the brenta bacchiglione river basin became apparent after the severe flood occurred in 2010 viero et al 2013 to allow for an improved management of flood events and civil protection activities the image ews allows i importing and pre processing hydro meteo

the semi distributed geomorphological hydrological model rinaldo et al 2015 benettin et al 2015 2019 estimates the temporal evolution of soil moisture content runoff and outflow dynamics in the mountain basins of the bacchiglione and the brenta rivers the spatial and temporal dynamics of meteorological forcing including precipitation fields is evaluated using spatial geostatistical interpolation via kriging techniques of observed data series the rainfall fraction actually involved in the generation of flood waves is based on suitable water balance equations benettin et al 2013 the river basins are divided into sub catchments for which vegetated and urban impervious fractions are evaluated from remote sensing data and simulated separately in the vegetated fraction infiltration to the root zone is split into evapotranspiration subsurface flow and groundwater recharge in the urban areas all the incoming rainfall is assumed to produce runoff but an initial fraction of the total runoff is diverted to water treatment plants for every reach and at the outlet of the basins the hydrologic response is computed using the convolution between the spatial and temporal distribution of the effective rainfall and the geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph rinaldo and rodriguez iturbe 1996 rinaldo et al 2006 which depends on the distributions of the residence times in the different flow paths of the basin the calibration parameters of the hydrological model can be subdivided into three categories i parameters related to soil properties and runoff production ii dynamical parameters related to transport processes within hillslopes and channels and iii vegetation parameters that define evapotranspiration rates and long term soil atmosphere interactions the calibration set of model parameters is computed using a markov chain monte carlo approach vrugt et al 2009 to obtain the best fit between modelled and measured discharge time series at the basin outlets and at inner gauged sections as well for example the model for the bacchiglione basin at viale diaz fig 3 has been calibrated from september 2010 to december 2015 for the entire calibration period the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is up to 0 96 and the root mean square error rmse is 5 2 m3 s nse 0 95 and rmse 8 3 m3 s for flow rates greater than 20 m3 s 12 probability of exceedance nse 0 78 and rmse 23 1 for flow rates greater than 100 m3 s 1 probability of exceedance passadore et al 2018 the discharge hydrographs predicted by the hydrological model are then provided as inflow boundary conditions to the 2def hydrodynamic model that simulates the propagation of flood waves in the river network and in case of overflowing the flooding of adjacent areas 3 definition of optimal operation rules for the voltabarozzo control structure 3 1 premises it has first to be noted that the discharge along the sgp canal q sgp depends on the opening of the scaricatore gates on the upstream water level and on the flow rate in the brenta river at strà that determines the downstream water level for the sgp canal furthermore the levees of the piovego canal are relatively low and in case of high downstream levels q sgp must be further limited to avoid overflowing and possible levee failures along the downstream reach of the piovego canal as a first step the hydrodynamic model has been used to evaluate the importance of unsteady effects on the propagation of flood waves within the considered channel networks it is known in fact that accounting for hydraulic interactions in complex river systems remains an open challenge for systemic flood risk management in particular when flow unsteadiness plays a crucial role ciullo et al 2019 di baldassarre et al 2009 fortunately the typical duration of flood wave along the brenta and bacchiglione rivers at padova is long compared to the transit time in the downstream branches this makes unsteady effects negligible in the management of the vcs then the hydrodynamic model has been used to compute under steady flow conditions the maximum flow rate that the sgp can discharge into the brenta river i e with the scaricatore gates completely open and avoiding levee overflowing as a function of the water level upstream of the vcs and of the flow rates in the brenta river upstream of the piovego confluence q bre ups fig 4 on the one hand the discharge divertable through the sgp canal q sgp can be increased by increasing the water level upstream of the vcs h ups which entails on the other hand reducing the levee freeboard along the scaricatore canal in addition due to backwater effects the maximum divertable discharge reduces for increasing q bre ups thanks to the joint operation of the regolatore and the scaricatore facilities water levels upstream of the vcs can be modified to some extent and compatibly with levee elevations also for fixed flow rate values this gives additional flexibility to the entire control system if compared with the case of lateral floodgates only with this in mind the goal is to define a set of optimal operation rules for the vcs to minimize the flood risk for both the city of padova and the downstream flood prone areas 3 2 minimization of flood risk we started by observing that the flood risk in the whole system is minimum when it is equally distributed in the different branches of the channel network and in the adjacent areas by analysing the maximum discharge capacity in the different reaches of the channel network using the 2def hydrodynamic model and according to the civil engineering department in charge of flood management five risk classes have been defined fig 5 each risk class corresponds to a specific range of four variables 1 the flow rate in the roncajette river q ron to account for the flood hazard in the roncajette river and on the adjacent areas 2 the flow rate in the brenta river downstream of the piovego confluence q bre dwns q bre ups q sgp to account for flood hazard in its lower reach and on the adjacent areas 3 the water level upstream of the vcs h ups to account for flood hazard along the scaricatore canal and on the adjacent areas 4 the minimum levee freeboard along the sgp canal to account for flood hazard along the canal and on the adjacent areas note that for the sgp canal the levee freeboard is used in place of the flow rate as here the relationship between level and discharge is not a one to one function due to the variable downstream water level that depends on the brenta flow rate based on how the classes have been determined it can be assumed that for a given risk class flood risk is reasonably equivalent in all the parts of the system indeed the definition of such risk classes is made by accounting for the risk of overflowing in the different branches of the principal channel network and also for exposure and vulnerability in the adjacent areas given the scope of the present study exposure vulnerability and in turn hydraulic risk in areas adjacent to the river network were not evaluated according to a rigorous quantitative procedure besides the results provided by the hydrodynamic models in terms of levee freeboard we relied on qualitative expert based evaluations i e technicians of the civil engineering department to account for the quantity and quality of exposed assets their vulnerability and the probability of levee failures we believe that expert based considerations are appropriate for the specific case study because levee failures driven by piping cannot be predicted deterministically d oria et al 2019 mazzoleni et al 2014 michelazzo et al 2018 and the presence of animal burrows is becoming increasingly important orlandini et al 2015 palladino et al 2020 viero et al 2013 it is also known that economic implications of flood risk go beyond the direct damages that are typically considered and a thorough quantitative assessment is still an open challenge koks 2018 koks et al 2019 norén et al 2016 3 3 determining optimal operation rules the optimization of the system to achieve minimum flood risk consists in managing the sluice gates so as to remain within the lowest possible risk class to this purpose we designed a specific algorithm that at a given time step determines the opening of the six gates of the vcs to minimize flood risk based on water levels and discharges at specific locations within the river network which can be identified as known variables at each time step the known variables are the discharges flowing in the bacchiglione river q bac and in the brenta river upstream of the piovego confluence q bre ups whereas the discharges in the roncajette river and in the sgp canal q ron and q sgp respectively the water level upstream of the vcs h ups and the minimum levee freeboard along the sgp canal are free variables that depend on the gate operations mass conservation at confluences entails q bac q ron q sgp and q bre dwns q bre ups q sgp in the exploratory phase of the study the algorithm is coupled with the 2def hydrodynamic model to test its effectiveness through the simulation of past flood events chosen a time step of one hour for the simulations a sensitivity analysis did not show any advantage associated with using smaller time steps the algorithm determines the gate opening of vcs based on known variables that in this case are computed by the 2def model then it drives the 2def model to simulate flood propagation with the prescribed gate opening until the next time step the use of a calibrated hydrodynamic model assures that the obtained solution in terms of free variables is plausible in designing the operation of the vcs two different relevant cases can be identified 1 for q bac 100 m3 s the scaricatore gates are kept closed according to the previous management of the vcs the regolatore gates are operated to keep the upstream water level h ups equal to 12 m asl 2 for q bac 100 m3 s the scaricatore gates should be partially opened to achieve flood risk minimization in this case the algorithm first attempts to recover the lower risk class in terms of q ron by discharging the excess flow through the sgp canal toward the brenta river while keeping h ups and q bre dwns within the same risk class fig 4 in general within a given risk class the flow rate through the roncajette river q ron is given the maximum value within the class range so as to minimize the upstream water level h ups and the total discharge in the downstream reach of the brenta river q bre dwns the last control concerns the minimum levee freeboard along the sgp canal if a freeboard is out of range the algorithm determines the needed closure of the scaricatore gates if it is not possible to keep the three free variables within the same risk class the algorithm assumes for q ron the value associated to the higher risk class a summary of the operation rules for the gates of the vcs for an increasing discharge of the bacchiglione river is shown in fig 6 as previously described when the algorithm cannot keep all the free variables within the same risk class the flow rate in the roncajette river is increased first an example of vcs management is shown in fig 7 for the rising limb of a typical flood wave in the bacchiglione river blue line as long as the bacchiglione flow rate q bac is lower than the 100 m3 s threshold risk class 1 light blue the upstream water level h ups is 12 00 m asl and the scaricatore gates remain closed q sgp 0 once q bac exceeds the 100 m3 s threshold risk class 2 green the scaricatore gates open to maintain q ron fixed at 100 m3 s and h ups 12 00 m asl q sgp increases accordingly when this is no longer possible because of the increase of q bac q ron is allowed to rise up to 200 m3 s once q ron exceeds 200 m3 s risk class 3 yellow first h ups rises up to 13 00 m asl then q ron increases up to 350 m3 s at this point h ups rises again up to 13 50 m asl and q ron up to 500 m3 s risk class 4 orange finally h ups can increase up to 14 m asl reaching the maximum flow rate divertable through the sgp canal q sgp and the exceeding flow rate is totally discharged into the roncajette river q ron 500 m3 s risk class 5 red the effectiveness of the operation rules has been tested by simulating the whole year 2009 during which some relevant flood events occurred the algorithm succeeded in determining the gate opening along the entire the simulated period such that all the variables of interest fully satisfy the management criteria summarized in figs 5 and 6 figure 8 shows the management of the vcs for the flood event occurred between 28 4 2009 and 1 5 2009 when the flow rates of the brenta and the bacchiglione rivers upstream of the city of padova exceeded 650 m3 s and 350 m3 s respectively interestingly in this case the flow rate diverted through the sgp canal q sgp was limited by the large flow rate of the brenta river q bre dwns 800 m3 s risk class 2 as a consequence it was not possible to increase the water level upstream of voltabarozzo intentionally to further increase q sgp hence during this flood event h ups remained fixed at 12 00 m asl even at the flood peak in the roncajette river 4 implementation of the operation rules in the image ews the final goal of the present study was to implement the optimal operation rules in the image early warning system described in sect 2 4 so as to simulate the management of the vcs correctly in real time flood forecast taking advantage of the static nature of the operation rules for the vcs we used specific 1d links implemented in the 2def hydrodynamic model to reproduce the gate operations described in sect 3 3 directly i e without using any external algorithm specifically in the 2def model we modelled each sluice gate using an available type of 1d link which operates the gate to maintain a prescribed upstream water level i e a target level the two sluice gates of the scaricatore were given a target level of 12 00 m asl so that they remain close for h ups 12 00 and progressively open for h ups 12 00 m asl for the regolatore gates a target level of 11 95 m asl was assigned to the first gate and its width selected so that a discharge of 100 m3 s determines an upstream level of 12 m asl with the gate completely open in this way when the first discharge threshold q ron 100 m3 s is reached h ups 12 00 m asl and the scaricatore gates start to open thus diverting the exceeding discharge to the sgp canal for a further increase of q bac h ups increase as well thus determining the opening of the second regolatore gate whose target level was set to 12 05 m asl and so on obviously the width of each gate of the regolatore facility was modified with respect to the actual width without changing the total width of the four sluice gates the additional controls concerning the minimum levee freeboard along the sgp canal and the maximum discharge within the downstream reach of the brenta river were implemented by connecting in series two fictitious gates downstream of the two scaricatore gates these fictitious gates close progressively when target levels are reached along the sgp canal and the brenta river thus limiting q sgp in order to keep q bre dwns and the minimum freeboard within the range of the associated risk class the model set up implemented within the image ews produces almost the same results as the procedure described in sect 3 3 as shown in fig 7 where dashed lines refer to the simplified image implementation of the operation rules the image implementation have been verified thoroughly by simulating 26 flood events occurred between 2010 and 2014 table 1 in simulating these flood events the image ews was forced using measured rainfall and meteorological data figures from 9 to 12 show the model results for 4 significant flood events characterized by increasing intensity and which cover different sorts of gate operations a detailed description of the specific operations rules applied in each case is reported in the figure captions the procedure implemented in the ews shows two slight deviations with respect to the algorithm described in sect 3 3 the former is described in the caption of fig 10 the latter in the caption of fig 12 yet the difference in terms of discharge partitioning is negligible 5 conclusions this research focuses on optimizing the operation of the hydraulic network of the city of padova and in particular of the voltabarozzo control structure which allows diverting waters from the bacchiglione river to the brenta river the operation rules allow determining the flow rate to be diverted and the water level upstream of the voltabarozzo control structure as a function of simultaneous values of discharge flowing in the bacchiglione and brenta rivers the principle behind flood management is the minimization of hydraulic risk which consists in distributing the risk in the different parts of the hydraulic network equally the goal is achieved by defining five risk classes accounting for hydraulic load at various locations along the reaches and for hydraulic hazard exposure and vulnerability of assets in the adjacent flood prone areas for each risk class a specific range is defined for discharges and minimum levee freeboard in the main branches of the channel network the operation rules have been tested by simulating several recent flood events furthermore they have been implemented in the image early warning system which is operational at the regional office in charge of flood forecasting to provide accurate real time predictions of discharges water levels levee freeboard and possible flooding along the brenta bacchiglione river network and over the adjacent areas the present work was developed in collaboration with the local civil engineering department in charge of flood management so as to take advantage of the direct knowledge of the technicians in charge of flood management as well as to create trust in the result of the work by those who have to put into practice the management rules we highlight that the operation rules described herein refer to the current configuration of the river and channel network in case of improvements of the hydraulic network as for example levee heightening the risk classes should be re defined to account for the modified reduced risk similarly in case of emergency situations or sudden accidents such as a levee collapse e g the levee breach formed in the roncajette river during the november 2010 flood event viero et al 2013 the management of the voltabarozzo control structure should adapt to the particular situation in order to minimize the discharge load in the damaged branch of the network e g yang et al 2020 further applications of the 2def hydrodynamic model with optimal operation of the voltabarozzo control structure should aim at evaluating the effects of additional interventions such as levee rise in the most critical segments of the channel network and the construction of the padova venezia waterway to be used beside navigation to divert part of the brenta river from downstream of strà directly to the venice lagoon martini et al 2004 mel et al 2019 2020 the proposed approach which uses hydrodynamic modelling and expert based knowledge to determine an equal distribution of flood risk in a river network allows minimizing flood risk through optimal operation of existing control structures without significant additional costs the suggested approach can be adapted and applied to different contexts accounting for the peculiarities of each specific river network but keeping the basic principles unchanged finally we remark the importance of collaborating with public institutions and with the technicians in charge of managing the river networks to promote exchange of knowledge and expertise and to maximize the practical

climate and geology create a strongly coupled surface groundwater system that produces copious baseflow and limited quantities of runoff and interflow patterns of hydrologic response are influenced by the type and rate of precipitation and permeability of the underlying geology under variable precipitation conditions the hydrologic response of volcanic terranes with similar permeability and subsurface storage capacity can be significantly different from a water management and ecohydrology perspective understanding regional patterns of hydrologic response and sub regional differences is fundamental results indicate that minimum flow methods provide the most conservative estimate of baseflow and may be the most robust for filtering out snowmelt bias in baseflow estimates baseflow contributes 75 of the perennial streamflow across the nvasa and represents a critical component of the regional water supply that provides critical cold water habitat keywords northwest volcanic aquifer hydrograph separation hydrologic response baseflow interflow groundwater dependent ecosystem volcanic aquifer 1 introduction the northwest volcanic aquifer study area nvasa fig 1 is underlain by highly heterogenous volcanic terranes sherrod and keith 2018 with strongly coupled surface water and groundwater systems burns et al 2017a there is considerable dependence on groundwater for irrigation public water supply hydro and geothermal power production and ecosystem services a fundamental understanding of the nvasa s regional hydrology and sub regional differences is a critical knowledge needed to guide sustainable water resource management in this relatively dry and understudied region of the northwestern united states two recent climate assessments vose et al 2014 mote et al 2018 further highlight the need for a better understanding of hydrologic response across the nvasa although the mean annual precipitation from 1980 to 2015 61 1 cm yr was close to the long term mean 60 5 cm yr precipitation anomalies fig 2 for a western region of the united states that includes the nvasa indicate an increase in the magnitude frequency and duration of precipitation extremes since 1980 vose et al 2014 snowmelt discharge is an important process for generating surface and subsurface flow in the mountainous regions of the nvasa a recent assessment of western snowpack mote et al 2018 found that 90 of long term snow monitoring sites showed declines in snowpack and 33 of these sites had declines with significant trends a regional hydrograph analysis under historic climates for the nvasa will provide an understanding of how changes in precipitation under historic climates influence hydrologic response a stream hydrograph represents the net balance of water discharged from a surface water basin there are numerous automated methods for hydrographseparation that partition streamflow into two or more subcomponents which can be assigned to surface e g fast flow or subsurface e g slow flow sources of water although heuristic these methods provide consistent results that are particularly useful for gaining a fundamental understanding of regional hydrology when hydrologic data are spatially and temporally sparse established hydrograph separation methods have been extensively reviewed and evaluated and can be classified into two broad categories chemical methods and hydrological methods hall 1968 nathan and mcmahon 1990 tallaksen 1995 smakhtin 2001 brodie and hostetler 2005 schwartz 2007 eckhardt 2008 partington et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 foks et al 2019 chemical methods hooper and shoemaker 1986 miller et al 2014 hugenschmidt et al 2014 use tracers e g stable isotopes major ions or specific conductance to characterize the unique chemical signatures of surface and subsurface sources of water however application of chemical methods at regional scales is typically limited by data availability in comparison hydrological methods use readily available streamflow records making these methods quite useful for a regional analysis of hydrologic response the hydrograph separation methods used in this study bfi wahl and wahl 1995 hysep fixed interval hysep sliding interval hysep local minimum sloto and crouse 1996 part rutledge 1998 can be divided into two subtypes those that assume surface and subsurface water respond to storm events concurrently and those that address the effects of storage and assume discharge from subsurface sources continues after surface runoff begins nathan and mcmahon 1990 the net result of these underlying assumptions is that they alternately maximize the quantity of streamflow that is assigned to either direct runoff or baseflow a regional analysis was undertaken using six hydrograph separation methods available in the usgs groundwater toolbox v2 0 gwtoolbox barlow et al 2015 variability in the results from the six methods motivated the development of a new three component metric for hydrograph analysis the new metric separates streamflow into three components defined by timescales of hydrologic response fast runoff intermediate interflow and slow baseflow the proposed metric is useful for gaining a broad understanding of the range and variability of hydrologic response at regional scales and for calibrating regional water balance models which are highly sensitive to the methods used to separate the subcomponents of streamflow flint et al 2013 because ecological response is closely linked to hydrologic response this new metric also provides a useful ecohydrology tool for analyzing instream flows and associated ecosystem benefits poff et al 1997 carlisle et al 2017 groundwater discharge in particular is closely linked to the distribution of cold water habitat boulton and hancock 2006 nichols et al 2014 torgersen et al 2012 cantonati et al 2012 and plays a critical role in sustaining a wide spectrum of instream biota during the low flow season and prolonged periods of drought a growing body of freshwater ecology studies indicate that surface groundwater exchange not only enriches ecosystem productivity jones et al 1995 pepin and hauer 2002 brown et al 2004 wyatt et al 2008 but also directly influences fish growth and prey resources wissmar et al 1997 power et al 1999 mejia et al 2016 the primary objectives of this study were to gain a fundamental understanding of regional hydrology across the nvasa by evaluating spatial patterns of hydrologic response sub regional differences and influencing factors and to assess ecohydrological implications with particular attention to baseflow a secondary objective was to evaluate the utility of automated hydrograph separation methods for investigating hydrologic response in permeable volcanic terranes 2 methods streamflow datasets for 312 surface water basins fig 1 were analyzed using six hydrograph separation methods available in the gwtoolbox v2 0 barlow et al 2015 a subset of 172 minimally impaired basins was selected and used to evaluate the utility of the six methods for assessing hydrologic response in volcanic terranes two methods were selected to define a new three component metric to evaluate the influence of physiography climate and geology on spatial patterns of hydrologic response and the ecohydrological implications 2 1 study area the nvasa fig 1 which is approximately 192 000 km2 has eight distinct physiographic subregions classified by fenneman and johnson 1946 on the basis of terrane texture rock type and geologic structure and history the subregions include the harney basin located in the geographic center of the study area the walla walla plateau and blue mountain anticline of oregon which constrain the northern boundary the eastern flank of the middle and southern cascade range of oregon and california constrain the western boundary the sierra nevada and basin and range of california and nevada constrain the southern boundary and the snake river plain of southwestern idaho constrains the eastern boundary there is a strong west to east precipitation gradient created by the orographic influence of the cascaderange and sierra nevada fig 1 annual precipitation in the cascade range can exceed 250 centimeters and in the semi arid regions of the high deserts in eastern oregon annual precipitation is commonly less than 25 centimeters snowmelt is an important process for generating streamflow particularly in basins located at higher elevations approximately 70 of the mean annual precipitation 60 5 cm yr falls as rain and 30 as snow thornton et al 2015 the nvasa part of the larger northwestern volcanic province nvp includes four additional important aquifer systems that have been previously studied columbia plateau regional aquifer system e g vaccaro 1986 snake river plain aquifer system e g lindholm 1996 upper deschutes basin aquifer system e g gannett et al 2001 and the upper klamath basin aquifer system e g gannett et al 2007 the study area boundary used to select the gaged basins for the regional hydrograph analysis was delineated on the basis of similar underlying geology and includes the nvasa the upper deschutes basin aquifer system and the upper klamath basin aquifer system the nvasa generally coincides with the pacific northwest basaltic rock aquifers and the pacific northwest basin fill aquifers defined by reilly et al 2008 the term basaltic rock aquifers is a bit of a misnomer because nvasa s volcanic aquifers are highly variable in composition spanning the entire silicic range from basalt to rhyolite sherrod and keith 2018 the basin fill aquifers generally composed of sediments derived from the surrounding volcanic uplands are hydrologically connected to the volcanic uplands suggesting that the rock and alluvial aquifers function as a single hydrogeologic system this system of volcanic and alluvial aquifers transmits substantial flow through primary e g conduit flow and secondary permeability features e g fractures and faults resulting in rapid groundwater response times for example studies of medicine lake volcano and the fall river springs system located in the southern cascade range of california fig 1 indicate groundwater residence times of less than 30 years for saturated flow paths that exceed 50 km rose et al 1996 davisson and rose 2014 davisson 2017 the production of copious amounts of relatively young groundwater across the nvasa sustains perennial stream flow and represents the most important source of water in this groundwater dependent ecosystem howard and merrifield 2010 brown et al 2011 although large cold water springs are common meinzer 1927 the spatial distribution of cold springs is not uniform burns et al 2017a and this suggests that there are important sub regional differences that control the spatial patterns of hydrologic response 2 2 compilation of available streamflow data the nvasa is sparsely populated and likewise hydrologic data are spatially and temporally sparse the longest and most complete hydrologic datasets are usgs streamflow measurements which are publicly available from the usgs national water information system nwis https waterdata usgs gov nwis a total of 6 995 annual hydrographs with variable periods of record spanning 1906 to 2015 measured at 312 stream gages fig 1 were analyzed using six hydrograph separation methods available in the gwtoolbox v2 0 barlow et al 2015 station descriptions detailed metadata and mean annual results for the 312 gaged basins fig 1 were compiled and published separately as a usgs data release curtis 2019 a hydrologic disturbance index hdi table 1 developed specifically for this study was used to select a subset of gaged basins with minimal anthropogenic disturbance fig 3 this is a critical step because anthropogenic disturbance i e impairment such as land use flow regulation and flow diversions create hydrograph variations and systematic biases in stream hydrographs that are unrelated to natural hydrologic processes each gaged basin was assigned to an hdi class using integer values from 0 to 7 table 1 the hdi classes include one unimpaired class 0 two unregulated classes with no known diversions 1 2 one unregulated class with known diversions 3 three regulated classes 4 5 6 and a class to denote the presence of large natural lakes 7 that may result in a natural reservoir effect that dampens downstream hydrographs the minimally impaired basins selected for the hydrologic response analysis had an hdi of 0 1 or 2 although the stream flow gaging record spans 1906 to 2015 the number of minimally impaired gages in operation increased steadily peaked in 1967 and has since declined fig 4 see curtis 2019 for additional details on the datasets used in this study 2 3 automated hydrograph separation using the gwtoolbox v2 0 the hydrograph separation methods used to partition mean daily streamflow datasets into fast flow and slow flow subcomponents assume that fast flow represents direct runoff discharged during a precipitation event whereas the slow flow represents baseflow an important caveat of these methods is that hydrological processes are not explicitly simulated instead the methods rely upon empirical parameters that use characteristic hydrologic response times to assign streamflow to the fast and slow components although direct runoff occurs on the timescale of minutes to days extended storms and instream travel times often delay the streamflow response measured at downstream gages in contrast aquifers commonly respond hydraulically on timescales ranging from days to several decades by releasing water from subsurface storage consequently the underlying assumptions of these methods are strongly tied to hydrologic response times this implicitly results in the methods assigning different values to the fast and slow components of streamflow evaluating the utility of the methods for interpreting hydrologic response is somewhat subjective because hydrologic processes operate on a continuum of timescales and streamflow cannot be uniquely separated into two components e g fast and slow representing only two processes e g direct runoff and groundwater discharge for example intermediate timescale processes such as interflow and snowmelt must be systematically assigned to either the fast or slow component of streamflow to partially mitigate this problem a novel approach was formulated to partition streamflow into three components using the results from two hydrograph separation methods this new three component metric for hydrograph analysis allows streamflow to be divided into fast runoff intermediate interflow and slow baseflow snowmelt discharge cannot be separated from the other components of streamflow using this metric and was not addressed in this study the gwtoolbox v2 0 was used to perform the hydrograph analysis because it provides an objective and efficient tool to retrieve inspect and analyze daily streamflow datasets for large regional studies the analyses can be run simultaneously for a batch of gaging stations with variable periods of record and the results are automatically exported into daily monthly and calendar year formats a python script was written to post process and aggregate the daily values into mean annual values by water year october 1 to september 30 this study used six of the eight methods currently available in the gwtoolbox v2 0 the methods include two variations of the base flow index method bfi standard and bfi modified wahl and wahl 1995 three variations of the hydrograph separation and analysis program hysep fixed interval hysep sliding interval hysep local minimum sloto and crouse 1996 and the streamflow partitioning program part rutledge 1998 the bfi methods are the only methods with adjustable parameters however for this study the default values were used the gwtoolbox now includes two digital filtering methods developed by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and eckhardt 2005 that were unavailable at the initiation of this study the six methods used in this study separate fast flow from slow flow using linear interpolation but the criteria for identifying values to be used in the interpolation vary and for this reason the methods provide a range of results when using the default parameters the bfi standard and bfi modified methods use a moving window to divide the calendar year into 5 day increments n 5 and a minimum flow is defined for each 5 day period the two methods differ in how the turning points used in the linear interpolation are identified the bfi standard method uses a turning point test factor f 0 9 which was replaced by a daily recession index k 0 979 in the bfi modified method using the default values if 90 of the minimum flow during the 5 day period is less than both adjacent minimum values then the bfi standard method defines that 5 day minimum as a turning point similarly if the daily recession rate during the 5 day window is 0 979 then the bfi modified defines that 5 day minimum as a turning point the hysep methods use a moving bar hysep fixed hysep sliding or local minimum hysep lomin defined as an inverse function of drainage area to define minimum values used for interpolation in comparison part uses a recession criterion to define the minimum values for interpolation and assumes baseflow is equal to daily streamflow unless there is a decline of 0 1 log cycle or more in the mean daily streamflow record once the minimum values are defined all six methods use linear interpolation to connect the minimum values and separate streamflow into the subcomponents the area below the minimum flow line is assigned to slow flow and the area above is assigned to fast flow detailed information regarding each method is provided in the relevant references we selected two periods of analysis for this study the period of record 1906 to 2015 was analyzed to assess long term behavior and a recent climate period 1980 to 2015 was analyzed to investigate the influence of non stationarity on the study results to assess sub regional differences in hydrologic response the annual means for all the gaged basins within each of the physiographic subregions were averaged regardless of the number of years of record ensuring equal weight among the gaged basins within each subregion large interannual variability in precipitation and streamflow is inherent in regions like the nvasa that are characterized by extremes fig 2 the interannual variability produces large uncertainties in the mean annual results standard errors of the mean a measure of the dispersion of the sample mean around the population mean was used to assess the accuracy of the results anduncertainty was assessed using the standard deviation a measure of the range or variation of the sample mean around the population mean 2 4 limitations and simplifying assumptions of hydrograph separation methods in our analysis we attempted to overcome some of the limitations and assumptions inherent to hydrograph separation by following recommendations suggested by barlow et al 2015 for example to mitigate for flow accumulation and travel time the contributing area for a gaged basin was constrained between 2 5 and 1300 km2 a minimum basin size of 2 5 km2 ensured that the duration of runoff exceeded the 1 day increment of the streamflow time series similarly because baseflow variability decreases with increasing basin size a maximum basin size of 1300 km2 was defined to mitigate for large basins that attenuate climate signals and homogenize differences in hydrologic response anthropogenic activities that influence the flow or storage of water within a basin can introduce systematic errors that bias the results for example reservoirs intercept and delay stormflow which is later released during the low flow season and commonly results in a systematic overestimation of baseflow similarly wastewater return flows and slow drainage from lakes wetlands or streambank storage may also result in the overestimation baseflow conversely water diversions may cause baseflow to be underestimated we mitigated these potential biases by using the subset of minimally impaired gage basins identified using the hydrologic disturbance index developed for this study curtis 2019 2 5 the influence of physiography climate and geology on hydrologic response the physiographic subregions of the nvasa are characterized by unique climatic and geologic histories we examined sub regional differences in hydrologic response and investigated the influence of physiography climate and geology by superimposing our results onto maps of mean annual precipitation and geologic age and composition the precipitation map was derived from 1 km gridded estimates of daily precipitation thornton et al 2015 and the geology map was extracted from a new compilation of thematic maps sherrod and keith 2018 snowmelt discharge is an important process for generating surface and subsurface flow across the nvasa using the method of barnhart et al 2016 the fraction of annual precipitation falling as snow was estimated for each 1 km grid cell thornton et al 2015 using the daily minimum and maximum temperatures allowing the computation of mean annual snow water equivalent for the period spanning 1980 2013 the resiliency of the hydrograph subcomponents to short term changes in precipitation was investigated by comparing results for a recent climatic period 1980 to 2015 to the period of record 1906 to 2015 this analysis was used to assess the influence of climatic variability on the study results we selected 1980 as the start of a recent climatic period with observed increases in precipitation anomalies fig 2 that followed a more stable climate period from 1950 to 1980 hansen et al 2012 from 1906 to 2015 there were 172 minimallyimpaired basins with streamflow records and 79 of these basins had streamflow records that span 1980 to 2015 fig 3 3 results and discussion the six hydrograph separation methods used in this study are intrinsically heuristic schwartz 2007 and have even been referred to as dubious halford and mayer 2000 despite these inherent limitations hydrograph separation remains a valuable tool for regional hydrologic assessments when working at regional scales with sparse data first order methods such as hydrograph separation continue to be a useful tool for conceptualizing the relative magnitude of hydrologic processes and estimating the subcomponents of a water budget the six methods used in this study have different underlying assumptions that alternately maximize the quantity of streamflow assigned to runoff or baseflow partington et al 2012 evaluated ten variations of common hydrograph separation methods against results simulated using a physically based surface groundwater flow model and found the methods underestimated baseflow by as much as 28 or overestimated by as much as 74 during rainfall events a recent study by schwartz and smith 2014 found that no single hydrograph separation method gave consistently superior results and the choice of method made no significant difference in the study results our results indicate the choice of method strongly influences the results we highlight this as an important distinction among the methods that motivated the development of a new three component metric the new metric is predicated and capitalizes on the differences in the underlying assumptions of methods that alternately maximum the runoff or baseflow subcomponents to demonstrate the differences among the methods an example hydrograph analysis is presented for a single gaged basin in fig 5 the part method provides the most conservative estimate of runoff 28 9 of total streamflow and the bfi methods provide the most conservative estimate of baseflow 39 4 of total streamflow subtracting estimates of runoff and baseflow from total streamflow provides an estimate of interflow 31 7 of total streamflow 3 1 regional hydrograph analysis results from the regional analysis are presented as mean annual water yield per unit drainage area cm yr and discussion of the regional results is focused on baseflow because it represents the largest subcomponent of streamflow the proportion of total streamflow contributed by baseflow commonly referred to as a baseflow index is used to assess sub regional differences in the baseflow results summary statistics describing the regional hydrograph analysis are presented for the period of record 1906 to 2015 table 2 a and the recent climatic period 1980 to 2015 table 2b during both of the analysis periods the standard error of the means was small 2 to 3 indicating the mean values are reliable for interpreting regional hydrologic response and sub regional differences conversely the standard deviations for both periods were high indicating large variability among the annual means which translates to large uncertainty for the period of record uncertainty was greater than the means for total streamflow as well as the runoff and baseflow subcomponents table 2a for the recent climate period uncertainty was less than the means for total streamflow and baseflow but greater than the mean for the runoff component table 2b for the period of record mean annual baseflow estimated using part hysep fixed hysep sliding and hysep locmin were similar and ranged from 37 1 to 39 0 cm yr table 2a in comparison mean annual baseflow estimated using the bfi standard and bfi modified was 13 lower than the other methods and ranged from 33 3 to 33 4 cm yr table 2a for the recent climatic period mean annual baseflow estimated using the part hysep fixed hysep sliding and hysep locmin were similar and ranged from 31 5 to 33 3 cm yr table 2b and the standard error was slightly higher 3 due to a decline in the number of gaged basins and years of gage data fig 4 in comparison mean annual baseflow estimated using the bfi standard and bfi modified was 12 less than the other methods and ranged from 28 4 to 28 7 cm yr table 2b minimum flow methods rather than recession methods are preferred for assessing baseflow in permeable terranes with significant snowmelt although snowmelt discharge was not directly assessed in this study we hypothesize that because minimum flow methods produce conservative estimates of baseflow they are also more robust for filtering out snowmelt bias snowmelt discharge released over intermediate timescales does not produce peaks that can be used as turning points in the stream hydrograph analysis for this reason snowmelt tends to be assigned to baseflow rather than being parsed out between runoff and baseflow in perennial streams within the nvasa baseflow contributes 75 of the total streamflow table 2 this regionalized estimate integrates the results from 172 gaged basins underlain by volcanic rock aquifers non volcanic rock aquifers and basin fill aquifers similarly eckhardt 2005 suggested baseflow generally contributes about 80 of the streamflow in perennial streams with porous aquifers our estimates of baseflow contributions in the middle cascade range 92 were similar to recent estimates published for the volcanic terranes of the middle cascade range oregon jefferson et al 2010 and the rio grande de san miguel el salvador wozab and jovel 1970 jefferson et al 2010 measured streamflow in six ungaged basins and used analogous hydrograph separation methods to estimate baseflow contributions three of the basins had flashy hydrographs with baseflow contributing less than 85 of the streamflow three of the basins were spring fed with baseflow contributing greater than 95 of the streamflow in comparison wozab and jovel 1970 related declines in groundwater levels to streamflow during dry periods when streamflow is solely sustained by groundwater they used a groundwater discharge rating curve to compute daily groundwater discharge and their results suggest that streamflow was composed of 86 groundwater 3 2 a new metric for assessing hydrologic response a gaged basin can be conceptualized as a series of interconnected reservoirs that store and release water over fast intermediate and slow timescales fig 6 hydrologic response in a gaged basin will vary with travel time as precipitation is converted into streamflow and conveyed downstream to a gaged location where it is measured generally a two component hydrograph analysis assigns water with the fastest travel time minutes to days to the runoff component and water with the slowest travel time weeks to decades to the baseflow component in contrast interflow is released from the shallow subsurface over a range of intermediate timescales days to months and cannot be explicitly captured by a two component analysis arguably interflow should not be explicitly lumped with either the fast or slow components of streamflow this interflow problem is inherent to a two component hydrograph analysis but can be resolved using a new three component metric as follows by combining the results from two hydrograph separation methods the first of which systematically assigns a smaller amount of water to direct runoff i e only the fastest water and the second of which systematically assigns a smaller amount to baseflow i e only the slowest water a third component can be defined this third component the intermediate timescale water is the remainder when the conservative estimates of runoff and baseflow are subtracted from total streamflow in very rare instances the remainder is negative but this has a minor effect on mean annual estimates of runoff interflow and baseflow an example annual hydrograph for usgs stream gage 11381500 fig 7 illustrates hydrograph separation using the new three component metric the bfi standard method preferentially assigns more flow to the runoff component and provides a conservative estimate of the slow water component grey area fig 6 the part method preferentially assigns more flow to the baseflow component and provides a conservative estimate of the fast water component blue area fig 6 subtracting the conservative runoff and baseflow estimates from total streamflow yields a remainder which provides an estimate of intermediate timescale water or interflow orange area fig 6 this novel approach overcomes the problem of assigning interflow to the fast or slow component and allows streamflow to be partitioned into three components 3 3 spatial patterns of hydrologic response the relative proportions of the three components of hydrologic response are summarized for the nvasa and seven of the eight physiographic subregions in fig 8 and table 3 the harney basin was not included in this analysis because the gaged basins did not meet our criteria for basin size and minimal impairment our results show that hydrologic response is spatially variable indicating fundamental sub regional differences across the nvasa baseflow represents the largest proportion 75 of total streamflow and the proportions of runoff 12 and interflow 13 were similar table 3 the sierra nevada produces the largest total streamflow followed by the middle cascade range the southern cascade range and the blue mountains these wetter subregions also have higher baseflow indexes the middle cascade range has the highest baseflow index 91 with runoff and interflow producing only 9 of the streamflow in comparison the baseflow indexes for the southern cascade range 75 sierra nevada 72 and the blue mountains 71 were smaller but similar the baseflow indexes for the drier subregions which includes the basin and range snake river and walla walla plateau were all 65 3 3 1 the influence of physiography climate and geology the nvasa s large precipitation gradient fig 9 a and highly heterogenous geology fig 9b strongly influence sub regional differences in hydrologic response when precipitation infiltrates the subsurface water storage increases and interflow and groundwater recharge occur huntington and niswonger 2012 carroll et al 2019 when the storage capacity of the vadose zone is exceeded or if rainfall or snowmelt rates exceed infiltration rates then runoff and interflow occur the rates of infiltration and recharge are influenced by the type and rate of precipitation and the permeability of the underlying geology consequently there must be sub regional differences in hydrologic response for regions with similar precipitation unless the geology and aquifer conditions are also the same baseflow indexes estimated for the period of record are shown superimposed upon maps of mean annual precipitation fig 9a and a thematic interpretation of the age and composition of the underlying geology fig 9b these maps show that wetter subregions have highly variable baseflow indexes likely related to permeability differences in the underlying geology generally wetter subregions mc and sc table 3 underlain by younger volcanic terranes also have gaged basins with higher baseflow indexes in comparison wetter subregions underlain by older non volcanic terranes sn and bm table 3 have gaged basins with lower baseflow indexes variability in baseflow among the wetter subregions is indicative of differences in subsurface flow that strongly influence hydrologic response subsurface flow is likely greater through the younger and more permeable volcanic rock aquifers in comparison the drier subregions are underlain by older non volcanic terranes and alluvial aquifers and the gaged basins have baseflow indexes that are lower and less variable wp br and sr table 3 the low baseflow indexes in drier regions suggest that deeper recharge into basin fill aquifers may be occurring in this case water may be lost to the regional groundwater system resulting in a smaller fraction of available water that emerges as baseflow young volcanic terranes are postulated to be the most permeable rocks within the nvasa and older volcanic terranes are assumed to be less permeable because over time pore filling minerals are hydrothermally altered to clays which decreases the primary permeability gannett et al 2001 gannett et al 2007 burns et al 2017a higher permeability in the young volcanic terranes results in relatively low runoff production that is balanced by high transmissivity and lateral flow in the shallow subsurface in these young volcanic terranes copious amounts of subsurface flow emerge over intermediate timescales as interflow and longer timescales as baseflow the exceptions to this generalization e g small circles in young volcanic terranes fig 9a occur where the available water recharges the regional groundwater system resulting in smaller baseflow generally the non volcanic and older volcanic terranes have lower primary permeability and uniformly lower baseflow the exceptions to this generalization e g larger circles in non volcanic or older volcanic terranes fig 9b occur where quaternary faults increase secondary permeability acting as conduits for lateral subsurface flow that emerges at the surface increasing baseflow in these regions 3 3 2 resiliency to climate variability and ecohydrology implications a detailed climate change analysis is beyond the scope of the current study but we assessed the resiliency of the three components of hydrologic response to short term changes in precipitation this allowed us to address the influence of climate variability and non stationarity on hydrologic response albeit in a cursory way the three components of hydrologic response estimated for the period of record 1906 to 2015 were compared to estimates for two recent dry periods 1976 77 and 1991 92 and two recent wet periods 1982 83 and 1997 98 fig 10 during the dry periods declines in interflow 61 were greater than declines in runoff 50 and baseflow was the most resilient 10 to short term changes in precipitation during the wet periods increases in interflow 8 were much smaller than increases in baseflow 57 and runoff 107 interflow was the least resilient declining by 61 during the dry periods and increasing by only 8 during the wetter periods suggesting that shallow subsurface storage in the vadose zone may be limited the relatively large increases in runoff and baseflow during the wetter periods includes an unknown amount of snowmelt discharge which was not addressed in this study the relation between recharge permeability and baseflow is illustrated conceptually in fig 11 under high recharge conditions in high permeability terranes groundwater can flow the length and depth of the permeable deposits producing large volumes of baseflow fig 11a conversely under high recharge conditions in low permeability terranes some groundwater flow paths are shorter resulting in groundwater discharge near the recharge areas which decreases the available water and results in moderate baseflow at downstream gaged locations fig 11b under low recharge conditions in low permeability terranes groundwater flow paths are long and available water is limited resulting in lower baseflow and possibly non perennial streamflow in some locations fig 11c even in low permeability terranes a small fraction of groundwater flow may travel great distances depending on connectivity in the deepsubsurface and when recharge rates do not exceed the capacity of the aquifer to transmit groundwater flow over long distances a large proportion of streamflow will be from baseflow even though the aquifer system may not be highly productive locations with high recharge rates underlain by young permeable volcanic terranes have extremely fast groundwater travel times and for this reason the temperature and rates of groundwater discharge are vulnerable to short and long term changes in climate recent isotope studies in northeastern california davisson 2017 documented groundwater residence times of less than 30 years during a recent extended period of drought groundwater discharge decreased volumetrically by 20 50 but there were no long term changes observed over the past 100 years indicating the long term resiliency of groundwater discharge davisson 2017 however a recent study on the thermal effects of climate change on groundwater temperatures in northeastern california burns et al 2017b indicates that shifts in groundwater temperatures could occur under warmer climate conditions and would likely lag about 20 to 60 years behind the shifts in recharge temperatures under future climates increases in surface and groundwater temperatures declines in groundwater and snowmelt discharge and the resultant declines in cold water habitat may be amplified across the nvasa baseflow represents the largest component of the regional water supply that supports a wide spectrum of cold water habitat and biota in this unique groundwater dependent ecosystem we have hypothesized that patterns of hydrologic response across the nvasa are strongly influenced by the type and rates of precipitation and permeability differences related to the age and composition of the underlying geology we further suggest that sub regional differences in hydrologic response have important ecosystem implications groundwater produced by diffuse seepage through the streambed or from discrete spring locations is critically important for maintaining instream flows and cold water habitat torgersen et al 2012 the discharge of cold groundwater mitigates thermal loading from incoming solar radiation supports increased ecosystem productivity and maintains thermal refugia during the low flow season and periods of extended drought understanding and mitigating the effects of thermal loading on stream temperatures is a national water quality objective usepa 2003 because it can be a limiting factor for cold water biota this study provides estimates of baseflow the primary source of cold water for mitigating thermal loading and maintaining cold water habitat with projected declines in snowpack under warmer climates mote et al 2018 groundwater discharge across the nvasa may provide a greater proportion of total streamflow under future climatic conditions 4 conclusions the permeable volcanic terranes of the nvasa have strongly coupled surface groundwater systems and rapid groundwater response times that produce copious amounts of baseflow stream hydrographs have slower recession rates than other less permeable landscapes consequently hydrograph separation methods that use a recession criteria e g part assign greater amounts of streamflow to the baseflow component whereas methods that use a minimum flow criteria e g bfi standard assign only the slowest flow to baseflow we further hypothesize that the bfi standard method is more robust for filtering out snowmelt bias and therefore provides the most accurate estimate of groundwater discharge in permeable volcanic terrains with rapid groundwater response times it is well known that the nature and thickness of the vadose zone plays an important role in controlling surface groundwater interactions but interflow released from shallow subsurface sources is difficult to measure directly and virtually impossible at regional scales when conservative estimates of runoff and baseflow are subtracted from total streamflow the remainder provides a first order estimate of interflow the proposed three component metric is predicated on automated hydrograph separation methods which are heuristic and inherently subjective but useful for gaining a fundamental and conceptual understanding of hydrologic response at basin to regional scales integrated modeling approaches huntington and niswonger 2012 carroll et al 2019 and chemical hydrograph methods miller et al 2014 miller et al 2015 represent important areas of research that could be used to test the proposed new three component metric for estimating hydrologic response our results suggest that interflow discharged from the shallow subsurface may be limited but the nvasa s groundwater storage capacity is large and baseflow represents a climate resilient component of streamflow that provides critical cold water habitat from the perspective of water resource management and ecohydrology the timing of hydrologic response is critically important non stationarity and the potential for novel conditions under future climates call for continued

by highly heterogenous volcanic terranes sherrod and keith 2018 with strongly coupled surface water and groundwater systems burns et al 2017a there is considerable dependence on groundwater for irrigation public water supply hydro and geothermal power production and ecosystem services a fundamental understanding of the nvasa s regional hydrology and sub regional differences is a critical knowledge needed to guide sustainable water resource management in this relatively dry and understudied region of the northwestern united states two recent climate assessments vose et al 2014 mote et al 2018 further highlight the need for a better understanding of hydrologic response across the nvasa although the mean annual precipitation from 1980 to 2015 61 1 cm yr was close to the long term mean 60 5 cm yr precipitation anomalies fig 2 for a western region of the united states that includes the nvasa indicate an increase in the magnitude frequency and duration of precipitation extremes since 1980 vose et al 2014 snowmelt discharge is an important process for generating surface and subsurface flow in the mountainous regions of the nvasa a recent assessment of western snowpack mote et al 2018 found that 90 of long term snow monitoring sites showed declines in snowpack and 33 of these sites had declines with significant trends a regional hydrograph analysis under historic climates for the nvasa will provide an understanding of how changes in precipitation under historic climates influence hydrologic response a stream hydrograph represents the net balance of water discharged from a surface water basin there are numerous automated methods for hydrographseparation that partition streamflow into two or more subcomponents which can be assigned to surface e g fast flow or subsurface e g slow flow sources of water although heuristic these methods provide consistent results that are particularly useful for gaining a fundamental understanding of regional hydrology when hydrologic data are spatially and temporally sparse established hydrograph separation methods have been extensively reviewed and evaluated and can be classified into two broad categories chemical methods and hydrological methods hall 1968 nathan and mcmahon 1990 tallaksen 1995 smakhtin 2001 brodie and hostetler 2005 schwartz 2007 eckhardt 2008 partington et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 foks et al 2019 chemical methods hooper and shoemaker 1986 miller et al 2014 hugenschmidt et al 2014 use tracers e g stable isotopes major ions or specific conductance to characterize the unique chemical signatures of surface and subsurface sources of water however application of chemical methods at regional scales is typically limited by data availability in comparison hydrological methods use readily available streamflow records making these methods quite useful for a regional analysis of hydrologic response the hydrograph separation methods used in this study bfi wahl and wahl 1995 hysep fixed interval hysep sliding interval hysep local minimum sloto and crouse 1996 part rutledge 1998 can be divided into two subtypes those that assume surface and subsurface water respond to storm events concurrently and those that address the effects of storage and assume discharge from subsurface sources continues after surface runoff begins nathan and mcmahon 1990 the net result of these underlying assumptions is that they alternately maximize the quantity of streamflow that is assigned to either direct runoff or baseflow a regional analysis was undertaken using six hydrograph separation methods available in the usgs groundwater toolbox v2 0 gwtoolbox barlow et al 2015 variability in the results from the six methods motivated the development of a new three component metric for hydrograph analysis the new metric separates streamflow into three components defined by timescales of hydrologic response fast runoff intermediate interflow and slow baseflow the proposed metric is useful for gaining a broad understanding of the range and variability of hydrologic response at regional scales and for calibrating regional water balance models which are highly sensitive to the methods used to separate the subcomponents of streamflow flint et al 2013 because ecological response is closely linked to hydrologic response this new metric also provides a useful ecohydrology tool for analyzing instream flows and associated ecosystem benefits poff et al 1997 carlisle et al 2017 groundwater discharge in particular is closely linked to the distribution of cold water habitat boulton and hancock 2006 nichols et al 2014 torgersen et al 2012 cantonati et al 2012 and plays a critical role in sustaining a wide spectrum of instream biota during the low flow season and prolonged periods of drought a growing body of freshwater ecology studies indicate that surface groundwater exchange not only enriches ecosystem productivity jones et al 1995 pepin and hauer 2002 brown et al 2004 wyatt et al 2008 but also directly influences fish growth and prey resources wissmar et al 1997 power et al 1999 mejia et al 2016 the primary objectives of this study were to gain a fundamental understanding of regional hydrology across the nvasa by evaluating spatial patterns of hydrologic response sub regional differences and influencing factors and to assess ecohydrological implications with particular attention to baseflow a secondary objective was to evaluate the utility of automated hydrograph separation methods for investigating hydrologic response in permeable volcanic terranes 2 methods streamflow datasets for 312 surface water basins fig 1 were analyzed using six hydrograph separation methods available in the gwtoolbox v2 0 barlow et al 2015 a subset of 172 minimally impaired basins was selected and used to evaluate the utility of the six methods for assessing hydrologic response in volcanic terranes two methods were selected to define a new three component metric to evaluate the influence of physiography climate and geology on spatial patterns of hydrologic response and the ecohydrological implications 2 1 study area the nvasa fig 1 which is approximately 192 000 km2 has eight distinct physiographic subregions classified by fenneman and johnson 1946 on the basis of terrane texture rock type and geologic structure and history the subregions include the harney basin located in the geographic center of the study area the walla walla plateau and blue mountain anticline of oregon which constrain the northern boundary the eastern flank of the middle and southern cascade range of oregon and california constrain the western boundary the sierra nevada and basin and range of california and nevada constrain the southern boundary and the snake river plain of southwestern idaho constrains the eastern boundary there is a strong west to east precipitation gradient created by the orographic influence of the cascaderange and sierra nevada fig 1 annual precipitation in the cascade range can exceed 250 centimeters and in the semi arid regions of the high deserts in eastern oregon annual precipitation is commonly less than 25 centimeters snowmelt is an important process for generating streamflow particularly in basins located at higher elevations approximately 70 of the mean annual precipitation 60 5 cm yr falls as rain and 30 as snow thornton et al 2015 the nvasa part of the larger northwestern volcanic province nvp includes four additional important aquifer systems that have been previously studied columbia plateau regional aquifer system e g vaccaro 1986 snake river plain aquifer system e g lindholm 1996 upper deschutes basin aquifer system e g gannett et al 2001 and the upper klamath basin aquifer system e g gannett et al 2007 the study area boundary used to select the gaged basins for the regional hydrograph analysis was delineated on the basis of similar underlying geology and includes the nvasa the upper deschutes basin aquifer system and the upper klamath basin aquifer system the nvasa generally coincides with the pacific northwest basaltic rock aquifers and the pacific northwest basin fill aquifers defined by reilly et al 2008 the term basaltic rock aquifers is a bit of a misnomer because nvasa s volcanic aquifers are highly variable in composition spanning the entire silicic range from basalt to rhyolite sherrod and keith 2018 the basin fill aquifers generally composed of sediments derived from the surrounding volcanic uplands are hydrologically connected to the volcanic uplands suggesting that the rock and alluvial aquifers function as a single hydrogeologic system this system of volcanic and alluvial aquifers transmits substantial flow through primary e g conduit flow and secondary permeability features e g fractures and faults resulting in rapid groundwater response times for example studies of medicine lake volcano and the fall river springs system located in the southern cascade range of california fig 1 indicate groundwater residence times of less than 30 years for saturated flow paths that exceed 50 km rose et al 1996 davisson and rose 2014 davisson 2017 the production of copious amounts of relatively young groundwater across the nvasa sustains perennial stream flow and represents the most important source of water in this groundwater dependent ecosystem howard and merrifield 2010 brown et al 2011 although large cold water springs are common meinzer 1927 the spatial distribution of cold springs is not uniform burns et al 2017a and this suggests that there are important sub regional differences that control the spatial patterns of hydrologic response 2 2 compilation of available streamflow data the nvasa is sparsely populated and likewise hydrologic data are spatially and temporally sparse the longest and most complete hydrologic datasets are usgs streamflow measurements which are publicly available from the usgs national water information system nwis https waterdata usgs gov nwis a total of 6 995 annual hydrographs with variable periods of record spanning 1906 to 2015 measured at 312 stream gages fig 1 were analyzed using six hydrograph separation methods available in the gwtoolbox v2 0 barlow et al 2015 station descriptions detailed metadata and mean annual results for the 312 gaged basins fig 1 were compiled and published separately as a usgs data release curtis 2019 a hydrologic disturbance index hdi table 1 developed specifically for this study was used to select a subset of gaged basins with minimal anthropogenic disturbance fig 3 this is a critical step because anthropogenic disturbance i e impairment such as land use flow regulation and flow diversions create hydrograph variations and systematic biases in stream hydrographs that are unrelated to natural hydrologic processes each gaged basin was assigned to an hdi class using integer values from 0 to 7 table 1 the hdi classes include one unimpaired class 0 two unregulated classes with no known diversions 1 2 one unregulated class with known diversions 3 three regulated classes 4 5 6 and a class to denote the presence of large natural lakes 7 that may result in a natural reservoir effect that dampens downstream hydrographs the minimally impaired basins selected for the hydrologic response analysis had an hdi of 0 1 or 2 although the stream flow gaging record spans 1906 to 2015 the number of minimally impaired gages in operation increased steadily peaked in 1967 and has since declined fig 4 see curtis 2019 for additional details on the datasets used in this study 2 3 automated hydrograph separation using the gwtoolbox v2 0 the hydrograph separation methods used to partition mean daily streamflow datasets into fast flow and slow flow subcomponents assume that fast flow represents direct runoff discharged during a precipitation event whereas the slow flow represents baseflow an important caveat of these methods is that hydrological processes are not explicitly simulated instead the methods rely upon empirical parameters that use characteristic hydrologic response times to assign streamflow to the fast and slow components although direct runoff occurs on the timescale of minutes to days extended storms and instream travel times often delay the streamflow response measured at downstream gages in contrast aquifers commonly respond hydraulically on timescales ranging from days to several decades by releasing water from subsurface storage consequently the underlying assumptions of these methods are strongly tied to hydrologic response times this implicitly results in the methods assigning different values to the fast and slow components of streamflow evaluating the utility of the methods for interpreting hydrologic response is somewhat subjective because hydrologic processes operate on a continuum of timescales and streamflow cannot be uniquely separated into two components e g fast and slow representing only two processes e g direct runoff and groundwater discharge for example intermediate timescale processes such as interflow and snowmelt must be systematically assigned to either the fast or slow component of streamflow to partially mitigate this problem a novel approach was formulated to partition streamflow into three components using the results from two hydrograph separation methods this new three component metric for hydrograph analysis allows streamflow to be divided into fast runoff intermediate interflow and slow baseflow snowmelt discharge cannot be separated from the other components of streamflow using this metric and was not addressed in this study the gwtoolbox v2 0 was used to perform the hydrograph analysis because it provides an objective and efficient tool to retrieve inspect and analyze daily streamflow datasets for large regional studies the analyses can be run simultaneously for a batch of gaging stations with variable periods of record and the results are automatically exported into daily monthly and calendar year formats a python script was written to post process and aggregate the daily values into mean annual values by water year october 1 to september 30 this study used six of the eight methods currently available in the gwtoolbox v2 0 the methods include two variations of the base flow index method bfi standard and bfi modified wahl and wahl 1995 three variations of the hydrograph separation and analysis program hysep fixed interval hysep sliding interval hysep local minimum sloto and crouse 1996 and the streamflow partitioning program part rutledge 1998 the bfi methods are the only methods with adjustable parameters however for this study the default values were used the gwtoolbox now includes two digital filtering methods developed by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and eckhardt 2005 that were unavailable at the initiation of this study the six methods used in this study separate fast flow from slow flow using linear interpolation but the criteria for identifying values to be used in the interpolation vary and for this reason the methods provide a range of results when using the default parameters the bfi standard and bfi modified methods use a moving window to divide the calendar year into 5 day increments n 5 and a minimum flow is defined for each 5 day period the two methods differ in how the turning points used in the linear interpolation are identified the bfi standard method uses a turning point test factor f 0 9 which was replaced by a daily recession index k 0 979 in the bfi modified method using the default values if 90 of the minimum flow during the 5 day period is less than both adjacent minimum values then the bfi standard method defines that 5 day minimum as a turning point similarly if the daily recession rate during the 5 day window is 0 979 then the bfi modified defines that 5 day minimum as a turning point the hysep methods use a moving bar hysep fixed hysep sliding or local minimum hysep lomin defined as an inverse function of drainage area to define minimum values used for interpolation in comparison part uses a recession criterion to define the minimum values for interpolation and assumes baseflow is equal to daily streamflow unless there is a decline of 0 1 log cycle or more in the mean daily streamflow record once the minimum values are defined all six methods use linear interpolation to connect the minimum values and separate streamflow into the subcomponents the area below the minimum flow line is assigned to slow flow and the area above is assigned to fast flow detailed information regarding each method is provided in the relevant references we selected two periods of analysis for this study the period of record 1906 to 2015 was analyzed to assess long term behavior and a recent climate period 1980 to 2015 was analyzed to investigate the influence of non stationarity on the study results to assess sub regional differences in hydrologic response the annual means for all the gaged basins within each of the physiographic subregions were averaged regardless of the number of years of record ensuring equal weight among the gaged basins within each subregion large interannual variability in precipitation and streamflow is inherent in regions like the nvasa that are characterized by extremes fig 2 the interannual variability produces large uncertainties in the mean annual results standard errors of the mean a measure of the dispersion of the sample mean around the population mean was used to assess the accuracy of the results anduncertainty was assessed using the standard deviation a measure of the range or variation of the sample mean around the population mean 2 4 limitations and simplifying assumptions of hydrograph separation methods in our analysis we attempted to overcome some of the limitations and assumptions inherent to hydrograph separation by following recommendations suggested by barlow et al 2015 for example to mitigate for flow accumulation and travel time the contributing area for a gaged basin was constrained between 2 5 and 1300 km2 a minimum basin size of 2 5 km2 ensured that the duration of runoff exceeded the 1 day increment of the streamflow time series similarly because baseflow variability decreases with increasing basin size a maximum basin size of 1300 km2 was defined to mitigate for large basins that attenuate climate signals and homogenize differences in hydrologic response anthropogenic activities that influence the flow or storage of water within a basin can introduce systematic errors that bias the results for example reservoirs intercept and delay stormflow which is later released during the low flow season and commonly results in a systematic overestimation of baseflow similarly wastewater return flows and slow drainage from lakes wetlands or streambank storage may also result in the overestimation baseflow conversely water diversions may cause baseflow to be underestimated we mitigated these potential biases by using the subset of minimally impaired gage basins identified using the hydrologic disturbance index developed for this study curtis 2019 2 5 the influence of physiography climate and geology on hydrologic response the physiographic subregions of the nvasa are characterized by unique climatic and geologic histories we examined sub regional differences in hydrologic response and investigated the influence of physiography climate and geology by superimposing our results onto maps of mean annual precipitation and geologic age and composition the precipitation map was derived from 1 km gridded estimates of daily precipitation thornton et al 2015 and the geology map was extracted from a new compilation of thematic maps sherrod and keith 2018 snowmelt discharge is an important process for generating surface and subsurface flow across the nvasa using the method of barnhart et al 2016 the fraction of annual precipitation falling as snow was estimated for each 1 km grid cell thornton et al 2015 using the daily minimum and maximum temperatures allowing the computation of mean annual snow water equivalent for the period spanning 1980 2013 the resiliency of the hydrograph subcomponents to short term changes in precipitation was investigated by comparing results for a recent climatic period 1980 to 2015 to the period of record 1906 to 2015 this analysis was used to assess the influence of climatic variability on the study results we selected 1980 as the start of a recent climatic period with observed increases in precipitation anomalies fig 2 that followed a more stable climate period from 1950 to 1980 hansen et al 2012 from 1906 to 2015 there were 172 minimallyimpaired basins with streamflow records and 79 of these basins had streamflow records that span 1980 to 2015 fig 3 3 results and discussion the six hydrograph separation methods used in this study are intrinsically heuristic schwartz 2007 and have even been referred to as dubious halford and mayer 2000 despite these inherent limitations hydrograph separation remains a valuable tool for regional hydrologic assessments when working at regional scales with sparse data first order methods such as hydrograph separation continue to be a useful tool for conceptualizing the relative magnitude of hydrologic processes and estimating the subcomponents of a water budget the six methods used in this study have different underlying assumptions that alternately maximize the quantity of streamflow assigned to runoff or baseflow partington et al 2012 evaluated ten variations of common hydrograph separation methods against results simulated using a physically based surface groundwater flow model and found the methods underestimated baseflow by as much as 28 or overestimated by as much as 74 during rainfall events a recent study by schwartz and smith 2014 found that no single hydrograph separation method gave consistently superior results and the choice of method made no significant difference in the study results our results indicate the choice of method strongly influences the results we highlight this as an important distinction among the methods that motivated the development of a new three component metric the new metric is predicated and capitalizes on the differences in the underlying assumptions of methods that alternately maximum the runoff or baseflow subcomponents to demonstrate the differences among the methods an example hydrograph analysis is presented for a single gaged basin in fig 5 the part method provides the most conservative estimate of runoff 28 9 of total streamflow and the bfi methods provide the most conservative estimate of baseflow 39 4 of total streamflow subtracting estimates of runoff and baseflow from total streamflow provides an estimate of interflow 31 7 of total streamflow 3 1 regional hydrograph analysis results from the regional analysis are presented as mean annual water yield per unit drainage area cm yr and discussion of the regional results is focused on baseflow because it represents the largest subcomponent of streamflow the proportion of total streamflow contributed by baseflow commonly referred to as a baseflow index is used to assess sub regional differences in the baseflow results summary statistics describing the regional hydrograph analysis are presented for the period of record 1906 to 2015 table 2 a and the recent climatic period 1980 to 2015 table 2b during both of the analysis periods the standard error of the means was small 2 to 3 indicating the mean values are reliable for interpreting regional hydrologic response and sub regional differences conversely the standard deviations for both periods were high indicating large variability among the annual means which translates to large uncertainty for the period of record uncertainty was greater than the means for total streamflow as well as the runoff and baseflow subcomponents table 2a for the recent climate period uncertainty was less than the means for total streamflow and baseflow but greater than the mean for the runoff component table 2b for the period of record mean annual baseflow estimated using part hysep fixed hysep sliding and hysep locmin were similar and ranged from 37 1 to 39 0 cm yr table 2a in comparison mean annual baseflow estimated using the bfi standard and bfi modified was 13 lower than the other methods and ranged from 33 3 to 33 4 cm yr table 2a for the recent climatic period mean annual baseflow estimated using the part hysep fixed hysep sliding and hysep locmin were similar and ranged from 31 5 to 33 3 cm yr table 2b and the standard error was slightly higher 3 due to a decline in the number of gaged basins and years of gage data fig 4 in comparison mean annual baseflow estimated using the bfi standard and bfi modified was 12 less than the other methods and ranged from 28 4 to 28 7 cm yr table 2b minimum flow methods rather than recession methods are preferred for assessing baseflow in permeable terranes with significant snowmelt although snowmelt discharge was not directly assessed in this study we hypothesize that because minimum flow methods produce conservative estimates of baseflow they are also more robust for filtering out snowmelt bias snowmelt discharge released over intermediate timescales does not produce peaks that can be used as turning points in the stream hydrograph analysis for this reason snowmelt tends to be assigned to baseflow rather than being parsed out between runoff and baseflow in perennial streams within the nvasa baseflow contributes 75 of the total streamflow table 2 this regionalized estimate integrates the results from 172 gaged basins underlain by volcanic rock aquifers non volcanic rock aquifers and basin fill aquifers similarly eckhardt 2005 suggested baseflow generally contributes about 80 of the streamflow in perennial streams with porous aquifers our estimates of baseflow contributions in the middle cascade range 92 were similar to recent estimates published for the volcanic terranes of the middle cascade range oregon jefferson et al 2010 and the rio grande de san miguel el salvador wozab and jovel 1970 jefferson et al 2010 measured streamflow in six ungaged basins and used analogous hydrograph separation methods to estimate baseflow contributions three of the basins had flashy hydrographs with baseflow contributing less than 85 of the streamflow three of the basins were spring fed with baseflow contributing greater than 95 of the streamflow in comparison wozab and jovel 1970 related declines in groundwater levels to streamflow during dry periods when streamflow is solely sustained by groundwater they used a groundwater discharge rating curve to compute daily groundwater discharge and their results suggest that streamflow was composed of 86 groundwater 3 2 a new metric for assessing hydrologic response a gaged basin can be conceptualized as a series of interconnected reservoirs that store and release water over fast intermediate and slow timescales fig 6 hydrologic response in a gaged basin will vary with travel time as precipitation is converted into streamflow and conveyed downstream to a gaged location where it is measured generally a two component hydrograph analysis assigns water with the fastest travel time minutes to days to the runoff component and water with the slowest travel time weeks to decades to the baseflow component in contrast interflow is released from the shallow subsurface over a range of intermediate timescales days to months and cannot be explicitly captured by a two component analysis arguably interflow should not be explicitly lumped with either the fast or slow components of streamflow this interflow problem is inherent to a two component hydrograph analysis but can be resolved using a new three component metric as follows by combining the results from two hydrograph separation methods the first of which systematically assigns a smaller amount of water to direct runoff i e only the fastest water and the second of which systematically assigns a smaller amount to baseflow i e only the slowest water a third component can be defined this third component the intermediate timescale water is the remainder when the conservative estimates of runoff and baseflow are subtracted from total streamflow in very rare instances the remainder is negative but this has a minor effect on mean annual estimates of runoff interflow and baseflow an example annual hydrograph for usgs stream gage 11381500 fig 7 illustrates hydrograph separation using the new three component metric the bfi standard method preferentially assigns more flow to the runoff component and provides a conservative estimate of the slow water component grey area fig 6 the part method preferentially assigns more flow to the baseflow component and provides a conservative estimate of the fast water component blue area fig 6 subtracting the conservative runoff and baseflow estimates from total streamflow yields a remainder which provides an estimate of intermediate timescale water or interflow orange area fig 6 this novel approach overcomes the problem of assigning interflow to the fast or slow component and allows streamflow to be partitioned into three components 3 3 spatial patterns of hydrologic response the relative proportions of the three components of hydrologic response are summarized for the nvasa and seven of the eight physiographic subregions in fig 8 and table 3 the harney basin was not included in this analysis because the gaged basins did not meet our criteria for basin size and minimal impairment our results show that hydrologic response is spatially variable indicating fundamental sub regional differences across the nvasa baseflow represents the largest proportion 75 of total streamflow and the proportions of runoff 12 and interflow 13 were similar table 3 the sierra nevada produces the largest total streamflow followed by the middle cascade range the southern cascade range and the blue mountains these wetter subregions also have higher baseflow indexes the middle cascade range has the highest baseflow index 91 with runoff and interflow producing only 9 of the streamflow in comparison the baseflow indexes for the southern cascade range 75 sierra nevada 72 and the blue mountains 71 were smaller but similar the baseflow indexes for the drier subregions which includes the basin and range snake river and walla walla plateau were all 65 3 3 1 the influence of physiography climate and geology the nvasa s large precipitation gradient fig 9 a and highly heterogenous geology fig 9b strongly influence sub regional differences in hydrologic response when precipitation infiltrates the subsurface water storage increases and interflow and groundwater recharge occur huntington and niswonger 2012 carroll et al 2019 when the storage capacity of the vadose zone is exceeded or if rainfall or snowmelt rates exceed infiltration rates then runoff and interflow occur the rates of infiltration and recharge are influenced by the type and rate of precipitation and the permeability of the underlying geology consequently there must be sub regional differences in hydrologic response for regions with similar precipitation unless the geology and aquifer conditions are also the same baseflow indexes estimated for the period of record are shown superimposed upon maps of mean annual precipitation fig 9a and a thematic interpretation of the age and composition of the underlying geology fig 9b these maps show that wetter subregions have highly variable baseflow indexes likely related to permeability differences in the underlying geology generally wetter subregions mc and sc table 3 underlain by younger volcanic terranes also have gaged basins with higher baseflow indexes in comparison wetter subregions underlain by older non volcanic terranes sn and bm table 3 have gaged basins with lower baseflow indexes variability in baseflow among the wetter subregions is indicative of differences in subsurface flow that strongly influence hydrologic response subsurface flow is likely greater through the younger and more permeable volcanic rock aquifers in comparison the drier subregions are underlain by older non volcanic terranes and alluvial aquifers and the gaged basins have baseflow indexes that are lower and less variable wp br and sr table 3 the low baseflow indexes in drier regions suggest that deeper recharge into basin fill aquifers may be occurring in this case water may be lost to the regional groundwater system resulting in a smaller fraction of available water that emerges as baseflow young volcanic terranes are postulated to be the most permeable rocks within the nvasa and older volcanic terranes are assumed to be less permeable because over time pore filling minerals are hydrothermally altered to clays which decreases the primary permeability gannett et al 2001 gannett et al 2007 burns et al 2017a higher permeability in the young volcanic terranes results in relatively low runoff production that is balanced by high transmissivity and lateral flow in the shallow subsurface in these young volcanic terranes copious amounts of subsurface flow emerge over intermediate timescales as interflow and longer timescales as baseflow the exceptions to this generalization e g small circles in young volcanic terranes fig 9a occur where the available water recharges the regional groundwater system resulting in smaller baseflow generally the non volcanic and older volcanic terranes have lower primary permeability and uniformly lower baseflow the exceptions to this generalization e g larger circles in non volcanic or older volcanic terranes fig 9b occur where quaternary faults increase secondary permeability acting as conduits for lateral subsurface flow that emerges at the surface increasing baseflow in these regions 3 3 2 resiliency to climate variability and ecohydrology implications a detailed climate change analysis is beyond the scope of the current study but we assessed the resiliency of the three components of hydrologic response to short term changes in precipitation this allowed us to address the influence of climate variability and non stationarity on hydrologic response albeit in a cursory way the three components of hydrologic response estimated for the period of record 1906 to 2015 were compared to estimates for two recent dry periods 1976 77 and 1991 92 and two recent wet periods 1982 83 and 1997 98 fig 10 during the dry periods declines in interflow 61 were greater than declines in runoff 50 and baseflow was the most resilient 10 to short term changes in precipitation during the wet periods increases in interflow 8 were much smaller than increases in baseflow 57 and runoff 107 interflow was the least resilient declining by 61 during the dry periods and increasing by only 8 during the wetter periods suggesting that shallow subsurface storage in the vadose zone may be limited the relatively large increases in runoff and baseflow during the wetter periods includes an unknown amount of snowmelt discharge which was not addressed in this study the relation between recharge permeability and baseflow is illustrated conceptually in fig 11 under high recharge conditions in high permeability terranes groundwater can flow the length and depth of the permeable deposits producing large volumes of baseflow fig 11a conversely under high recharge conditions in low permeability terranes some groundwater flow paths are shorter resulting in groundwater discharge near the recharge areas which decreases the available water and results in moderate baseflow at downstream gaged locations fig 11b under low recharge conditions in low permeability terranes groundwater flow paths are long and available water is limited resulting in lower baseflow and possibly non perennial streamflow in some locations fig 11c even in low permeability terranes a small fraction of groundwater flow may travel great distances depending on connectivity in the deepsubsurface and when recharge rates do not exceed the capacity of the aquifer to transmit groundwater flow over long distances a large proportion of streamflow will be from baseflow even though the aquifer system may not be highly productive locations with high recharge rates underlain by young permeable volcanic terranes have extremely fast groundwater travel times and for this reason the temperature and rates of groundwater discharge are vulnerable to short and long term changes in climate recent isotope studies in northeastern california davisson 2017 documented groundwater residence times of less than 30 years during a recent extended period of drought groundwater discharge decreased volumetrically by 20 50 but there were no long term changes observed over the past 100 years indicating the long term resiliency of groundwater discharge davisson 2017 however a recent study on the thermal effects of climate change on groundwater temperatures in northeastern california burns et al 2017b indicates that shifts in groundwater temperatures could occur under warmer climate conditions and would likely lag about 20 to 60 years behind the shifts in recharge temperatures under future climates increases in surface and groundwater temperatures declines in groundwater and snowmelt discharge and the resultant declines in cold water habitat may be amplified across the nvasa baseflow represents the largest component of the regional water supply that supports a wide spectrum of cold water habitat and biota in this unique groundwater dependent ecosystem we have hypothesized that patterns of hydrologic response across the nvasa are strongly influenced by the type and rates of precipitation and permeability differences related to the age and composition of the underlying geology we further suggest that sub regional differences in hydrologic response have important ecosystem implications groundwater produced by diffuse seepage through the streambed or from discrete spring locations is critically important for maintaining instream flows and cold water habitat torgersen et al 2012 the discharge of cold groundwater mitigates thermal loading from incoming solar radiation supports increased ecosystem productivity and maintains thermal refugia during the low flow season and periods of extended drought understanding and mitigating the effects of thermal loading on stream temperatures is a national water quality objective usepa 2003 because it can be a limiting factor for cold water biota this study provides estimates of baseflow the primary source of cold water for mitigating thermal loading and maintaining cold water habitat with projected declines in snowpack under warmer climates mote et al 2018 groundwater discharge across the nvasa may provide a greater proportion of total streamflow under future climatic conditions 4 conclusions the permeable volcanic terranes of the nvasa have strongly coupled surface groundwater systems and rapid groundwater response times that produce copious amounts of baseflow stream hydrographs have slower recession rates than other less permeable landscapes consequently hydrograph separation methods that use a recession criteria e g part assign greater amounts of streamflow to the baseflow component whereas methods that use a minimum flow criteria e g bfi standard assign only the slowest flow to baseflow we further hypothesize that the bfi standard method is more robust for filtering out snowmelt bias and therefore provides the most accurate estimate of groundwater discharge in permeable volcanic terrains with rapid groundwater response times it is well known that the nature and thickness of the vadose zone plays an important role in controlling surface groundwater interactions but interflow released from shallow subsurface sources is difficult to measure directly and virtually impossible at regional scales when conservative estimates of runoff and baseflow are subtracted from total streamflow the remainder provides a first order estimate of interflow the proposed three component metric is predicated on automated hydrograph separation methods which are heuristic and inherently subjective but useful for gaining a fundamental and conceptual understanding of hydrologic response at basin to regional scales integrated modeling approaches huntington and niswonger 2012 carroll et al 2019 and chemical hydrograph methods miller et al 2014 miller et al 2015 represent important areas of research that could be used to test the proposed new three component metric for estimating hydrologic response our results suggest that interflow discharged from the shallow subsurface may be limited but the nvasa s groundwater storage capacity is large and baseflow represents a climate resilient component of streamflow that provides critical cold water habitat from the perspective of water resource management and ecohydrology the timing of hydrologic response is critically important non stationarity and the potential for novel conditions under future climates call for continued
