16660,in municipal wastewater treatment plants some dissolved methane can enter the aerobic bioreactors this greenhouse gas originates from sewers and return flows from anaerobic sludge treatment in well mixed conventional activated sludge reactors methane emissions are largely avoided because methane oxidizing bacteria consume a large fraction even without optimizing for this purpose in this work the fate of dissolved methane is studied in aerobic granular sludge reactors as they become increasingly popular the influence of the characteristic design and operating conditions of these reactors are studied with a mathematical model with apparent conversion kinetics and stripping the separation of feeding and aeration in time a higher substrate transport resistance a high retention time of granular biomass and a taller water column even for a best case scenario combining an unrealistically low intragranule substrate transport resistance a high retention time a tall reactor an extremely high influent methane concentration and no oxygen limitation the methane conversion efficiency was only 12 when feeding and aeration were separated in time which is lower than for continuous activated sludge reactors under typical conditions a more rigorous model was used to confirm the limited conversion considering the multi species and multi substrate biofilm kinetics anoxic methane consumers and the high substrate concentration at the bottom during upward plug flow feeding the observed limited methane conversion is mainly due to the high concentration that accumulates during unaerated feeding phases which favours stripping more than conversion in the subsequent aeration phase based on these findings strategies were proposed to mitigate methane emissions from wastewater treatment plants with sequentially operated reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane oxidizing bacteria greenhouse gas wastewater treatment sequencing batch reactor emission aerobic granular sludge 1 introduction methane ch4 emissions may account for 0 to 40 of the total carbon footprint of conventional aerobic municipal wastewater treatment plants but the exact value and hot spots depend on the design and operation of a specific plant and sewer system foley et al 2011 masuda et al 2018 methane is produced during anaerobic conversions of organic material this mainly occurs in sewers and sludge digesters but can also take place in sludge thickeners and primary settlers daelman et al 2012 masuda et al 2015 the average dissolved methane concentration in the influent ranges from 2 to 61 g cod m 3 liu et al 2015 depending on the residence time geometry and type of sewers and on the wastewater characteristics and temperature foley et al 2009 short et al 2017 terryn et al 2017 dissolved methane can be stripped from several unit processes in a treatment plant the headworks are a first source of emissions accounting for 0 to 50 of the plant wide emissions the fraction that is stripped here increases if there is intense contact with air e g when screw conveyors or aerated grit chambers are used daelman et al 2012 foley et al 2011 kwok et al 2015 liu et al 2014 masuda et al 2018 ren et al 2013 samuelsson et al 2018 wang et al 2011 when present primary settlers can also be a major emission source with values ranging from less than 1 to 68 of the plant wide emissions daelman et al 2012 liu et al 2014 masuda et al 2018 ren et al 2013 the residual dissolved methane that reaches the bioreactors is nearly completely removed here via stripping on the one hand and biological conversion oxidation on the other hand also the contribution of this unit process to the plant wide methane emissions varies over a wide range between 3 and 80 daelman et al 2012 kwok et al 2015 wang et al 2011 biological methane oxidation has been shown to remove 68 80 of the methane that enters continuous activated sludge reactors daelman et al 2012 liu et al 2014 methane emissions from a plant increase drastically if sludge is anaerobically digested methane can escape from the digesters directly during sludge dewatering and storage and due to the incomplete combustion of biogas which has been reported to sum up to 72 81 of the plant wide emissions daelman et al 2012 delre et al 2017 foley et al 2011 kwok et al 2015 samuelsson et al 2018 yoshida et al 2014 moreover the reject water contains dissolved methane which often enters the main treatment process again where it can be emitted as mentioned above daelman et al 2012 ribera guardia et al 2019 literature thus clearly shows an immense variation of both the load and fate of methane between different plants the potential hot spots of methane input production emissions and conversion in wastewater treatment plants discussed in this section are summarized in fig 1 the amount of methane oxidized in an activated sludge reactor depends on the design and operation for example there is an optimal aeration rate for methane oxidation which is high enough to avoid oxygen limitations of the conversion but low enough to avoid excessive stripping deeper diffusers also slightly improve conversions as the hydraulic pressure improves the solubility of gases and therefore hinders methane stripping while stimulating oxygen transfer finally a continuously stirred tank reactor shows more conversion than a plug flow type reactor because mixing dilutes the incoming methane which decreases the stripping rate more than it decreases the conversion rate daelman et al 2014 notwithstanding these influencing factors aerobic bioreactors are rarely or never optimized for methane conversion in municipal wastewater treatment plants as cod and nutrient removal are the primary goals yet even without optimization measurements in continuous aerobic systems have always shown methane conversion efficiencies above 68 daelman et al 2012 liu et al 2014 besides simulations under various conditions have consistently shown values above 21 except when influent methane concentrations are below 5 g cod m 3 daelman et al 2014 this may give the impression that in cases where the influent methane concentration is high aerobic methane conversion can always be relied on to mitigate the associated potential extra greenhouse gas emissions however it is not yet sure whether high methane conversion efficiencies are as easily achieved in sequentially operated reactors without aeration during the feeding phases sequential operation with unaerated feeding phases is becoming increasingly popular under the form of aerobic granular sludge reactors which have lower space and energy requirements than conventional activated sludge systems pronk et al 2017 the fate of methane in aerobic granular sludge reactors has not yet been investigated in these reactors feeding and discharge are separated in time from aeration biomass is present in larger and denser aggregates than in conventional activated sludge reactors pronk et al 2017 granules have a higher resistance for substrate transport towards the microorganisms leading to lower specific conversion rates at low limiting substrate concentrations baeten et al 2018 at the same time they have a higher solids retention time due to their excellent settleability ali et al 2019 winkler et al 2012 moreover aerobic granular sludge reactors are typically taller 6 9 m than conventional activated sludge reactors to enable feeding from the bottom while discharging effluent from the top via an upward plug flow de bruin et al 2013 these characteristic design and operating conditions could influence the fate of methane entering these reactors in different ways from earlier work one can deduce that the higher mass transport resistance may limit conversion baeten et al 2018 the discontinuous feeding may promote stripping mozo et al 2012 the higher solids retention time may promote conversion henze et al 2008 and the taller reactor height may limit stripping daelman et al 2014 yet the magnitude of these effects for the typical design and operating conditions of aerobic granular sludge reactors and their combined effect remain difficult to predict as the fate of methane could be altered these reactor types may also require different strategies to minimize emissions this work investigates for the first time the fate of dissolved methane entering sequentially operated reactors with unaerated feeding phases in general and aerobic granular sludge reactors in particular first a simple mass balance model for the fate of methane and methane oxidizing bacteria mob was set up and used to separately investigate the effects of separating feeding and aeration in time i e sequential versus continuous reactor operation more intragranule transport resistance higher solids retention times and increased reactor heights a more rigorous model was then developed to confirm the results for the best case scenario considering the multi species and multi substrate biofilm kinetics presence of anoxic methane oxidizers and the high substrate concentration at the bottom during the upward plug flow during feeding 2 methodology 2 1 influence of design and operating conditions a mathematical model was set up to study how the methane conversion efficiency is affected by sequential feeding and aeration a higher intragranule substrate transport resistance a higher solids retention time and taller reactors first a general mass balance was set up for methane 2 1 1 and methane oxidizing bacteria 2 1 2 then the simulated scenarios were defined for a sequentially 2 1 3 and continuously operated reactor 2 1 4 to investigate the effect of separating feeding and aeration in time the other design and operating

reactor in the best case scenario it considered the multi species and multi substrate biofilm kinetics anoxic methane consumers and higher substrate concentrations in the granule bed during upward plug flow during feeding which were neglected in the simple model described above a summary is given here while details on the implementation and parameter values are provided in supplementary information section s2 and aquasim file 2 2 1 biological conversions not only aerobic methane consumption by methane oxidizing bacteria mob but also anoxic consumption by denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea damoa and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria damob were described with stoichiometry and kinetics from literature arcangeli and arvin 1999 chen et al 2014 lopes et al 2011 for the half saturation coefficients for methane the value from the best case scenario 0 04 g cod m 3 was applied for all methane oxidizing groups which is 147 times smaller than reported for damoa and damob chen et al 2014 monod and inhibition terms for oxygen were included here in contrast to the simplified approach used before eq 2 to account for the competition for oxygen with other microbial groups the conversions catalysed by ordinary heterotrophic organisms phosphate accumulating organisms ammonium oxidizing organisms and nitrite oxidizing organisms were described with asm2d henze et al 2000 as corrected by hauduc et al 2010 and extended with two step nitrification sin et al 2008 and first order hydrolysis kinetics baeten et al 2019 vanrolleghem et al 2003 2 2 2 mass transport and transfer the model was set up in aquasim reichert 1994 comprising a dynamic 1d biofilm model which calculates the microbial population distribution over the granule depth resulting from competition for space and substrates wanner and gujer 1986 the same reactor design and operation was applied as in the simple model for a sequentially operated reactor but additional parameters were required here the influent composition in terms of cod n and p was based on values for the reference reactor pronk et al 2015 and a typical fractionation in the netherlands roeleveld and van loosdrecht 2002 a high influent methane concentration was used to represent a best case scenario sch4 in 61 g cod m 3 the total reactor volume was split up into a 1100 m3 biofilm compartment which represents the settled sludge bed at the bottom of the reactor and a mixed compartment 8500 m3 after feeding which represents the top part of the reactor fig 4 during feeding the diffusive exchange coefficient between the two compartments was set to zero to obtain a higher concentration of substrates in the sludge bed than in the rest of the reactor as in a full scale reactor during upward plug flow feeding pronk et al 2015 during other phases the exchange coefficient was increased to let the liquid phases of both compartments behave as one mixed fluctuating water volume without numerical errors baeten et al 2021 a tall reactor h 12 m was assumed to calculate the liquid gas transfer rate of methane eq 3 and oxygen eq s10 to represent a best case scenario the simulated aeration control strategy was based on the full scale operation using a fixed dissolved oxygen set point during the aeration phases until the ammonium concentration drops below its set point pronk et al 2015 the applied granule size was based on measurements on full scale van dijk et al 2018 and the granule depth was divided into 20 grid points mass transfer resistance from the bulk liquid to the granule surface was neglected 750 days were simulated 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of design and operating conditions first the fate of influent methane simulated with the simple model was compared between a continuously and sequentially operated reactor 3 1 1 for the reference parameter values table 1 to assess the effect of separating feeding and aeration which is used in some sequencing batch reactors with flocculent sludge and in full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors then the effect of different design and operating conditions was studied 3 1 2 3 1 5 3 1 1 unaerated feeding reference case conversion was the main sink of methane 70 when a continuously operated reactor was simulated with a fixed typical concentration of methane oxidizing bacteria of 10 g cod m 3 while the contribution of the effluent load was negligible fig 5 both results are in line with the experimental findings of daelman et al 2012 and liu et al 2014 in contrast sequential operation with the same fixed population size of methane oxidizing bacteria led to significantly less conversion 24 and more stripping 76 the lower predicted conversion efficiency was due to the separation of feeding and aeration in time as this was the only difference between the two scenarios the cyclic dynamics of the sequentially operated reactor give insight in the cause of the higher emissions during feeding fig 6c no conversion or stripping occurred fig 6a while methane entered via the influent which led to methane accumulation in the liquid phase this resulted in a high dissolved methane concentration at the beginning of the aeration phase fig 6b upon the start of aeration the emission rate was higher than the conversion rate fig 6a this is because the stripping rate increases linearly with the methane concentration while the conversion rate saturates towards a maximal value fig 7 only when the methane concentration dropped below 0 72 g cod m 3 did the stripping rate drop below the conversion rate however by this time most of the methane had already been emitted experimental off gas analyzes on aerobic granular sludge reactors have similarly shown a rapid decrease of the emission rate within the first 2 h of aeration baeten et al in press de bruin et al 2013 conversely the steady state methane concentration in a continuously operated reactor was low 0 14 g cod m 3 due to the constant dilution conversion and stripping this constantly low concentration favours conversion over stripping fig 7 it can be concluded that a separate unaerated feeding phase lowers the overall conversion efficiency because methane accumulates during feeding which favours stripping when biomass dynamics were considered the difference between the continuous and sequential operation became more pronounced even more methane conversion was predicted for the continuous operation 88 and no conversion at all was seen for the sequential operation fig 5 as a larger fraction of the influent methane was stripped during sequential operation the methane available for growth of methane oxidizing bacteria was insufficient to compensate the loss via decay and wasting consequently the amount of biomass decreased during consecutive cycles causing a lower methane conversion efficiency in turn a critical amount of methane conversion is necessary to maintain a population of methane oxidizing organisms which was not achieved in the reference sequentially operated reactor 3 1 2 higher intragranule transport resistance kch4 mob for a fixed population of methane oxidizing bacteria more intragranule transport resistance higher kch4 ch4 representing a higher degree of biomass aggregation resulted in less methane conversion and thus more stripping both for continuous and sequentially operated reactors fig 8 this can be explained by the lower conversion rates due to the occurrence of kch4 mob of in the denominator of the monod expression eq 4 the conversion efficiency was always larger for continuous than for sequential operation when microbial dynamics were included this difference became even bigger over the complete anticipated range of apparent half saturation coefficients an active population of methane oxidizers was always maintained during continuous operation consequently aerobic methane oxidation is always expected to some extent in continuously operated reactors with enough oxygen supply even if the biomass is granular kent et al 2018 wei et al 2020 with sequential operation on the other hand wash out already occurred when kch4 mob was above 0 2 g cod m 3 which is on the low end of the range of experimentally observed values arcangeli and arvin 1999 and is therefore more representative for suspended cells or small flocs than for granules even for the lowest reported kch4 mob 0 04 g cod m 3 which practically results in zero order kinetics only 7 was converted so even for a sequentially operated reactor with flocculent sludge kuba et al 1993 the population of methane oxidizing bacteria is expected to be smaller than for a continuously operated reactor with otherwise similar design and operating conditions 3 1 3 higher biomass retention for a continuously operated reactor a higher retention time led to more methane conversion but it saturated quickly fig 9 the population size and thus also the conversion efficiency increased sensitively with an increasing srtmob up to 4 days because wasting of methane oxidizers was slower eq 8 afterwards the impact on the population size diminished because the waste rate became smaller than the decay rate eq 5 which is unaffected by the srtmob for sequential operation a slight improvement of the methane conversion was also observed with increasing srtmob however it did not exceed 1 4 even at an srtmob of 150 days which is representative for large granules in a full scale plant ali et al 2019 consequently the better retention of granules cannot compensate for the decrease of the methane oxidation efficiency resulting from sequential operation 3 1 4 taller reactors for continuous operation a higher reactor led to a slightly more methane conversion under the given assumptions this can be explained by the increased solubility of methane due to the higher hydraulic pressure which decreases the stripping rate eq 3 however this effect is marginal due to the low henry coefficient and negligible content of methane in air baeten et al 2020 daelman et al 2012 did predict a significant improvement but mainly due to the improved absorption of oxygen which has a much higher concentration in the air 20 946 in the simple model applied in this work oxygen limitation was already neglected altogether as an optimistic scenario due to the minor effect of the reactor height on the stripping rate wash out of methane oxidizers could not be prevented during sequential operation even with a 12 m tall reactor as oxygen limitation was neglected this does not prove that a taller reactor can never improve the methane conversion efficiency but it does show the upper limit of this effect which is apparently far less strong than the negative effect of an unaerated feeding phase 3 1 5 higher influent methane concentration best case scenario as the detrimental effect of sequential operation on the methane conversion efficiency could not be countered with less intragranule transport resistance better biomass retention nor by taller reactors this section explores whether the combined effects of the most beneficial design and operating conditions could a low apparent half saturation representative for small flocs a high solids retention time representative for large granules a tall reactor even higher than typical granular sludge reactors and increased influent methane concentrations the highest average reported still without any oxygen limitation represents fig 9 a higher influent methane concentration increased the percentage conversion as predicted by daelman et al 2014 for activated sludge systems however even for the best case scenario with the highest average influent concentration reported sl in ch4 61 g cod m 3 the conversion efficiency was no more than 12 during sequential operation while nearly 100 methane conversion was found during continuous operation with more realistic assumptions including oxygen limitation and a higher transport resistance and more moderate conditions meaning lower influent methane concentrations and less tall reactors even less aerobic methane oxidation will occur than predicted a one at a time sensitivity analysis for this best case scenario showed that the specific growth and decay rate were the most sensitive biological parameters fig s2 sequential operation still led to less methane conversion than continuous operation over the complete range of values found in literature even for the outlier parameter values methane conversion stayed below the reference value of 88 for the continuous operation fig 5 for example 81 was found for µmob max 12 9 d 1 8 times the reference value but this extremely high growth rate actually co occurred with an extremely high decay coefficient bmob 0 96 d 1 arcangeli and arvin 1999 this would again diminish the conversion efficiency but this is not reflected in a one at a time sensitivity analysis 3 2 confirmation with a rigorous biofilm model even though the simple model predicts that stripping is the main fate of methane in a sequentially operated reactor for the best case scenario in terms of design operation and biological parameters two mechanisms were neglected which may lead to higher values first apparent kinetics may have underestimated the conversion because part of the methane will have diffused inside the granules during the unaerated feeding phase the upward plug flow through the settled sludge bed would even lead to more methane entering the granules as the incoming methane is not diluted with the rest of the reactor contents until aeration starts this fraction of methane inside the granules does not experience the diffusional resistance for conversion secondly anoxic methane consumers might be able to survive using nitrate and nitrite instead of oxygen as electron acceptor to account for these possibilities the best case scenario was also simulated with a multi species and multi substrate biofilm model including anoxic methane consumers and the concentrated methane in the granule bed during upward plug flow feeding the simulation with the rigorous model showed only 7 methane conversion after 750 days of simulation which is even lower than predicted by the simple model fig 9 as expected there was a flux of methane into the granules during feeding fig 10a when aeration started mixing between the water at the top and bottom led to a sudden drop of the methane concentration in the sludge bed fig 10c causing a negative peak in the diffusive flux i e out of the granules this led to a fast decrease of intragranule methane concentration profiles fig s6 the stripping peak fig 10c occurred only 1 min after the peak of the outward flux this indicates that neglecting diffusion as in the simple model does not significantly underestimate the conversions after all due to fast diffusion kinetics aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria almost completely washed out fig s3 this can be explained by the competition for oxygen by heterotrophs and nitrifiers which was now included tables s2 and s4 and fig s5 on the other hand anoxic methane consumers were maintained in the system damob which use nitrite were most abundant and resided primarily in the inner layers of the granule fig s4 which is explained by their inhibition by oxygen in the outer layers table s4 the damoa population did not yet reach a steady state after 750 days of simulation even with an active population of anoxic methane consumers the majority of the influent methane is still stripped so only a fraction could be used as an electron donor for denitrification the same conclusion was reached as with the simple model low methane conversion efficiencies are expected in sequentially operated aerobic granular sludge reactors however it took more than 5000 times longer to perform one simulation 2 min versus more than a week this shows the strength of the simple model it is easier to understand and it allows scanning the parameter space to study the effect of different parameters within a reasonable timeframe yet the benefit of the rigorous model was that it could be used to verify whether the conclusion derived from the simple model was robust for the simplifying assumptions that were made there are still a few mechanisms which were not modeled and which might lead to higher methane conversion efficiencies some studies have shown methanotrophic activity of nitrifiers daebeler et al 2014 jones and morita 1983 ward 1987 and nitrifying activity of methanotrophs o neill and wilkinson 1977 yoshinari 1985 if the nitrifiers were able to convert a significant fraction of methane a certain amount of methane conversion capacity could be maintained as the nitrifiers have ample ammonium as substrate conversely if the methanotrophs are able to grow on ammonium also some conversion capacity can be maintained however these effects are probably limited due to competitive inhibition of ammonium on the methane oxidation rate king and schnell 1994 nyerges and stein 2009 especially as sequential operation leads to accumulation of ammonium during an unaerated feeding phase intensifying the competitive inhibition moreover immigration of methane consumers may also occur from the sewers the effect of temperature was not included in this study because the wastewater temperature is not expected to be significantly different between continuous and sequentially operated reactors and is therefore out of scope 3 3 implications for limiting greenhouse gas emissions there is a range of operating conditions between a sequentially operated reactor with an unaerated feeding phase and a reactor with continuous feeding and aeration for example a sequentially operated reactor can have an aerated feeding phase artan and orhon 2005 in this case the dissolved methane concentration is kept lower during feeding due to the conversion and stripping that are favoured by the still active aeration which would favour conversion fig 7 liu et al 2014 found 48 methane conversion in a full scale reactor with such sequential operation with aerobic feeding this is lower than the efficiencies found for continuously fed and aerated reactors daelman et al 2012 liu et al 2014 but still higher than those expected with unaerated feeding fig 5 increasing the duration of an aerated feeding phase would improve the conversion efficiency further as this approaches fully continuous operation more and more as mozo et al 2012 illustrated for several volatile organics however granulation is hindered by aeration during the feeding phase de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 therefore this is not a viable strategy to improve the methane conversion in sequentially operated aerobic granular sludge reactors as the environmental benefits of this technology would be lost i e the lower energy chemical and area requirements pronk et al 2017 the development of aerobic granular sludge in a continuous flow reactor kent et al 2018 may partly combine these benefits with a significant methane conversion efficiency but the exact effect of the intragranule transport resistance is still uncertain fig 8 as methane consumption is expected to be limited other strategies seem more effective to reduce methane emissions from sequentially operated reactors with unaerated feeding first of all methane production in the sewers can be minimized via appropriate design and or chemical dosing liu et al 2015 terryn et al 2017 the head works can be covered and ventilated in case of a high influent methane and intense contact with air so that the methane enriched ventilation air can be treated separately for example in a biofilter huete et al 2018 if the head works do not significantly strip the influent methane the succeeding reactors could be covered instead the latter would be cheaper for aerobic granular sludge reactors due to their compactness if anaerobic digestion is used enclosed sludge treatment and storage units can limit emissions delre et al 2017 moreover significant methane oxidation is expected if the methane rich reject water is treated separately in a partial nitritation anammox reactor castro barros et al 2018 this is only effective in reducing plants wide emissions if the reject water represents a significant fraction of the total liquid phase methane entering the main stream which is not always the case rodriguez caballero et al 2014 this study indicates that also for partial nitritation anammox reactors continuous operation is preferred over sequential operation in this respect joss et al 2009 finally valuable polymers can be extracted from waste aerobic granular sludge this alternative sludge treatment would reduce the cod load to the digesters kehrein et al 2020 schaafsma et al 2016 if present and could therefore reduce methane emissions from this hot spot it should be noted that the proposed mitigation strategies come at an environmental and economic cost further research is necessary to determine when the environmental benefit of avoiding the methane emissions in such a manner outweighs the environmental costs for the extra equipment and energy consumption the answer will certainly depend on the specific plant especially on the influent methane concentration from the wide range of concentrations at the plant entrance table 1 a maximal emission between 0 5 and 15 3 g ch4 is expected per m3 of wastewater assuming no methane oxidation and no anaerobic digesters this corresponds to 0 017 0 520 kg co2 m 3 on a 100 year time horizon myhre et al 2013 since the total carbon footprint of a wastewater treatment plant can easily vary between 0 6 and 1 7 kg co2 m 3 maktabifard et al 2020 the contribution of methane can be negligible in some cases 0 1 and substantial in others it should be noted that dedicated systems for methane removal with efficiencies of over 99 exist for example downflow hanging sponge reactors have been used for post treatment of anaerobic effluent from uasb reactors matsuura et al 2015 matsuura et al 2017 their high methane removal efficiency can be explained by the continuous feeding and aeration see section 3 1 1 by the low influent cod concentrations which limit the competition from heterotrophs see section 3 2 and by the different liquid gas transfer in such closed trickling filter systems however these systems are specifically designed as post treatment of anaerobic effluents to remove methane and thus cannot be directly compared with aerobic granular sludge or activated sludge systems which are designed to remove cod nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater directly 4 conclusion mathematical modeling was used to investigate the fate of methane entering sequentially operated aerobic granular sludge reactors an unaerated feeding phase increased the methane concentration during aeration which favoured stripping and lowered the conversion efficiency compared to a continuously operated reactor with simultaneous aeration and feeding even for a best case scenario with an unrealistically low intragranule substrate transport resistance a high retention time of methane oxidizing bacteria a tall reactor for an extremely high influent methane concentration and without considering oxygen limitation the methane conversion efficiency was significantly lower 12 than typical values measured in activated sludge reactors with simultaneous aeration and feeding 48 no conversion was predicted under more realistic assumptions and more

16660,in municipal wastewater treatment plants some dissolved methane can enter the aerobic bioreactors this greenhouse gas originates from sewers and return flows from anaerobic sludge treatment in well mixed conventional activated sludge reactors methane emissions are largely avoided because methane oxidizing bacteria consume a large fraction even without optimizing for this purpose in this work the fate of dissolved methane is studied in aerobic granular sludge reactors as they become increasingly popular the influence of the characteristic design and operating conditions of these reactors are studied with a mathematical model with apparent conversion kinetics and stripping the separation of feeding and aeration in time a higher substrate transport resistance a high retention time of granular biomass and a taller water column even for a best case scenario combining an unrealistically low intragranule substrate transport resistance a high retention time a tall reactor an extremely high influent methane concentration and no oxygen limitation the methane conversion efficiency was only 12 when feeding and aeration were separated in time which is lower than for continuous activated sludge reactors under typical conditions a more rigorous model was used to confirm the limited conversion considering the multi species and multi substrate biofilm kinetics anoxic methane consumers and the high substrate concentration at the bottom during upward plug flow feeding the observed limited methane conversion is mainly due to the high concentration that accumulates during unaerated feeding phases which favours stripping more than conversion in the subsequent aeration phase based on these findings strategies were proposed to mitigate methane emissions from wastewater treatment plants with sequentially operated reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane oxidizing bacteria greenhouse gas wastewater treatment sequencing batch reactor emission aerobic granular sludge 1 introduction methane ch4 emissions may account for 0 to 40 of the total carbon footprint of conventional aerobic municipal wastewater treatment plants but the exact value and hot spots depend on the design and operation of a specific plant and sewer system foley et al 2011 masuda et al 2018 methane is produced during anaerobic conversions of organic material this mainly occurs in sewers and sludge digesters but can also take place in sludge thickeners and primary settlers daelman et al 2012 masuda et al 2015 the average dissolved methane concentration in the influent ranges from 2 to 61 g cod m 3 liu et al 2015 depending on the residence time geometry and type of sewers and on the wastewater characteristics and temperature foley et al 2009 short et al 2017 terryn et al 2017 dissolved methane can be stripped from several unit processes in a treatment plant the headworks are a first source of emissions accounting for 0 to 50 of the plant wide emissions the fraction that is stripped here increases if there is intense contact with air e g when screw conveyors or aerated grit chambers are used daelman et al 2012 foley et al 2011 kwok et al 2015 liu et al 2014 masuda et al 2018 ren et al 2013 samuelsson et al 2018 wang et al 2011 when present primary settlers can also be a major emission source with values ranging from less than 1 to 68 of the plant wide emissions daelman et al 2012 liu et al 2014 masuda et al 2018 ren et al 2013 the residual dissolved methane that reaches the bioreactors is nearly completely removed here via stripping on the one hand and biological conversion oxidation on the other hand also the contribution of this unit process to the plant wide methane emissions varies over a wide range between 3 and 80 daelman et al 2012 kwok et al 2015 wang et al 2011 biological methane oxidation has been shown to remove 68 80 of the methane that enters continuous activated sludge reactors daelman et al 2012 liu et al 2014 methane emissions from a plant increase drastically if sludge is anaerobically digested methane can escape from the digesters directly during sludge dewatering and storage and due to the incomplete combustion of biogas which has been reported to sum up to 72 81 of the plant wide emissions daelman et al 2012 delre et al 2017 foley et al 2011 kwok et al 2015 samuelsson et al 2018 yoshida et al 2014 moreover the reject water contains dissolved methane which often enters the main treatment process again where it can be emitted as mentioned above daelman et al 2012 ribera guardia et al 2019 literature thus clearly shows an immense variation of both the load and fate of methane between different plants the potential hot spots of methane input production emissions and conversion in wastewater treatment plants discussed in this section are summarized in fig 1 the amount of methane oxidized in an activated sludge reactor depends on the design and operation for example there is an optimal aeration rate for methane oxidation which is high enough to avoid oxygen limitations of the conversion but low enough to avoid excessive stripping deeper diffusers also slightly improve conversions as the hydraulic pressure improves the solubility of gases and therefore hinders methane stripping while stimulating oxygen transfer finally a continuously stirred tank reactor shows more conversion than a plug flow type reactor because mixing dilutes the incoming methane which decreases the stripping rate more than it decreases the conversion rate daelman et al 2014 notwithstanding these influencing factors aerobic bioreactors are rarely or never optimized for methane conversion in municipal wastewater treatment plants as cod and nutrient removal are the primary goals yet even without optimization measurements in continuous aerobic systems have always shown methane conversion efficiencies above 68 daelman et al 2012 liu et al 2014 besides simulations under various conditions have consistently shown values above 21 except when influent methane concentrations are below 5 g cod m 3 daelman et al 2014 this may give the impression that in cases where the influent methane concentration is high aerobic methane conversion can always be relied on to mitigate the associated potential extra greenhouse gas emissions however it is not yet sure whether high methane conversion efficiencies are as easily achieved in sequentially operated reactors without aeration during the feeding phases sequential operation with unaerated feeding phases is becoming increasingly popular under the form of aerobic granular sludge reactors which have lower space and energy requirements than conventional activated sludge systems pronk et al 2017 the fate of methane in aerobic granular sludge reactors has not yet been investigated in these reactors feeding and discharge are separated in time from aeration biomass is present in larger and denser aggregates than in conventional activated sludge reactors pronk et al 2017 granules have a higher resistance for substrate transport towards the microorganisms leading to lower specific conversion rates at low limiting substrate concentrations baeten et al 2018 at the same time they have a higher solids retention time due to their excellent settleability ali et al 2019 winkler et al 2012 moreover aerobic granular sludge reactors are typically taller 6 9 m than conventional activated sludge reactors to enable feeding from the bottom while discharging effluent from the top via an upward plug flow de bruin et al 2013 these characteristic design and operating conditions could influence the fate of methane entering these reactors in different ways from earlier work one can deduce that the higher mass transport resistance may limit conversion baeten et al 2018 the discontinuous feeding may promote stripping mozo et al 2012 the higher solids retention time may promote conversion henze et al 2008 and the taller reactor height may limit stripping daelman et al 2014 yet the magnitude of these effects for the typical design and operating conditions of aerobic granular sludge reactors and their combined effect remain difficult to predict as the fate of methane could be altered these reactor types may also require different strategies to minimize emissions this work investigates for the first time the fate of dissolved methane entering sequentially operated reactors with unaerated feeding phases in general and aerobic granular sludge reactors in particular first a simple mass balance model for the fate of methane and methane oxidizing bacteria mob was set up and used to separately investigate the effects of separating feeding and aeration in time i e sequential versus continuous reactor operation more intragranule transport resistance higher solids retention times and increased reactor heights a more rigorous model was then developed to confirm the results for the best case scenario considering the multi species and multi substrate biofilm kinetics presence of anoxic methane oxidizers and the high substrate concentration at the bottom during the upward plug flow during feeding 2 methodology 2 1 influence of design and operating conditions a mathematical model was set up to study how the methane conversion efficiency is affected by sequential feeding and aeration a higher intragranule substrate transport resistance a higher solids retention time and taller reactors first a general mass balance was set up for methane 2 1 1 and methane oxidizing bacteria 2 1 2 then the

reactor in the best case scenario it considered the multi species and multi substrate biofilm kinetics anoxic methane consumers and higher substrate concentrations in the granule bed during upward plug flow during feeding which were neglected in the simple model described above a summary is given here while details on the implementation and parameter values are provided in supplementary information section s2 and aquasim file 2 2 1 biological conversions not only aerobic methane consumption by methane oxidizing bacteria mob but also anoxic consumption by denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea damoa and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria damob were described with stoichiometry and kinetics from literature arcangeli and arvin 1999 chen et al 2014 lopes et al 2011 for the half saturation coefficients for methane the value from the best case scenario 0 04 g cod m 3 was applied for all methane oxidizing groups which is 147 times smaller than reported for damoa and damob chen et al 2014 monod and inhibition terms for oxygen were included here in contrast to the simplified approach used before eq 2 to account for the competition for oxygen with other microbial groups the conversions catalysed by ordinary heterotrophic organisms phosphate accumulating organisms ammonium oxidizing organisms and nitrite oxidizing organisms were described with asm2d henze et al 2000 as corrected by hauduc et al 2010 and extended with two step nitrification sin et al 2008 and first order hydrolysis kinetics baeten et al 2019 vanrolleghem et al 2003 2 2 2 mass transport and transfer the model was set up in aquasim reichert 1994 comprising a dynamic 1d biofilm model which calculates the microbial population distribution over the granule depth resulting from competition for space and substrates wanner and gujer 1986 the same reactor design and operation was applied as in the simple model for a sequentially operated reactor but additional parameters were required here the influent composition in terms of cod n and p was based on values for the reference reactor pronk et al 2015 and a typical fractionation in the netherlands roeleveld and van loosdrecht 2002 a high influent methane concentration was used to represent a best case scenario sch4 in 61 g cod m 3 the total reactor volume was split up into a 1100 m3 biofilm compartment which represents the settled sludge bed at the bottom of the reactor and a mixed compartment 8500 m3 after feeding which represents the top part of the reactor fig 4 during feeding the diffusive exchange coefficient between the two compartments was set to zero to obtain a higher concentration of substrates in the sludge bed than in the rest of the reactor as in a full scale reactor during upward plug flow feeding pronk et al 2015 during other phases the exchange coefficient was increased to let the liquid phases of both compartments behave as one mixed fluctuating water volume without numerical errors baeten et al 2021 a tall reactor h 12 m was assumed to calculate the liquid gas transfer rate of methane eq 3 and oxygen eq s10 to represent a best case scenario the simulated aeration control strategy was based on the full scale operation using a fixed dissolved oxygen set point during the aeration phases until the ammonium concentration drops below its set point pronk et al 2015 the applied granule size was based on measurements on full scale van dijk et al 2018 and the granule depth was divided into 20 grid points mass transfer resistance from the bulk liquid to the granule surface was neglected 750 days were simulated 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of design and operating conditions first the fate of influent methane simulated with the simple model was compared between a continuously and sequentially operated reactor 3 1 1 for the reference parameter values table 1 to assess the effect of separating feeding and aeration which is used in some sequencing batch reactors with flocculent sludge and in full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors then the effect of different design and operating conditions was studied 3 1 2 3 1 5 3 1 1 unaerated feeding reference case conversion was the main sink of methane 70 when a continuously operated reactor was simulated with a fixed typical concentration of methane oxidizing bacteria of 10 g cod m 3 while the contribution of the effluent load was negligible fig 5 both results are in line with the experimental findings of daelman et al 2012 and liu et al 2014 in contrast sequential operation with the same fixed population size of methane oxidizing bacteria led to significantly less conversion 24 and more stripping 76 the lower predicted conversion efficiency was due to the separation of feeding and aeration in time as this was the only difference between the two scenarios the cyclic dynamics of the sequentially operated reactor give insight in the cause of the higher emissions during feeding fig 6c no conversion or stripping occurred fig 6a while methane entered via the influent which led to methane accumulation in the liquid phase this resulted in a high dissolved methane concentration at the beginning of the aeration phase fig 6b upon the start of aeration the emission rate was higher than the conversion rate fig 6a this is because the stripping rate increases linearly with the methane concentration while the conversion rate saturates towards a maximal value fig 7 only when the methane concentration dropped below 0 72 g cod m 3 did the stripping rate drop below the conversion rate however by this time most of the methane had already been emitted experimental off gas analyzes on aerobic granular sludge reactors have similarly shown a rapid decrease of the emission rate within the first 2 h of aeration baeten et al in press de bruin et al 2013 conversely the steady state methane concentration in a continuously operated reactor was low 0 14 g cod m 3 due to the constant dilution conversion and stripping this constantly low concentration favours conversion over stripping fig 7 it can be concluded that a separate unaerated feeding phase lowers the overall conversion efficiency because methane accumulates during feeding which favours stripping when biomass dynamics were considered the difference between the continuous and sequential operation became more pronounced even more methane conversion was predicted for the continuous operation 88 and no conversion at all was seen for the sequential operation fig 5 as a larger fraction of the influent methane was stripped during sequential operation the methane available for growth of methane oxidizing bacteria was insufficient to compensate the loss via decay and wasting consequently the amount of biomass decreased during consecutive cycles causing a lower methane conversion efficiency in turn a critical amount of methane conversion is necessary to maintain a population of methane oxidizing organisms which was not achieved in the reference sequentially operated reactor 3 1 2 higher intragranule transport resistance kch4 mob for a fixed population of methane oxidizing bacteria more intragranule transport resistance higher kch4 ch4 representing a higher degree of biomass aggregation resulted in less methane conversion and thus more stripping both for continuous and sequentially operated reactors fig 8 this can be explained by the lower conversion rates due to the occurrence of kch4 mob of in the denominator of the monod expression eq 4 the conversion efficiency was always larger for continuous than for sequential operation when microbial dynamics were included this difference became even bigger over the complete anticipated range of apparent half saturation coefficients an active population of methane oxidizers was always maintained during continuous operation consequently aerobic methane oxidation is always expected to some extent in continuously operated reactors with enough oxygen supply even if the biomass is granular kent et al 2018 wei et al 2020 with sequential operation on the other hand wash out already occurred when kch4 mob was above 0 2 g cod m 3 which is on the low end of the range of experimentally observed values arcangeli and arvin 1999 and is therefore more representative for suspended cells or small flocs than for granules even for the lowest reported kch4 mob 0 04 g cod m 3 which practically results in zero order kinetics only 7 was converted so even for a sequentially operated reactor with flocculent sludge kuba et al 1993 the population of methane oxidizing bacteria is expected to be smaller than for a continuously operated reactor with otherwise similar design and operating conditions 3 1 3 higher biomass retention for a continuously operated reactor a higher retention time led to more methane conversion but it saturated quickly fig 9 the population size and thus also the conversion efficiency increased sensitively with an increasing srtmob up to 4 days because wasting of methane oxidizers was slower eq 8 afterwards the impact on the population size diminished because the waste rate became smaller than the decay rate eq 5 which is unaffected by the srtmob for sequential operation a slight improvement of the methane conversion was also observed with increasing srtmob however it did not exceed 1 4 even at an srtmob of 150 days which is representative for large granules in a full scale plant ali et al 2019 consequently the better retention of granules cannot compensate for the decrease of the methane oxidation efficiency resulting from sequential operation 3 1 4 taller reactors for continuous operation a higher reactor led to a slightly more methane conversion under the given assumptions this can be explained by the increased solubility of methane due to the higher hydraulic pressure which decreases the stripping rate eq 3 however this effect is marginal due to the low henry coefficient and negligible content of methane in air baeten et al 2020 daelman et al 2012 did predict a significant improvement but mainly due to the improved absorption of oxygen which has a much higher concentration in the air 20 946 in the simple model applied in this work oxygen limitation was already neglected altogether as an optimistic scenario due to the minor effect of the reactor height on the stripping rate wash out of methane oxidizers could not be prevented during sequential operation even with a 12 m tall reactor as oxygen limitation was neglected this does not prove that a taller reactor can never improve the methane conversion efficiency but it does show the upper limit of this effect which is apparently far less strong than the negative effect of an unaerated feeding phase 3 1 5 higher influent methane concentration best case scenario as the detrimental effect of sequential operation on the methane conversion efficiency could not be countered with less intragranule transport resistance better biomass retention nor by taller reactors this section explores whether the combined effects of the most beneficial design and operating conditions could a low apparent half saturation representative for small flocs a high solids retention time representative for large granules a tall reactor even higher than typical granular sludge reactors and increased influent methane concentrations the highest average reported still without any oxygen limitation represents fig 9 a higher influent methane concentration increased the percentage conversion as predicted by daelman et al 2014 for activated sludge systems however even for the best case scenario with the highest average influent concentration reported sl in ch4 61 g cod m 3 the conversion efficiency was no more than 12 during sequential operation while nearly 100 methane conversion was found during continuous operation with more realistic assumptions including oxygen limitation and a higher transport resistance and more moderate conditions meaning lower influent methane concentrations and less tall reactors even less aerobic methane oxidation will occur than predicted a one at a time sensitivity analysis for this best case scenario showed that the specific growth and decay rate were the most sensitive biological parameters fig s2 sequential operation still led to less methane conversion than continuous operation over the complete range of values found in literature even for the outlier parameter values methane conversion stayed below the reference value of 88 for the continuous operation fig 5 for example 81 was found for µmob max 12 9 d 1 8 times the reference value but this extremely high growth rate actually co occurred with an extremely high decay coefficient bmob 0 96 d 1 arcangeli and arvin 1999 this would again diminish the conversion efficiency but this is not reflected in a one at a time sensitivity analysis 3 2 confirmation with a rigorous biofilm model even though the simple model predicts that stripping is the main fate of methane in a sequentially operated reactor for the best case scenario in terms of design operation and biological parameters two mechanisms were neglected which may lead to higher values first apparent kinetics may have underestimated the conversion because part of the methane will have diffused inside the granules during the unaerated feeding phase the upward plug flow through the settled sludge bed would even lead to more methane entering the granules as the incoming methane is not diluted with the rest of the reactor contents until aeration starts this fraction of methane inside the granules does not experience the diffusional resistance for conversion secondly anoxic methane consumers might be able to survive using nitrate and nitrite instead of oxygen as electron acceptor to account for these possibilities the best case scenario was also simulated with a multi species and multi substrate biofilm model including anoxic methane consumers and the concentrated methane in the granule bed during upward plug flow feeding the simulation with the rigorous model showed only 7 methane conversion after 750 days of simulation which is even lower than predicted by the simple model fig 9 as expected there was a flux of methane into the granules during feeding fig 10a when aeration started mixing between the water at the top and bottom led to a sudden drop of the methane concentration in the sludge bed fig 10c causing a negative peak in the diffusive flux i e out of the granules this led to a fast decrease of intragranule methane concentration profiles fig s6 the stripping peak fig 10c occurred only 1 min after the peak of the outward flux this indicates that neglecting diffusion as in the simple model does not significantly underestimate the conversions after all due to fast diffusion kinetics aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria almost completely washed out fig s3 this can be explained by the competition for oxygen by heterotrophs and nitrifiers which was now included tables s2 and s4 and fig s5 on the other hand anoxic methane consumers were maintained in the system damob which use nitrite were most abundant and resided primarily in the inner layers of the granule fig s4 which is explained by their inhibition by oxygen in the outer layers table s4 the damoa population did not yet reach a steady state after 750 days of simulation even with an active population of anoxic methane consumers the majority of the influent methane is still stripped so only a fraction could be used as an electron donor for denitrification the same conclusion was reached as with the simple model low methane conversion efficiencies are expected in sequentially operated aerobic granular sludge reactors however it took more than 5000 times longer to perform one simulation 2 min versus more than a week this shows the strength of the simple model it is easier to understand and it allows scanning the parameter space to study the effect of different parameters within a reasonable timeframe yet the benefit of the rigorous model was that it could be used to verify whether the conclusion derived from the simple model was robust for the simplifying assumptions that were made there are still a few mechanisms which were not modeled and which might lead to higher methane conversion efficiencies some studies have shown methanotrophic activity of nitrifiers daebeler et al 2014 jones and morita 1983 ward 1987 and nitrifying activity of methanotrophs o neill and wilkinson 1977 yoshinari 1985 if the nitrifiers were able to convert a significant fraction of methane a certain amount of methane conversion capacity could be maintained as the nitrifiers have ample ammonium as substrate conversely if the methanotrophs are able to grow on ammonium also some conversion capacity can be maintained however these effects are probably limited due to competitive inhibition of ammonium on the methane oxidation rate king and schnell 1994 nyerges and stein 2009 especially as sequential operation leads to accumulation of ammonium during an unaerated feeding phase intensifying the competitive inhibition moreover immigration of methane consumers may also occur from the sewers the effect of temperature was not included in this study because the wastewater temperature is not expected to be significantly different between continuous and sequentially operated reactors and is therefore out of scope 3 3 implications for limiting greenhouse gas emissions there is a range of operating conditions between a sequentially operated reactor with an unaerated feeding phase and a reactor with continuous feeding and aeration for example a sequentially operated reactor can have an aerated feeding phase artan and orhon 2005 in this case the dissolved methane concentration is kept lower during feeding due to the conversion and stripping that are favoured by the still active aeration which would favour conversion fig 7 liu et al 2014 found 48 methane conversion in a full scale reactor with such sequential operation with aerobic feeding this is lower than the efficiencies found for continuously fed and aerated reactors daelman et al 2012 liu et al 2014 but still higher than those expected with unaerated feeding fig 5 increasing the duration of an aerated feeding phase would improve the conversion efficiency further as this approaches fully continuous operation more and more as mozo et al 2012 illustrated for several volatile organics however granulation is hindered by aeration during the feeding phase de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 therefore this is not a viable strategy to improve the methane conversion in sequentially operated aerobic granular sludge reactors as the environmental benefits of this technology would be lost i e the lower energy chemical and area requirements pronk et al 2017 the development of aerobic granular sludge in a continuous flow reactor kent et al 2018 may partly combine these benefits with a significant methane conversion efficiency but the exact effect of the intragranule transport resistance is still uncertain fig 8 as methane consumption is expected to be limited other strategies seem more effective to reduce methane emissions from sequentially operated reactors with unaerated feeding first of all methane production in the sewers can be minimized via appropriate design and or chemical dosing liu et al 2015 terryn et al 2017 the head works can be covered and ventilated in case of a high influent methane and intense contact with air so that the methane enriched ventilation air can be treated separately for example in a biofilter huete et al 2018 if the head works do not significantly strip the influent methane the succeeding reactors could be covered instead the latter would be cheaper for aerobic granular sludge reactors due to their compactness if anaerobic digestion is used enclosed sludge treatment and storage units can limit emissions delre et al 2017 moreover significant methane oxidation is expected if the methane rich reject water is treated separately in a partial nitritation anammox reactor castro barros et al 2018 this is only effective in reducing plants wide emissions if the reject water represents a significant fraction of the total liquid phase methane entering the main stream which is not always the case rodriguez caballero et al 2014 this study indicates that also for partial nitritation anammox reactors continuous operation is preferred over sequential operation in this respect joss et al 2009 finally valuable polymers can be extracted from waste aerobic granular sludge this alternative sludge treatment would reduce the cod load to the digesters kehrein et al 2020 schaafsma et al 2016 if present and could therefore reduce methane emissions from this hot spot it should be noted that the proposed mitigation strategies come at an environmental and economic cost further research is necessary to determine when the environmental benefit of avoiding the methane emissions in such a manner outweighs the environmental costs for the extra equipment and energy consumption the answer will certainly depend on the specific plant especially on the influent methane concentration from the wide range of concentrations at the plant entrance table 1 a maximal emission between 0 5 and 15 3 g ch4 is expected per m3 of wastewater assuming no methane oxidation and no anaerobic digesters this corresponds to 0 017 0 520 kg co2 m 3 on a 100 year time horizon myhre et al 2013 since the total carbon footprint of a wastewater treatment plant can easily vary between 0 6 and 1 7 kg co2 m 3 maktabifard et al 2020 the contribution of methane can be negligible in some cases 0 1 and substantial in others it should be noted that dedicated systems for methane removal with efficiencies of over 99 exist for example downflow hanging sponge reactors have been used for post treatment of anaerobic effluent from uasb reactors matsuura et al 2015 matsuura et al 2017 their high methane removal efficiency can be explained by the continuous feeding and aeration see section 3 1 1 by the low influent cod concentrations which limit the competition from heterotrophs see section 3 2 and by the different liquid gas transfer in such closed trickling filter systems however these systems are specifically designed as post treatment of anaerobic effluents to remove methane and thus cannot be directly compared with aerobic granular sludge or activated sludge systems which are designed to remove cod nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater directly 4 conclusion mathematical modeling was used to investigate the fate of methane entering sequentially operated aerobic granular sludge reactors an unaerated feeding phase increased the methane concentration during aeration which favoured stripping and lowered the conversion efficiency compared to a continuously operated reactor with simultaneous aeration and feeding even for a best case scenario with an unrealistically low intragranule substrate transport resistance a high retention time of methane oxidizing bacteria a tall reactor for an extremely high influent methane concentration and without considering oxygen limitation the methane conversion efficiency was significantly lower 12 than typical values measured in activated sludge reactors with simultaneous aeration and feeding 48 no conversion was predicted under more realistic assumptions and more moderate conditions mitigation of methane emissions from plants with sequentially operated reactors can be based on minimizing production in the sewers controlled stripping and separate treatment of

16661,the formation of fungal biofilm goes through some different states including monodisperse state aggregated state germinated state hyphal and biofilm the aggregation of spores is a primary step of fungal biofilm development in aquatic systems previous studies on the inactivation of fungi were mostly performed in the monodisperse state of fungal spores and biofilm state however the inactivation of aggregated fungal spores is still unclear in this study the aggregated characteristics of fungal spores aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus flavus at different ph values were firstly studied and the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores at different aggregation degree by chlorine based disinfectants was also clarified the results showed that the aggregation degree of aspergillus fumigatus was the highest at ph 9 0 while it was the lowest at ph 5 0 aggregation between fungal spores was mainly mediated by occasional adhesin adhesin interactions and electrostatic interactions compared with monodisperse spores fungal spores were more resistant to chlorine based disinfectants with the increase of spore aggregation degree the inactivation rate constants of aspergillus fumigatus at 30 and 63 aggregation degree were 1 5 and 4 folds lower than that of monodisperse spores respectively the lower proportion of membrane damage and higher intracellular reactive oxygen species level for aggregated spores than monodisperse spores was observed according to the flow cytometric results after chlorine based disinfectants treatment the reasons for the lower inactivation efficiency of aggregated spores are as following the protection of outer layer spores and signals between aggregates lead to the increase of resistance for aggregated spores this study is meaningful for the control of the fungal spores at different states in water graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords fungal spores aggregation inactivation resistance mechanisms 1 introduction a series of water environmental security issues caused by the mass propagation of fungi have been widely concerned oliveira et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 wen et al 2017 2017a fungi are widely existed in different habitats in environments including air water and soil and the primary species of fungi encompass aspergillus spp penicillium spp trichoderma spp fusarium spp and others augustina egbuta et al 2016 oliveira et al 2013 fungi have been reported to cause the undesirable taste turbidity and odor in the aquatic environment oliveira et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 wen et al 2017 2017a it may release mycotoxins causing skin allergy asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other problems curtis et al 2009 hageskal et al 2009 pereira et al 2013 denning 2006 meanwhile a few investigations have been reported that fungal spores could form biofilms under nutritious conditions and biofilm debris may be released into the water resulting in the increase of water pollution doggett 2000 nagy and olson 1982 biofilms can promote clogged filters and corrosion of pipes and the increased resistance of biofilms to antimicrobial agents may also enhance the required dosage of disinfectants in water treatment li et al 2020 harding et al proposed that filamentous fungal biofilm formation comprise the following stages the absorption of propagules active attachment microcolony formation maturation and diffusion plankton harding et al 2009 moreover different forms of fungi exist during the formation of biofilm for example monodisperse state and aggregated state in the form of spore or sporangia germinated state and biofilms in which spores and hyphae coexist harding et al 2009 fernandes et al studied the process of filamentous fungal spore adhesion to form biofilm the result suggested that filamentous fungal spore also showed a self aggregation process in the process of spore adhesion fernandes et al 2019 aggregation studies in water environments demonstrated its significant role in the maintenance and development of biofilm communities afonso et al 2021 the aggregation of microbes was related to the surface characteristics surface charge and size of microbes mamane gravetz and linden 2005 previous studies have reported that microbial aggregation was realized by adjusting the ph electrolytic ion composition and concentration of the solution min et al 2010 grimm et al showed that ph values may affect the aggregation of aspergillus niger conidia by changing the surface charge of conidia he confirmed that the potential of conidia on the shear plane changed with the variation of ph value grimm et al 2010 the purpose of virus aggregation was achieved by decreasing the ph of the solution below the isoelectric point of the virus due to that the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged viruses could be effectively reduced and shielded allowing attractive interactions e g van der waals forces electrostatic force hydrophobic interactions to dominate floyd and sharp 1978 1979 langlet et al 2007 mattle et al 2011 watts et al 2020 furthermore aggregation could be influenced by the monovalent and divalent alkali metal cations he et al showed that calcium ion could promote the aggregation of virus ms2 itself while sodium ion had no obvious effect on the aggregation of virus ms2 he et al 2014 the reason was that the carboxyl groups of glutamic acid and aspartic acid on the surface of ms2 virus could form inner coordination with calcium ion promoting aggregation of ms2 at present most of the studies on microbial aggregation focused on viruses with simple structure and small size floyd and sharp 1978 1979 gerba and betancourt 2017 mattle et al 2011 young and sharp 1977 the aggregation characteristics of eukaryotic fungi with complicated structure have not been studied moreover due to the differences in structure and size between viruses and fungi the aggregation characteristics of viruses could not be directly transplanted into the research of fungi thus the aggregation characteristics of fungal spores in different ph values was firstly investigated in this study the aggregation of microorganisms in the water environment had a significant impact on their disinfection process for example ct values of chlorination for 3 log inactivation value of aggregated hadv2 were up to 3 fold higher than that of dispersed hadv2 indicating that aggregation decreased the inactivation rate kahler et al 2016 mattle et al also reported that virus ms2 aggregates decreased the inactivation rate constants 2 6 folds compared with that of dispersed ms2 mattle et al 2011 in addition mamane gravetz and linden explored uv inactivation of isolated indigenous spores in water the uv inactivation curve also showed tailing and this study showed that part of the spores was aggregated due to hydrophobic interaction mamane gravetz and linden 2005 meanwhile mattle et al developed a model to describe the effect of aggregation on the inactivation kinetics mattle et al 2011 this model explained the slower inactivation rate was caused by the negative gradient diffusion of paa concentration to the center of the aggregates which made the internal virus of aggregates survive longer than that in the dispersion however the influence of aggregates on disinfection kinetics should also be considered in terms of biological factors among the aggregate fungal spore aggregation is a highly specific cell cell mechanism by which cells of the same species recognize and adhere to each other rickard et al 2003 this specific recognition and adhesion mechanism could facilitate the exchange of chemical signal molecules and genetic information protect microorganisms from adverse conditions wimpenny and colasanti 2005 increase the resistance to host and enhance virulence for microorganisms ajay et al 2013 quorum sensing qs systems with the intraspecies and interspecies cell to cell communication systems liu et al 2016 has been shown to influence biofilm formation by dominating eps synthesis of v cholerae hammer and bassler 2010 and by governing cell aggregation of serratia marcescens liquefaciens labbate et al 2004 mattle and kohn found that aggregated viruses appeared to tail more easily than the dispersed ms2 during uv light disinfection mattle and kohn 2012 wan et al also studied the inactivation and reactivation of fungal spores in pbs by uv leds and lpuv which showed the inactivation curve appeared tailing phenomenon under high radiation intensity which probably was caused by the aggregation of fungal spores wan et al 2020 nevertheless most of the studies on the disinfection of fungi were performed in a population of dispersed spores ma and bibby 2017 oliveira et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 2013 wan et al 2020 wen et al 2019 2017 2017a 2019a 2016b and the understanding of the inactivation of aggregated spores was limited to our knowledge previous studies have focused more on the aggregated virus whereas the aggregated characteristics and inactivation efficiency of aggregated fungal spores in water have been reported much less therefore this study conducted the inactivation of aggregated and monodispersed fungal spores using three chlorine based disinfectants chlorine monochloramine chlorine dioxide with the following three main objectives 1 to explore the aggregated characteristics of aspergillus flavus a flavus and aspergillus fumigatus a fumigatus at different ph 2 to compared the inactivation efficiency and mechanism of different aggregation degree of fungal spores by three chlorine based disinfectants 3 to explain the reasons of the decrease in inactivation efficiency with the aggregation of fungal spores 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganisms and preparation of spore suspensions two dominant fungi a fumigatus and a flavus were chosen due to they were pathogenic fungi in water wong et al 2021 the preparation method of spore suspensions was described in previous study wen et al 2019 the concentration of fungal spore cfu ml 1 was determined using hemacytometer counting method and the stock solutions of spore suspensions with a concentration of 108 cfu ml 1 were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c wen et al 2019 2 2 characteristics of fungal spores surface hydrophobicity of spores was measured by the assay of microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon mel 2010 the hydrophobicity of fungal spore is shown in table s1 zeta potential of fungal spores was measured by zeta potential meter zs90 malvern zetasizer nano england and the measurement results are shown in fig s1 the size of aggregates was assessed by laser particle size distribution analyzer micicrotrac inc sync uzhou sato precision instrument co ltd germany the aggregates size was the corresponding particle size of 50 of the samples in the particle size distribution micromorphological observation of aggregates was characterized by light microscope 50i nikon japan at each sampling time 2 3 fungal spore aggregation and dispersal spore aggregation was conducted in 0 05 l centrifuge tube contained 0 01 l 15 mm phosphate and 15 mm chloride ion buffer solution the stock of spore suspensions was added into centrifuge tube to reach an initial spore concentration of 5 8 106 cfu ml 1 then the ph of solution was adjusted to 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 with naoh respectively each sample was treated with ultrasonic system science ii d ningbo scientz biotechnology co ltd china for 5 min at 495 w ultrasonic power to disperse small aggregates of spores finally the samples began to be aggregated continuously for 48 h in oscillating incubator bs 2f guohua electric appliance co ltd china at 30 c 120 r min 1 samples were measured on the aspects of aggregated size morphology and quantity in every 12 h previous studies used optical density od value to quantitatively calculate the aggregation efficiency of cell nazeer and ahmed 2019 nistor et al 2010 tran et al 2020 it was not accurate to calculate the aggregation efficiency of spores by od value microscopic counting is a more accurate method to determine the number of fungal spores so we recorded the number of aggregated spores as 1 cfu the aggregation degree of fungal spores could be simply and quantitatively defined by the difference in the number of fungal spores before and after aggregation martin et al 2015 we used the aggregation time as a variable to determine the percentage of aggregation we thought that the aggregation of two or more fungal spores were defined as spore aggregates the aggregation efficiency was expressed by aggregation percentage and the calculation formula was as following 1 p n 0 n t n 0 where p represents aggregation efficiency nt is the number of fungal spores after t h of aggregation and n0 stands for the number of fungal spores at time 0 of aggregation the aggregation percentage was an average value which obtained from many repeated experiments under the same conditions in our study the aggregation percentage of fungal spore had an error of 2 after inactivation each sample was finally treated with ultrasonic system for 7 min at 495 w ultrasonic power to redisperse before enumeration prior to use all of buffers were filtered with 0 22 μm filter 2 4 inactivation procedures the inactivation of a flavus and a fumigatus with different degree of aggregation was conducted to evaluate the impact of aggregation on disinfection inactivation experiments were conducted in 0 1 l 10 mm pbs in 0 25 l glass flasks spore suspensions with different aggregation degree was added into 0 09 l pbs to reach an initial spore concentration of 5 8 105 cfu ml 1 blank sample was taken into 0 002 l centrifuge tube before the inactivation disinfectants was added into the solution to achieve certain concentration 2 and 3 mg l 1 sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 0 1 m was added into the centrifuge tube in advance to quench the residual disinfectant wen et al 2020a samples were taken at different sampling time then samples were treated with ultrasonic system for 7 min at 495 w ultrasonic power finally the redispersed samples after diluted were plated on drbc agar in triplicate wan et al 2020a the plates were incubated at 28 c for 3 days and then the colonies were counted all of inactivation experiments were performed three times at room temperature control samples with adding na2s2o3 without disinfectants confirmed that na2s2o3 showed no inactivation effect on fungal spores the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine spectrophotometric method was applied to determine the concentration of residual disinfectants during the inactivation wen et al 2019a 2 5 flow cytometric measurements change of membrane integrity and ros level of fungal spores before and after inactivation were determined using flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa berney et al 2007 wen et al 2020b 2016a 2014 sybr green і and propidium iodide sg pi dyes were used to evaluate the membrane integrity of the fungal spores dihydroethidium dhe dyes were used to evaluate the intracellular ros level of fungal spores wan et al 2020 the detection range of the flow cytometer applied in our study was 103 105 cells ml 1 additional details about the staining and detection procedures were described in previous studies wen et al 2020b 2 6 data analysis inactivation rate of chlorine monochloramine chlorine dioxide can be calculated as follows 2 n log n 0 n where n0 and n represent the number of the viable fungal spores cfu ml 1 before and after inactivation and n denotes the value of log inactivation the geeraerd and van impe model fitting tool ginafit was used to analysis the inactivation process of fungal spores berney et al 2006 inactivation rate constants of fungal spores were calculated from the linear part of the inactivation curves the inactivation curve of log linear regression plus shoulder and log linear regression plus shoulder plus tail were applied in our study log liner shoulder was chosen to describe the inactivation process of chlorine and chloramine log liner shoulder tail was chosen to describe the inactivation process of chlorine dioxide 3 results and discussion 3 1 aggregation characteristics of fungal spores at different ph fig 1 shows the aggregation efficiency of a flavus and a fumigatus at different ph in fig 1 the aggregation degree of two fungal spores increased with time at different ph correspondingly the aggregation degree was the lowest at ph 5 0 while it was much higher under slightly alkaline condition the aggregation degree of two fungal spores was 21 70 and 21 14 for a flavus and a fumigatus at ph 5 0 after 48 h which was the lowest at different ph at ph 3 0 the aggregation degree of a flavus was 30 70 and a fumigatus was 44 31 after 48 h the surface charge and size of microorganisms determine the aggregation and adsorption capacity of microorganisms wong et al 2012 when the ph value of the solution was close to the isoelectric point pi of the microorganism the net charge on the surface of the microorganism was close to 0 and the electrostatic repulsion force between the microorganisms was the smallest samandoulgou et al 2015 as shown in fig s1 the pi of a flavus and a fumigatus were about 3 3 and when ph value was higher than pi of a flavus and a fumigatus the surface of fungal spores were negatively charged the ph value ph 3 0 lower than the pi of fungal spores and fungal spores were easier to be aggregated due to negative charge on the surface of fungal spores was reduced and mutual repulsion between fungal spores was weakened this result was in consistent with the previous report that ms2 was easier to be aggregated when reducing the ph value of the solution below the pi the radius of ms2 aggregate was about 1 0 μm at ph 3 0 mattle et al 2011 nevertheless the aggregation level of a flavus and a fumigatus were higher under neutral and slightly alkaline conditions at ph 7 0 the aggregation degree of a fumigatus and a flavus were 54 47 and 53 29 respectively at ph 9 0 the aggregation degree of a fumigatus and a flavus were 60 and 55 the higher aggregation degree may be due to the expression of adhesin and receptors rickard et al 2000 2010 or the production of eps hede and khandeparker 2020 on the outer surface of fungal spores at slightly neutral and alkaline conditions min and rickard suggested that s natatoria 2 1 isolated from freshwater expressed aggregation adhesins which promotes the aggregation of s natatoria 2 1 during the biofilm development min and rickard 2009 filamentous fungi also formed viscous eps in the process of forming biofilm which can promote the aggregation of filamentous fungal spores and further form fungal biofilm fernandes et al 2019 the highest aggregation of fungal spores at ph 9 0 might be due to the fact that fungal spores were in alkaline solution for a long time 48 h which dissolved the alkaline soluble contents in the outer layer of cell wall exposed the hydrophobic proteins in the inner layer of cell wall increased the hydrophobicity of spore surface and improved the aggregation degree of fungal spores attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectrometry thermo scientific usa with the range of 400 4000 cm 1 32 scans at 4 0 cm 1 was used to characterize the functional groups change of fungal spore wall during the aggregation experiments as shown in fig s2 the dominant effect observed with atr ftir spectra was that absorbance intensities of the aspergillus spore wall increased at 1042 and 3300 cm 1 with the increase of aggregation time in ph 9 0 solution the peaks at 1042 and 3300 cm 1 are mainly due to the increase of carboxylic acids 3300 2500 cm 1 and ethers 1075 1020 cm 1 functional groups on the spore wall badireddy et al 2010 danae et al 2019 these functional groups were the main hydrophobic groups of hydrophobic proteins which could promote the fungal spore aggregation the results showed the aggregation degree of a fumigatus were higher than that of a flavus the aggregation degree of fungal spores was not only related to surrounding environments but also in relation to the property of fungal spores such as size and hydrophobicity the hydrophobicity of a flavus and a fumigatus is shown in table s1 the hydrophobicity of a flavus was 77 0 which was higher than a fumigatus 21 38 the size of a fumigatus was 2 60 μm and a flavus was 4 00 μm the higher hydrophobicity and smaller size lead to the higher aggregation degree mamane gravetz and linden 2005 this result indicated that the size of spores was more important than hydrophobicity for aggregation of fungal spores microscope images of a flavus and a fumigatus after aggregation are shown in fig s3 it evidenced the presence of aggregated spores in samples at ph 7 0 after 48 h at first the monodisperse fungal spores were observed in pbs solution then the aggregates formation over time was observed in the next 48 h which showed the difference between fungal spores at monodisperse state and aggregated state the average particle size of a flavus spores increased from 4 00 μm to 4 34 μm and that of a fumigatus spores increased from 2 60 to 2 79 μm it should be noted that aggregate was not spherical the size of fungal aggregates was determined as presented in fig 2 the increased size of two fungal aggregates was observed with the increase of the aggregation time the aggregates size of a flavus were 4 26 μm ph 3 0 4 17 μm ph 5 0 4 34 μm ph 7 0 4 36 μm ph 9 0 and a fumigatus were 3 13 μm ph 3 0 2 76 μm ph 5 0 2 79 μm ph 7 0 3 42 μm ph 9 0 respectively after 48 h of aggregation spore aggregation depended on the surface properties of itself and the concentration of the fungal spores floyd and sharp 1977 as well as the composition of the solution in which spores were stored floyd and sharp 1979 in general aggregation of fungal spores depended on different biotic and abiotic factors among the biological factors the growth stage of microorganism rickard et al 2000 the expression of adhesins and receptors or the production of eps would affect the aggregation moreover the presence of solutes min and rickard 2009 the hydrodynamic conditions rickard et al 2004 and the environmental physicochemical properties min et al 2010 are examples of abiotic factors that affect bacterial aggregation in fresh water in our study fungal spores were easier to be aggregated under slightly alkaline condition was attributed to a combination of biotic factors and hydrophobic force 3 2 inactivation of aggregated and monodispersed fungal spores by chlorine aggregated and dispersed fungal spores were exposed to 2 and 3 mg l 1 of chlorine as shown in figs 3 and s4 the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores decreased with the increase of aggregation degree according to the log count reduction lcr the inactivation of a flavus at 0 20 and 58 aggregation degree were 0 75 log 0 28 log and 0 19 log with 2 0 mg l 1 chlorine in 30 min for a fumigatus at 0 30 and 63 aggregation degree it was 2 06 log 1 26 log and 0 54 log with 2 0 mg l 1 chlorine in 30 min as shown in fig 3 a b the inactivation efficiency of a flavus after aggregation fluctuated during the first 10 min and the same phenomenon was observed for a fumigatus during the first 7 min this might be due to the inactivation and dispersion effect of aggregated fungal spores were both existed at the first reaction phase log liner shoulder inactivation curve was more fitted for inactivation of fungal spores by chlorine previous studies have shown that there was a tailing in the inactivation curves after the initial linear phase mattle et al 2011 sharp et al 1975 1976 young and sharp 1977 nevertheless these previous reports did not redisperse the aggregate before it was enumeration and therefore measured inactivation values of the whole aggregate conversely the fungal aggregates after inactivation were redispersed and then enumeration in our study our study was not contradictory to previous studies but rather offered another knowledge into the inactivation process within spore aggregate inactivation rate constants k for two fungal spores was calculated form a linear phase as shown in fig 3 c d the results showed the k value of two fungal spores decreased with the increase of aggregation degree for example k value of the a fumigatus spores at 30 and 63 aggregation degree was 0 13 and 0 05 min 1 by 2 mg l 1 chlorine in 30 min and it decreased 1 54 and 4 times compared with spores before aggregation the k value of aggregates decreased was due to the increased size of fungal aggregates and the slow penetration rate of disinfectant in the aggregate with the increase of aggregation degree the external spores played a protective role on the internal spores thus making it more difficult for the disinfectant to contact the internal spores thus reducing the inactivation efficiency mattle et al 2011 our results were consistent with previous studies on inactivation of aggregated adenovirus 40 and feline calicivirus by chlorine thurston enriquez et al 2003 thurston enriquez et al found the 2 log inactivation ct of aggregated fcv afcv and pv 1 apv 1 were 31 0 and 2 8 times higher than that of dispersed virus respectively moreover the k value of a fumigatus was much higher than that of a flavus at the same disinfectant dose and aggregation time which indicated that the resistance of a flavus was higher than that of a fumigatus it could be explained that a fumigatus was smaller than that of a flavus and pigment in a flavus cell wall played a protective role for a flavus spores 3 3 change of membrane integrity of fungal spores after inactivation by chlorine the membrane integrity of fungal spores before and after inactivation were determined and the results are shown in figs 4 5 and s5 it could be observed that the percentage of membrane intact spores decreased with the increase of inactivation time for different aggregation degree of fungal spores the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores for aggregated spores increased much slower than that of monodispersed fungal spores during disinfectant treatment for monodisperse spores the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores of a flavus and a fumigatus increased from 3 01 and 0 33 to 94 09 and 99 68 in 30 min respectively by comparison the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores of a flavus and a fumigatus aggregated spores increased from 23 86 and 4 98 to 76 76 and 98 65 in 30 min respectively this result indicated that chlorine firstly attacked the cell wall and membrane of a flavus and a fumigatus during the inactivation before inactivation a small number of membrane permeated spores appeared because of sublethal damage during spore storage thanh et al 2006 nescerecka et al 2016 the 2d dot plot of a flavus and a fumigatus staining with sg pi are shown in figs 5 and s5 respectively it directly reflected the increased trend of the percentage of spores permeating with the membrane pi could penetrate into the cells with permeable membrane to stain nucleic acid nescerecka et al 2016 it was obvious from the histogram that the percentage of spores with high red fluorescence intensity fl3 a increased slowly with the increase of spore aggregation 3 4 intracellular ros level of fungal spores after inactivation by chlorine the variation in intracellular ros level of a fumigatus and a flavus before and after inactivation by chlorine are shown in fig 6 the percentage of high intracellular ros levels of spores increased with the increase of inactivation time in different aggregation degree of fungal spores the proportion of high intracellular ros level of monodisperse a fumigatus and a flavus increased from 6 47 and 5 74 to 79 68 and 88 18 in 30 min as for the aggregated fungal spores the increased high intracellular ros level was negligible a fumigatus and a flavus increased from 5 76 and 4 81 to 36 89 and 39 22 respectively ros is a very important metabolic indicator and signal molecule in the development and physiological response of fungal organisms gessler et al 2007 the production of ros in fungi increased attributed to some stress agents such as starvation light and interaction with other organisms gessler et al 2007 relatively high intracellular ros level can cause an increased cell damage seriously influence dna accelerating double stranded proteins and other intracellular components and lead to cell membrane instability moreno et al 2019 in addition compared with the results of membrane integrity and it was inferred that high ros level promoted the membrane permeability of a fumigatus and a flavus the histograms of a flavus and a fumigatus dyeing with dhe are shown in fig 7 and fig s5 respectively which visually reflected the change in the percentage of spores with a high ros level with the increase of inactivation time dhe could enter the cell membrane and be oxidized to ethidium by intracellular ros and could be inserted with dna to emerge red fluorescence fl3 a mesquita et al 2013 based on the change of red fluorescence in cells the content and change of ros in cells could be determined the percentage of high intracellular ros level increased slowly after inactivation for aggregated spores was proportional to the percentage of membrane damage for aggregated spores increased which further proved that the spores were more resistant to chlorine disinfectant after aggregation 3 5 comparison on the inactivation of aggregated and monodispersed fungal spores by chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine inactivation of a fumigatus and a flavus spores by chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine at different degree of aggregation are shown in figs s6 and s7 the inactivation efficiency of a fumigatus and a flavus decreased with the increase of aggregation degree by three disinfectants the inactivation efficiency of three chlorine based disinfectants on fungal spores with different aggregation degree followed chlorine dioxide monochloramine chlorine the inactivation efficiency of two fungal spores by chlorine was discussed in section 3 2 the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores with different aggregation degree by monochloramine was higher than that by chlorine it took 28 and 6 min to inactivate 2 log of a fumigatus with 63 aggregation degree by 3 mg l 1 chlorine and monochloramine respectively our result showed a divergence from previous study ingols et al reported that the chlorine was a much more efficient bactericide than monochloramine ingols et al 1953 this discrepancy was probably attributed to the pigments inside the cells of fungal spores some studies showed that melanin provided protection for fungi from chemicals agustinho and nosanchuk 2017 day 1998 monochloramines might penetrate cells more effectively although less reactive in comparison to chlorine and chlorine dioxide because unlike chlorine and chlorine dioxide monochloramines less readily reacted with the presence of organic matters pigment molecules in the cell wall of the fungi monochloramine directly penetrated cells and damaged dna to inactivate fungal spores the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores with different aggregation degree was highest by chlorine dioxide among the three chlorine based disinfectants the obvious tailing phenomenon was appeared during the inactivation by chlorine dioxide on aspergillus spores with the increase of aggregation degree especially chlorine dioxide inactivated a fumigatus at different aggregation degree when a fumigatus spores with 30 aggregation degree reached 1 88 log inactivation the tailing appeared while it was 1 60 log inactivation for a fumigatus spores with 63 aggregation degree and the tailing appeared sigstam et al investigated the reason of the tailing phenomenon during the inactivation of virus by chlorine dioxide and the results showed that the main reason for the tailing phenomenon in the process of chlorine dioxide disinfection of ms2 was the change of virus properties during the experiment rather than virus aggregation sigstam et al 2014 this discrepancy was probably due to the structural differences among the fungi and virus wen et al 2017a although the inactivation efficiency of fungal spore was reduced with the increase of aggregation degree of spores for chlorine and monochloramine the inactivation curves still followed the form of shoulder log liner and the inactivation by chlorine dioxide followed the process of log liner shoulder tailing the k values of spores with different aggregation degree by chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide treatment are summarized in table 1 as depicted in the table the k values of a fumigatus were higher than that of a flavus and the k values of 3 mg l 1 chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide were higher than that of 2 mg l 1 taking a flavus as an example the k values of spores with aggregation degree of 0 20 and 58 by 3 mg l 1 monochloramine and chlorine dioxide treatment were 0 99 0 87 0 71 and 2 35 1 07 0 75 respectively for 2 mg l 1 monochloramine and chlorine dioxide the k values of spores with aggregation degree of 0 20 and 58 were 0 86 0 15 0 09 and 1 23 0 70 0 42 berman and hoff studied the inactivation of simian rotavirus sail by chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine the results were consistent with our study and it showed that the cell associated virus were more resistant to disinfectants than that of single virions berman and hoff 1984 the decrease in inactivation efficiency of aggregates was due to the protective effect of outer spores on internal spores in aggregates nevertheless the enhance of spore resistance was attributed to the interaction of quorum sensing signal molecule between aggregates the close contact between aggregated cells can promote the exchange of signals or cues thus regulating the sense and gene regulation between cells mutha et al 2018 li et al reported that high cell density and cell proximity trigger the quorum sensing qs circuit which detects and responds to cell density through gene regulation and qs increases the resistance of biofilms li et al 2020 in order to further compared the inactivation efficiency of chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide for different aggregation degree of fungal spores and membrane permeability and intracellular ros level of spores before and after inactivation were analyzed as shown in fig 8 the damage degree of fungal spores with membrane integrity by three disinfectants followed the order of chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine no matter whether the fungal spores were aggregation or not this result was a little different from that obtained by plate counting method especially for monochloramine inactivation the inactivation values of the a fumigatus at 0 and 63 aggregation degree were 0 165 log and 0 036 log with 3 0 mg l 1 in 20 min according to the data obtained by the flow cytometry the results of the plate method showed the log reductions of the a fumigatus at 0 and 63 aggregation degree in 20 min were 4 51 log and 3 90 log respectively which were evidently higher than the values obtained by the flow cytometry of the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores the difference of inactivation values was due to the loss of culturability of fungal spores at first and then the loss of membrane integrity during the inactivation wen et al 2020a xiujuan et al also suggested that some bacteria were called the viable but non culturable vbnc state xiujuan et al 2015 the results showed that spores were easier to form vbnc state during the inactivation process by monochloramine in comparison with chlorine and chlorine dioxide ingols et al reported that one irreversible and complete change occurred by the chlorine and chlorine dioxide molecule oxidized the sulfhydryl groups to the completely oxidized sulfur state or the cysteine could not help the bacterium recover the sulfonyl radical to the functional sulfhydryl form however one reversible and incomplete change happened by monochloramine with a possible restoration of the sulfhydryl radical revives by cysteine ingols et al 1953 the change of intracellular ros level of the fungal spores with different aggregation degree before and after inactivation by three disinfectants are shown in fig 8 the percentage of high intracellular ros level of the fungal spores at different aggregation degree increased with the reaction time the increased order of the percentage of high intracellular ros level in the fungal spores was as follows chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine monodisperse spores produced higher percentage of the high intracellular ros levels than aggregated spores under the same reaction conditions 3 6 reasons for the increased resistance to disinfectants during the aggregation the attenuation of chlorine and monochloramine concentration during the inactivation of fungal spores at different aggregation degree is shown in figs 9 and s8 the concentration of chlorine and monochloramine decreased with the increase of inactivation time taking chlorine as an example the concentration of chlorine 3 mg l 1 attenuated by 84 80 and 74 after 30 min during the inactivation of a flavus with 0 30 and 63 aggregation degree respectively the concentration of chlorine 3 mg l 1 attenuated by 48 36 and 29 in 30 min during the inactivation of a fumigatus at 0 30 and 63 aggregation degree respectively the change of chlorine concentration was obviously different due to the resistance of a flavus was higher than that of a fumigatus during the inactivation similarly monochloramine also followed this rule in the process of disinfection nevertheless one difference was that monochloramine decayed slower than chlorine throughout the inactivation process even the monodisperse a fumigatus and a flavus spores were inactivated monochloramine 3 mg l 1 only decreased by 9 and 9 3 after 20 min this discrepancy was due to the permeability of monochloramine was greater than that of chlorine in the cells ingols et al 1953 monochloramines less readily reacted with the presence of organic matters pigment molecules in the cell wall of the spores thus reducing the attenuation of monochloramine concentration the average radius of aggregates and the corresponding inactivation rate constants are shown in table 1 note that we used the spherical symmetry of the problem and introduced r which was the distance from the center of the aggregate r 0 r r was the radius of the aggregate the balance concentration of disinfectants within the aggregate cd r was computed by the following model mattle et al 2011 3 c d r c d 0 i 0 k 2 r d i 0 k 2 r d where i0 is the modified bessel function abramowitz 1988 d denotes the diffusion constant of the disinfectants in water d 1 1 10 9 m2 s 1 gharagheizi and sattari 2009 cd is the disinfectant concentration k2 is the rate at which disinfectant molecules are removed from the solution by reacting with or adsorbing on the fungal spores the size of fungal spores is much larger than that of virus it would therefore take 0 02 s for the disinfection concentration to reach a balance over the size of the largest aggregates diffusion goes as dt 1 2 in our study the balance was thus achieved before the first measurement was taken 1 min therefore the model can be used to characterize the change of disinfectant concentration in fungal aggregation this model demonstrated the time scale of fungal spore inactivation was not related to the time of disinfectant penetration spores within an aggregate were thus subject to a disinfectant concentration that was constant in time but dependent on the position within the fungal spore aggregate in this model the concentration of disinfectant diffused to the center of the aggregates in a negative gradient in other words the average concentration of disinfectant in the aggregate was getting lower with the increase of aggregate size the model of aggregates effect on disinfection was as follows mattle et al 2011 4 c v r t c v 0 e k 1 t c d 0 i 0 k 2 r d i 0 k 2 r d α where cv is the concentration of fungal spores after t min of inactivation k1 is the inactivation rate constant and the order in cd is α 0 82 the simplified formula is as follows 5 c v r t c v 0 e k 1 t c d 0 r r 1 2 α within the framework of the model the results showed that the concentration of disinfectant diffusion in the aggregates decreased with the increase of the size of the aggregates this further leaded to a lower inactivation rate constant for aggregated spores due to the negative gradient of disinfectants concentration diffused to the center of the aggregates which allowed the innermost spores of aggregates to survive longer than dispersed fungal spores in addition chemical signals molecules between aggregates might increase the resistance of microbial to disinfectants li et al 2020 the quorum sensing qs phenomenon of fungi was firstly found in the pathogenic polymorphic fungal histoplasma capsulatum in 2000 kugler et al 2000 some studies found that the quorum sensing molecules qsms of fungi could regulate the transformation of fungal phase biofilm formation drug resistance gene expression the secretion of virulence factors and the production of antibiotics padder et al 2018 currently verified fungal qsms included alcohols lipoxylates small molecule peptides and certain volatile substances farnesol was a kind of qsms which had been deeply studied at present it could affect the morphological transformation biofilm formation oxidative stress induce fungal apoptosis control drug excretion and so on westwater et al reported that farnesol was related to oxidative stress and the concentration of 40 100 μmol l 1 farnesol could protect candida albicans from oxidative stress of h2o2 plumbagin and menadione by up regulating the expression of some genes related to oxidative stress such as superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat westwater et al 2005 lipoxygenase lox in aspergillus was the key of fatty acid metabolism pathway lox and p po protein regulated the qs of a flavus and lox or p po mutation will change the density dependent nuclei and conidia conversion and affect toxin production brown et al 2008 it is possible that the aggregated aspergillus spores could secrete the chemical signal molecules in response to environmental stress disinfectants attack thus increasing the resistance of the aggregated aspergillus spores to disinfectants the mechanism of chemical signal molecules between aggregates on improving the resistance of microbial to disinfectants was unclear due to the complexity of this process it needs further study about this question in the future 4 conclusion the conclusions from this study are as follows 1 the ph value lowered below the isoelectric point of the fungal spores and at neutral or slightly alkaline condition the fungal spores were easier to be aggregated due to the negative charge on the spore surface was reduced and the formation of viscous extracellular polymers on the outer surface of spores 2 the resistance of the fungal spore aggregates to disinfectants increased with the increase of aggregation degree of spores and the inactivation rate constant of aggregated spores decreased 4 6 fold compared with monodispersed spores 3 the lower proportion of membrane damage and high intracellular reactive oxygen species level for aggregated spores than monodisperse spores was observed after chlorine based disinfectants treatment and the proportion of membrane permeable spores and high ros level increased more slowly with the increase of aggregation degree of fungal spores 4 the inactivation efficiency of three chlorine based disinfectants on different aggregation degree of fungi followed the order of chlorine dioxide monochloramine chlorine the percentage of membrane permeability and the proportion of high intracellular ros level of different aggregated fungal spores by three chlorine based disinfectants also followed the order

16661,the formation of fungal biofilm goes through some different states including monodisperse state aggregated state germinated state hyphal and biofilm the aggregation of spores is a primary step of fungal biofilm development in aquatic systems previous studies on the inactivation of fungi were mostly performed in the monodisperse state of fungal spores and biofilm state however the inactivation of aggregated fungal spores is still unclear in this study the aggregated characteristics of fungal spores aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus flavus at different ph values were firstly studied and the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores at different aggregation degree by chlorine based disinfectants was also clarified the results showed that the aggregation degree of aspergillus fumigatus was the highest at ph 9 0 while it was the lowest at ph 5 0 aggregation between fungal spores was mainly mediated by occasional adhesin adhesin interactions and electrostatic interactions compared with monodisperse spores fungal spores were more resistant to chlorine based disinfectants with the increase of spore aggregation degree the inactivation rate constants of aspergillus fumigatus at 30 and 63 aggregation degree were 1 5 and 4 folds lower than that of monodisperse spores respectively the lower proportion of membrane damage and higher intracellular reactive oxygen species level for aggregated spores than monodisperse spores was observed according to the flow cytometric results after chlorine based disinfectants treatment the reasons for the lower inactivation efficiency of aggregated spores are as following the protection of outer layer spores and signals between aggregates lead to the increase of resistance for aggregated spores this study is meaningful for the control of the fungal spores at different states in water graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords fungal spores aggregation inactivation resistance mechanisms 1 introduction a series of water environmental security issues caused by the mass propagation of fungi have been widely concerned oliveira et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 wen et al 2017 2017a fungi are widely existed in different habitats in environments including air water and soil and the primary species of fungi encompass aspergillus spp penicillium spp trichoderma spp fusarium spp and others augustina egbuta et al 2016 oliveira et al 2013 fungi have been reported to cause the undesirable taste turbidity and odor in the aquatic environment oliveira et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 wen et al 2017 2017a it may release mycotoxins causing skin allergy asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other problems curtis et al 2009 hageskal et al 2009 pereira et al 2013 denning 2006 meanwhile a few investigations have been reported that fungal spores could form biofilms under nutritious conditions and biofilm debris may be released into the water resulting in the increase of water pollution doggett 2000 nagy and olson 1982 biofilms can promote clogged filters and corrosion of pipes and the increased resistance of biofilms to antimicrobial agents may also enhance the required dosage of disinfectants in water treatment li et al 2020 harding et al proposed that filamentous fungal biofilm formation comprise the following stages the absorption of propagules active attachment microcolony formation maturation and diffusion plankton harding et al 2009 moreover different forms of fungi exist during the formation of biofilm for example monodisperse state and aggregated state in the form of spore or sporangia germinated state and biofilms in which spores and hyphae coexist harding et al 2009 fernandes et al studied the process of filamentous fungal spore adhesion to form biofilm the result suggested that filamentous fungal spore also showed a self aggregation process in the process of spore adhesion fernandes et al 2019 aggregation studies in water environments demonstrated its significant role in the maintenance and development of biofilm communities afonso et al 2021 the aggregation of microbes was related to the surface characteristics surface charge and size of microbes mamane gravetz and linden 2005 previous studies have reported that microbial aggregation was realized by adjusting the ph electrolytic ion composition and concentration of the solution min et al 2010 grimm et al showed that ph values may affect the aggregation of aspergillus niger conidia by changing the surface charge of conidia he confirmed that the potential of conidia on the shear plane changed with the variation of ph value grimm et al 2010 the purpose of virus aggregation was achieved by decreasing the ph of the solution below the isoelectric point of the virus due to that the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged viruses could be effectively reduced and shielded allowing attractive interactions e g van der waals forces electrostatic force hydrophobic interactions to dominate floyd and sharp 1978 1979 langlet et al 2007 mattle et al 2011 watts et al 2020 furthermore aggregation could be influenced by the monovalent and divalent alkali metal cations he et al showed that calcium ion could promote the aggregation of virus ms2 itself while sodium ion had no obvious effect on the aggregation of virus ms2 he et al 2014 the reason was that the carboxyl groups of glutamic acid and aspartic acid on the surface of ms2 virus could form inner coordination with calcium ion promoting aggregation of ms2 at present most of the studies on microbial aggregation focused on viruses with simple structure and small size floyd and sharp 1978 1979 gerba and betancourt 2017 mattle et al 2011 young and sharp 1977 the aggregation characteristics of eukaryotic fungi with complicated structure have not been studied moreover due to the differences in structure and size between viruses and fungi the aggregation characteristics of viruses could not be directly transplanted into the research of fungi thus the aggregation characteristics of fungal spores in different ph values was firstly investigated in this study the aggregation of microorganisms in the water environment had a significant impact on their disinfection process for example ct values of chlorination for 3 log inactivation value of aggregated hadv2 were up to 3 fold higher than that of dispersed hadv2 indicating that aggregation decreased the inactivation rate kahler et al 2016 mattle et al also reported that virus ms2 aggregates decreased the inactivation rate constants 2 6 folds compared with that of dispersed ms2 mattle et al 2011 in addition mamane gravetz and linden explored uv inactivation of isolated indigenous spores in water the uv inactivation curve also showed tailing and this study showed that part of the spores was aggregated due to hydrophobic interaction mamane gravetz and linden 2005 meanwhile mattle et al developed a model to describe the effect of aggregation on the inactivation kinetics mattle et al 2011 this model explained the slower inactivation rate was caused by the negative gradient diffusion of paa concentration to the center of the aggregates which made the internal virus of aggregates survive longer than that in the dispersion however the influence of aggregates on disinfection kinetics should also be considered in terms of biological factors among the aggregate fungal spore aggregation is a highly specific cell cell mechanism by which cells of the same species recognize and adhere to each other rickard et al 2003 this specific recognition and adhesion mechanism could facilitate the exchange of chemical signal molecules and genetic information protect microorganisms from adverse conditions wimpenny and colasanti 2005 increase the resistance to host and enhance virulence for microorganisms ajay et al 2013 quorum sensing qs systems with the intraspecies and interspecies cell to cell communication systems liu et al 2016 has been shown to influence biofilm formation by dominating eps synthesis of v cholerae hammer and bassler 2010 and by governing cell aggregation of serratia marcescens liquefaciens labbate et al 2004 mattle and kohn found that aggregated viruses appeared to tail more easily than the dispersed ms2 during uv light disinfection mattle and kohn 2012 wan et al also studied the inactivation and reactivation of fungal spores in pbs by uv leds and lpuv which showed the inactivation curve appeared tailing phenomenon under high radiation intensity which probably was caused by the aggregation of fungal spores wan et al 2020 nevertheless most of the studies on the disinfection of fungi were performed in a population of dispersed spores ma and bibby 2017 oliveira et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 2013 wan et al 2020 wen et al 2019 2017 2017a 2019a 2016b and the understanding of the inactivation of aggregated spores was limited to our knowledge previous studies have focused more on the aggregated virus whereas the aggregated characteristics and inactivation efficiency of aggregated fungal spores in water have been reported much less therefore this study conducted the inactivation of aggregated and monodispersed fungal spores using three chlorine based disinfectants chlorine monochloramine chlorine dioxide with the following three main objectives 1 to explore the aggregated characteristics of aspergillus flavus a flavus and aspergillus fumigatus a fumigatus at different ph 2 to compared the inactivation efficiency and mechanism of different aggregation degree of fungal spores by three chlorine based disinfectants 3 to explain the reasons of the decrease in inactivation efficiency with the aggregation of fungal spores 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganisms and preparation of spore suspensions two dominant fungi a fumigatus and a flavus were chosen due to they were pathogenic fungi in water wong et al 2021 the preparation method of spore suspensions was described in previous study wen et al 2019 the concentration of fungal spore cfu ml 1 was determined using hemacytometer counting method and the stock solutions of spore suspensions with a concentration of 108 cfu ml 1 were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c wen et al 2019 2 2 characteristics of fungal spores surface hydrophobicity of spores was measured by the assay of microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon mel 2010 the hydrophobicity of fungal spore is shown in table s1 zeta potential of fungal spores was measured by zeta potential meter zs90 malvern zetasizer nano england and the measurement results are shown in fig s1 the size of aggregates was assessed by laser particle size distribution analyzer micicrotrac inc sync uzhou sato precision instrument co ltd germany the aggregates size was the corresponding particle size of 50 of the samples in the particle size distribution micromorphological observation of aggregates was characterized by light microscope 50i nikon japan at each sampling time 2 3 fungal spore aggregation and dispersal spore aggregation was conducted in 0 05 l centrifuge tube contained 0 01 l 15 mm phosphate and 15 mm chloride ion buffer solution the stock of spore suspensions was added into centrifuge tube to reach an initial spore concentration of 5 8 106 cfu ml 1 then the ph of solution was adjusted to 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 with naoh respectively each sample was treated with ultrasonic system science ii d ningbo scientz biotechnology co ltd china for 5 min at 495 w ultrasonic power to disperse small aggregates of spores finally the samples began to be aggregated continuously for 48 h in oscillating incubator bs 2f guohua electric appliance co ltd china at 30 c 120 r min 1 samples were measured on the aspects of aggregated size morphology and quantity in every 12 h previous studies used optical density od value to quantitatively calculate the aggregation efficiency of cell nazeer and ahmed 2019 nistor et al 2010 tran et al 2020 it was not accurate to calculate the aggregation efficiency of spores by od value microscopic counting is a more accurate method to determine the number of fungal spores so we recorded the number of aggregated spores as 1 cfu the aggregation degree of fungal spores could be simply and quantitatively defined by the difference in the number of fungal spores before and after aggregation martin et al 2015 we used the aggregation time as a variable to determine the percentage of aggregation we thought that the aggregation of two or more fungal spores were defined as spore aggregates the aggregation efficiency was expressed by aggregation percentage and the calculation formula was as following 1 p n 0 n t n 0 where p represents aggregation efficiency nt is the number of fungal spores after t h of aggregation and n0 stands for the number of fungal spores at time 0 of aggregation the aggregation percentage was an average value which obtained from many repeated experiments under the same conditions in our study the aggregation percentage of fungal spore had an error of 2 after inactivation each sample was finally treated with ultrasonic system for 7 min at 495 w ultrasonic power to redisperse before enumeration prior to use all of buffers were filtered with 0 22 μm filter 2 4 inactivation procedures the inactivation of a flavus and a fumigatus with different degree of aggregation was conducted to evaluate the impact of aggregation on disinfection inactivation experiments were conducted in 0 1 l 10 mm pbs in 0 25 l glass flasks spore suspensions with different aggregation degree was added into 0 09 l pbs to reach an initial spore concentration of 5 8 105 cfu ml 1 blank sample was taken into 0 002 l centrifuge tube before the inactivation disinfectants was added into the solution to achieve certain concentration 2 and 3 mg l 1 sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 0 1 m was added into the centrifuge tube in advance to quench the residual disinfectant wen et al 2020a samples were taken at different sampling time then samples were treated with ultrasonic system for 7 min at 495 w ultrasonic power finally the redispersed samples after diluted were plated on drbc agar in triplicate wan et al 2020a the plates were incubated at 28 c for 3 days and then the colonies were counted all of inactivation experiments were performed three times at room temperature control samples with adding na2s2o3 without disinfectants confirmed that na2s2o3 showed no inactivation effect on fungal spores the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine spectrophotometric method was applied to determine the concentration of residual disinfectants during the inactivation wen et al 2019a 2 5 flow cytometric measurements change of membrane integrity and ros level of fungal spores before and after inactivation were determined using flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa berney et al 2007 wen et al 2020b 2016a 2014 sybr green і and propidium iodide sg pi dyes were used to evaluate the membrane integrity of the fungal spores dihydroethidium dhe dyes were used to evaluate the intracellular ros level of fungal spores wan et al 2020 the detection range of the flow cytometer applied in our study was 103 105 cells ml 1 additional details about the staining and detection procedures were described in previous studies wen et al 2020b 2 6 data analysis inactivation rate of chlorine monochloramine chlorine dioxide can be calculated as follows 2 n log n 0 n where n0 and n represent the number of the viable fungal spores cfu ml 1 before and after inactivation and n denotes the value of log inactivation the geeraerd and van impe model fitting tool ginafit was used to analysis the inactivation process of fungal spores berney et al 2006 inactivation rate constants of fungal spores were calculated from the linear part of the inactivation curves the inactivation curve of log linear regression plus shoulder and log linear regression plus shoulder plus tail were applied in our study log liner shoulder was chosen to describe the inactivation process of chlorine and chloramine log liner shoulder tail was chosen to describe the inactivation process of chlorine dioxide 3 results and discussion 3 1 aggregation characteristics of fungal spores at different ph fig 1 shows the aggregation efficiency of a flavus and a fumigatus at different ph in fig 1 the aggregation degree of two fungal spores increased with time at different ph correspondingly the aggregation degree was the lowest at ph 5 0 while it was much higher under slightly alkaline condition the aggregation degree of two fungal spores was 21 70 and 21 14 for a flavus and a fumigatus at ph 5 0 after 48 h which was the lowest at different ph at ph 3 0 the aggregation degree of a flavus was 30 70 and a fumigatus was 44 31 after 48 h the surface charge and size of microorganisms determine the aggregation and adsorption capacity of microorganisms wong et al 2012 when the ph value of the solution was close to the isoelectric point pi of the microorganism the net charge on the surface of the microorganism was close to 0 and the electrostatic repulsion force between the microorganisms was the smallest samandoulgou et al 2015 as shown in fig s1 the pi of a flavus and a fumigatus were about 3 3 and when ph value was higher than pi of a flavus and a fumigatus the surface of fungal spores were negatively charged the ph value ph 3 0 lower than the pi of fungal spores and fungal spores were easier to be aggregated due to negative charge on the surface of fungal spores was reduced and mutual repulsion between fungal spores was weakened this result was in consistent with the previous report that ms2 was easier to be aggregated when reducing the ph value of the solution below the pi the radius of ms2 aggregate was about 1 0 μm at ph 3 0 mattle et al 2011 nevertheless the aggregation level of a flavus and a fumigatus were higher under neutral and slightly alkaline conditions at ph 7 0 the aggregation degree of a fumigatus and a flavus were 54 47 and 53 29 respectively at ph 9 0 the aggregation degree of a fumigatus and a flavus were 60 and 55 the higher aggregation degree may be due to the expression of adhesin and receptors rickard et al 2000 2010 or the production of eps hede and khandeparker 2020 on the outer surface of fungal spores at slightly neutral and alkaline conditions min and rickard suggested that s natatoria 2 1 isolated from freshwater expressed aggregation adhesins which promotes the aggregation of s natatoria 2 1 during the biofilm development min and rickard 2009 filamentous fungi also formed viscous eps in the process of forming biofilm which can promote the aggregation of filamentous fungal spores and further form fungal biofilm fernandes et al 2019 the highest aggregation of fungal spores at ph 9 0 might be due to the fact that fungal spores were in alkaline solution for a long time 48 h which dissolved the alkaline soluble contents in the outer layer of cell wall exposed the hydrophobic proteins in the inner layer of cell wall increased the hydrophobicity of spore surface and improved the aggregation degree of fungal spores attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectrometry thermo scientific usa with the range of 400 4000 cm 1 32 scans at 4 0 cm 1 was used to characterize the functional groups change of fungal spore wall during the aggregation experiments as shown in fig s2 the dominant effect observed with atr ftir spectra was that absorbance intensities of the aspergillus spore wall increased at 1042 and 3300 cm 1 with the increase of aggregation time in ph 9 0 solution the peaks at 1042 and 3300 cm 1 are mainly due to the increase of carboxylic acids 3300 2500 cm 1 and ethers 1075 1020 cm 1 functional groups on the spore wall badireddy et al 2010 danae et al 2019 these functional groups were the main hydrophobic groups of hydrophobic proteins which could promote the fungal spore aggregation the results showed the aggregation degree of a fumigatus were higher than that of a flavus the aggregation degree of fungal spores was not only related to surrounding environments but also in relation to the property of fungal spores such as size and hydrophobicity the hydrophobicity of a flavus and a fumigatus is shown in table s1 the hydrophobicity of a flavus was 77 0 which was higher than a fumigatus 21 38 the size of a fumigatus was 2 60 μm and a flavus was 4 00 μm the higher hydrophobicity and smaller size lead to the higher aggregation degree mamane gravetz and linden 2005 this result indicated that the size of spores was more important than hydrophobicity for aggregation of fungal spores microscope images of a flavus and a fumigatus after aggregation are shown in fig s3 it evidenced the presence of aggregated spores in samples at ph 7 0 after 48 h at first the monodisperse fungal spores were observed in pbs solution then the aggregates formation over time was observed in the next 48 h which showed the difference between fungal spores at monodisperse state and aggregated state the average particle size of a flavus spores increased from 4 00 μm to 4 34 μm and that of a fumigatus spores increased from 2 60 to 2 79 μm it should be noted that aggregate was not spherical the size of fungal aggregates was determined as presented in fig 2 the increased size of two fungal aggregates was observed with the increase of the aggregation time the aggregates size of a flavus were 4 26 μm ph 3 0 4 17 μm ph 5 0 4 34 μm ph 7 0 4 36 μm ph 9 0 and a fumigatus were 3 13 μm ph 3 0 2 76 μm ph 5 0 2 79 μm ph 7 0 3 42 μm ph 9 0 respectively after 48 h of aggregation spore aggregation depended on the surface properties of itself and the concentration of the fungal spores floyd and sharp 1977 as well as the composition of the solution in which spores were stored floyd and sharp 1979 in general aggregation of fungal spores depended on different biotic and abiotic factors among the biological factors the growth stage of microorganism rickard et al 2000 the expression of adhesins and receptors or the production of eps would affect the aggregation moreover the presence of solutes min and rickard 2009 the hydrodynamic conditions rickard et al 2004 and the environmental physicochemical properties min et al 2010 are examples of abiotic factors that affect bacterial aggregation in fresh water in our study fungal spores were easier to be aggregated under slightly alkaline condition was attributed to a combination of biotic factors and hydrophobic force 3 2 inactivation of aggregated and monodispersed fungal spores by chlorine aggregated and dispersed fungal spores were exposed to 2 and 3 mg l 1 of chlorine as shown in figs 3 and s4 the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores decreased with the increase of aggregation degree according to the log count reduction lcr the inactivation of a flavus at 0 20 and 58 aggregation degree were 0 75 log 0 28 log and 0 19 log with 2 0 mg l 1 chlorine in 30 min for a fumigatus at 0 30 and 63 aggregation degree it was 2 06 log 1 26 log and 0 54 log with 2 0 mg l 1 chlorine in 30 min as shown in fig 3 a b the inactivation efficiency of a flavus after aggregation fluctuated during the first 10 min and the same phenomenon was observed for a fumigatus during the first 7 min this might be due to the inactivation and dispersion effect of aggregated fungal spores were both existed at the first reaction phase log liner shoulder inactivation curve was more fitted for inactivation of fungal spores by chlorine previous studies have shown that there was a tailing in the inactivation curves after the initial linear phase mattle et al 2011 sharp et al 1975 1976 young and sharp 1977 nevertheless these previous reports did not redisperse the aggregate before it was enumeration and therefore measured inactivation values of the whole aggregate conversely the fungal aggregates after inactivation were redispersed and then enumeration in our study our study was not contradictory to previous studies but rather offered another knowledge into the inactivation process within spore aggregate inactivation rate constants k for two fungal spores was calculated form a linear phase as shown in fig 3 c d the results showed the k value of two fungal spores decreased with the increase of aggregation degree for example k value of the a fumigatus spores at 30 and 63 aggregation degree was 0 13 and 0 05 min 1 by 2 mg l 1 chlorine in 30 min and it decreased 1 54 and 4 times compared with spores before aggregation the k value of aggregates decreased was due to the increased size of fungal aggregates and the slow penetration rate of disinfectant in the aggregate with the increase of aggregation degree the external spores played a protective role on the internal spores thus making it more difficult for the disinfectant to contact the internal spores thus reducing the inactivation efficiency mattle et al 2011 our results were consistent with previous studies on inactivation of aggregated adenovirus 40 and feline calicivirus by chlorine thurston enriquez et al 2003 thurston enriquez et al found the 2 log inactivation ct of aggregated fcv afcv and pv 1 apv 1 were 31 0 and 2 8 times higher than that of dispersed virus respectively moreover the k value of a fumigatus was much higher than that of a flavus at the same disinfectant dose and aggregation time which indicated that the resistance of a flavus was higher than that of a fumigatus it could be explained that a fumigatus was smaller than that of a flavus and pigment in a flavus cell wall played a protective role for a flavus spores 3 3 change of membrane integrity of fungal spores after inactivation by chlorine the membrane integrity of fungal spores before and after inactivation were determined and the results are shown in figs 4 5 and s5 it could be observed that the percentage of membrane intact spores decreased with the increase of inactivation time for different aggregation degree of fungal spores the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores for aggregated spores increased much slower than that of monodispersed fungal spores during disinfectant treatment for monodisperse spores the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores of a flavus and a fumigatus increased from 3 01 and 0 33 to 94 09 and 99 68 in 30 min respectively by comparison the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores of a flavus and a fumigatus aggregated spores increased from 23 86 and 4 98 to 76 76 and 98 65 in 30 min respectively this result indicated that chlorine firstly attacked the cell wall and membrane of a flavus and a fumigatus during the inactivation before inactivation a small number of membrane permeated spores appeared because of sublethal damage during spore storage thanh et al 2006 nescerecka et al 2016 the 2d dot plot of a flavus and a fumigatus staining with sg pi are shown in figs 5 and s5 respectively it directly reflected the increased trend of the percentage of spores permeating with the membrane pi could penetrate into the cells with permeable membrane to stain nucleic acid nescerecka et al 2016 it was obvious from the histogram that the percentage of spores with high red fluorescence intensity fl3 a increased slowly with the increase of spore aggregation 3 4 intracellular ros level of fungal spores after inactivation by chlorine the variation in intracellular ros level of a fumigatus and a flavus before and after inactivation by chlorine are shown in fig 6 the percentage of high intracellular ros levels of spores increased with the increase of inactivation time in different aggregation degree of fungal spores the proportion of high intracellular ros level of monodisperse a fumigatus and a flavus increased from 6 47 and 5 74 to 79 68 and 88 18 in 30 min as for the aggregated fungal spores the increased high intracellular ros level was negligible a fumigatus and a flavus increased from 5 76 and 4 81 to 36 89 and 39 22 respectively ros is a very important metabolic indicator and signal molecule in the development and physiological response of fungal organisms gessler et al 2007 the production of ros in fungi increased attributed to some stress agents such as starvation light and interaction with other organisms gessler et al 2007 relatively high intracellular ros level can cause an increased cell damage seriously influence dna accelerating double stranded proteins and other intracellular components and lead to cell membrane instability moreno et al 2019 in addition compared with the results of membrane integrity and it was inferred that high ros level promoted the membrane permeability of a fumigatus and a flavus the histograms of a flavus and a fumigatus dyeing with dhe are shown in fig 7 and fig s5 respectively which visually reflected the change in the percentage of spores with a high ros level with the increase of inactivation time dhe could enter the cell membrane and be oxidized to ethidium by intracellular ros and could be inserted with dna to emerge red fluorescence fl3 a mesquita et al 2013 based on the change of red fluorescence in cells the content and change of ros in cells could be determined the percentage of high intracellular ros level increased slowly after inactivation for aggregated spores was proportional to the percentage of membrane damage for aggregated spores increased which further proved that the spores were more resistant to chlorine disinfectant after aggregation 3 5 comparison on the inactivation of aggregated and monodispersed fungal spores by chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine inactivation of a fumigatus and a flavus spores by chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine at different degree of aggregation are shown in figs s6 and s7 the inactivation efficiency of a fumigatus and a flavus decreased with the increase of aggregation degree by three disinfectants the inactivation efficiency of three chlorine based disinfectants on fungal spores with different aggregation degree followed chlorine dioxide monochloramine chlorine the inactivation efficiency of two fungal spores by chlorine was discussed in section 3 2 the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores with different aggregation degree by monochloramine was higher than that by chlorine it took 28 and 6 min to inactivate 2 log of a fumigatus with 63 aggregation degree by 3 mg l 1 chlorine and monochloramine respectively our result showed a divergence from previous study ingols et al reported that the chlorine was a much more efficient bactericide than monochloramine ingols et al 1953 this discrepancy was probably attributed to the pigments inside the cells of fungal spores some studies showed that melanin provided protection for fungi from chemicals agustinho and nosanchuk 2017 day 1998 monochloramines might penetrate cells more effectively although less reactive in comparison to chlorine and chlorine dioxide because unlike chlorine and chlorine dioxide monochloramines less readily reacted with the presence of organic matters pigment molecules in the cell wall of the fungi monochloramine directly penetrated cells and damaged dna to inactivate fungal spores the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores with different aggregation degree was highest by chlorine dioxide among the three chlorine based disinfectants the obvious tailing phenomenon was appeared during the inactivation by chlorine dioxide on aspergillus spores with the increase of aggregation degree especially chlorine dioxide inactivated a fumigatus at different aggregation degree when a fumigatus spores with 30 aggregation degree reached 1 88 log inactivation the tailing appeared while it was 1 60 log inactivation for a fumigatus spores with 63 aggregation degree and the tailing appeared sigstam et al investigated the reason of the tailing phenomenon during the inactivation of virus by chlorine dioxide and the results showed that the main reason for the tailing phenomenon in the process of chlorine dioxide disinfection of ms2 was the change of virus properties during the experiment rather than virus aggregation sigstam et al 2014 this discrepancy was probably due to the structural differences among the fungi and virus wen et al 2017a although the inactivation efficiency of fungal spore was reduced with the increase of aggregation degree of spores for chlorine and monochloramine the inactivation curves still followed the form of shoulder log liner and the inactivation by chlorine dioxide followed the process of log liner shoulder tailing the k values of spores with different aggregation degree by chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide treatment are summarized in table 1 as depicted in the table the k values of a fumigatus were higher than that of a flavus and the k values of 3 mg l 1 chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide were higher than that of 2 mg l 1 taking a flavus as an example the k values of spores with aggregation degree of 0 20 and 58 by 3 mg l 1 monochloramine and chlorine dioxide treatment were 0 99 0 87 0 71 and 2 35 1 07 0 75 respectively for 2 mg l 1 monochloramine and chlorine dioxide the k values of spores with aggregation degree of 0 20 and 58 were 0 86 0 15 0 09 and 1 23 0 70 0 42 berman and hoff studied the inactivation of simian rotavirus sail by chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine the results were consistent with our study and it showed that the cell associated virus were more resistant to disinfectants than that of single virions berman and hoff 1984 the decrease in inactivation efficiency of aggregates was due to the protective effect of outer spores on internal spores in aggregates nevertheless the enhance of spore resistance was attributed to the interaction of quorum sensing signal molecule between aggregates the close contact between aggregated cells can promote the exchange of signals or cues thus regulating the sense and gene regulation between cells mutha et al 2018 li et al reported that high cell density and cell proximity trigger the quorum sensing qs circuit which detects and responds to cell density through gene regulation and qs increases the resistance of biofilms li et al 2020 in order to further compared the inactivation efficiency of chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide for different aggregation degree of fungal spores and membrane permeability and intracellular ros level of spores before and after inactivation were analyzed as shown in fig 8 the damage degree of fungal spores with membrane integrity by three disinfectants followed the order of chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine no matter whether the fungal spores were aggregation or not this result was a little different from that obtained by plate counting method especially for monochloramine inactivation the inactivation values of the a fumigatus at 0 and 63 aggregation degree were 0 165 log and 0 036 log with 3 0 mg l 1 in 20 min according to the data obtained by the flow cytometry the results of the plate method showed the log reductions of the a fumigatus at 0 and 63 aggregation degree in 20 min were 4 51 log and 3 90 log respectively which were evidently higher than the values obtained by the flow cytometry of the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores the difference of inactivation values was due to the loss of culturability of fungal spores at first and then the loss of membrane integrity during the inactivation wen et al 2020a xiujuan et al also suggested that some bacteria were called the viable but non culturable vbnc state xiujuan et al 2015 the results showed that spores were easier to form vbnc state during the inactivation process by monochloramine in comparison with chlorine and chlorine dioxide ingols et al reported that one irreversible and complete change occurred by the chlorine and chlorine dioxide molecule oxidized the sulfhydryl groups to the completely oxidized sulfur state or the cysteine could not help the bacterium recover the sulfonyl radical to the functional sulfhydryl form however one reversible and incomplete change happened by monochloramine with a possible restoration of the sulfhydryl radical revives by cysteine ingols et al 1953 the change of intracellular ros level of the fungal spores with different aggregation degree before and after inactivation by three disinfectants are shown in fig 8 the percentage of high intracellular ros level of the fungal spores at different aggregation degree increased with the reaction time the increased order of the percentage of high intracellular ros level in the fungal spores was as follows chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine monodisperse spores produced higher percentage of the high intracellular ros levels than aggregated spores under the same reaction conditions 3 6 reasons for the increased resistance to disinfectants during the aggregation the attenuation of chlorine and monochloramine concentration during the inactivation of fungal spores at different aggregation degree is shown in figs 9 and s8 the concentration of chlorine and monochloramine decreased with the increase of inactivation time taking chlorine as an example the concentration of chlorine 3 mg l 1 attenuated by 84 80 and 74 after 30 min during the inactivation of a flavus with 0 30 and 63 aggregation degree respectively the concentration of chlorine 3 mg l 1 attenuated by 48 36 and 29 in 30 min during the inactivation of a fumigatus at 0 30 and 63 aggregation degree respectively the change of chlorine concentration was obviously different due to the resistance of a flavus was higher than that of a fumigatus during the inactivation similarly monochloramine also followed this rule in the process of disinfection nevertheless one difference was that monochloramine decayed slower than chlorine throughout the inactivation process even the monodisperse a fumigatus and a flavus spores were inactivated monochloramine 3 mg l 1 only decreased by 9 and 9 3 after 20 min this discrepancy was due to the permeability of monochloramine was greater than that of chlorine in the cells ingols et al 1953 monochloramines less readily reacted with the presence of organic matters pigment molecules in the cell wall of the spores thus reducing the attenuation of monochloramine concentration the average radius of aggregates and the corresponding inactivation rate constants are shown in table 1 note that we used the spherical symmetry of the problem and introduced r which was the distance from the center of the aggregate r 0 r r was the radius of the aggregate the balance concentration of disinfectants within the aggregate cd r was computed by the following model mattle et al 2011 3 c d r c d 0 i 0 k 2 r d i 0 k 2 r d where i0 is the modified bessel function abramowitz 1988 d denotes the diffusion constant of the disinfectants in water d 1 1 10 9 m2 s 1 gharagheizi and sattari 2009 cd is the disinfectant concentration k2 is the rate at which disinfectant molecules are removed from the solution by reacting with or adsorbing on the fungal spores the size of fungal spores is much larger than that of virus it would therefore take 0 02 s for the disinfection concentration to reach a balance over the size of the largest aggregates diffusion goes as dt 1 2 in our study the balance was thus achieved before the first measurement was taken 1 min therefore the model can be used to characterize the change of disinfectant concentration in fungal aggregation this model demonstrated the time scale of fungal spore inactivation was not related to the time of disinfectant penetration spores within an aggregate were thus subject to a disinfectant concentration that was constant in time but dependent on the position within the fungal spore aggregate in this model the concentration of disinfectant diffused to the center of the aggregates in a negative gradient in other words the average concentration of disinfectant in the aggregate was getting lower with the increase of aggregate size the model of aggregates effect on disinfection was as follows mattle et al 2011 4 c v r t c v 0 e k 1 t c d 0 i 0 k 2 r d i 0 k 2 r d α where cv is the concentration of fungal spores after t min of inactivation k1 is the inactivation rate constant and the order in cd is α 0 82 the simplified formula is as follows 5 c v r t c v 0 e k 1 t c d 0 r r 1 2 α within the framework of the model the results showed that the concentration of disinfectant diffusion in the aggregates decreased with the increase of the size of the aggregates this further leaded to a lower inactivation rate constant for aggregated spores due to the negative gradient of disinfectants concentration diffused to the center of the aggregates which allowed the innermost spores of aggregates to survive longer than dispersed fungal spores in addition chemical signals molecules between aggregates might increase the resistance of microbial to disinfectants li et al 2020 the quorum sensing qs phenomenon of fungi was firstly found in the pathogenic polymorphic fungal histoplasma capsulatum in 2000 kugler et al 2000 some studies found that the quorum sensing molecules qsms of fungi could regulate the transformation of fungal phase biofilm formation drug resistance gene expression the secretion of virulence factors and the production of antibiotics padder et al 2018 currently verified fungal qsms included alcohols lipoxylates small molecule peptides and certain volatile substances farnesol was a kind of qsms which had been deeply studied at present it could affect the morphological transformation biofilm formation oxidative stress induce fungal apoptosis control drug excretion and so on westwater et al reported that farnesol was related to oxidative stress and the concentration of 40 100 μmol l 1 farnesol could protect candida albicans from oxidative stress of h2o2 plumbagin and menadione by up regulating the expression of some genes related to oxidative stress such as superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat westwater et al 2005 lipoxygenase lox in aspergillus was the key of fatty acid metabolism pathway lox and p po protein regulated the qs of a flavus and lox or p po mutation will change the density dependent nuclei and conidia conversion and affect toxin production brown et al 2008 it is possible that the aggregated aspergillus spores could secrete the chemical signal molecules in response to environmental stress disinfectants attack thus increasing the resistance of the aggregated aspergillus spores to disinfectants the mechanism of chemical signal molecules between aggregates on improving the resistance of microbial to disinfectants was unclear due to the complexity of this process it needs further study about this question in the future 4 conclusion the conclusions from this study are as follows 1 the ph value lowered below the isoelectric point of the fungal spores and at neutral or slightly alkaline condition the fungal spores were easier to be aggregated due to the negative charge on the spore surface was reduced and the formation of viscous extracellular polymers on the outer surface of spores 2 the resistance of the fungal spore aggregates to disinfectants increased with the increase of aggregation degree of spores and the inactivation rate constant of aggregated spores decreased 4 6 fold compared with monodispersed spores 3 the lower proportion of membrane damage and high intracellular reactive oxygen species level for aggregated spores than monodisperse spores was observed after chlorine based disinfectants treatment and the proportion of membrane permeable spores and high ros level increased more slowly with the increase of aggregation degree of fungal spores 4 the inactivation efficiency of three chlorine based disinfectants on different aggregation degree of fungi followed the order of chlorine dioxide monochloramine chlorine the percentage of membrane permeability and the proportion of high intracellular ros level of different aggregated fungal spores by three chlorine based disinfectants also followed the order

16662,with the transformation of lake ecosystem from clear water to turbid water the residual phosphorus p accumulated in sediments may slow down the process of aquatic ecological restoration and the related mechanisms are complex and need to be better understood in this study high resolution systematic investigation and analysis of p binding forms in the sediments showed that lake dianchi the largest plateau lake in southwest china was enriched with naoh rp hcl p and res p but depleted in nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp the bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp were the main contributors to potential p release from sediments while the release potential of nh4cl p was relatively weak 1 when the external p loading gradually decreased the internal p loading of lake dianchi was estimated to be 522 mg p m2 a in the past 30 years the succession of grass algae type in lake dianchi coincided with reduced absorption and transformation of potential mobile p and decreased accumulation of stable p especially the res p meanwhile the temporal variation of potential mobile p was a good predictor of ecological degradation and reduced ecosystem sustainability in lake dianchi graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sedimentary p binding forms accumulation release mechanisms ecological factors lake dianchi 1 introduction globally eutrophication has become one of the most significant environmental problems in lakes ngatia et al 2017 according to lin et al 2021 54 53 46 and 28 of lakes in asia europe north america and africa are facing this situation respectively phosphorus p an essential nutrient element which is required to maintain the primary productivity of lake ecosystem has long been considered as a limiting factor of eutrophication lin et al 2017 anthropogenic p input not only causes ecological problems such as algal blooms development of hypoxia in the bottom water loss of biodiversity and increased toxicity to aquatic organisms haygarth et al 2005 santos et al 2015 huang et al 2018 but also leads to p accumulation in lake sediments parsons et al 2017 thus to reduce lake eutrophication and restore water ecology there is need to effectively control the rate at which anthropogenic p is transported to lakes although many efforts have been made to reduce the external p load in lakes wang et al 2019 it is inevitable that changes of biogeochemical and physical processes in lakes bottom water or sediments can result in the release of the accumulated p in sediments into the water column which would further delay the recovery of lake ecosystems suffering from eutrophication cavalcante et al 2018 therefore knowledge on the release and or accumulation mechanisms of sedimentary p is important for elucidating the continuous eutrophication of lakes and also informs management actions that can reduce p levels in the sediments lake sediments play a critical role in determining the fate of p dittrich et al 2013 generally the release of p is controlled by various mobilization and transport processes tammeorg et al 2016 which are driven by factors such as redox conditions temperature and ph bioturbation sediment resuspension and degradation of p enriched sediments etc lake et al 2007 song et al 2017 li et al 2019 in contrast fractions of p that cannot be released will be accumulated or permanently buried in sediments as an archive to reflect historical changes in pressures of the lake ecosystems ni and wang 2015 sediment cores can not only record human activities in the watershed and changes in water environment but could also provide vital information on the evolution of lake water and factors influencing its ecology summers et al 2017 jin et al 2020 at present current research on p biogeochemistry in lakes sediment cores have focused on emphasizing the importance of internal p loading into lakes tammeorg et al 2015 2016 2017 horppila et al 2017 the release and burial mechanism of p binding forms in sediments dittrich et al 2013 doan et al 2018 markovic et al 2019 and the driving mechanism of human activities and climate change on sedimentary p diagenesis chen et al 2020 etc however there are few studies to elucidate the interaction mechanism between release accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms and changes of other ecological factors such as aquatic plants phytoplankton fish and zoobenthos when there are changes in the lake ecosystem from grass type clear water to algae type turbid water the study by klamt et al 2019 showed that a shift from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance can affect the sedimentary p forms but the relevant mechanism is still unclear therefore an in depth research and discussion in this area is essential to find a favorable theoretical basis for the restoration of lake water ecology lake dianchi the largest plateau lake in southwest china is one of the world s most eutrophic lakes characterized by high p contents in the water with annual algal blooms cao et al 2016 although the water quality has improved after decades of intensive restoration efforts it is not as obvious as expected wang et al 2014 which could be mainly attributed to the effect of internal p loading from the lake sediments wu et al 2018a therefore this study combines high resolution systematic sampling of sediments and analysis of p binding forms in the sediment cores as well as the historical changes of ecological factors to investigate 1 the importance and mechanism of p release from sediments and 2 the response mechanism between p accumulation in sediments and ecological factors during the changes of lake dianchi ecosystem our study focuses on the influences of internal p loading on eutrophication and reconstructs the relationship between diagenesis mechanisms of sedimentary p and changes of the lake ecosystem in lake dianchi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake dianchi 24º40 25º02 n 102º36 102º47 e fig 1 is a semi closed lake in china s yunnan guizhou plateau with an elevation of 1886 m a watershed of 2920 km2 and an average water volume of 1 56 109 m3 the lake covers the surface area of 310 km2 and extends 40 4 km north to south with a width of 7 km west to east with an average water depth of 5 0 m and a shoreline of 163 2 km it is artificially divided into two parts caohai north near the urban area of kunming city and waihai south bordered by an intensively managed farmland which respectively accounts for 3 5 and 96 5 of the total lake surface according to the geographical location the whole lake dianchi can also be divided into caohai northern waihai central waihai and southern waihai he et al 2015 there are 29 main rivers flowing into the lake including 7 rivers into caohai and 22 rivers into the waihai and 2 outlets of the lake including xiyuan tunnel in caohai outflow 1 fig 1 and haikou station in waihai outflow 2 fig 1 water discharge at two outlets accounts for 20 outflow 1 and 80 outflow 2 of the annual total outflows 4 0 108 m3 in lake dianchi the water retention time of the lake is about 3 5 years with poor self purification capacity zhang et al 2016 lake dianchi was dominated by southwest wind throughout the year and the annual average wind velocity gradually increased from 2 5 m s before 2000 to 3 0 m s in 2010 chen et al 2020 2 2 sample collection in may 2013 36 sediment cores were collected from four regions of the lake fig 1 using a gravity corer length 100 cm internal diameter 10 cm the cores were sealed on site kept in a vertical position and protected from light and then immediately transported to the laboratory for sectioning in the laboratory the cores were sectioned at intervals of 0 2 2 5 5 8 8 12 12 16 16 20 cm under inert n2 atmosphere and were immediately stored in sterile sealable plastic bags freeze dried for 7 days ground and passed through a 100 mesh sieve for the analysis of organic matter om and p binding forms 2 3 analytical methods the sediment p binding forms were analyzed by p fractionation method proposed by hupfer et al 2009 this was done on freeze dried samples to better ensure the homogeneity and representativeness of the sediment samples briefly these sediments were subjected to sequential chemical extraction with 1 0 mol l nh4cl 25 0 5 h 0 11 mol l nahco3 na2s2o4 bicarbonate dithionite bd 40 1 h 1 0 mol l naoh 25 16 h 0 5 mol l hcl 25 16 h and 1 0 mol l naoh 85 2 h the sediment p fractions are operationally defined as nh4cl p loosely adsorbed p bd p redox sensitive p bound to fe and mn oxyhydroxides naoh rp p bound to hydrated oxides of aluminum clays naoh nrp organic bound p hcl p calcium bound p and res p residual p the detailed procedure is described in fig s1 of the supplementary material the ratio of sediments to water volume was 1 50 the extracts were centrifuged and the supernatants were filtered through a 0 45 µm pore size phosphorus free membrane the nh4cl p bd p hcl p and res p extracts were digested with potassium peroxodisulfate k2s2o8 for the determination of tp liu et al 2009 the naoh rp extract was for the determination of srp naoh nrp was the difference between naoh tp and naoh rp fig s1 the content of p in the extracts was determined by molybdenum blue method in addition the content of sedimentary tp was also determined by standard measurement and test smt ruban et al 1999 the recovery rate of sequential extraction method was 88 to 119 in this study the average error between tp content and sum of the sedimentary p fractions was less than 5 here we define nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp as potential mobile p and naoh rp hcl p and res p as stable p according to the characteristics of p binding forms om in sediments was estimated based on the loss on ignition after 2 h of calcination at 500 murphy et al 2001 2 4 the release contribution of sedimentary p binding previous studies had shown that the release rate of p in sediment cores could be expressed by the variation of p content in surface and other layers of sediments dittrich et al 2013 markovic et al 2019 if the difference of p content in surface and other layers of sediments is positive it means that this form of p is mainly released conversely when the difference is negative it means that this form of p is mainly retained the equation of release contribution can be expressed as li et al 2016 1 release contribution c s u r f a c e c o t h e r p o s i t i v e i 1 n c s u r f a c e c o t h e r p o s i t i v e 100 where c s u r f a c e represents the content of p binding forms in 0 2cm sedimentary layer c o t h e r represents the content of p binding forms in other 2 5 5 8 8 12 12 16 16 20 cm sedimentary layers n is nh4cl p bd p naoh nrp naoh rp hcl p and res p 2 5 calculations of p accumulation loads the accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms was be calculated as follows 2 p l c s v s t s 10 2 where p l is the accumulation load of each p fraction g m2 c s is the average concentration of each p fraction in the sedimentary layer mg kg v s is p accumulation rate g cm2 a t s is the accumulation time of sediments a while 10 2 is the conversion factor v s and t s are calculated based on the determination of 137cs dating zhang et al 2009 and these are reported in table 1 the total accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms in the whole lake was expressed as 3 p l t i 1 n p l i a i 10 6 where p l t is total accumulation load of each p fraction in the corresponding deposition layer t p l i is the accumulation of each p fraction in the sediment layer at the i th monitoring point g m2 a i is the spatial interpolation area of p l i obtained by arcgis at the i th monitoring point m2 i is the monitoring point i 1 2 3 n 2 6 total internal p loading the total internal p loading i p t o t in lake dianchi was calculated by comparing mass balance computed p retention r m a s s and sediment derived p retention r s e d the equation can be expressed as nürnberg 1984 modified by tammeorg et al 2017 4 i p t o t t p i n r s e d r m a s s r s e d where i p t o t is total internal p loading mg p m2 a representing the portion of tp once entered lake but not buried in the sediments t p i n is the total inputs loading of p r m a s s mg p m2 a was calculated from the difference between total inputs here due to the limitation of data collection only rivers input and atmospheric deposition were included and outputs quantified by the two outlets water withdrawals and evaporations of tp in lake dianchi li et al 2016 ren et al 2019 wu et al 2018b ding et al 2019 r s e d mg p m2 a was the product of the sedimentation rate with the tp content of the sediments dillon and evans 1993 a detailed description of these equations can be found in tammeorg et al 2016 2017 and horppila et al 2017 2 7 ecological factors the historical data of ecological factors in lake dianchi were collected from the literatures for details please refer to table 2 table s1 1 1 2 and 1 3 3 results 3 1 sedimentary om contents in lake dianchi the contents of sedimentary om in all the investigated sediment cores ranged from 0 13 to 64 9 with an average of 11 5 spatially the average sedimentary om content in the caohai 29 3 was about three times that of waihai 9 52 while the mean value 3 19 in the northeast waihai was the lowest fig 2 a historically the average content of sedimentary om was lower considering the relatively long period of deposition fig 2b in the sediments of lake dianchi the average om content 9 72 between 1964 and 1970 was 30 lower than that in 2005 2013 13 8 however the contents of om in the central and southern caohai were higher in the sedimentary layers corresponding to year 1964 1970 which were 53 6 and 64 9 respectively fig 2b 3 2 potential mobile p stable p and tp in the sediments of lake dianchi the average concentrations of nh4cl p 2 7 mg kg bd p 183 mg kg and naoh nrp 146 mg kg accounted for 0 82 0 17 of tp 55 12 of tp and 44 9 2 of tp of the potential mobile p respectively the average concentration of nh4cl p was the highest 20 3 mg kg near the estuary of panlong river in northern waihai followed by that 4 2 mg kg in caohai and some areas north of huiwan and baoxiang river while the lowest nh4cl p content 1 3 mg kg was found in the central and southern waihai fig 3 a the average concentration of nh4cl p in 1986 2013 was higher about 1 6 times than that in 1964 1986 and the average value of nh4cl p tp gradually decreased as the deposition time increases fig 4 a the average concentration of bd p was two orders of magnitude higher than that of nh4cl p the highest values mean 290 124 mg kg n 36 were observed in the caohai huiwan and the estuary of panlong river while the lowest values mean 100 68 mg kg n 42 were observed in the northeastern shore of waihai fig 3b comparatively the bd p contents in the northwest coast and central lake area of waihai were significantly higher than that in northeastern shore and southern lake area compared with the average concentration of bd p in 1977 2013 the average bd p value in 1964 1977 significantly decreased by 26 and the variation trend p 0 05 of bd p tp with sedimentary age was similar to that p 0 05 of nh4cl p tp fig 4b moreover the average concentration of naoh nrp was second only to bd p in areas with high naoh nrp such as the caohai and haikou there was a general downward trend p 0 05 and p 0 01 in the average naoh nrp content as the deposition age increases fig s2a on the contrary the average concentrations of naoh nrp increased simultaneously with sedimentary age in areas with low naoh nrp contents including some areas of southern waihai fig s2a thus the variation tendency of naoh nrp tp with sedimentary age was different from that of nh4cl p tp and bd p tp and the average concentration of naoh nrp during the depositional period of 1964 1970 increased by 8 compared to that of 1970 1977 fig 4c in addition there was a significant positive correlation p 0 01 r 0 429 n 165 between naoh nrp and om in sediments of the whole lake dianchi in the sediments of lake dianchi the average concentrations of naoh rp 365 mg kg hcl p 663 mg kg and res p 226 mg kg accounted for 29 23 of tp 53 42 of tp and 18 14 of tp of the stable p respectively the average concentration of naoh rp was observed to be the highest 2050 mg kg near the estuary of panlong river in northern waihai followed by that 875 mg kg in northern caohai while the lowest 144 mg kg was recorded in the southern caohai and northeastern shore of waihai in the rest of northern waihai and most of the southern area of the lake the mean naoh rp values were 357 mg kg and 317 mg kg respectively fig 3d in most areas of northern waihai the average content of naoh rp showed a downward trend p 0 01 as the sedimentary age increases especially in 1964 1986 fig s2b however in most of the southern lake the average naoh rp concentration increased simultaneously with sedimentary age fig s2b thus the average naoh rp tp value in the whole lake sediments was relatively stable with the increase of sedimentary age fig 4d moreover there were significant positive correlations between naoh rp and nh4cl p p 0 01 r 0 811 n 171 and naoh rp and bd p p 0 01 r 0 526 n 171 in this study the average content of hcl p was the highest among all the p forms and the highest values mean 1005 529 mg kg n 48 which accounted for 52 of tp were observed in southern waihai the lowest values mean 311 130 mg kg n 30 were observed in northeastern shore of waihai fig 3e with the increase of sedimentary age the average concentration trend of sedimentary hcl p first increased significantly from 2013 to 1986 p 0 05 and then decreased with no statistical significance p 0 16 from 1986 to 1964 fig 4e the lowest average concentration of hcl p appeared in the two depositional ages of 1964 1970 and 2005 2013 with an average of 559 mg kg and 544 mg kg respectively the highest content average 781 mg kg occurred in 1986 1994 res p also known as the inert p was the most stable p comprising mostly of the insoluble p and stable organic p in this study res p was the highest average 706 558 mg kg n 6 occurred in the area near gucheng river estuary the lowest average 90 53 mg kg n 6 appeared near the daqing river estuary and fluctuated between 113 mg kg and 342 mg kg in the remaining lake areas fig 3f the average concentration of res p in the whole lake sediments showed an overall increasing trend p 0 01 as the deposition age increases and the average res p value increased to 280 mg kg during the deposition period of 1964 1970 fig 4f overall the sedimentary tp in lake dianchi varied from 351 mg kg to 4571 mg kg highest tp concentrations 2000 mg kg were observed in the center of caohai the estuary of panlong river and the estuary of gucheng river and lowest tp concentrations 1000 mg kg were recorded in the northeastern coast of waihai fig 3g the average tp concentration in sediments was 1434 mg kg in 1964 1970 increased to 1718 mg kg in 1986 1994 and decreased further in 2005 2013 fig 4g 3 3 release of sedimentary p binding forms it was found that the release potential of p binding forms from the sediment cores varied with changes in the depositional age of sediments in the whole lake dianchi fig 5 the release contribution of sedimentary bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp ranged from 36 to 100 22 44 and 19 34 respectively the release contribution of sedimentary nh4cl p and hcl p were relatively low being 1 and 8 8 respectively 3 4 the total accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms in the sedimentary age from 1964 to 2013 the total tp load in the sediments of lake dianchi was 1 42 104 t of which the total potentially mobile and buried load accounted for 18 and 82 of tp respectively the total loads of nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp ranged from 0 73 t to 3 33 t 75 9 361 t and 57 4 331 t respectively the total loads of naoh rp hcl p and res p ranged from 107 t to 850 t 210 1600 t and 66 6 765 t respectively based on the analysis of sedimentary p load contribution in lake dianchi we found that the total load contribution distribution of potential mobile p was similar i e since the 1970s and 1980s the load contribution of three forms of sedimentary p had shown a gradually increasing trend nh4cl p p 0 01 bd p p 0 05 and naoh nrp p 0 05 fig 6 however the total load contribution of stable p varied with the depositional age i e the turning point of total load contribution of naoh rp hcl p and res p all appeared in the 1980s 1990s which lagged nearly 10 years behind that of potential mobile p fig 6 3 5 total internal p loading in lake dianchi in this study based on our mass balance calculation the r m a s s was estimated that approximately 73 t a of tp which accounted for 23 of the total inflow load was retained in lake dianchi however the r s e d obtained from the dated sediment core was about 149 t a which was higher than the r m a s s the result was consistent with most previous studies e g engstrom et al 2009 furthermore the average i p t o t in lake dianchi was estimated to be about 522 mg p m2 a in the past 30 years 3 6 historical changes of ecological factors historical data showed that with the gradual deterioration of water quality aquatic plants in lake dianchi entered a rapid degradation period in 1970s 1980s table s1 1 and their species and distribution area ratio decreased by 58 and 74 compared with that in 1960s respectively table 2 after the 1990s aquatic plants entered the end of degradation and their distribution area proportion in the whole lake remained at a low level 2 table 2 correspondingly the dominant species of aquatic plants in lake dianchi had gradually changed from ottelia acuminata to potamogeton pectinatus table s1 1 and due to the deterioration of water quality the dominant community of phytoplankton in lake dianchi had also gradually changed from chlorophyta and bacillariophyta to cyanophyta microcystis table s1 2 although the species of algae in lake dianchi decreased in recent decades their density cells l increased by nearly two orders of magnitude compared with that in the 1970s and 1980s table 2 in addition alien fish species gradually replaced indigenous fish as the dominant fish species in lake dianchi at the 1980s it is worth noting that with the deepening of eutrophication in lake dianchi the number of alien and indigenous fish species decreased in 2010 table s1 2 the historical change characteristics of zoobenthos in lake dianchi were similar to those of aquatic plants algae and fish specifically some species have declined or even become extinct such as spongilla carteri and spongilla sp while pollution tolerant species have increased table s1 3 4 discussion 4 1 importance of sediment internal p loading in the lake dianchi when water quality in the lake changes from oligotrophic to eutrophic the variation mechanism of sedimentary p with depth gradually changes from diagenetic burial type to potential p release type rydin et al 2011 thus when the external sources of p to lakes gradually decreases the lake sediments may become an internal source of total p to the overlying water column welch and cooke 1995 even if internal p loading from the sediment is eventually decreased the previously released fractions would continue to play an important role in p budget of the water body jarvie et al 2013 and can promote the increase of tp and soluble reactive p srp concentrations and algae biomass in the lake water bormans et al 2016 generally the greater the difference between r s e d and r m a s s the more important the internal p loading in the lake dillon and evans 1993 mainly because the dynamics of sedimentary p in lakes are closely correlated to the lake s trophic status kowalczewska madura et al 2015 here it is difficult to exclusively quantify the internal p loading due to complexity of the lake ecosystem although we have used a combination of survey and historical data to roughly estimate the internal p loading in lake dianchi there are still some uncertainties in the quantification of r s e d and r m a s s for example a lake wind and waves could affect the accuracy of sediment chronology especially the assessment of sedimentation rate tammeorg et al 2016 and b the post depositional migration of p within the sediments especially upward diffusion of bd p could take place and interfere with the evaluation of internal loading ostrofsky 2012 and so on therefore these factors should be considered when quantifying internal p loading from sediments in this study the result average 522 mg p m2 a was roughly estimated to be within the range 77 1663 mg p m2 a reported for internal p loading in global eutrophic lakes tammeorg et al 2017 and was comparable with those reported for lake erhai 551 mg p m2 a wang 2013 and lake loch leven 547 mg p m2 a spears et al 2006 according to tammeorg et al 2017 the internal p loading contribution due to anoxia in lakes was 37 at the global scale applying this ratio to lake dianchi approximately 193 mg p m2 a were released from anoxic sediments nevertheless the release of sedimentary p under aerobic conditions might also account for the internal p loading in lake dianchi even though aerobic sediments had been reported to exhibit characteristic high p binding capacity jensen et al 1992 to a large extent aerobic p release could occur due to changes in temperature ph facilitated by water turbulence and the resulting resuspended sediments and decomposed sedimentary om horppila and nurminen 2003 søndergaard et al 2003 these factors can regulate the internal p loading of the lake by affecting the accumulation or release of sedimentary p binding forms for example sediments resuspension could increase alkaline phosphatase activity apa which could accelerate the degradation of naoh nrp in surface sediments newman et al 1992 thus promoting the diffusion of bioavailable p from interstitial water into the overlying water body increasing the concentration of particulate p in lake water volume and thereby promoting the development of cyanobacterial blooms zou et al 2020 consequently the migration and transformation of sedimentary p binding forms might have had an important contribution to the internal p loading in the lake in this study it can be concluded from sections 3 2 that nh4cl p bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp in the sediment cores from lake dianchi gradually decreased as the deposition age depth increases indicating a limited capacity of the sediments to retain p upon burial fig 4a b c and d suggesting that the mineralization and degradation release of the different forms of p would promote the increase loading of internal p thereby causing the deterioration of water quality and delay the recovery of lake ecosystem over a longer period of time 4 2 mechanisms of p release from sediments in the lake dianchi in general the difference of p content in the top two layers of sediments cores was considered to be fast release short term release while the change in p content between the surface and bottom layers was called slow release long term release dittrich et al 2013 in this study the approximate time scales of the fast and slow p release from the sediment layers are 19 a and 49 a respectively the nh4cl p is mainly adsorbed on the surface of mineral particles in sediments and can be released easily into the water body when environmental conditions changes rydin et al 2011 the contents of nh4cl p average 2 7 mg kg in sediments and the release contribution ratio 1 were the lowest in lake dianchi which indicated that the potential release of nh4cl p would play a limited role in the increase concentration of p in the sediment interstitial water in particular the release contribution of nh4cl p in the short term release period indicated that the release of nh4cl p might have been already finished within the time frame corresponding to the top two sediment layers bd p was the most abundant component 55 of potential labile p in sediment its mobility is easily affected by the redox conditions at the sediment water interface dan et al 2020 the concentrations of bd p in the whole lake dianchi sediments showed a gradual decrease as deposition age increases and its concentration decreased by 33 during the long term release period although the proportion of bd p among the sedimentary p binding forms was relatively low considering the whole lake dianchi 3 5 22 fig 4b its release contribution in each sedimentary age was relatively high and particularly obvious during the short term release period fig 5 sedimentary bd p had a very weak correlation with the concentration of srp in the interstitial water p 0 05 r 0 173 n 153 fig s3a but there was no significant correlation between bd p in surface sediments and srp in the overlying water fig s3c which indicates that sedimentary bd p release do not directly affect the quality of overlying water in lake dianchi although the released bd p from sediments under anoxic conditions could become bioavailable and affect the concentration of p in the overlying water amirbahman et al 2013 anaerobic do 2 mg l conditions rarely occur in shallow lakes like lake dianchi liu et al 2014 wu et al 2017 therefore this indicated that the release process of bd p can be overshadowed by the complex p cycle at the sediment water interface the naoh nrp is mainly derived from the deposition of biological organisms including organic p compounds such as humic acid bound p phosphate monoester phosphodiester pyrophosphate and polyphosphate paludan and jensen 1995 under the conditions of high nitrogen loading especially ammonium the oxygen deficit and microbial activities naoh nrp could be mineralized into orthophosphate which was a potential source of internal p load from sediments ma et al 2018 markovic et al 2019 the release contribution of sedimentary naoh nrp in the whole lake dianchi varied in each depositional age which was 0 22 44 36 and 27 respectively fig 5 obviously its release contribution first showed an increasing trend and then decreased as the deposition age increases suggesting naoh nrp was the main contributor to the difference between p at the surface and 8 12cm sediment layers of the sediment cores in lake dianchi the naoh nrp component was an indicator of microbial activity in the sediments jaschinski et al 2011 and its reduction mainly resulted from microbial degradation ahlgren et al 2005 so the 8 12cm sediment layer in the sediment cores of lake dianchi might be subjected to strong microbial activities which caused gradual degradation and release of naoh nrp however it has been reported that microbial phosphatase activity in surface sediments was higher than that in deep layers in many lakes from the usa and europe wobus et al 2003 theoretically the naoh nrp content in surface sediments was less than that in the deep layer due to microbial degradation but this was not the case so this indicates that the upward migration of sedimentary naoh nrp occupied a major proportion when the external p input into the lake is effectively controlled moreover om was an important carrier of naoh nrp and its adhesion and microbial degradation would also directly affect the content of naoh nrp in sediments wu et al 2018a the positive correlation p 0 01 r 0 242 n 153 between sedimentary naoh nrp and dissolved organic p dop fig s3b in the interstitial water indicates that the degradation and release of sedimentary naoh nrp in lake dianchi promoted the increase of dop concentration to a certain extent in the interstitial water the naoh rp could reflect p burial in the sediments ahlgren et al 2005 generally naoh rp was considered to be the most refractory form of p but it might also be released under special circumstances such as anaerobic conditions and high ph lukkari et al 2007 in sediment cores of the whole lake dianchi the release contribution distribution of naoh rp was similar to that of bd p but opposite to that of naoh nrp except for the short term release period fig 5 the lowest release contribution 19 of naoh rp was estimated by the difference between p at the surface and 8 12cm sediment layers suggesting the increase of naoh rp content in this sedimentary layer may be caused by the degradation and release of naoh nrp although the naoh rp was generally considered to be inert it can be mutually transformed to a certain extent into bd p and the reduction and release of bd p could also promote the increase of nh4cl p in the sediments jiang et al 2008 the hcl p is usually associated with calcium apatite and carbonates and cannot be readily released and biologically utilized under normal conditions but can be released only when the sedimentary environment is weakly acidic ph 6 jin et al 2006 the release contribution of sedimentary hcl p in the whole lake dianchi was 8 8 only in the long term release stage fig 5 which indicated that the partial release of hcl p in this depositional age might be caused by the low ph in the sediments however previous investigations showed that the ph in sediments of lake dianchi decreased with the increase of depth in the 0 10cm sedimentary layer and then increased slightly with the increase of depth ranging from 6 8 to 8 5 gao et al 2004 therefore the decrease of hcl p in the long term release stage may be caused by the participation of this p form in the transformation of other p finally res p is the most stable p also known as inert p most of which are composed of insoluble and stable organic p cavalcante et al 2018 in the sediments of lake dianchi the res p was always buried and no release contribution was found overall our findings suggest in eutrophic lakes such as lake dianchi sedimentary bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp could have greater release potentials while the potential of nh4cl p release from sediment was relatively small the hcl p and res p were usually retained in sediments and participated in the sedimentary diagenetic process of p although we have tried clarifying the release mechanism of sedimentary p binding forms in the above discussion the mechanism of p migration and transformation involved is still at a qualitative level thus the effective quantification of the transformation and migration of different p forms is uncertain some previous studies had reported that small increase in sedimentary hcl p might be attributed to the release of bd p and mineralization of naoh nrp huser and pilgrim 2014 lin et al 2017 however it is not clear which process dominates while sedimentary hcl p increases at present only few studies have quantified the conversion and migration rates of sedimentary p binding forms therefore it is difficult to deepen the understanding of this aspect without further systematic investigation and analysis by using other geochemical means such as phosphate oxygen isotope technology δ18op in sediments jaisi et al 2011 4 3 ecological driving factors of p accumulation in sediments as the lake eutrophication increases the ecological structure of lake dianchi will inevitably change from a stable state to an unstable state studies have shown that the deterioration of water quality will affect the composition structure and function of ecosystem communities and may as well result in the degradation or disappearance of some ecosystem functions li et al 2014 however it is unclear whether the changes of these ecological factors such as aquatic plants phytoplankton fish and zoobenthos played a driving role in the accumulation of p binding forms in lake sediments so far there are few relevant research reports therefore it is scientifically significant to explore the interaction mechanism between the accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms and the changes of ecological factors with the deterioration of water quality the aquatic plants in lake dianchi have been degraded on a large scale in recent decades and after the 1970s aquatic plants in lake dianchi were only distributed in the lakeside area and shallow coastal zone li et al 2014 interestingly the period of large scale degradation of aquatic plants coincided with the inflection point of total load contribution of potential mobile p fig 6 and afterwards it was also observed that the total load contribution of potential mobile p increased with the decrease of the proportion of aquatic plants distribution area this indicates that the degradation of aquatic plants may reduce the absorption and transformation of nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp in the sediments and increase the release risk of potential mobile p resulting in an increase of p concentration in the interstitial water thus affecting the water quality of lake dianchi ding et al 2016 previous investigation found that the shift from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance increased the accumulation rates of sedimentary res p klamt et al 2019 in lake dianchi the total load contribution of sedimentary res p increased only slightly after the degradation of aquatic plants fig 6 table 2 table s1 1 which may be due to co precipitation of algal cells with carbonates hartley et al 1995 or sedimentation of algal debris cao et al 2016 in addition submersed macrophyte vallisneria spiralis has been reported to reduce the content of sedimentary naoh rp because of its developed root system wang et al 2018 but the degradation of aquatic plants did not promote the increase of the total load contribution of sedimentary naoh rp in lake dianchi on the contrary the decrease of sedimentary naoh rp content might be affected by ph in the 8 20cm sediment layer of lake dianchi gao et al 2004 because when the ph in the sediment was 7 5 the relatively low ph may contribute to the formation and stability of naoh rp olila and reddy 1995 this suggests that the accumulation of sedimentary naoh rp was less sensitive to changes in the distribution ratio of aquatic plants and its accumulation time turning point appeared at the end of aquatic plants degradation table s1 1 which was later than that of potential mobile p similarly the inflection points of sedimentary hcl p accumulation time also appeared at the end of aquatic plants degradation and studies showed that the removal efficiency of hcl p by aquatic plants was significantly higher than that of bd p and naoh nrp li et al 2021 which indicated the degradation of aquatic plants largely increased the accumulation load contribution of sedimentary hcl p from 1964 to 1994 fig 6 in addition previous studies also showed that nutrients could be stored in aquatic plants for a long time after being absorbed with a significant effect on sediment stabilization marchand et al 2010 li et al 2014 therefore the survival of aquatic plants plays an important role in the accumulation and release of p binding forms in lake sediments compared with aquatic plants algae have a shorter growth cycle and both the growth and death periods occur simultaneously after microbial degradation and mineralization dead algae could release inorganic n and p into the water which would later participate in the next nutrient cycle cao et al 2016 in lake dianchi the correlation p 0 05 between algal density and total load contribution of potential mobile p especially nh4cl p and naoh nrp indicates that the increase of algal density promotes the accumulation of potential mobile p and may also increase the release risk of sedimentary p benthos are one of the most important biological components in aquatic ecosystem and play an important role in nutrient cycling in lake dianchi habitat destruction and the deterioration of water quality led to the widespread disappearance of aquatic plants and the outbreak of cyanobacteria li et al 2014 meanwhile the community structure of benthos has also changed significantly obviously in the past few decades benthic animals have gradually replaced gastropoda by two pollution tolerant organisms of oligochaeta and chironomidae table s1 3 moreover the increase of pollution resistant organisms may be responsible for the reduction of sediment stability by accelerating the oxidation of the surface sediments in lake dianchi thereby promoting the transformation of hcl p to nh4cl p and bd p li et al 2020 this may partly explain the decrease of the total load contribution of sedimentary hcl p in the past 30 years fig 6 in addition the degradation of aquatic plants could also lead to the loss of fish habitat and the reduction of the number of indigenous fish species in lake dianchi table s1 2 as a result the regulation of fish on p balance in the lake was gradually weakened despite the invasion of alien fish species yogev et al 2020 in the process of lake eutrophication the succession of grass algae type has led to the decrease of species the simplification of community structure and the increase of pollution tolerant organisms in lake dianchi furthermore previous reports have demonstrated that the internal loading process of sedimentary p in algal dominated areas was stronger than that in macrophyte dominated areas resulting in sediments tending to gradually change from sink to source of p in lake water during the succession from grass type to algae type ding et al 2015 and references therein therefore in the face of a two way deterioration trend of aquatic environment and regional species diversity in lake dianchi it is important to pay more attention to the protection of lake ecosystems and species diversity on the basis of controlling the external source load so as to effectively control the internal source pollution 5 conclusions by analyzing the composition of p binding forms in the sediment cores we found that lake dianchi was enriched with naoh rp hcl p and res p but depleted in nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp the bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp were the main contributors to the potential release p in the sediments of lake dianchi and their contribution ranges were 36 100 0 44 and 0 34 respectively the potential release contribution of nh4cl p was relatively weak 1 moreover when the external p loading gradually decreased the internal p loading of lake dianchi was estimated to be 522 mg p m2 a in the past 30 years the degradation of aquatic plants coincided with reduced absorption and transformation of nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp and with decreased accumulation of res p the increase in pollution tolerant organisms such as oligochaeta and chironomidae went along with an accelerated the transformation of different forms of p especially the hcl p and other p forms by reconstructing the relationship between sedimentary p binding forms and changes in lake ecosystem this study shows that the temporal variation of potential mobile p coincides with ecological degradation and reduced

16662,with the transformation of lake ecosystem from clear water to turbid water the residual phosphorus p accumulated in sediments may slow down the process of aquatic ecological restoration and the related mechanisms are complex and need to be better understood in this study high resolution systematic investigation and analysis of p binding forms in the sediments showed that lake dianchi the largest plateau lake in southwest china was enriched with naoh rp hcl p and res p but depleted in nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp the bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp were the main contributors to potential p release from sediments while the release potential of nh4cl p was relatively weak 1 when the external p loading gradually decreased the internal p loading of lake dianchi was estimated to be 522 mg p m2 a in the past 30 years the succession of grass algae type in lake dianchi coincided with reduced absorption and transformation of potential mobile p and decreased accumulation of stable p especially the res p meanwhile the temporal variation of potential mobile p was a good predictor of ecological degradation and reduced ecosystem sustainability in lake dianchi graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sedimentary p binding forms accumulation release mechanisms ecological factors lake dianchi 1 introduction globally eutrophication has become one of the most significant environmental problems in lakes ngatia et al 2017 according to lin et al 2021 54 53 46 and 28 of lakes in asia europe north america and africa are facing this situation respectively phosphorus p an essential nutrient element which is required to maintain the primary productivity of lake ecosystem has long been considered as a limiting factor of eutrophication lin et al 2017 anthropogenic p input not only causes ecological problems such as algal blooms development of hypoxia in the bottom water loss of biodiversity and increased toxicity to aquatic organisms haygarth et al 2005 santos et al 2015 huang et al 2018 but also leads to p accumulation in lake sediments parsons et al 2017 thus to reduce lake eutrophication and restore water ecology there is need to effectively control the rate at which anthropogenic p is transported to lakes although many efforts have been made to reduce the external p load in lakes wang et al 2019 it is inevitable that changes of biogeochemical and physical processes in lakes bottom water or sediments can result in the release of the accumulated p in sediments into the water column which would further delay the recovery of lake ecosystems suffering from eutrophication cavalcante et al 2018 therefore knowledge on the release and or accumulation mechanisms of sedimentary p is important for elucidating the continuous eutrophication of lakes and also informs management actions that can reduce p levels in the sediments lake sediments play a critical role in determining the fate of p dittrich et al 2013 generally the release of p is controlled by various mobilization and transport processes tammeorg et al 2016 which are driven by factors such as redox conditions temperature and ph bioturbation sediment resuspension and degradation of p enriched sediments etc lake et al 2007 song et al 2017 li et al 2019 in contrast fractions of p that cannot be released will be accumulated or permanently buried in sediments as an archive to reflect historical changes in pressures of the lake ecosystems ni and wang 2015 sediment cores can not only record human activities in the watershed and changes in water environment but could also provide vital information on the evolution of lake water and factors influencing its ecology summers et al 2017 jin et al 2020 at present current research on p biogeochemistry in lakes sediment cores have focused on emphasizing the importance of internal p loading into lakes tammeorg et al 2015 2016 2017 horppila et al 2017 the release and burial mechanism of p binding forms in sediments dittrich et al 2013 doan et al 2018 markovic et al 2019 and the driving mechanism of human activities and climate change on sedimentary p diagenesis chen et al 2020 etc however there are few studies to elucidate the interaction mechanism between release accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms and changes of other ecological factors such as aquatic plants phytoplankton fish and zoobenthos when there are changes in the lake ecosystem from grass type clear water to algae type turbid water the study by klamt et al 2019 showed that a shift from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance can affect the sedimentary p forms but the relevant mechanism is still unclear therefore an in depth research and discussion in this area is essential to find a favorable theoretical basis for the restoration of lake water ecology lake dianchi the largest plateau lake in southwest china is one of the world s most eutrophic lakes characterized by high p contents in the water with annual algal blooms cao et al 2016 although the water quality has improved after decades of intensive restoration efforts it is not as obvious as expected wang et al 2014 which could be mainly attributed to the effect of internal p loading from the lake sediments wu et al 2018a therefore this study combines high resolution systematic sampling of sediments and analysis of p binding forms in the sediment cores as well as the historical changes of ecological factors to investigate 1 the importance and mechanism of p release from sediments and 2 the response mechanism between p accumulation in sediments and ecological factors during the changes of lake dianchi ecosystem our study focuses on the influences of internal p loading on eutrophication and reconstructs the relationship between diagenesis mechanisms of sedimentary p and changes of the lake ecosystem in lake dianchi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lake dianchi 24º40 25º02 n 102º36 102º47 e fig 1 is a semi closed lake in china s yunnan guizhou plateau with an elevation of 1886 m a watershed of 2920 km2 and an average water volume of 1 56 109 m3 the lake covers the surface area of 310 km2 and extends 40 4 km north to south with a width of 7 km west to east with an average water depth of 5 0 m and a shoreline of 163 2 km it is artificially divided into two parts caohai north near the urban area of kunming city and waihai south bordered by an intensively managed farmland which respectively accounts for 3 5 and 96 5 of the total lake surface according to the geographical location the whole lake dianchi can also be divided into caohai northern waihai central waihai and southern waihai he et al 2015 there are 29 main rivers flowing into the lake including 7 rivers into caohai and 22 rivers into the waihai and 2 outlets of the lake including xiyuan tunnel in caohai outflow 1 fig 1 and haikou station in waihai outflow 2 fig 1 water discharge at two outlets accounts for 20 outflow 1 and 80 outflow 2 of the annual total outflows 4 0 108 m3 in lake dianchi the water retention time of the lake is about 3 5 years with poor self purification capacity zhang et al 2016 lake dianchi was dominated by southwest wind throughout the year and the annual average wind velocity gradually increased from 2 5 m s before 2000 to 3 0 m s in 2010 chen et al 2020 2 2 sample collection in may 2013 36 sediment cores were collected from four regions of the lake fig 1 using a gravity corer length 100 cm internal diameter 10 cm the cores were sealed on site kept in a vertical position and protected from light and then immediately transported to the laboratory for sectioning in the laboratory the cores were sectioned at intervals of 0 2 2 5 5 8 8 12 12 16 16 20 cm under inert n2 atmosphere and were immediately stored in sterile sealable plastic bags freeze dried for 7 days ground and passed through a 100 mesh sieve for the analysis of organic matter om and p binding forms 2 3 analytical methods the sediment p binding forms were analyzed by p fractionation method proposed by hupfer et al 2009 this was done on freeze dried samples to better ensure the homogeneity and representativeness of the sediment samples briefly these sediments were subjected to sequential chemical extraction with 1 0 mol l nh4cl 25 0 5 h 0 11 mol l nahco3 na2s2o4 bicarbonate dithionite bd 40 1 h 1 0 mol l naoh 25 16 h 0 5 mol l hcl 25 16 h and 1 0 mol l naoh 85 2 h the sediment p fractions are operationally defined as nh4cl p loosely adsorbed p bd p redox sensitive p bound to fe and mn oxyhydroxides naoh rp p bound to hydrated oxides of aluminum clays naoh nrp organic bound p hcl p calcium bound p and res p residual p the detailed procedure is described in fig s1 of the supplementary material the ratio of sediments to water volume was 1 50 the extracts were centrifuged and the supernatants were filtered through a 0 45 µm pore size phosphorus free membrane the nh4cl p bd p hcl p and res p extracts were digested with potassium peroxodisulfate k2s2o8 for the determination of tp liu et al 2009 the naoh rp extract was for the determination of srp naoh nrp was the difference between naoh tp and naoh rp fig s1 the content of p in the extracts was determined by molybdenum blue method in addition the content of sedimentary tp was also determined by standard measurement and test smt ruban et al 1999 the recovery rate of sequential extraction method was 88 to 119 in this study the average error between tp content and sum of the sedimentary p fractions was less than 5 here we define nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp as potential mobile p and naoh rp hcl p and res p as stable p according to the characteristics of p binding forms om in sediments was estimated based on the loss on ignition after 2 h of calcination at 500 murphy et al 2001 2 4 the release contribution of sedimentary p binding previous studies had shown that the release rate of p in sediment cores could be expressed by the variation of p content in surface and other layers of sediments dittrich et al 2013 markovic et al 2019 if the difference of p content in surface and other layers of sediments is positive it means that this form of p is mainly released conversely when the difference is negative it means that this form of p is mainly retained the equation of release contribution can be expressed as li et al 2016 1 release contribution c s u

represents the content of p binding forms in other 2 5 5 8 8 12 12 16 16 20 cm sedimentary layers n is nh4cl p bd p naoh nrp naoh rp hcl p and res p 2 5 calculations of p accumulation loads the accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms was be calculated as follows 2 p l c s v s t s 10 2 where p l is the accumulation load of each p fraction g m2 c s is the average concentration of each p fraction in the sedimentary layer mg kg v s is p accumulation rate g cm2 a t s is the accumulation time of sediments a while 10 2 is the conversion factor v s and t s are calculated based on the determination of 137cs dating zhang et al 2009 and these are reported in table 1 the total accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms in the whole lake was expressed as 3 p l t i 1 n p l i a i 10 6 where p l t is total accumulation load of each p fraction in the corresponding deposition layer t p l i is the accumulation of each p fraction in the sediment layer at the i th monitoring point g m2 a

the total inputs loading of p r m a s s mg p m2 a was calculated from the difference between total inputs here due to the limitation of data collection only rivers input and atmospheric deposition were included and outputs quantified by the two outlets water withdrawals and evaporations of tp in lake dianchi li et al 2016 ren et al 2019 wu et al 2018b ding et al 2019 r s e d mg p m2 a was the product of the sedimentation rate with the tp content of the sediments dillon and evans 1993 a detailed description of these equations can be found in tammeorg et al 2016 2017 and horppila et al 2017 2 7 ecological factors the historical data of ecological factors in lake dianchi were collected from the literatures for details please refer to table 2 table s1 1 1 2 and 1 3 3 results 3 1 sedimentary om contents in lake dianchi the contents of sedimentary om in all the investigated sediment cores ranged from 0 13 to 64 9 with an average of 11 5 spatially the average sedimentary om content in the caohai 29 3 was about three times that of waihai 9 52 while the mean value 3 19 in the northeast waihai was the lowest fig 2 a historically the average content of sedimentary om was lower considering the relatively long period of deposition fig 2b in the sediments of lake dianchi the average om content 9 72 between 1964 and 1970 was 30 lower than that in 2005 2013 13 8 however the contents of om in the central and southern caohai were higher in the sedimentary layers corresponding to year 1964 1970 which were 53 6 and 64 9 respectively fig 2b 3 2 potential mobile p stable p and tp in the sediments of lake dianchi the average concentrations of nh4cl p 2 7 mg kg bd p 183 mg kg and naoh nrp 146 mg kg accounted for 0 82 0 17 of tp 55 12 of tp and 44 9 2 of tp of the potential mobile p respectively the average concentration of nh4cl p was the highest 20 3 mg kg near the estuary of panlong river in northern waihai followed by that 4 2 mg kg in caohai and some areas north of huiwan and baoxiang river while the lowest nh4cl p content 1 3 mg kg was found in the central and southern waihai fig 3 a the average concentration of nh4cl p in 1986 2013 was higher about 1 6 times than that in 1964 1986 and the average value of nh4cl p tp gradually decreased as the deposition time increases fig 4 a the average concentration of bd p was two orders of magnitude higher than that of nh4cl p the highest values mean 290 124 mg kg n 36 were observed in the caohai huiwan and the estuary of panlong river while the lowest values mean 100 68 mg kg n 42 were observed in the northeastern shore of waihai fig 3b comparatively the bd p contents in the northwest coast and central lake area of waihai were significantly higher than that in northeastern shore and southern lake area compared with the average concentration of bd p in 1977 2013 the average bd p value in 1964 1977 significantly decreased by 26 and the variation trend p 0 05 of bd p tp with sedimentary age was similar to that p 0 05 of nh4cl p tp fig 4b moreover the average concentration of naoh nrp was second only to bd p in areas with high naoh nrp such as the caohai and haikou there was a general downward trend p 0 05 and p 0 01 in the average naoh nrp content as the deposition age increases fig s2a on the contrary the average concentrations of naoh nrp increased simultaneously with sedimentary age in areas with low naoh nrp contents including some areas of southern waihai fig s2a thus the variation tendency of naoh nrp tp with sedimentary age was different from that of nh4cl p tp and bd p tp and the average concentration of naoh nrp during the depositional period of 1964 1970 increased by 8 compared to that of 1970 1977 fig 4c in addition there was a significant positive correlation p 0 01 r 0 429 n 165 between naoh nrp and om in sediments of the whole lake dianchi in the sediments of lake dianchi the average concentrations of naoh rp 365 mg kg hcl p 663 mg kg and res p 226 mg kg accounted for 29 23 of tp 53 42 of tp and 18 14 of tp of the stable p respectively the average concentration of naoh rp was observed to be the highest 2050 mg kg near the estuary of panlong river in northern waihai followed by that 875 mg kg in northern caohai while the lowest 144 mg kg was recorded in the southern caohai and northeastern shore of waihai in the rest of northern waihai and most of the southern area of the lake the mean naoh rp values were 357 mg kg and 317 mg kg respectively fig 3d in most areas of northern waihai the average content of naoh rp showed a downward trend p 0 01 as the sedimentary age increases especially in 1964 1986 fig s2b however in most of the southern lake the average naoh rp concentration increased simultaneously with sedimentary age fig s2b thus the average naoh rp tp value in the whole lake sediments was relatively stable with the increase of sedimentary age fig 4d moreover there were significant positive correlations between naoh rp and nh4cl p p 0 01 r 0 811 n 171 and naoh rp and bd p p 0 01 r 0 526 n 171 in this study the average content of hcl p was the highest among all the p forms and the highest values mean 1005 529 mg kg n 48 which accounted for 52 of tp were observed in southern waihai the lowest values mean 311 130 mg kg n 30 were observed in northeastern shore of waihai fig 3e with the increase of sedimentary age the average concentration trend of sedimentary hcl p first increased significantly from 2013 to 1986 p 0 05 and then decreased with no statistical significance p 0 16 from 1986 to 1964 fig 4e the lowest average concentration of hcl p appeared in the two depositional ages of 1964 1970 and 2005 2013 with an average of 559 mg kg and 544 mg kg respectively the highest content average 781 mg kg occurred in 1986 1994 res p also known as the inert p was the most stable p comprising mostly of the insoluble p and stable organic p in this study res p was the highest average 706 558 mg kg n 6 occurred in the area near gucheng river estuary the lowest average 90 53 mg kg n 6 appeared near the daqing river estuary and fluctuated between 113 mg kg and 342 mg kg in the remaining lake areas fig 3f the average concentration of res p in the whole lake sediments showed an overall increasing trend p 0 01 as the deposition age increases and the average res p value increased to 280 mg kg during the deposition period of 1964 1970 fig 4f overall the sedimentary tp in lake dianchi varied from 351 mg kg to 4571 mg kg highest tp concentrations 2000 mg kg were observed in the center of caohai the estuary of panlong river and the estuary of gucheng river and lowest tp concentrations 1000 mg kg were recorded in the northeastern coast of waihai fig 3g the average tp concentration in sediments was 1434 mg kg in 1964 1970 increased to 1718 mg kg in 1986 1994 and decreased further in 2005 2013 fig 4g 3 3 release of sedimentary p binding forms it was found that the release potential of p binding forms from the sediment cores varied with changes in the depositional age of sediments in the whole lake dianchi fig 5 the release contribution of sedimentary bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp ranged from 36 to 100 22 44 and 19 34 respectively the release contribution of sedimentary nh4cl p and hcl p were relatively low being 1 and 8 8 respectively 3 4 the total accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms in the sedimentary age from 1964 to 2013 the total tp load in the sediments of lake dianchi was 1 42 104 t of which the total potentially mobile and buried load accounted for 18 and 82 of tp respectively the total loads of nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp ranged from 0 73 t to 3 33 t 75 9 361 t and 57 4 331 t respectively the total loads of naoh rp hcl p and res p ranged from 107 t to 850 t 210 1600 t and 66 6 765 t respectively based on the analysis of sedimentary p load contribution in lake dianchi we found that the total load contribution distribution of potential mobile p was similar i e since the 1970s and 1980s the load contribution of three forms of sedimentary p had shown a gradually increasing trend nh4cl p p 0 01 bd p p 0 05 and naoh nrp p 0 05 fig 6 however the total load contribution of stable p varied with the depositional age i e the turning point of total load contribution of naoh rp hcl p and res p all appeared in the 1980s 1990s which lagged nearly 10 years behind that of potential mobile p fig 6 3 5 total internal p loading in lake dianchi in this study based on our mass balance calculation the r m a s s was estimated that approximately 73 t a of tp which accounted for 23 of the total inflow load was retained in lake dianchi however the r s e d obtained from the dated sediment core was about 149 t a which was higher than the r m a s s the result was consistent with most previous studies e g engstrom et al 2009 furthermore the average i p t o t in lake dianchi was estimated to be about 522 mg p m2 a in the past 30 years 3 6 historical changes of ecological factors historical data showed that with the gradual deterioration of water quality aquatic plants in lake dianchi entered a rapid degradation period in 1970s 1980s table s1 1 and their species and distribution area ratio decreased by 58 and 74 compared with that in 1960s respectively table 2 after the 1990s aquatic plants entered the end of degradation and their distribution area proportion in the whole lake remained at a low level 2 table 2 correspondingly the dominant species of aquatic plants in lake dianchi had gradually changed from ottelia acuminata to potamogeton pectinatus table s1 1 and due to the deterioration of water quality the dominant community of phytoplankton in lake dianchi had also gradually changed from chlorophyta and bacillariophyta to cyanophyta microcystis table s1 2 although the species of algae in lake dianchi decreased in recent decades their density cells l increased by nearly two orders of magnitude compared with that in the 1970s and 1980s table 2 in addition alien fish species gradually replaced indigenous fish as the dominant fish species in lake dianchi at the 1980s it is worth noting that with the deepening of eutrophication in lake dianchi the number of alien and indigenous fish species decreased in 2010 table s1 2 the historical change characteristics of zoobenthos in lake dianchi were similar to those of aquatic plants algae and fish specifically some species have declined or even become extinct such as spongilla carteri and spongilla sp while pollution tolerant species have increased table s1 3 4 discussion 4 1 importance of sediment internal p loading in the lake dianchi when water quality in the lake changes from oligotrophic to eutrophic the variation mechanism of sedimentary p with depth gradually changes from diagenetic burial type to potential p release type rydin et al 2011 thus when the external sources of p to lakes gradually decreases the lake sediments may become an internal source of total p to the overlying water column welch and cooke 1995 even if internal p loading from the sediment is eventually decreased the previously released fractions would continue to play an important role in p budget of the water body jarvie et al 2013 and can promote the increase of tp and soluble reactive p srp concentrations and algae biomass in the lake water bormans et al 2016 generally the greater the difference between r s e d and r m a s s the more important the internal p loading in the lake dillon and evans 1993 mainly because the dynamics of sedimentary p in lakes are closely correlated to the lake s trophic status kowalczewska madura et al 2015 here it is difficult to exclusively quantify the internal p loading due to complexity of the lake ecosystem although we have used a combination of survey and historical data to roughly estimate the internal p loading in lake dianchi there are still some uncertainties in the quantification of r s e d and r m a s s for example a lake wind and waves could affect the accuracy of sediment chronology especially the assessment of sedimentation rate tammeorg et al 2016 and b the post depositional migration of p within the sediments especially upward diffusion of bd p could take place and interfere with the evaluation of internal loading ostrofsky 2012 and so on therefore these factors should be considered when quantifying internal p loading from sediments in this study the result average 522 mg p m2 a was roughly estimated to be within the range 77 1663 mg p m2 a reported for internal p loading in global eutrophic lakes tammeorg et al 2017 and was comparable with those reported for lake erhai 551 mg p m2 a wang 2013 and lake loch leven 547 mg p m2 a spears et al 2006 according to tammeorg et al 2017 the internal p loading contribution due to anoxia in lakes was 37 at the global scale applying this ratio to lake dianchi approximately 193 mg p m2 a were released from anoxic sediments nevertheless the release of sedimentary p under aerobic conditions might also account for the internal p loading in lake dianchi even though aerobic sediments had been reported to exhibit characteristic high p binding capacity jensen et al 1992 to a large extent aerobic p release could occur due to changes in temperature ph facilitated by water turbulence and the resulting resuspended sediments and decomposed sedimentary om horppila and nurminen 2003 søndergaard et al 2003 these factors can regulate the internal p loading of the lake by affecting the accumulation or release of sedimentary p binding forms for example sediments resuspension could increase alkaline phosphatase activity apa which could accelerate the degradation of naoh nrp in surface sediments newman et al 1992 thus promoting the diffusion of bioavailable p from interstitial water into the overlying water body increasing the concentration of particulate p in lake water volume and thereby promoting the development of cyanobacterial blooms zou et al 2020 consequently the migration and transformation of sedimentary p binding forms might have had an important contribution to the internal p loading in the lake in this study it can be concluded from sections 3 2 that nh4cl p bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp in the sediment cores from lake dianchi gradually decreased as the deposition age depth increases indicating a limited capacity of the sediments to retain p upon burial fig 4a b c and d suggesting that the mineralization and degradation release of the different forms of p would promote the increase loading of internal p thereby causing the deterioration of water quality and delay the recovery of lake ecosystem over a longer period of time 4 2 mechanisms of p release from sediments in the lake dianchi in general the difference of p content in the top two layers of sediments cores was considered to be fast release short term release while the change in p content between the surface and bottom layers was called slow release long term release dittrich et al 2013 in this study the approximate time scales of the fast and slow p release from the sediment layers are 19 a and 49 a respectively the nh4cl p is mainly adsorbed on the surface of mineral particles in sediments and can be released easily into the water body when environmental conditions changes rydin et al 2011 the contents of nh4cl p average 2 7 mg kg in sediments and the release contribution ratio 1 were the lowest in lake dianchi which indicated that the potential release of nh4cl p would play a limited role in the increase concentration of p in the sediment interstitial water in particular the release contribution of nh4cl p in the short term release period indicated that the release of nh4cl p might have been already finished within the time frame corresponding to the top two sediment layers bd p was the most abundant component 55 of potential labile p in sediment its mobility is easily affected by the redox conditions at the sediment water interface dan et al 2020 the concentrations of bd p in the whole lake dianchi sediments showed a gradual decrease as deposition age increases and its concentration decreased by 33 during the long term release period although the proportion of bd p among the sedimentary p binding forms was relatively low considering the whole lake dianchi 3 5 22 fig 4b its release contribution in each sedimentary age was relatively high and particularly obvious during the short term release period fig 5 sedimentary bd p had a very weak correlation with the concentration of srp in the interstitial water p 0 05 r 0 173 n 153 fig s3a but there was no significant correlation between bd p in surface sediments and srp in the overlying water fig s3c which indicates that sedimentary bd p release do not directly affect the quality of overlying water in lake dianchi although the released bd p from sediments under anoxic conditions could become bioavailable and affect the concentration of p in the overlying water amirbahman et al 2013 anaerobic do 2 mg l conditions rarely occur in shallow lakes like lake dianchi liu et al 2014 wu et al 2017 therefore this indicated that the release process of bd p can be overshadowed by the complex p cycle at the sediment water interface the naoh nrp is mainly derived from the deposition of biological organisms including organic p compounds such as humic acid bound p phosphate monoester phosphodiester pyrophosphate and polyphosphate paludan and jensen 1995 under the conditions of high nitrogen loading especially ammonium the oxygen deficit and microbial activities naoh nrp could be mineralized into orthophosphate which was a potential source of internal p load from sediments ma et al 2018 markovic et al 2019 the release contribution of sedimentary naoh nrp in the whole lake dianchi varied in each depositional age which was 0 22 44 36 and 27 respectively fig 5 obviously its release contribution first showed an increasing trend and then decreased as the deposition age increases suggesting naoh nrp was the main contributor to the difference between p at the surface and 8 12cm sediment layers of the sediment cores in lake dianchi the naoh nrp component was an indicator of microbial activity in the sediments jaschinski et al 2011 and its reduction mainly resulted from microbial degradation ahlgren et al 2005 so the 8 12cm sediment layer in the sediment cores of lake dianchi might be subjected to strong microbial activities which caused gradual degradation and release of naoh nrp however it has been reported that microbial phosphatase activity in surface sediments was higher than that in deep layers in many lakes from the usa and europe wobus et al 2003 theoretically the naoh nrp content in surface sediments was less than that in the deep layer due to microbial degradation but this was not the case so this indicates that the upward migration of sedimentary naoh nrp occupied a major proportion when the external p input into the lake is effectively controlled moreover om was an important carrier of naoh nrp and its adhesion and microbial degradation would also directly affect the content of naoh nrp in sediments wu et al 2018a the positive correlation p 0 01 r 0 242 n 153 between sedimentary naoh nrp and dissolved organic p dop fig s3b in the interstitial water indicates that the degradation and release of sedimentary naoh nrp in lake dianchi promoted the increase of dop concentration to a certain extent in the interstitial water the naoh rp could reflect p burial in the sediments ahlgren et al 2005 generally naoh rp was considered to be the most refractory form of p but it might also be released under special circumstances such as anaerobic conditions and high ph lukkari et al 2007 in sediment cores of the whole lake dianchi the release contribution distribution of naoh rp was similar to that of bd p but opposite to that of naoh nrp except for the short term release period fig 5 the lowest release contribution 19 of naoh rp was estimated by the difference between p at the surface and 8 12cm sediment layers suggesting the increase of naoh rp content in this sedimentary layer may be caused by the degradation and release of naoh nrp although the naoh rp was generally considered to be inert it can be mutually transformed to a certain extent into bd p and the reduction and release of bd p could also promote the increase of nh4cl p in the sediments jiang et al 2008 the hcl p is usually associated with calcium apatite and carbonates and cannot be readily released and biologically utilized under normal conditions but can be released only when the sedimentary environment is weakly acidic ph 6 jin et al 2006 the release contribution of sedimentary hcl p in the whole lake dianchi was 8 8 only in the long term release stage fig 5 which indicated that the partial release of hcl p in this depositional age might be caused by the low ph in the sediments however previous investigations showed that the ph in sediments of lake dianchi decreased with the increase of depth in the 0 10cm sedimentary layer and then increased slightly with the increase of depth ranging from 6 8 to 8 5 gao et al 2004 therefore the decrease of hcl p in the long term release stage may be caused by the participation of this p form in the transformation of other p finally res p is the most stable p also known as inert p most of which are composed of insoluble and stable organic p cavalcante et al 2018 in the sediments of lake dianchi the res p was always buried and no release contribution was found overall our findings suggest in eutrophic lakes such as lake dianchi sedimentary bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp could have greater release potentials while the potential of nh4cl p release from sediment was relatively small the hcl p and res p were usually retained in sediments and participated in the sedimentary diagenetic process of p although we have tried clarifying the release mechanism of sedimentary p binding forms in the above discussion the mechanism of p migration and transformation involved is still at a qualitative level thus the effective quantification of the transformation and migration of different p forms is uncertain some previous studies had reported that small increase in sedimentary hcl p might be attributed to the release of bd p and mineralization of naoh nrp huser and pilgrim 2014 lin et al 2017 however it is not clear which process dominates while sedimentary hcl p increases at present only few studies have quantified the conversion and migration rates of sedimentary p binding forms therefore it is difficult to deepen the understanding of this aspect without further systematic investigation and analysis by using other geochemical means such as phosphate oxygen isotope technology δ18op in sediments jaisi et al 2011 4 3 ecological driving factors of p accumulation in sediments as the lake eutrophication increases the ecological structure of lake dianchi will inevitably change from a stable state to an unstable state studies have shown that the deterioration of water quality will affect the composition structure and function of ecosystem communities and may as well result in the degradation or disappearance of some ecosystem functions li et al 2014 however it is unclear whether the changes of these ecological factors such as aquatic plants phytoplankton fish and zoobenthos played a driving role in the accumulation of p binding forms in lake sediments so far there are few relevant research reports therefore it is scientifically significant to explore the interaction mechanism between the accumulation of sedimentary p binding forms and the changes of ecological factors with the deterioration of water quality the aquatic plants in lake dianchi have been degraded on a large scale in recent decades and after the 1970s aquatic plants in lake dianchi were only distributed in the lakeside area and shallow coastal zone li et al 2014 interestingly the period of large scale degradation of aquatic plants coincided with the inflection point of total load contribution of potential mobile p fig 6 and afterwards it was also observed that the total load contribution of potential mobile p increased with the decrease of the proportion of aquatic plants distribution area this indicates that the degradation of aquatic plants may reduce the absorption and transformation of nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp in the sediments and increase the release risk of potential mobile p resulting in an increase of p concentration in the interstitial water thus affecting the water quality of lake dianchi ding et al 2016 previous investigation found that the shift from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance increased the accumulation rates of sedimentary res p klamt et al 2019 in lake dianchi the total load contribution of sedimentary res p increased only slightly after the degradation of aquatic plants fig 6 table 2 table s1 1 which may be due to co precipitation of algal cells with carbonates hartley et al 1995 or sedimentation of algal debris cao et al 2016 in addition submersed macrophyte vallisneria spiralis has been reported to reduce the content of sedimentary naoh rp because of its developed root system wang et al 2018 but the degradation of aquatic plants did not promote the increase of the total load contribution of sedimentary naoh rp in lake dianchi on the contrary the decrease of sedimentary naoh rp content might be affected by ph in the 8 20cm sediment layer of lake dianchi gao et al 2004 because when the ph in the sediment was 7 5 the relatively low ph may contribute to the formation and stability of naoh rp olila and reddy 1995 this suggests that the accumulation of sedimentary naoh rp was less sensitive to changes in the distribution ratio of aquatic plants and its accumulation time turning point appeared at the end of aquatic plants degradation table s1 1 which was later than that of potential mobile p similarly the inflection points of sedimentary hcl p accumulation time also appeared at the end of aquatic plants degradation and studies showed that the removal efficiency of hcl p by aquatic plants was significantly higher than that of bd p and naoh nrp li et al 2021 which indicated the degradation of aquatic plants largely increased the accumulation load contribution of sedimentary hcl p from 1964 to 1994 fig 6 in addition previous studies also showed that nutrients could be stored in aquatic plants for a long time after being absorbed with a significant effect on sediment stabilization marchand et al 2010 li et al 2014 therefore the survival of aquatic plants plays an important role in the accumulation and release of p binding forms in lake sediments compared with aquatic plants algae have a shorter growth cycle and both the growth and death periods occur simultaneously after microbial degradation and mineralization dead algae could release inorganic n and p into the water which would later participate in the next nutrient cycle cao et al 2016 in lake dianchi the correlation p 0 05 between algal density and total load contribution of potential mobile p especially nh4cl p and naoh nrp indicates that the increase of algal density promotes the accumulation of potential mobile p and may also increase the release risk of sedimentary p benthos are one of the most important biological components in aquatic ecosystem and play an important role in nutrient cycling in lake dianchi habitat destruction and the deterioration of water quality led to the widespread disappearance of aquatic plants and the outbreak of cyanobacteria li et al 2014 meanwhile the community structure of benthos has also changed significantly obviously in the past few decades benthic animals have gradually replaced gastropoda by two pollution tolerant organisms of oligochaeta and chironomidae table s1 3 moreover the increase of pollution resistant organisms may be responsible for the reduction of sediment stability by accelerating the oxidation of the surface sediments in lake dianchi thereby promoting the transformation of hcl p to nh4cl p and bd p li et al 2020 this may partly explain the decrease of the total load contribution of sedimentary hcl p in the past 30 years fig 6 in addition the degradation of aquatic plants could also lead to the loss of fish habitat and the reduction of the number of indigenous fish species in lake dianchi table s1 2 as a result the regulation of fish on p balance in the lake was gradually weakened despite the invasion of alien fish species yogev et al 2020 in the process of lake eutrophication the succession of grass algae type has led to the decrease of species the simplification of community structure and the increase of pollution tolerant organisms in lake dianchi furthermore previous reports have demonstrated that the internal loading process of sedimentary p in algal dominated areas was stronger than that in macrophyte dominated areas resulting in sediments tending to gradually change from sink to source of p in lake water during the succession from grass type to algae type ding et al 2015 and references therein therefore in the face of a two way deterioration trend of aquatic environment and regional species diversity in lake dianchi it is important to pay more attention to the protection of lake ecosystems and species diversity on the basis of controlling the external source load so as to effectively control the internal source pollution 5 conclusions by analyzing the composition of p binding forms in the sediment cores we found that lake dianchi was enriched with naoh rp hcl p and res p but depleted in nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp the bd p naoh nrp and naoh rp were the main contributors to the potential release p in the sediments of lake dianchi and their contribution ranges were 36 100 0 44 and 0 34 respectively the potential release contribution of nh4cl p was relatively weak 1 moreover when the external p loading gradually decreased the internal p loading of lake dianchi was estimated to be 522 mg p m2 a in the past 30 years the degradation of aquatic plants coincided with reduced absorption and transformation of nh4cl p bd p and naoh nrp and with decreased accumulation of res p the increase in pollution tolerant organisms such as oligochaeta and chironomidae went along with an accelerated the transformation of different forms of p especially the hcl p and other p forms by reconstructing the relationship between sedimentary p binding forms and changes in lake ecosystem this study shows that the temporal variation of potential mobile p coincides with ecological degradation and reduced

16663,methane ebullition and contamination are two typical characteristics from lakes however these two are generally studied independently in fact the exchange of matter and energy between methane bubbles and their surrounding environment can be very active to enhance the contaminant transport there is limited research on understanding the characteristics and trends of gas ebullition facilitated contaminant emissions in large areas considering water and air as receptors we herein estimate the transport capacity of methane ebullition for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs out of the sediment from global lakes which may reach an average of 71 up to 159 t yr 1 methane bubbles could transfer one third of the total pah flux from sediments or equivalent of 1 3 3 0 ng l 1 of additional pahs into the water column with the rest going into air offsetting from 52 to 118 of dry pah deposition flux into global lakes sediment per year given the pah concentration in lake water is often in the range of 0 1 100 ng l 1 ebullition facilitated pah flux may increase pah concentration by a factor of 1 4 to 2 4 until 2 100 being a significant contributor for the pah increment in lake waters keywords methane ebullition polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fluxes global lakes 1 introduction methane ebullition and contamination are two typical characteristics from lakes however these two are generally studied independently methane bubbles are produced primarily by the anaerobic decomposition of aquatic sediments liu et al 2018 which consist of a major proportion of methane with a balance of nitrogen carbon monoxide or oxygen casper et al 2000 keller and stallard 1994 methane is the second largest contributor for carbon based greenhouse gas ghg release gunthel et al 2019 whereas rivers and lakes are important sources for its production for the past three decades 1980 2009 kirschke et al 2013 methane emission from lakes was estimated about 8 48 tg ch4 yr 1 bastviken et al 2004 higher than that from the global ocean emission 5 25 tg of ch4 yr 1 weber et al 2019 ebullition and diffusion are the two main emission pathways delsontro et al 2016 sawakuchi et al 2014 with high spatiotemporal variabilities mcclure et al 2020 ebullition is episodic as compared to diffusion behaviors and accurate estimation of ebullition flux needs continuously sampling and monitoring davidson et al 2018 some studies have shown that methane ebullition often dominates the lake total ch4 flux making up 50 90 vol bastviken et al 2011 panneer selvam et al 2014 segarra et al 2013 and may be further enhanced by synergy between nutrients and warming davidson et al 2018 as a significant term in atmospheric ch4 budget ebullitive methane from lakes has been investigated separately to a lesser extent and contrastively mixed methane fluxes have been studied in many more cases which contain both ebullitive and diffusive flux sanches et al 2019 which are regulated by the interaction between physical properties e g temperature and system productivity which is further associated with nutrients such as phosphorus tp deemer et al 2016 west et al 2016 yvon durocher et al 2014 on the other hand its intermittent and temporal transport behaviors from the sediment layer and the exchange of matter and energy of the bubbles with their surroundings e g via the gas water interface are significantly ignored solute transport at the sediment water interface due to methane ebullition may be substantially promoted and effectively drives porewater convection which discharges sediment porewater into water column and enhances benthic pelagic coupling cheng et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the presence of even minor amounts of gas can increase the fluxes of poorly soluble species by several factors flury et al 2015 leading to the further contamination of overlaying water in lakes methane ebullition from sediment to water phase and then from water to gas phase via bubble burst provides two respective pathways for the release of solute facilitated by methane ebullition one pathway is initiated with gas phase partitioning and the other is initiated with the bubble surface adsorption with air and water as receptors these findings deepen understanding of relationships between methane production and the surrounding environment and bring insights for the vector effects of methane ebullition to redistribute organic pollutants at the sediment water gas interface apart from its global warming potential regardless of a few studies investigating the behaviors of gas ebullition on benthic solute exchange using conservative tracers such as fluoride klein 2006 or bromide flury et al 2015 details on methane ebullition facilitated flux of pollutants from lake sediments in situ are barely understood polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are ubiquitously distributed in global lakes with overall concentrations ranging from 0 159 33090 ng g 1 du and jing 2018 which could surpass chlorinated hydrocarbons in the threat they pose to aquatic biota in urban streams and lakes van metre and mahler 2005 ascribed to their hydrophobicity sediments are the main sink of pahs in lakes recent studies in an urban river and channel viana et al 2018 viana et al 2012 suggest that gas ebullition from the field is an important pathway for releasing pahs from buried sediments with as much as 0 2 mg of benzo a pyrene 1 2 mg of phenanthrene and 0 7 mg of pyrene released per liter of ebullitive gas due to both contaminants partitioning to gas bubbles and to sediment resuspension based on another study yuan et al 2007 significant amounts of pah contaminants 3 total sediment phenanthrene mass transport over 15 d sparging of methane bubbles at gas flux 183 l m 2 d 1 can be released from a sediment bed by gas movement showing a positive correlation to the gas volume these papers demonstrate significant pah fluxes from sediments facilitated by gas ebullition viana et al 2012 current relevant papers viana et al 2018 viana et al 2012 yuan et al 2007 provide limited understanding of pah fluxes facilitated by methane ebullition this article intends to understand the vector effects of methane bubbles on the migration of pollutants to understand the characteristics trends and mechanisms of pah fluxes facilitated by methane ebullition on a global scale which can serve as a prognostic indicator for other contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes and heavy metals delwiche et al 2020 the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the overall ebullitive methane budget and the overall pahs distribution then 2 to leverage an interconnection to derive their quantitative interactions and ultimately 3 to estimate the pah flux induced by methane bubbling from global lakes 2 methodology 2 1 ebullitive ch4 data acquisition fluxes of ch4 ebullition from lakes were acquired from literature in mg c m 2 d 1 for further data processing literature data search was carried out on google scholar and web of science with input of keywords ebullition methane ch4 lake and sediments in all possible combinations from september 2020 to june 2021 for a few cases multiple data were adopted from different collection points in one single lake in total 211 data n 211 of ch4 ebullition were applied for gis plotting arcmap 10 6 esri from 125 lakes among which 78 data points table s1 supporting information si were regenerated from their original ch4 total flux measurement via floating static chambers with gas chromatography gc li et al 2018 via calculation based on our developed prediction model n 67 ρ2 0 23 table s2 si to discriminate the flux of ebullition from its total emission 1 g f e b u l l 2 65 g f t o l 0 36 where gfebull

understand their quantitative correlations 2 2 arrhenius model of ebullitive ch4 flux some research deemer et al 2016 delsontro et al 2018 suggests that the chl a concentration plays a unique role correlated with methane emissions though most studies share the dominant view that methane emission from a wide range of freshwater ecosystems is primarily temperature driven aben et al 2017 delsontro et al 2016 mcginnis et al 2016 van bergen et al 2019 viana et al 2012 yvon durocher et al 2014 for example yvon durocher et al 2014 demonstrate that the temperature dependencies of methanogenesis ch4 production and ch4 emissions are substantially higher than two other key rate processes in the carbon cycle i e heterotrophic respiration and photosynthesis aben et al 2017 show that there exists a strong correlation between temperature and ebullition on a large geographical scale however through a disproportional increase in ebullition 6 20 per 1 c increase based on another study delsontro et al 2016 bubbling appears to be more sensitive to temperature compared to diffusive pathway the correlation studies between methane ebullition and temperature in the current paper also suggest that temperature significantly affects ebullition fig 2 modified arrhenius equation were applied aben et al 2017 to simulate ch4 ebullition fluxes as a function of water temperatures n 125 2 e t e 20 θ s t

al 2019 viana et al 2012 three groups of methane ebullition data namely g1 g2 and g3 were used for simulations to calculate the mean g1 upper g2 and lower g3 methane ebullition fluxes respectively g1 represents the whole dataset of methane ebullition collected from literature n 118 which were divided into 4 subsets dependent of their temperature profiles classified as 20 c 10 20 c 5 10 c and 5 c respectively to yield the arithmetic mean fluxes of methane ebullition which were then simulated by arrhenius model fig 2a likewise g2 n 34 and g3 n 84 represent the two complementary subsets of data from g1 with values higher for g2 and lower for g3 than the arrhenius model curve derived from g1 dataset fig 2a respectively which were then used to yield the corresponding upper and lower fluxes of methane ebullition via arrhenius models fig 2b c known that global lake thermal regions maberly et al 2020 present a strong relationship to climatic zones we herein made one to one mapping to assign the 4 temperature ranges corresponding to 4 latitudinal zones layden et al 2015 respectively i e 5 c generalizing the latitudinal zone of 66 5 10 c generalizing the latitudinal zone of 54 66 10 20 c

latitudinal zones tables s1 s4 7 si while the global lake areas under different latitudinal zones were referenced to bastviken et al 2011 these simulated results based on respective g1 g2 and g3 thus stands for the mean upper and lower methane ebullition fluxes corresponding to individual latitudinal zones of 24 24 54 54 66 and 66 fig 2d tables s4 7 si bastviken et al 2011 2 3 pah concentrations

from 6 artificial lakes bovan ćelije vrutci barje bojnik and garaši and one from 53 mediterranean shallow lakes the average of minimum and maximum values was taken if the pah concentration was given only a range continents of these lakes their latitudinal zones 24 24 54 54 66 and 66 and areas n 126 were also collected lake areas km2 were further classified into 0 001 0 01 0 01 0 1 0 1 1 1 10 10

lake attributes were calculated for comparison and error propagation 2 4 estimation of pah concentrations from global lakes the spatiotemporal distribution of pahs shows high variability du and jing 2018 the variation could be explained by multiple factors such as sources e g the pyrogenic or petrogenic origin climate to affect the wet and dry deposition and social economic factors policies industrialization population growth and energy consumption etc pertaining to the social economic influence pah concentrations in sediments to a certain degree are reconciled to unbalanced continent development the 20th century has seen rapid industrialization in some countries in asia and africa while a similar scenario occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries in europe and the americas as a result of these various industrial revolutions population growth and per capita consumption of energy more pahs are released into the terrestrial environment in the above mentioned geographical regions that eventually reached bodies of water partitioned into the sediments and served as sediment pah depots ramesh et al 2011 however there is no known proof to show significant correlations between pahs and their geographic latitude we herein adopted the average pah distribution across various continents to establish the modelling platform while the methane ebullition flux from different lakes for each continent were simulated differently according to their belonged latitudinal bands table s3 si it herein allows correlations of the two attributes i e pahs distribution and methane ebullition to derive the pah fluxes facilitated by methane ebullition world widely via data extraction and extrapolation 2 5 monte carlo modelling pah flux via methane bubbles pah transport via methane bubbles were modelled via assembling the two pathways mechanisms i e the portion with gas phase partitioning and the other with bubble surface adsorption with air and water as respective receptors we assume that pahs retained in the bubble gas will be 100 emitted to atmosphere through bubble explosion at the water gas interface while pahs adsorbed onto the bubble surface to be completely dissolved into the water phase during bubble migration through the water column note that particle resuspension can be facilitated by gas ebullition which may result in pah particle water partitioning to further influence the pah flux however is not accounted in this paper the pah flux dominated by the former pathway was assessed based on henry s law fendinger et al 1992 viana et al

individual pahs were adopted table s13 si the primary transport pathways for pahs include gas phase partitioning and interface adsorption simcik 2004 while the pah flux based on the latter pathway

methane bubbles may encounter obstacles e g suspended particles or water blooms during their ascending whereas pahs adsorbed onto the bubble surface are subjected to exchange these factors were not accounted for in the current study 2 6 projection of pah fluxes until 2100 projection of pah fluxes was performed by considering the methane ebullition flux and the pah emission as the two main factors for interaction however subjected to changes over time respectively we assumed a stable increase on ch4 emission from lakes per annum triggered by eutrophication beaulieu et al 2019 whereas the global warming effects are not concerned given that a lot of measures and efforts have been implemented to reduce the greenhouse gas ghg emission we speculate that climate change will be significantly inhibited in the future and there will be limited effects on the changes of ch4 ebullition from lakes aben et al 2017 in this paper normalized to the chl a concentration multiplication

atmospheric stabilization framework model asf scenario for integrated model to assess the greenhouse effect image scenario for multiregional approach for resource and industry allocation maria scenario for model for energy supply strategy alternatives and their general environmental impact message and scenario for mini climate assessment model minicam collectively as a1b scenarios to underlie technological emphasis on a balance across all energy sources between fossil and non fossil ones here we chose coal oil and biomass under the primary energy by fuel category in each scenario nakicenovic et al 2000 as the model sources as they are the major drivers to cause pah emissions shen et al 2013 we assumed that the variation among these fuel sources in conjunction with technology split over time bond et al 2007 would dominate the variation of pah emissions to achieve the time dependent fractions of the technology divisions ascribed to technology split associated with various fuels typical s shape curve models were often used bond et al 2007 shen et al 2013 6 x t x 0 x f e t t 0 2 2 s 2 x f where x0 and xf are initial and final fractions of a certain technology division respectively t0 is the start time of the technology transition and s is a rate here x0 and xf were assigned to 1 and 0 respectively while t0 and s was assumed to be dependent of regions t0 1907 s 35 for oecd90 region t0 1955 s 26 for ref region t0 1915 s 40 for asia region and t0 1907 s 35 for alm region nakicenovic et al 2000 the individual pah emission factors efpahs associated with all types of fuels coal oil or biomass were set to be constants based on two technology divisions namely uncontrolled consumption and controlled consumption respectively table s9 si ravindra et al 2008 shen et al 2013 meanwhile pahs deposition rate into the sediments was assumed to be strictly proportional to their annual emission in addition degradation of pahs overtime remediation efforts and uncontrollable factors such as governance and emission reduction policies were not considered in the estimate sediment varve was assumed at 0 4 cm yr 1 duan et al 2015 jenny et al 2013 slater et al 2013 yunker and macdonald 2003 while the sediment layer subjected to interference by methane bubbles was set as 20 cm in depth based on methanogenesis rates measured as a function of depth on a subset of lakes west et al 2016 which showed that sediment methane formation was dominated by the upper sediment with depth of 0 2 m joyce and jewell 2003 kelly and chynoweth 1981 schwarz et al 2008 wilkinson et al 2015 herein pah fluxes induced by methane bubbles for each specific year may be traced back to pah emissions in a half century earlier 2 7 model validation the pah distribution was estimated with large lakes glwd level1 50 km2 according to their individual latitudinal zones and continents respectively to yield two weighted averages table 1 i e the modelled mean via arrhenius model and the arithmetic mean which were then used for calculating global methane ebullition fluxes to further compare and validate with that estimated by batsviken et al 2004 studies on methane ebullition facilitated pah flux are extremely limited and reflect site specific characteristics validations of predicted pah fluxes facilitated by methane ebullition were performed with several datasets from 1 our earlier publication viana et al 2012 2 yuan et al 2007 and 3 our bench scale experiments via comparison between these various measurements and simulation results simulated with eqs 3 and 4 to perform relevant experiments in the laboratory column tests were set up fig s1 mixed pahs 16pahs grade of analytical reagents same concentration of each pah 2mg ml 1 were purchased from

was introduced with designed concentrations of individual pahs or their mixture before adding into the bottom of the column and then 300 ml water was gradually introduced to minimize sediment suspension a tap on the column side was used to collect water samples while the outlet was connected to a trap a sealed conical flask filled with n hexane to intercept escaped pahs if any a sparger was used to bubble gases from the bottom of the column simulated with 60 ch4 and 40 n2 yingju gas co ltd nanjing at the aeration rate of 2 ml min 1 for 6 h 1467l m 2 d 1 samples were collected from

in duplicate note 1 the column tests were conducted to represent typical sediment properties and 2 site specific considerations will affect gas ebullition rates and associated pah transport see viana et al 2012 and astm 2021 for more information 2 8 statistical analysis pared t tests were performed for correlations between gfebull and chl a tp tn and doc respectively kruskal wallis k w h tests were performed for pah concentrations acquired from literature to determine if there are statistically significant differences among the characteristic groups based on geographic classifications of latitude continent and the lake area welch t test were performed between our modelled individual pah fluxes with or without consideration of bubble interface adsorption while taking account of foc cpah gfebull from the field measurements and those measured ones viana et al 2018 suggesting no statistically significantly differences between each other with for both cases p 0 26 0 41 respectively with and without the term for bubble interface adsorption all p values in the study are two tailed statistical data analyses were carried out in r 3 6 3 and microsoft excel 2016 3 results 3 1 methane ebullition flux and pah concentrations from global lakes ebullition of methane from global lakes were generally latitude dependent fig 1 table s10 si such trend was notable from tropical 24 or boreal 66 lakes fig 1 where the ebullition fluxes from the former were found frequently above 10 74 or 100 mg c m 2 d 1 26 while from the latter was ubiquitously 100 capped within 100 mg c m 2 d 1 further examination of fluxes from the temperate zone 24 66 unveiled more irregular methane emission where the rate of 0 10 10 100 and 100 mg c m 2 d 1 accounted for 50 38 and 12 of data points respectively given the fact that a majority of global lakes 76 6 in area bastviken et al 2011 messager et al 2016 are from northern temperate zone 24 66 their ch4 ebullition fluxes have been further complicated

mixed trophic status palma silva et al 2013 which leads to their high variabilities fig 1 pah concentrations from lake sediments exhibit a high spacial heterogeneity for instance the pah concentrations can range from as low as 1 0 102 to as high as 5 4 105 ng g 1 from a single lake source debruyn et al 2009 fig 1 a majority of pah distributions from lake sediments demonstrate elusive links with their attributes a poor correlation ρ 0 013 between methane emission and pah concentration was herein conferred n 9 not a surprise temporal differences in pah emission also occur by the variation in onset of major industrial and economic growth at various localities which is highly unbalanced among regions and countries adams et al 2018 adding to it is the remobilization of legacy pahs from sediments e g via long range transport and leaching debruyn et al 2009 to interact with the newly deposited pah at various rates buckley et al 2004 from new sources of production du and jing 2018 making their distribution to be more confused 3 2 methane ebullition from global lakes showing a positive correlation to temperature positive correlations of methane ebullition to temperature were recognized in many individual freshwater ecosystems aben et al 2017 such as city ponds forest ponds post glacial lakes and rivers here we collected ebullitive data from 118 lakes covering latitude from 2 5 to 69 6 to show relationship between ch4 ebullition flux and temperature seasonal dynamics was not considered conferring the similar tendency via arrhenius model aben et al 2017 wik et al 2014 fig 2 a c the fitted arrhenius model e20 based on g1 g3 data see methodology was 45 100 and 14 mg c m 2 d 1 respectively in agreement with the modelled values of e20 for lake systems by others wik et al 2014 3 3 predicted methane ebullition budget compares to literature the fitted arrhenius models fig 2a yielded individual fluxes 1σ of 16 2 24 1 34 5 and 73 16 mg c m 2 d 1 for the latitudinal zone of 66 54 66 24 54 and 24 respectively based on g1 data table s11 si these latitude dependent fluxes together with the calculated arithmetic mean fluxes 1σ i e 11 24 30 30 40 73 and 74 84 mg c m 2 d 1 for the same latitudinal zones taking account of g1 data were used to extrapolate the total flux from global lakes as shown in fig 2d for validation the global methane ebullition fluxes achieved by extrapolation based on respective calculation and simulation were further compared with those reported from literature bastviken et al 2011 delsontro et al 2018 showing comparable results 63 3 tg yr 1 based on arrhenius modelling and 71 0 tg yr 1 based on arithmetic means in this paper vs 53 5 170 tg yr 1 from literature our results fall well within the data range however there is a bias from those high end value observed likely ascribed to the data scale collection time sieczko et al 2020 and locations for literatures reviewed methane ebullition fluxes as well as the applied prediction model modified arrhenius equation in this study sanches et al 2019 walter et al 2007 wik et al 2016a 3 4 correlation studies on methane ebullition flux as functions of lake

and tn in lakes are often indexed to suggest the specific lake trophic status with different productivity carlson and simpson 1996 nzme 2010 among which various correlations with empirical equations are also reported burns et al 2005 carlson 1977 paulic et al 1996 zhou et al 2020 which however are regional specific and conditional in the global context correlation coefficients among these attributes n 91 considered those data when chl a tp and tn are all available from the same source lakes only are found to be significantly low as 0 0082 between chl a and tp 0 021 between chl a and tn and 0 17 between tp and tn we further run multilinear regression models based on these three attributes n 91 chl a tp and tn as a function of ebullitive ch4 r 2 0 24 table s12 si where p 0 05 for chl

evidences to endorse our prediction on methane ebullition fluxes until 2100 primarily triggered by nutrients normalized to the chl a concentration details in fig 4d 3 5 pah distribution from global lakes demonstrates heterogeneities across continents and latitudes total pah concentrations are plotted against various lake attributes including lake area coordinate and its belonging continent fig 3 a c there was no consistent trend on pah concentrations in relation to lake areas different from methane ebullition which is highly latitude dependent the pah concentration could have comprehensive dependency and response to its contamination source and a lot of attributes guo et al 2017 hijosa valsero et al 2016 at the continent levels however pah concentrations ranked as c pahs in na c pahs in asia c pahs in af c pahs in eu c pahs in oc c pahs in sa which is likely a combination result from the lake distributions land productivity population and economic growth over the last 50 70 years roser 2013 the highest pah concentrations were found from north america na which contains the largest economy us suggesting the legacy characteristics of recalcitrant pahs by the earlier development asia demonstrates the second highest pah concentrations which has experienced the most rapid development since 1960s suggesting the immediacy characteristics of pahs with an instant pahs accumulation primarily ascribed to increased anthropogenic activities guo et al 2017 admittedly the distribution of pahs based on certain continents were more fragmented and site specific such as sa n 4 and oceanic n 2 which may present higher bias in estimating their representative pah concentrations 3 6 prediction of increased pah flux over time facilitated by ebullitive methane emission according to the real dataset on global pah emission in 2007 shen et al 2013 the mean and maximum pah fluxes are predicted at 71 and 161 t yr 1 based on the average ch4 ebullition flux simulated by arrhenius model with g1 dataset fig 4 a the fluxes for individual pahs are significantly different ranged from as low as 1 0 g yr 1 for inp to as high as 67 t yr 1 for nap mean fig 4a suggesting that the total pah flux is dominated by a few pahs with extremely high transmission capacities facilitated by ch4 bubbles e g nap the pah fluxes are highly regional specific fig 4c whereas na dominates accounting for 50 of the total pah flux attributed for its high lake area 45 and the highest pah distribution surprisingly asia with the 2nd highest pah concentration however only shares 9 of the total pah flux primarily due to its limited lake area 8 about a quarter of the total pah flux 23 is generated from lakes in af as a result of their geographical distribution of most lakes 99 of lake area with the latitude 24o in conjunction with its relative high pah generation both sa and oc are negligible for global pah fluxes 1 because of their limited lake areas 5 and much lower pah contaminations 7 and 24 of that for na respectively these results bring insights to promote further studies on comparisons of other pollutant levels in lakes facilitated by methane ebullition between different regions along with time in terms of other types of organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes whose production are regional specific too pah fluxes are further projected until 2100 between 82 239 as per of its current level fig 4d considering the coupling effects of enhanced gas ebullition as functions of future nutrient loading to inland waters normalized to the chl a concentration multiplication factor between 1 0 2 2 was applied beaulieu et al 2019 and continuous pah emission based on six emission scenarios underlying technological emphasis on a balance across all energy sources between fossil and non fossil ones developed by ipcc nakicenovic et al 2000 shen et al 2013 inhibition is particularly noted on certain pah flux between 2045 2060 e g 9 12 reduction for scenario aim 13 18 reduction for scenario maria 2 7 reduction for scenario message all compared to pah flux in year 2020 due to technology split bond et al 2007 and the energy source dynamics under each scenario nakicenovic et al 2000 disregarding the forecasted continuous growth on ch4 emission beaulieu et al 2019 alongside an increased share on biomass as one major energy source and meanwhile with the depletion of technology dividends on the control of pah release for instance the technology division for uncontrolled pah release in asia was dropped from 7 5 in 2020 rapidly to 0 1 in 2050 pah flux picked up again by 2100 the pah flux may moderately increase to 1 4 2 4 times as much as the present level 3 7 impact analysis to determine the two pah streams according to their eventual receptors as air and water we simulated the mean pah fluxes ascribed to methane ebullition cf pah mean with and without the exclusion of the bubble surface adsorption obtaining a total pah flux from the former equal to 65 5 as much of that from the latter with the same concentration of each pah suggesting 34 5 of pahs moving into the lake water via bubble surface desorption which could be a conservative estimation in fact 11 out of 16 pahs demonstrated a higher interface adsorption coefficient than their gas partitioning counterpart as much as 5 orders of magnitudes for dban normalizing the predicted pah fluxes 71 161 t yr 1 from mean to maximum with a standard unit of area it suggests that the vector effect due to methane ebullition could be 52 118 of dry deposition volume for pahs between atmosphere and global lakes per year the global dry deposition of aerosol bound pahs is estimated at 0 001 tg per month gonzález gaya et al 2016 meanwhile 1 3 up to 3 0 ng l 1 of total pahs can be shifted into lake waters per annum assuming the affective water depth of 5 m where most ch4 ebullition activities occur cheng et al 2014 frouzova et al 2015 given the average pah level from inland surface waters is frequently around 0 1 100 ng l 1 lawal 2017 we hereby manifest that methane ebullition facilitated pah flux carries a significant role in regulating pah levels with accumulation in lake water likewise the total pah concentration presented in bubble gases is estimated as 3100 7100 times as much of the atmosphere baseline 100 ng m 3 hafner et al 2005 3 8 model verification spatiotemporal heterogeneity together with data paucity from methane ebullition aben et al 2017 wik et al 2016a and pah distribution ahrens and depree 2004 du and jing 2018 goswami et al 2016 guo et al 2017 yunker and macdonald 2003 are two main constraints to accurately predict the pah fluxes ascribed to ch4 ebullition models with necessary assumptions in this regard are extremely useful to derive the wanted results however these assumptions bring uncertainties for instance the assumed average bubble diameters 4 6 mm across different latitudes delwiche and hemond 2017a delwiche and hemond 2017b may bias from their true distributions and patterns liu et al 2018 which have functions of the atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure chen and slater 2015 flury et al 2015 benthic shear stress johnson et al 2018 and the pore connectivity liu et al 2018 martinez and anderson 2013 nonetheless a preliminary verification fig 5 c incorporating necessary boundaries from the field i e foc cpah and gfebull viana et al 2012 suggests that for most pahs including bna bnp bbfl bpy bkfl chr dban flan phe and pyr their individual fluxes could be largely predicted capped between two modelled mean fluxes with and without account of the bubble interface adsorption the inclusion of a second term by taking account of pahs interface adsorption mechanism with its current setting values hoff et al 1993 overestimated certain pah fluxes e g bbfl dban and nap possibly due to adsorption inequilibrium or the occurrence of desorption on the other hand with the preclusion of the second term a number of individual pah fluxes were underestimated e g bkfl bna bnp and dban suggesting the importance of the bubble surface adsorption interestingly there is a larger difference between measured pah fluxes in situ and those simulated by models when the measured values were lower fig 5c suggesting that a small pah flux likely driven by low pah concentration gradient by gas ebullition is more susceptible to the surrounding environment for further verification phe fluxes from literature yuan et al 2007 and mixed pahs 16pahs fluxes during gas ebullition from our laboratory study were investigated according to eqs 3 and 4 shown in fig 5a b much higher fluxes were recorded from both laboratory studies for instance the mean pah flux measured in our experiments was 1 log magnitude higher than that via modelling however individual pah fluxes demonstrate relative consistent trends of changes with those of modelling results suggesting that they could be largely dominated by assumed mechanisms i e gas phase partitioning combined with bubble surface adsorption to explain the difference between the two distinctive fluxes measurements vs modelling we speculate that freshly inoculated pahs and high gas fluxes 1467 l m 2 d 1 in our experiments and 1 1963 l m 2 d 1 from experiments in literature yuan et al 2007 which are 4 5 7 104 times as much as those measured from the fields i e 11 74 mg c m 2 d 1 would significantly enhance the pah fluxes for instance the higher of the ch4 flux the larger difference of phe fluxes between experimental ones and those by modelling as shown in fig 5b where pahs partitioning may not yet reach equilibrium between sediment and porewater with more free phase pahs in the porewater and meanwhile sediment resuspension ascribed to high gas fluxes can promote pah particle water partitioning resulting in the mobilization of pollutants e g pahs and pcbs alkhatib and weigand 2002 latimer et al 1999 or trace metals burgess and kester 2002 from particles into overlying water and influence the pah flux comparatively pah fluxes from the field viana et al 2012 present more complicated trends fig 5c ascribed to the complicated in situ conditions and interactions between pahs and other natural and anthropogenic organic compounds in lake sediment 4 conclusion pah flux from sediments due to gas ebullition from the global lake system significantly offsets the pahs sink in lake sediments and affects pah concentrations in both lake water and atmosphere considering the long lasting pah fluxes with an increasing potential until 2100 the pah concentrations from the lakes may continuously accumulate resulting in a significant negative impact to the lake ecosystems which may lead to acute chronic and or bioaccumulation effects further evaluation of site specific koc and kia effect of ebullition facilitated particle resuspension and distribution of individual pah from the global lake system would

16663,methane ebullition and contamination are two typical characteristics from lakes however these two are generally studied independently in fact the exchange of matter and energy between methane bubbles and their surrounding environment can be very active to enhance the contaminant transport there is limited research on understanding the characteristics and trends of gas ebullition facilitated contaminant emissions in large areas considering water and air as receptors we herein estimate the transport capacity of methane ebullition for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs out of the sediment from global lakes which may reach an average of 71 up to 159 t yr 1 methane bubbles could transfer one third of the total pah flux from sediments or equivalent of 1 3 3 0 ng l 1 of additional pahs into the water column with the rest going into air offsetting from 52 to 118 of dry pah deposition flux into global lakes sediment per year given the pah concentration in lake water is often in the range of 0 1 100 ng l 1 ebullition facilitated pah flux may increase pah concentration by a factor of 1 4 to 2 4 until 2 100 being a significant contributor for the pah increment in lake waters keywords methane ebullition polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fluxes global lakes 1 introduction methane ebullition and contamination are two typical characteristics from lakes however these two are generally studied independently methane bubbles are produced primarily by the anaerobic decomposition of aquatic sediments liu et al 2018 which consist of a major proportion of methane with a balance of nitrogen carbon monoxide or oxygen casper et al 2000 keller and stallard 1994 methane is the second largest contributor for carbon based greenhouse gas ghg release gunthel et al 2019 whereas rivers and lakes are important sources for its production for the past three decades 1980 2009 kirschke et al 2013 methane emission from lakes was estimated about 8 48 tg ch4 yr 1 bastviken et al 2004 higher than that from the global ocean emission 5 25 tg of ch4 yr 1 weber et al 2019 ebullition and diffusion are the two main emission pathways delsontro et al 2016 sawakuchi et al 2014 with high spatiotemporal variabilities mcclure et al 2020 ebullition is episodic as compared to diffusion behaviors and accurate estimation of ebullition flux needs continuously sampling and monitoring davidson et al 2018 some studies have shown that methane ebullition often dominates the lake total ch4 flux making up 50 90 vol bastviken et al 2011 panneer selvam et al 2014 segarra et al 2013 and may be further enhanced by synergy between nutrients and warming davidson et al 2018 as a significant term in atmospheric ch4 budget ebullitive methane from lakes has been investigated separately to a lesser extent and contrastively mixed methane fluxes have been studied in many more cases which contain both ebullitive and diffusive flux sanches et al 2019 which are regulated by the interaction between physical properties e g temperature and system productivity which is further associated with nutrients such as phosphorus tp deemer et al 2016 west et al 2016 yvon durocher et al 2014 on the other hand its intermittent and temporal transport behaviors from the sediment layer and the exchange of matter and energy of the bubbles with their surroundings e g via the gas water interface are significantly ignored solute transport at the sediment water interface due to methane ebullition may be substantially promoted and effectively drives porewater convection which discharges sediment porewater into water column and enhances benthic pelagic coupling cheng et al 2014 liu et al 2018 the presence of even minor amounts of gas can increase the fluxes of poorly soluble species by several factors flury et al 2015 leading to the further contamination of overlaying water in lakes methane ebullition from sediment to water phase and then from water to gas phase via bubble burst provides two respective pathways for the release of solute facilitated by methane ebullition one pathway is initiated with gas phase partitioning and the other is initiated with the bubble surface adsorption with air and water as receptors these findings deepen understanding of relationships between methane production and the surrounding environment and bring insights for the vector effects of methane ebullition to redistribute organic pollutants at the sediment water gas interface apart from its global warming potential regardless of a few studies investigating the behaviors of gas ebullition on benthic solute exchange using conservative tracers such as fluoride klein 2006 or bromide flury et al 2015 details on methane ebullition facilitated flux of pollutants from lake sediments in situ are barely understood polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are ubiquitously distributed in global lakes with overall concentrations ranging from 0 159 33090 ng g 1 du and jing 2018 which could surpass chlorinated hydrocarbons in the threat they pose to aquatic biota in urban streams and lakes van metre and mahler 2005 ascribed to their hydrophobicity sediments are the main sink of pahs in lakes recent studies in an urban river and channel viana et al 2018 viana et al 2012 suggest that gas ebullition from the field is an important pathway for releasing pahs from buried sediments with as much as 0 2 mg of benzo a pyrene 1 2 mg of phenanthrene and 0 7 mg of pyrene released per liter of ebullitive gas due to both contaminants partitioning to gas bubbles and to sediment resuspension based on

a sediment bed by gas movement showing a positive correlation to the gas volume these papers demonstrate significant pah fluxes from sediments facilitated by gas ebullition viana et al 2012 current relevant papers viana et al 2018 viana et al 2012 yuan et al 2007 provide limited understanding of pah fluxes facilitated by methane ebullition this article intends to understand the vector effects of methane bubbles on the migration of pollutants to understand the characteristics trends and mechanisms of pah fluxes facilitated by methane ebullition on a global scale which can serve as a prognostic indicator for other contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes and heavy metals delwiche et al 2020 the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the overall ebullitive methane budget and the overall pahs distribution then 2 to leverage an interconnection to derive their quantitative interactions and ultimately 3 to estimate the pah flux induced by methane bubbling from global lakes 2 methodology 2 1 ebullitive ch4 data acquisition fluxes of ch4 ebullition from lakes were acquired from literature in mg c m 2 d 1 for further data processing literature data search was carried out on google scholar and web of science with input of keywords ebullition methane ch4 lake and sediments in all possible combinations from september 2020 to june 2021 for a few cases multiple data were adopted from different collection points in one single lake in total 211 data n 211 of ch4 ebullition were applied for gis plotting arcmap 10 6 esri from 125

2018 via calculation based on our developed prediction model n 67 ρ2 0 23 table s2 si to discriminate the flux of ebullition from its total emission 1 g f e b u l l 2 65 g f t o l 0 36 where gfebull

understand their quantitative correlations 2 2 arrhenius model of ebullitive ch4 flux some research deemer et al 2016 delsontro et al 2018 suggests that the chl a concentration plays a unique role correlated with methane emissions though most studies share the dominant view that methane emission from a wide range of freshwater ecosystems is primarily temperature driven aben et al 2017 delsontro et al 2016 mcginnis et al 2016 van bergen et al 2019 viana et al 2012 yvon durocher et al 2014 for example yvon durocher et al 2014 demonstrate that the temperature dependencies of methanogenesis ch4 production and ch4 emissions are substantially higher than two other key rate processes in the carbon cycle i e heterotrophic respiration and photosynthesis aben et al 2017 show that there exists a strong correlation between temperature and ebullition on a large geographical scale however through a disproportional increase in ebullition 6 20 per 1 c increase based on another study delsontro et al 2016 bubbling appears to be more sensitive to temperature compared to diffusive pathway the correlation studies between methane ebullition and temperature in the current paper also suggest that temperature significantly affects ebullition fig 2 modified arrhenius equation were applied aben et al 2017 to simulate ch4 ebullition fluxes as a function of water temperatures n 125 2 e t e 20 θ s t

al 2019 viana et al 2012 three groups of methane ebullition data namely g1 g2 and g3 were used for simulations to calculate the mean g1 upper g2 and lower g3 methane ebullition fluxes respectively g1 represents the whole dataset of methane ebullition collected from literature n 118 which were divided into 4 subsets dependent of their temperature profiles classified as 20 c 10 20 c 5 10 c and 5 c respectively to yield the arithmetic mean fluxes of methane ebullition which were then simulated by arrhenius model fig 2a likewise g2 n 34 and g3 n 84 represent the two complementary subsets of data from g1 with values higher for g2 and lower for g3 than the arrhenius model curve derived from g1 dataset fig 2a respectively which were then used to yield the corresponding upper and lower fluxes of methane ebullition via arrhenius models fig 2b c known that global lake thermal regions maberly et al 2020 present a strong relationship to climatic zones we herein made one to one mapping to assign

latitudinal zones tables s1 s4 7 si while the global lake areas under different latitudinal zones were referenced to bastviken et al 2011 these simulated results based on respective g1 g2 and g3 thus

from 6 artificial lakes bovan ćelije vrutci barje bojnik and garaši and one from 53 mediterranean shallow lakes the average of minimum and maximum values was taken if the pah concentration was given

lake attributes were calculated for comparison and error propagation 2 4 estimation of pah concentrations from global lakes the spatiotemporal distribution of pahs shows high variability du and jing 2018 the variation could be explained by multiple factors such as sources e g the pyrogenic or petrogenic origin climate to affect the wet and dry deposition and social economic factors policies industrialization population growth and energy consumption etc pertaining to the social economic influence pah concentrations in sediments to a certain degree are reconciled to unbalanced continent development the 20th century has seen rapid industrialization in some countries in asia and africa while a similar scenario occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries in europe and the americas as a result of these various industrial revolutions population growth and per capita consumption of energy more pahs are released into the terrestrial environment in the above mentioned geographical regions that eventually reached bodies of water partitioned into the sediments and served as sediment pah depots ramesh et al 2011 however there is no known proof to show significant correlations between pahs and their geographic latitude we herein adopted the average pah distribution across various continents to establish the modelling platform while the methane ebullition flux from different lakes for each continent were simulated differently according to their belonged latitudinal bands table s3 si it herein allows correlations of the two attributes i e pahs distribution and methane ebullition to derive the pah fluxes facilitated by methane ebullition world widely via data extraction and extrapolation 2 5 monte carlo modelling pah flux via methane bubbles pah transport via methane bubbles were modelled via assembling the two pathways mechanisms i e the portion with gas phase partitioning and the other with bubble surface adsorption with air and water as respective receptors we assume that pahs retained in the bubble gas will be 100 emitted to atmosphere through bubble explosion at the water gas interface while pahs adsorbed onto the bubble surface to be completely dissolved into the water phase during bubble migration through the water column note that particle resuspension can be facilitated by gas ebullition which may result in pah particle water partitioning to further influence the pah flux however is not accounted in this paper the pah flux dominated by the former pathway was assessed based on henry s law fendinger et al 1992 viana et al

methane bubbles may encounter obstacles e g suspended particles or water blooms during their ascending whereas pahs adsorbed onto the bubble surface are subjected to exchange these factors were not accounted for in the current study 2 6 projection of pah fluxes until 2100 projection of pah fluxes was performed by considering the methane ebullition flux and the pah emission as the two main factors for interaction however subjected to changes over time respectively we assumed a stable increase on ch4 emission from lakes per annum triggered by eutrophication beaulieu et al 2019 whereas the global warming effects are not concerned given that a lot of measures and efforts have been implemented to reduce the greenhouse gas ghg emission we speculate that climate change will be significantly inhibited in the future and there will be limited effects on the changes of ch4 ebullition from lakes aben et al 2017 in this paper normalized to the chl a concentration multiplication

scenario for model for energy supply strategy alternatives and their general environmental impact message and scenario for mini climate assessment model minicam collectively as a1b scenarios to underlie technological emphasis on a balance across all energy sources between fossil and non fossil ones here we chose coal oil and biomass under the primary energy by fuel category in each scenario nakicenovic et al 2000 as the model sources as they are the major drivers to cause pah emissions shen et al 2013 we assumed that the variation among these fuel sources in conjunction with technology split over time bond et al 2007 would dominate the variation of pah emissions to achieve the time dependent fractions of the technology divisions ascribed to technology split associated with various fuels typical s shape curve models were often used bond et al 2007 shen et al 2013 6 x t x 0 x f e t t 0 2 2 s 2 x f where x0 and xf are initial and final fractions of a certain technology division respectively t0 is the start time of the technology transition and s is a rate here x0 and xf were assigned to 1 and 0 respectively while t0 and s was assumed to be dependent of regions t0 1907 s 35 for oecd90 region t0 1955 s 26 for ref region t0 1915 s 40 for asia region and t0 1907 s 35 for alm region nakicenovic et al 2000 the individual pah emission factors efpahs associated with all types of fuels coal oil or biomass were set to be constants based on two technology divisions namely uncontrolled consumption and controlled consumption respectively table s9 si ravindra et al 2008 shen et al 2013 meanwhile pahs deposition rate into the sediments was assumed to be strictly proportional to their annual emission in addition degradation of pahs overtime remediation efforts and uncontrollable factors such as governance and emission reduction policies were not considered in the estimate sediment varve was assumed at 0 4 cm yr 1 duan et al 2015 jenny et al 2013 slater et al 2013 yunker and macdonald 2003 while the sediment layer subjected to interference by methane bubbles was set as 20 cm in depth based on methanogenesis rates measured as a function of depth on a subset of lakes west et al 2016 which showed that sediment methane formation was dominated by the upper sediment with depth of 0 2 m joyce and jewell 2003 kelly and chynoweth 1981 schwarz et al 2008 wilkinson et al 2015 herein pah fluxes induced by methane bubbles for each specific year may be traced back to pah emissions in a half century earlier 2 7 model validation the pah distribution was estimated with large lakes glwd level1 50 km2 according to their individual latitudinal zones and continents respectively to yield two weighted averages table 1 i e the modelled mean via arrhenius model and the arithmetic mean which were then used for calculating global methane ebullition fluxes to further compare and validate with that estimated by batsviken et al 2004 studies on methane ebullition facilitated pah flux are extremely limited and reflect site specific characteristics validations of predicted pah fluxes facilitated by methane ebullition were performed with several datasets from 1 our earlier publication viana et al 2012 2 yuan et al 2007 and 3 our bench scale experiments via comparison between these various measurements and simulation results simulated with eqs 3 and 4 to perform relevant experiments in the laboratory column tests were set up fig s1 mixed pahs 16pahs grade of analytical reagents same concentration of each pah 2mg ml 1 were purchased from

et al 2012 and astm 2021 for more information 2 8 statistical analysis pared t tests were performed for correlations between gfebull and chl a tp tn and doc respectively kruskal wallis k w h tests were performed for pah concentrations acquired from literature to determine if there are statistically significant differences among the characteristic groups based on geographic classifications of

with and without the term for bubble interface adsorption all p values in the study are two tailed statistical data analyses were carried out in r 3 6 3 and microsoft excel 2016 3 results 3 1 methane ebullition flux and pah concentrations from global lakes ebullition of methane from global lakes were generally latitude dependent fig 1 table s10 si such trend was notable from tropical 24 or boreal 66 lakes fig 1 where the ebullition fluxes from the former were found frequently above 10 74 or 100 mg c m 2 d 1 26 while from the latter was ubiquitously 100 capped within 100 mg c m 2 d 1 further examination of fluxes from the temperate zone 24 66 unveiled more irregular methane emission where the rate of 0 10 10 100 and 100 mg c m 2 d 1 accounted for 50 38 and 12 of data points respectively given the fact that a majority of global lakes 76 6 in area bastviken et al 2011 messager et al 2016 are from northern temperate zone 24 66 their ch4 ebullition fluxes have been further complicated with seasonal dynamics e g temperature wind storm water level stratification carbon input energy input and etc lohrberg et al 2020 sabrekov et al 2017 wik et al 2013 wik et al 2014 wik et al 2016b and mixed trophic status palma silva et al 2013 which leads to their high variabilities fig 1 pah concentrations from lake sediments exhibit a high spacial heterogeneity for instance the pah concentrations can range from as low as 1 0 102 to as high as 5 4 105 ng g 1 from a single lake source debruyn et al 2009 fig 1 a majority of pah distributions from lake sediments demonstrate elusive links with their attributes a poor correlation ρ 0 013 between methane emission and pah concentration was herein conferred n 9 not a surprise temporal differences in pah emission also occur by the variation in onset of major industrial and economic growth at various localities which is highly unbalanced among regions and countries adams et al 2018 adding to it is the remobilization of legacy pahs from sediments e g via long range transport and leaching debruyn et al 2009 to interact with the newly deposited pah at various rates buckley et al 2004 from new sources of production du and jing 2018 making their distribution to be more confused 3 2 methane ebullition from global lakes showing a positive correlation to temperature positive correlations of methane ebullition to temperature were recognized in many individual freshwater ecosystems aben et al 2017 such as city ponds forest ponds post glacial lakes and rivers here we collected ebullitive data from 118 lakes covering latitude from 2 5 to 69 6 to show relationship between ch4 ebullition flux and temperature seasonal dynamics was not considered conferring the similar tendency via arrhenius model aben et al 2017 wik et al 2014 fig 2 a c the fitted arrhenius model e20 based on g1 g3 data see methodology was 45 100 and 14 mg c m 2 d 1 respectively in agreement with the modelled values of e20 for lake systems by others wik et al 2014 3 3 predicted methane ebullition budget compares to literature the fitted arrhenius models fig 2a yielded individual fluxes 1σ of 16 2 24 1 34 5 and 73 16 mg c m 2 d 1 for the latitudinal zone of 66 54 66 24 54 and 24 respectively based on g1 data table s11 si these latitude dependent fluxes together with the calculated arithmetic mean fluxes 1σ i e 11 24 30 30 40 73 and 74 84 mg c m 2 d 1 for the same latitudinal zones taking account of g1 data were used to extrapolate the total flux from global lakes as shown in fig 2d for validation the global methane ebullition fluxes achieved by extrapolation based on respective calculation and simulation were further compared with those reported from literature bastviken et al 2011 delsontro et al 2018 showing comparable results 63 3 tg yr 1 based on arrhenius modelling and 71 0 tg yr 1 based on arithmetic means in this paper vs 53 5 170 tg yr 1 from literature our results fall well within the data range however there is a bias from those high end value observed likely ascribed to the data scale collection time sieczko et al 2020 and locations for literatures reviewed methane ebullition fluxes as well as the applied prediction model modified arrhenius equation in this study sanches et al 2019 walter et al 2007 wik et al 2016a 3 4 correlation studies on methane ebullition flux as functions of lake nutrients methane ebullition showed a certain linear correlation with tp r 0 61 n 102 p 0 01 chl a r 0 46 n 117 p 0 05 and doc r 0 52 n 62 p 0 05 but not with tn r 0 044 n 91 p 0 01 fig s2a d chl a tp and tn in lakes are often indexed to suggest the specific lake trophic status with different productivity carlson and simpson 1996 nzme 2010 among which various correlations with empirical equations are also reported burns et al 2005 carlson 1977 paulic et al 1996 zhou et al 2020 which however are regional specific and conditional in the global context correlation coefficients among these attributes n 91 considered those data when chl a tp and tn are all available from the same source lakes only are found to be significantly low as 0 0082 between chl a and tp 0 021 between chl a and tn and 0 17 between tp and tn we further run multilinear regression models based on these three attributes n 91 chl a tp and tn as a function of ebullitive ch4 r 2 0 24 table s12 si where p 0 05 for chl a p 0 43 for tp and p 0 66 for tn and show that chl a is the only significant attribute demonstrating certain correlation r 2 0 23 fig s3 with the ebullitive ch4 flux these results also provide direct evidences to endorse our prediction on methane ebullition fluxes until 2100 primarily triggered by nutrients normalized to the chl a concentration details in fig 4d 3 5 pah distribution from global lakes demonstrates heterogeneities across continents and latitudes total pah concentrations are plotted against various lake attributes including lake area coordinate and its belonging continent fig 3 a c there was no consistent trend on pah concentrations in relation to lake areas different from methane ebullition which is highly latitude dependent the pah concentration could have comprehensive dependency and response to its contamination source and a lot of attributes guo et al 2017 hijosa valsero et al 2016 at the continent levels however pah concentrations ranked as c pahs in na c pahs in asia c pahs in af c pahs in eu c pahs in oc c pahs in sa which is likely a combination result from the lake distributions land productivity population and economic growth over the last 50 70 years roser 2013 the highest pah concentrations were found from north america na which contains the largest economy us suggesting the legacy characteristics of recalcitrant pahs by the earlier development asia demonstrates the second highest pah concentrations which has experienced the most rapid development since 1960s suggesting the immediacy characteristics of pahs with an instant pahs accumulation primarily ascribed to increased anthropogenic activities guo et al 2017 admittedly the distribution of pahs based on certain continents were more fragmented and site specific such as sa n 4 and oceanic n 2 which may present higher bias in estimating their representative pah concentrations 3 6 prediction of increased pah flux over time facilitated by ebullitive methane emission according to the real dataset on global pah emission in 2007 shen et al 2013 the mean and maximum pah fluxes are predicted at 71 and 161 t yr 1 based on the average ch4 ebullition flux simulated by arrhenius model with g1 dataset fig 4 a the fluxes for individual pahs are significantly different ranged from as low as 1 0 g yr 1 for inp to as high as 67 t yr 1 for nap mean fig 4a suggesting that the total pah flux is dominated by a few pahs with extremely high transmission capacities facilitated by ch4 bubbles e g nap the pah fluxes are highly regional specific fig 4c whereas na dominates accounting for 50 of the total pah flux attributed for its high lake area 45 and the highest pah distribution surprisingly asia with the 2nd highest pah concentration however only shares 9 of the total pah flux primarily due to its limited lake area 8 about a quarter of the total pah flux 23 is generated from lakes in af as a result of their geographical distribution of most lakes 99 of lake area with the latitude 24o in conjunction with its relative high pah generation both sa and oc are negligible for global pah fluxes 1 because of their limited lake areas 5 and much lower pah contaminations 7 and 24 of that for na respectively these results bring insights to promote further studies on comparisons of other pollutant levels in lakes facilitated by methane ebullition between different regions along with time in terms of other types of organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes whose production are regional specific too pah fluxes are further projected until 2100 between 82 239 as per of its current level fig 4d considering the coupling effects of enhanced gas ebullition as functions of future nutrient loading to inland waters normalized to the chl a concentration multiplication factor between 1 0 2 2 was applied beaulieu et al 2019 and continuous pah emission based on six emission scenarios underlying technological emphasis on a balance across all energy sources between fossil and non fossil ones developed by ipcc nakicenovic et al 2000 shen et al 2013 inhibition is particularly noted on certain pah flux between 2045 2060 e g 9 12 reduction for scenario aim 13 18 reduction for scenario maria 2 7 reduction for scenario message all compared to pah flux in year 2020 due to technology split bond et al 2007 and the energy source dynamics under each scenario nakicenovic et al 2000 disregarding the forecasted continuous growth on ch4 emission beaulieu et al 2019 alongside an increased share on biomass as one major energy source and meanwhile with the depletion of technology dividends on the control of pah release for instance the technology division for uncontrolled pah release in asia was dropped from 7 5 in 2020 rapidly to 0 1 in 2050 pah flux picked up again by 2100 the pah flux may moderately increase to 1 4 2 4 times as much as the present level 3 7 impact analysis to determine the two pah streams according to their eventual receptors as air and water we simulated the mean pah fluxes ascribed to methane ebullition cf pah mean with and without the exclusion of the bubble surface adsorption obtaining a total pah flux from the former equal to 65 5 as much of that from the latter with the same concentration of each pah suggesting 34 5 of pahs moving into the lake water via bubble surface desorption which could be a conservative estimation in fact 11 out of 16 pahs demonstrated a higher interface adsorption coefficient than their gas partitioning counterpart as much as 5 orders of magnitudes for dban normalizing the predicted pah fluxes 71 161 t yr 1 from mean to maximum with a standard unit of area it suggests that the vector effect due to methane ebullition could be 52 118 of dry deposition volume for pahs between atmosphere and global lakes per year the global dry deposition of aerosol bound pahs is estimated at 0 001 tg per month gonzález gaya et al 2016 meanwhile 1 3 up to 3 0 ng l 1 of total pahs can be shifted into lake waters per annum assuming the affective water depth of 5 m where most ch4 ebullition activities occur cheng et al 2014 frouzova et al 2015 given the average pah level from inland surface waters is frequently around 0 1 100 ng l 1 lawal 2017 we hereby manifest that methane ebullition facilitated pah flux carries a significant role in regulating pah levels with accumulation in lake water likewise the total pah concentration presented in bubble gases is estimated as 3100 7100 times as much of the atmosphere baseline 100 ng m 3 hafner et al 2005 3 8 model verification spatiotemporal heterogeneity together with data paucity from methane ebullition aben et al 2017 wik et al 2016a and pah distribution ahrens and depree 2004 du and jing 2018 goswami et al 2016 guo et al 2017 yunker and macdonald 2003 are two main constraints to accurately predict the pah fluxes ascribed to ch4 ebullition models with necessary assumptions in this regard are extremely useful to derive the wanted results however these assumptions bring uncertainties for instance the assumed average bubble diameters 4 6 mm across different latitudes delwiche and hemond 2017a delwiche and hemond 2017b may bias from their true distributions and patterns liu et al 2018 which have functions of the atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure chen and slater 2015 flury et al 2015 benthic shear stress johnson et al 2018 and the pore connectivity liu et al 2018 martinez and anderson 2013 nonetheless a preliminary verification fig 5 c incorporating necessary boundaries from the field i e foc cpah and gfebull viana et al 2012 suggests that for most pahs including bna bnp bbfl bpy bkfl chr dban flan phe and pyr their individual fluxes could be largely predicted capped between two modelled mean fluxes with and without account of the bubble interface adsorption the inclusion of a second term by taking account of pahs interface adsorption mechanism with its current setting values hoff et al 1993 overestimated certain pah fluxes e g bbfl dban and nap possibly due to adsorption inequilibrium or the occurrence of desorption on the other hand with the preclusion of the second term a number of individual pah fluxes were underestimated e g bkfl bna bnp and dban suggesting the importance of the bubble surface adsorption interestingly there is a larger difference between measured pah fluxes in situ and those simulated by models when the measured values were lower fig 5c suggesting that a small pah flux likely driven by low pah concentration gradient by gas ebullition is more susceptible to the surrounding environment for further verification phe fluxes from literature yuan et al 2007 and mixed pahs 16pahs fluxes during gas ebullition from our laboratory study were investigated according to eqs 3 and 4 shown in fig 5a b much higher fluxes were recorded from both laboratory studies for instance the mean pah flux measured in our experiments was 1 log magnitude higher than that via modelling however individual pah fluxes demonstrate relative consistent trends of changes with those of modelling results suggesting that they could be largely dominated by assumed mechanisms i e gas phase partitioning combined with bubble surface adsorption to explain the difference between the two distinctive fluxes measurements vs modelling we speculate that freshly inoculated pahs and high gas fluxes 1467 l m 2 d 1 in our experiments and 1 1963 l m 2 d 1 from experiments in literature yuan et al 2007 which are 4 5 7 104 times as much as those measured from the fields i e 11 74 mg c m 2 d 1 would significantly enhance the pah fluxes for instance the higher of the ch4 flux the larger difference of phe fluxes between experimental ones and those by modelling as shown in fig 5b where pahs partitioning may not yet reach equilibrium between sediment and porewater with more free phase pahs in the porewater and meanwhile sediment resuspension ascribed to high gas fluxes can promote pah particle water partitioning resulting in the mobilization of pollutants e g pahs and pcbs alkhatib and weigand 2002 latimer et al 1999 or trace metals burgess and kester 2002 from particles into overlying water and influence the pah flux comparatively pah fluxes from the field viana et al 2012 present more complicated trends fig 5c ascribed to the complicated in situ conditions and interactions between pahs and other natural and anthropogenic organic compounds in lake sediment 4 conclusion pah flux from sediments due to gas ebullition from the global lake system significantly offsets the pahs sink in lake sediments and affects pah concentrations in both lake water and atmosphere considering the long lasting pah fluxes with an increasing potential until 2100 the pah concentrations from the lakes may continuously accumulate resulting in a significant negative impact to the lake ecosystems which may lead to acute chronic and or bioaccumulation effects further evaluation of site specific koc and kia effect of ebullition facilitated particle resuspension and distribution of individual pah from the global lake system would

16664,coastal harmful algal blooms habs commonly termed red tides have severe undesirable consequences to the marine ecosystems and local fishery and tourism industries increase in nitrogen and or phosphorus loading is often regarded as the major culprits of increasing frequency and intensity of the coastal hab however fundamental understanding is lacking as to the causes and mechanism of bloom formation despite decades of intensive investigation in this study we interrogated the prokaryotic microbiomes of surface water samples collected at two neighboring segments of east china sea that contrast greatly in terms of the intensity and frequency of prorocentrum dominated hab mantel tests identified significant correlations between the structural and functional composition of the microbiomes and the physicochemical state and the algal biomass density of the surface seawater implying the possibility that prokaryotic microbiota may play key roles in the coastal hab a conspicuous feature of the microbiomes at the sites characterized with high trophic state index and eukaryotic algal cell counts was disproportionate proliferation of vibrio spp and their complete domination of the functional genes attributable to the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra pathway substantially enriched at these sites the genes attributed to phosphorus uptake function were significantly enriched at these sites presumably due to the pi deficiency induced by algal growth however the profiles of the phosphorus mineralization genes lacked consistency barring any conclusive evidence with regard to contribution of prokaryotic microbiota to phosphorus bioavailability the results of the co occurrence network analysis performed with the core prokaryotic microbiome supported that the observed proliferation of vibrio and hab may be causally associated the findings of this study suggest a previously unidentified association between vibrio proliferation and the prorocentrum dominated hab in the subtropical east china sea and opens a discussion regarding a theoretically unlikely but still possible involvement of vibrio mediated dnra in vibrio prorocentrum symbiosis further experimental substantiation of this supposed symbiotic mechanism may prove crucial in understanding the dynamics of explosive local algal growth in the region during spring algal blooms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal bloom microbiome metagenomics prorocentrum vibrio dnra 1 introduction today many coastal regions across the globe suffer from harmful algal blooms hab more widely known as the layman s term red tides anderson et al 2012 the east china sea off the southeast coast of china has been one of the regions most severely affected by hab since the 1980s tang et al 2006 since the turn of millennium the major culprits of hab in the east china sea have shifted to the dinoflagellates prorocentrum spp a group of fast growing phototrophic algae widespread in coastal waters across the globe heil et al 2005 the species prevalent in hab in east china sea which had been named p donghaiense is neither morphologically nor genotypically clearly distinguishable from other prorocentrum species with worldwide distribution e g p dentatum and p obtusidens lu et al 2005 shin et al 2019 although toxin production by this particular species has not been reported the possibility cannot be totally ruled out as several prorocentrum species have been observed to produce okadaic acid dinophysistoxin 1 and prorocentrolide ben gharbia et al 2016 nascimento et al 2017 even apart from toxin production intense prorocentrum blooms cause substantial detrimental impacts to the local marine and estuarine ecosystems by means of oxygen depletion alteration of ph and or light attenuation which are typical for high biomass algal blooms anderson et al 2012 azanza et al 2005 gallegos and bergstrom 2005 such ecological damage as well as aesthetic deterioration due to coloration and putrefaction accompanied with the blooms have caused immense damage to the local tourism fishing and aquaculture industries yu et al 2018 the annually repetitive nature of the prorocentrum algal bloom in the east china sea as well as explosive growths of p donghaiense observed during progressions of the algal blooms endemic to the region suggests that in situ growth is more important than vertical and or horizontal migration in understanding the mechanisms of bloom dynamics in the region li et al 2011 tang et al 2006 as p donghaiense is primarily a photoautotrophic organism with carbon needs mostly fulfilled from uptake of inorganic carbon the environmental factors regarded to be crucial to its overgrowth during the bloom events are presumably availability of nitrogen and phosphorus as suggested by previous laboratory observations anderson et al 2012 glibert et al 2008 varkitzi et al 2010 although several published data collected from the east china sea suggest potential correlations between nitrogen and phosphorus availability and p donghaiense blooms conclusive experimental evidences are still lacking and it is yet unclear whether or which specific forms of nitrogen and phosphorus support rapid growth of p donghaiense li et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 as such the decades long question as to whether or how relief of nitrogen and or phosphorus limitation initiates p donghaiense bloom remains unanswered in this study we approached this same old question from a different perspective exploring the possibility that the sea surface microbiome may play a key role in formation and progression of prorocentrum blooms diverse bacterial and archaeal constituents of the sea surface microbiota are involved with cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus kuypers et al 2018 in the euphotic zone generally characterized by supple sunlight and oxygen availability photosynthetic cyanobacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonium and organic nitrogen and diverse bacteria and archaea catalyze aerobic mineralization of organic n and oxidation of nh3 and no2 dore and karl 1996 michael beman et al 2012 wankel et al 2007 typically no3 is often the most abundant form of nitrogen at the sea surface due to its oxidizing condition mahmud et al 2020 patey et al 2008 the microbial reactions perceived as predominantly anaerobic e g denitrification anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox and dissimilatory nitrate nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra may also occur during periodic hypoxia e g nocturnal anoxic spells during high biomass algal blooms and periods of massive biomass decay following demise of algal blooms conley et al 2011 turner et al 2015 such microbial mediated nitrogen transformation reactions may affect nitrogen supply to phytoplankton as they may alter the overall nitrogen availability as well as nitrogen speciation as nitrogen is often regarded as the limiting nutrient for algal growth during rapid blooms and previous laboratory experiments have shown that certain nitrogen species are favored by prorocentrum spp over others investigations into these microbially mediated nitrogen transformations may help improve understanding of the bloom dynamics in the east china sea fan et al 2003 heil et al 2005 varkitzi et al 2010 less predictable is the influence of microbiota on hab via alteration of the marine phosphorus cycle given the patchy ecophysiological understanding of marine microbial phosphorus metabolism previous metagenomic analyses have revealed abundance and omnipresence of diverse phoa phod and phox type alkaline phosphatases ap and c p lyases and hydrolases in seawater microbiomes which have been known to be involved with disintegration of inorganic phosphorus pi from phosphoesters and phosphonates luo et al 2009 luo and moran 2013 sebastian and ammerman 2009 expressions of these organic phosphorus metabolizing enzymes are generally perceived to be under pho regulon control such that they are expressed only under pi deficiency however pi insensitive expression and activity of alkaline phosphatases and c p hydrolases have been experimentally demonstrated in both in situ and laboratory experiments chin et al 2018 suzumura et al 2012 thus bacterial mineralization of organic phosphorus may enrich the inorganic phosphorus pool in situ and increase phosphorus bioavailability to phytoplanktons contributing to formation of hab hoppe 2003 luo et al 2009 thomson et al 2019 marine eukaryotic phytoplankton including prorocentrum spp also synthesize active ap hoppe 2003 labry et al 2005 ou et al 2020 however a recent field study conducted in the east china sea during a late spring p donghaiense bloom showed that the bacterial fraction accounted for the majority of ap activity and that the contribution of eukaryotic algae was minimal mo et al 2020 here a comparative survey of the sea surface microbiomes was performed at two neighboring coastal seas off the coastline of fujian province in southeastern china the sea surrounding pingtan island hereafter referred to as pingtan sea has been regularly and frequently affected by p donghaiense blooms in contrast xiamen bay 200 km to the southwest has stayed mostly free of prorocentrum spp although occasional occurrences of moderate diatom and dinoflagellate blooms have been reported zhuo 2018 during a typical spring dinoflagellate bloom event in the pingtan sea in 2019 surface seawater samples were collected from five locations in pingtan sea and three locations in xiamen bay and the physicochemical properties of the seawater and population densities and compositions of the eukaryotic algae were analyzed the microbiomes of these seawater samples were then analyzed with shotgun metagenome sequencing the compositional and functional features of the microbiomes were analyzed with particular emphasis on those relating to nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism and statistically associated with the severity of hab in the region the findings from the comparative metagenomics analysis warrant further investigation into interactions between key microbial groups e g vibrio spp and eukaryotic algae for a more complete understanding of hab dynamics in coastal seas 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and in situ treatment and characterization sampling was performed at five locations along the coast

command in hmmer v3 1b2 huang et al 2018 assembled contigs from the individual samples were pooled together and for each sample quality trimmed raw sequence reads were mapped onto these contigs using the bwa mem v0 7 17 software default parameters li 2013 read counts were performed using htseq v0 12 4 anders et al 2015 the raw counts of the coding sequences were normalized with the nucleotide length in kilobases and the total read count of the sample analyzed in million reads yielding gene coverage values in rpkm reads per kilobase per million mapped reads 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses in this study were performed using nonparametric methods due to the small sample size n 8 all statistical analyses were performed using r v4 0 2 r core team 2013 pairwise comparisons of the environmental parameters between sampling sites were statistically evaluated with student s t test using wilcox test function implemented in the stats package spearman s rank correlation tests were performed to evaluate statistical significance of pairwise correlations between the environmental parameters mantel tests evaluated pairwise correlations among physicochemical parameter matrices the algal biomass data the microbial community profiles the kegg orthology ko number based functional gene abundance profiles and the cazymes profiles the dissimilarity matrices for these datasets were constructed using either bray curtis dissimilatory metrics vegdist function in vegan package or euclidean distance metrics dist function in stats package and these dissimilarity matrices were used as the inputs for the mantel tests performed using the mantel function implemented in vegan package with the correlation method and permutation options set to spearman and 9999 respectively the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses of microbial communities and functional gene compositions were performed based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrices constructed using metamds function embedded in vegan package the co occurrence networks were constructed based on the pairwise spearman s correlation analyses performed with the relative abundances of the selected otus using cor test function in stats package co occurrence networks visualizing the connections between the otus exhibiting significant correlations p 0 05 were constructed using cytoscape v3 7 2 su et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the sampling sites notable differences were observed between the physicochemical characteristics of the surface water samples collected from the pingtan sea pin1 pin5 and the xiamen bay xia1 xia3 fig s1 table s1 the surface water temperature was higher at the xiamen bay sites by approximately 3 c at the time of sampling and the ph and salinity were slightly but significantly higher p 0 05 at the pingtan sea sites the dissolved oxygen do concentration of the surface water ranged between 4 7 and 6 9 mg l but no significant difference was found between the two regions p 0 05 the measured oxidation reduction potential orp values were 43 9 2 5 mv and 22 1 6 5 mv at the pingtan sea and the xiamen bay sites respectively fig s1 overall xiamen bay was more nutrient rich than the pingtan sea the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration was significantly higher p 0 05 in the xiamen bay samples 1 5 0 3 mg n l than in the pingtan sea samples 0 76 0 2 mg n l the no3 and no2 concentrations were both significantly higher p 0 05 in xiamen bay with 1 1 0 2 mg no3 n l and 0 070 0 020 mg no2 n l as compared to 0 53 0 08 mg no3 n l and 0 010 0 001 mg no2 n l measured in pingtan sea nh4 concentrations were not significantly different p 0 05 between xiamen bay 0 31 0 11 mg nh4 n l and pingtan sea 0 23 0 10 mg nh4 n l fig s1 the concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus srp dissolved total phosphorus dtp and total phosphorus tp were all significantly higher in xiamen bay than pingtan sea fig s1 depletion of srp was particularly notable in the surface seawater of the pingtan sea as the srp concentrations measured at the pingtan sea sites were 26 18 of the concentrations measured at the xiamen bay sites the dtn to dtp ratio was significantly higher p 0 05 in pingtan sea according to the criterion based on the carlson s trophic indices tsi three of the five sampling locations in pingtan sea pin1 pin4 and pin5 and two of three in xiamen bay xia1 and xia2 were classified as eutrophic tsi 50 the total eukaryotic algal cell count was the highest at pin4 1 2 106 cells l and the algal cells morphologically identified as prorocentrum spp accounted for 91 0 of the total algal population table s2 the only other site with a substantial prorocentrum spp population was pin5 where 3 6 105 cells l out of the total algal population of 5 2 105 cells l were identified as prorocentrum spp the total 16s rrna gene copy numbers as an indicator of prokaryotic population ranged between 9 9 1 3 107 and 4 2 0 2 108 copies l in pingtan sea and between 9 1 0 9 107 and 2 9 0 9 108 copies l in xiamen bay fig 1b and table s2 3 2 analysis of prokaryotic community and core microbiome designation analysis of the prokaryotic community structures of pin1 5 and xia1 3 identified proteobacteria as the dominant phylum with its relative abundance ranging from 76 4 to 88 2 fig 2 a alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria constituted 18 0 34 6 and 41 5 70 0 of the prokaryotic communities respectively bacteroidia were also abundant constituting 6 3 17 0 of the total prokaryotic community although archaeal otus affiliated to thermoplasmata and nitrososphaeria were found in the metagenomes the cumulative relative abundance of the archaeal otus was below 1 5 in any of the samples analyzed the beta diversity analysis of the sea surface microbiomes clearly set the pingtan sites apart from the xiamen sites fig 2c e the non metric multidimension scaling nmds plots constructed via taxonomic grouping of 16s rrna gene sequences and functional assignments of translated enzyme sequences to kegg orthology ko groups and cazymes groups invariably separated pin1 5 from xia1 3 fig 2c e suggesting disparities between the microbiomes of these two regions in terms of both taxonomic and functional make ups the pairwise mantel tests identified significant correlations between the taxonomic and functional compositions of the microbiomes and the states of the surface seawater at the pingtan and xiamen sites fig 2b significant correlation was observed between algal biomass and 16s rrna based community composition r m 0 39 p 0 04 algal biomass was also significantly correlated with the functional profiles of the microbiomes r m 0 55 p 0 03 and r m 0 55 p 0 03 for correlations with ko based and cazyme based functional profiles respectively a stronger statistically significant correlation was observed between the physicochemical states of the seawater and the prokaryotic community compositions r m 0 61 p 0 002 and the ko based and cazyme based functional profiles r m 0 57 p 0 001 and r m 0 71 p 0 002 respectively of the microbiomes the physicochemical states were not significantly correlated with the algal biomass r m 0 35 p 0 093 suggesting that a snapshot of the physicochemical state of seawater is not sufficient as an indicator for hab possibly the significant correlation between the microbiome composition and the algal biomass may imply that the history of the recent biogeochemical events missing in a snapshot characterization of physicochemical properties is ingrained in the taxonomic and functional compositions of the microbiome luria et al 2016 another possible scenario that can be inferred from the mantel test results is the microbiota shaped by environmental pressure playing a direct role in algal bloom development in a sense analogous to the key principle underlying diet microbiome host interactions in human and animal guts bindels et al 2015 the otus identified in the samples were assigned to 379 bacterial and 5 archaeal taxa according to genus level classification and 47 of these taxa shared by all 8 metagenomes were further considered as the members of the core microbiome table s3 the core microbiome consisted of 46 bacterial taxa and one archaeal taxon most of which are uncultured and understudied the members of the core microbiome constituted vast majority of the total prokaryotic community in each of the analyzed samples such that their cumulative relative abundance ranged between 70 4 and 76 9 at the pingtan sea sites and between 62 6 and 73 6 at the xiamen bay sites table s3 the core microbiome taxa with 1 relative abundance at all sites included the sar11 clade pseudoalteromonas vibrio candidatus actinomarina the ns5 marine group and an unidentified genus of rhodobacteraceae the high abundance of vibrio spp at pin1 pin4 pin5 and xia1 was especially notable vibrio spp constituted 15 2 32 7 9 9 and 19 3 of the prokaryotic populations at the respective sites all of which were categorized as eutrophic according to their tsi values 50 the relative abundance of the vibrio was 4 5 at the other four sites where with sole exception of xia2 the tsi values indicated mesotrophic conditions another core microbiome taxon affiliated to the vibrionaceae family unassignable to any distinct genus was found at pin2 and pin3 sites with 10 relative abundance however its low abundance in pin4 1 3 suggests relevance of this taxon to eutrophication or algal bloom unlikely 3 3 metagenomic analysis of nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism the metagenomic profiles of nitrogen metabolism related genes in the microbiomes suggest possible involvement of the prokaryotic microbiome in altering the availability of labile nitrogen to prorocentrum dominated algal populations fig 3 and table s4 apart from the genes involved with urea uptake and mineralization ureabc and urtabcde all of the most abundant nitrogen functional genes were relevant to dissimilatory and assimilatory no3 to no2 reduction napab and nasa and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra nrfa and nirb the genes encoding for the periplasmic nitrate reductase napab had substantially higher relative abundance at the pingtan sea sites 10 2 39 8 rpkm for napa and 6 0 27 3 rpkm for napb than in the xiamen bay sites 6 9 17 1 rpkm for napa and 8 0 14 2 rpkm for napb although the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 the nirb and nrfa genes encoding the catalytic subunits of the two distinct forms of nitrite reductases central to the dnra pathway showed high relative abundance at the pingtan sea and xiamen bay sites heo et al 2020 the relative abundance of nirb ranged between 26 6 and 87 5 rpkm in the pingtan sea metagenomes and 17 5 and 50 4 rpkm in the xiamen bay metagenomes the nrfa genes recovered in lower abundance than nirb in all metagenomes were also substantially more abundant in the pingtan sea metagenomes 12 7 8 9 rpkm than in xiamen bay metagenomes 3 1 3 5 rpkm although the differences were not significant due to the large sample to sample variations disproportionately large shares of napa nirb and nrfa genes were phylogenetically affiliated with vibrio spp considering that the relative abundance of vibrio spp did not exceed 33 of the total prokaryotic population according to the 16s rrna based community composition analyses at the pingtan sea sites where this tendency was more pronounced 93 2 95 8 and 56 1 of the reads mapped onto napa napb and nirb respectively were phylogenetically affiliated with the genus vibrio the gene coding sequences identified as nrfa were invariably phylogenetically affiliated with vibrio spp in all metagenomes and the relative abundance of vibrio spp exhibited significant correlation with that of nrfa p 0 05 according to the spearman s rank correlation that the pronounced biases observed with regards to affiliation of napa napb and nirb to vibrio spp and higher relative abundance of nrfa observed in the pingtan sea microbiomes may have been due merely to the higher relative abundance of vibrio spp is possible but unlikely the xia1 sample with the highest 16s rrna based vibrio relative abundance among the samples collected from xiamen bay had lower proportions of napa napb and nirb genes affiliated to vibrio spp than pin2 and pin3 samples with 8 5 and 7 2 fold lower 16s rrna based vibrio relative abundance in the same context the relative abundance of nrfa in the xia1 sample 7 1 rpkm was similar to those of the pin2 6 8 rpkm and pin3 4 9 rpkm samples the nitrite reductases encoded by nirb have an alternate role as assimilatory nitrite reductases however the periplasmic nitrate reductases napab and the nrfa type nitrite reductases have been predominantly associated with anaerobic respiratory no3 to no2 and no2 to nh4 reductions respectively cruz garcía et al 2007 malm et al 2009 thus presence of selection pressure for vibrio spp possessing the dnra related functional genes was highly probable in the pingtan sea region compared to the functional genes involved with no3 to no2 reduction and dnra the functional genes encoding key enzymes for nitrification and denitrification were in general recovered in relatively low abundance fig 3c the gene abundance of amoa was below 3 1 rpkm in all metagenomes 1 8 0 7 and 1 9 1 7 rpkm at the pingtan sea and xiamen bay sites respectively and all recovered amoa sequences were affiliated with ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa of the candidatus genus nitrosomarinus despite relatively high nh4 n concentrations measured at the pingtan and xiamen bay sites 0 23 0 10 and 0 31 0 11 mg l respectively no bacterial amoa was recovered in any of the metagenomes the collective relative abundance of nxrb narg and narz were 5 1 2 7 and 9 1 2 8 rpkm at the pingtan sea and xiamen bay sites respectively no nirs gene encoding cytochrome cd 1 nitrite reductase was found in any metagenome and the relative abundance of nirk genes encoding the copper dependent nitrite reductases was below 1 5 rpkm notably the nrfa to nirk and nirb to nirk ratios were significantly higher in the pingtan sea metagenomes 80 1 68 0 and 352 5 291 2 respectively than in the xiamen bay metagenomes 2 6 2 2 and 34 4 19 8 respectively and the pin4 site with by far the highest algal biomass exhibited the highest nrfa to nirk and nirb to nirk ratio 163 1 and 532 3 respectively this selective enrichment of nrfa and nirb in the pingtan sea metagenomes appear too heavily biased to be solely attributable to the high relative abundance of vibrio spp 12 5 12 5 versus 5 8 9 1 of xiamen bay metagenomes none of the signature genes for nitrogen fixation nifdhk or anammox hzs and hdh was recovered at a significant abundance 1 7 rpkm metagenomic interrogation of phosphorus uptake and metabolism also identified several notable differences between the pingtan sea and xiamen bay microbiomes fig 3a and fig 3d the ugpabce genes encoding atp binding cassette abc transporters for uptake of glycerol 3 phosphate and glycerophocholine were found in significantly higher relative abundance in the pingtan sea metagenomes than in the xiamen bay metagenomes the phosphonate transporter gene phnd and the high affinity phosphate binding protein psts were both also significantly more abundant in the pingtan sea microbiomes 51 7 15 0 rpkm and 75 5 21 6 rpkm respectively than in the xiamen bay microbiomes 27 4 5 7 rpkm and 50 9 11 8 rpkm respectively as these phosphorus uptake genes are known to be expressed under pi deficient conditions to cope for phosphorus starvation their abundance in pingtan sea metagenomes was consistent with the low concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus 7 9 4 3 10 3 mg l at the pingtan sea sites ilikchyan et al 2009 scanlan et al 1997 yang et al 2009 substantial proportions of phnd 35 5 11 5 psts 43 3 15 0 and ugpb 34 8 15 8 sequences recovered from the pingtan sea metagenomes were affiliated with vibrio spp suggesting that possession of these diverse means of alternative phosphorus uptake may have contributed to the disproportionate proliferation of vibrio spp observed in pingtan sea the genes encoding three distinct forms of alkaline phosphatases phoa phox and phod were found in all metagenomes and phoa and phod both with rpkm values above 50 were among the most abundant nitrogen or phosphorus related functional genes in the metagenomes fig 3d the phoa genes were significantly more abundant in the pingtan metagenomes 68 7 8 4 rpkm than in the xiamen bay metagenomes 49 5 2 6 rpkm p 0 05 however the abundances of phox and phod were not significantly different between the two regions p 0 05 in the pingtan metagenomes vibrio affiliated sequences accounted for the majority of phox 62 3 13 4 while only 13 6 7 0 and 0 8 0 5 of phoa and phod both at least 3 4 fold more abundant than phox were affiliated with vibrio spp therefore the abundances of alkaline phosphatase genes appear to have little relevance to vibrio proliferation or prorocentrum bloom 3 4 vibrio dinoflagellate relationship as inferred from the microbial network analysis of the core microbiome microbial network analysis of the core microbiome further substantiated the alleged association between abundance of vibrio spp and dinoflagellate bloom fig 4 a the relative abundances of two core microbiome taxa including pseudoalteromonas and an unidentified genus of the family cryomorphaceae showed significant positive correlation with the algal biomass and the relative abundances of four other core microbiome taxa exhibited significant negative correlation spearman s r 0 7 p 0 05 fig 4b the core microbiome taxon affiliated to the genus vibrio was positively but not significantly correlated with algal biomass r 0 26 p 0 53 however its relative abundance had strong significant positive correlation r 0 81 p 0 015 with the relative abundance of pseudoalteromonas and significant negative correlations with those of three core microbiome taxa negatively correlated with algal biomass including marine group ii of the phylum euryarchaeota an unidentified genus of the family parvibaculaceae and the is 44 subgroup of the family nitrosomonadaceae r 0 71 p 0 047 r 0 71 p 0 047 r 0 79 p 0 021 respectively of note co abundance of pseudoalteromonas spp with eukaryotic algae has been previously observed and mechanistically explained with basis on the capability of the microorganisms belonging to this taxon to prey on eukaryotic algae skovhus et al 2004 alongside the observation that vibrio spp was the single most abundant taxon in the pin4 microbiome most severely affected by hab these co occurrence patterns surrounding vibrio in the core microbiome network corroborate the possibility of a causal association of vibrio spp with hab despite the lack of statistically significant correlation between the relative abundance of the vibrio and the algal biomass 3 5 ecological association of vibrio spp with dinoflagellate algal bloom as these metagenome analyses suggest association of vibrio spp to the prorocentrum dominated algal blooms was apparent in the examined segment of coastal east china sea strong significant correlations between the abundance of vibrio spp and the environmental metrics for eutrophication tsi r 0 833 p 0 011 as well as the chlorophyll a concentration r 0 762 p 0 028 also support that the vibrio and algal proliferation may be mechanistically correlated table s5 these observations are in line with a number of previous studies that have reported occurrences of vibrio blooms in coastal seas simultaneous with blooms of phytoplanktons e g cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates or immediately following their demise asplund et al 2011 eiler et al 2006 gilbert et al 2012 main et al 2015 takemura et al 2014 in a study that monitored microbial population dynamics over a six year period off the coast of plymouth uk the time point at which a single vibrio sp dominated the prokaryotic population representing 54 of the entire pool of 16s rrna sequences coincided with a peak in the population of a diatom species chaetoceros compressus gilbert et al 2012 another study performed during raphidophyte blooms in delaware s inland bays identified significant correlation between the abundances of particle associated vibrio spp and the raphidophyte population main et al 2015 these previous studies have hypothetically attributed the observed abundance of vibrio spp to the benefits these opportunistic fast growing bacteria may gain from phytoplanktons such as protection from zooplankton predation and provision of algal exudates or detritus as organic substrates asplund et al 2011 main et al 2015 takemura et al 2014 although vibrio spp may form biofilms attached to microalgal cells and detritus physically and chemically protected from grazing recent culture independent studies have repeatedly identified particle associated fractions as minor fractions of vibrio population in seawater liang et al 2019 thus supply of labile organics photosynthetically produced and released by algal counterparts is deemed more likely as the primary mechanism via which algal blooms accommodate disproportionate proliferation of vibrio spp thickman and gobler 2017 further several vibrio species have been physiologically characterized as alginolytic and thus may be able to utilize dead algal biomass or even be algicidal in this study core microbiome analysis identified a strong significant positive correlation between vibrio and pseudoalteromonas a taxon widely known to include algicidal bacteria lee et al 2000 this correlation may be interpreted as two groups of specialists sharing a habitat abound with their common substrates i e live or dead algal biomass and or algae derived organic materials it may also be possible that smaller organic compounds produced from pseudoalteromanas mediated algal biomass digestion may serve as more labile organic substrates for fast growing vibrio spp thickman and gobler 2017 either hypothesized mechanism would be consistent with the co occurrence of vibrio proliferation and prorocentrum dominant algal bloom observed in this study whether the presumed vibrio prorocentrum association may be a commensal relationship benefitting only vibrio spp or a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship cannot be inferred from these previous reports as none of them investigated or discussed how vibrio spp may contribute to algal blooms nevertheless the findings from the comparative metagenomic analysis of the nitrogen functional genes suggest scenarios how vibrio proliferation may provide positive feedback to growth of prorocentrum spp and possibly other eukaryotic microalgae the proportion of vibrio associated functional genes were in general higher at the pingtan sea sites than at the xiamen bay sites probably due merely to the higher vibrio abundance however vibrio s exclusive ownership of dnra related functional genes i e napab and nrfa and the near complete absence of denitrification related functional genes nirk and nirs that are often found in genomes of marine heterotrophic bacteria e g algicidal pseudoalteromonas spp are not explicable merely with the high vibrio abundance the do concentrations of the bulk seawater at the pingtan sea sites including the pin4 site with the highest prorocentrum population and algal biomass indicated that the bulk seawater was oxic at the time of sampling which due to logistical reasons took place during the daytime under oxic conditions dnra is not likely to occur as it is known as a strictly anaerobic process however considering the high populations of the fast metabolizing vibrio and prorocentrum that may be potent o2 sinks at dark hours it is plausible that periodic oxic anoxic shifts may occur in the region especially at highly eutrophicated locales such as the pin4 and pin5 sites broman et al 2021 hitchcock et al 2014 spatial microaerobic or anoxic niches may also exist such as in biofilms attached to particle surfaces microbial aggregates and intracellular spaces within zooplankton or phytoplankton where vibrio spp may be able to colonize bianchi et al 2018 broman et al 2021 espinoza vergara et al 2020 van der henst et al 2016 rapid decay of algal carcass and or upwelling of hypoxic bottom water may also cause temporal anoxia that may not be captured by snapshots of do measurement lee et al 2005 pitcher et al 2014 further the redox potentials measured in situ at the pingtan sea 43 9 2 5 mv sites were in fact substantially lower than the standard redox potentials at ph 7 0 of no3 to no2 420 mv and no2 to nh4 reduction 440 mv despite the do concentrations ranging between 4 73 6 89 mg l 1 thus it is highly likely that at least some of the napab and nrfa possessing vibrio spp become dnra active once initial patchy prorocentrum blooms supported by initially available dissolved nh4 n start to develop the vibrio mediated dnra may promote growth of prorocentrum spp by providing additional supply of nh4 generally known as a more efficient nitrogen source for fast growing dinoflagellates than no3 as a positive feedback bringing about an increase in the area and intensity of hab ou et al 2019 although any decisive conclusion cannot be reached solely based on the metagenome analysis the findings from this study are certainly compelling indications that nh4 production via dnra may be key to the hypothesized symbiotic association between vibrio spp and prorocentrum spp and warrant further attention to the role that dnra may play in prorocentrum dominated hab 4 conclusions occurrences of severe marine algal blooms are often attributed to nitrogen and or phosphorus enrichment relieving nutrient limitations to algal growth however conclusive evidence of the presumed correlation between the nutrient conditions and algal population has remained elusive in this study we attempted a different avenue of approach using comparative metagenomics to investigate any association between surface seawater microbiomes and prorocentrum dominated algal blooms in east china sea the most prominent feature that distinguished the microbiomes of pingtan sea with frequent severe prorocentrum blooms from that of xiamen bay much less frequently affected was enrichment of organisms affiliated with vibrio spp and disproportionately biased affiliation of napab and nrfa to this taxon the alleged association between dnra capable vibrio spp and algal bloom in this locale was further substantiated via core microbiome network analysis the findings suggest a previously unidentified causal association between vibrio proliferation and dinoflagellate bloom in subtropical marine environment and broach the possibility that dnra may play a key role in mutually

16664,coastal harmful algal blooms habs commonly termed red tides have severe undesirable consequences to the marine ecosystems and local fishery and tourism industries increase in nitrogen and or phosphorus loading is often regarded as the major culprits of increasing frequency and intensity of the coastal hab however fundamental understanding is lacking as to the causes and mechanism of bloom formation despite decades of intensive investigation in this study we interrogated the prokaryotic microbiomes of surface water samples collected at two neighboring segments of east china sea that contrast greatly in terms of the intensity and frequency of prorocentrum dominated hab mantel tests identified significant correlations between the structural and functional composition of the microbiomes and the physicochemical state and the algal biomass density of the surface seawater implying the possibility that prokaryotic microbiota may play key roles in the coastal hab a conspicuous feature of the microbiomes at the sites characterized with high trophic state index and eukaryotic algal cell counts was disproportionate proliferation of vibrio spp and their complete domination of the functional genes attributable to the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra pathway substantially enriched at these sites the genes attributed to phosphorus uptake function were significantly enriched at these sites presumably due to the pi deficiency induced by algal growth however the profiles of the phosphorus mineralization genes lacked consistency barring any conclusive evidence with regard to contribution of prokaryotic microbiota to phosphorus bioavailability the results of the co occurrence network analysis performed with the core prokaryotic microbiome supported that the observed proliferation of vibrio and hab may be causally associated the findings of this study suggest a previously unidentified association between vibrio proliferation and the prorocentrum dominated hab in the subtropical east china sea and opens a discussion regarding a theoretically unlikely but still possible involvement of vibrio mediated dnra in vibrio prorocentrum symbiosis further experimental substantiation of this supposed symbiotic mechanism may prove crucial in understanding the dynamics of explosive local algal growth in the region during spring algal blooms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords harmful algal bloom microbiome metagenomics prorocentrum vibrio dnra 1 introduction today many coastal regions across the globe suffer from harmful algal blooms hab more widely known as the layman s term red tides anderson et al 2012 the east china sea off the southeast coast of china has been one of the regions most severely affected by hab since the 1980s tang et al 2006 since the turn of millennium the major culprits of hab in the east china sea have shifted to the dinoflagellates prorocentrum spp a group of fast growing phototrophic algae widespread in coastal waters across the globe heil et al 2005 the species prevalent in hab in east china sea which had been named p donghaiense is neither morphologically nor genotypically clearly distinguishable from other prorocentrum species with worldwide distribution e g p dentatum and p obtusidens lu et al 2005 shin et al 2019 although toxin production by this particular species has not been reported the possibility cannot be totally ruled out as several prorocentrum species have been observed to produce okadaic acid dinophysistoxin 1 and prorocentrolide ben gharbia et al 2016 nascimento et al 2017 even apart from toxin production intense prorocentrum blooms cause substantial detrimental impacts to the local marine and estuarine ecosystems by means of oxygen depletion alteration of ph and or light attenuation which are typical for high biomass algal blooms anderson et al 2012 azanza et al 2005 gallegos and bergstrom 2005 such ecological damage as well as aesthetic deterioration due to coloration and putrefaction accompanied with the blooms have caused immense damage to the local tourism fishing and aquaculture industries yu et al 2018 the annually repetitive nature of the prorocentrum algal bloom in the east china sea as well as explosive growths of p donghaiense observed during progressions of the algal blooms endemic to the region suggests that in situ growth is more important than vertical and or horizontal migration in understanding the mechanisms of bloom dynamics in the region li et al 2011 tang et al 2006 as p donghaiense is primarily a photoautotrophic organism with carbon needs mostly fulfilled from uptake of inorganic carbon the environmental factors regarded to be crucial to its overgrowth during the bloom events are presumably availability of nitrogen and phosphorus as suggested by previous laboratory observations anderson et al 2012 glibert et al 2008 varkitzi et al 2010 although several published data collected from the east china sea suggest potential correlations between nitrogen and phosphorus availability and p donghaiense blooms conclusive experimental evidences are still lacking and it is yet unclear whether or which specific forms of nitrogen and phosphorus support rapid growth of p donghaiense li et al 2010 zhou et al 2017 as such the decades long question as to whether or how relief of nitrogen and or phosphorus limitation initiates p donghaiense bloom remains unanswered in this study we approached this same old question from a different perspective exploring the possibility that the sea surface microbiome may play a key role in formation and progression of prorocentrum blooms diverse bacterial and archaeal constituents of the sea surface microbiota are involved with cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus kuypers et al 2018 in the euphotic zone generally characterized by supple sunlight and oxygen availability photosynthetic cyanobacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonium and organic nitrogen and diverse bacteria and archaea catalyze aerobic mineralization of organic n and oxidation of nh3 and no2 dore and karl 1996 michael beman et al 2012 wankel et al 2007 typically no3 is often the most abundant form of nitrogen at the sea surface due to its oxidizing condition mahmud et al 2020 patey et al 2008 the microbial reactions perceived as predominantly anaerobic e g denitrification anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox and dissimilatory nitrate nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra may also occur during periodic hypoxia e g nocturnal anoxic spells during high biomass algal blooms and periods of massive biomass decay following demise of algal blooms conley et al 2011 turner et al 2015 such microbial mediated nitrogen transformation reactions may affect nitrogen supply to phytoplankton as they may alter the overall nitrogen availability as well as nitrogen speciation as nitrogen is often regarded as the limiting nutrient for algal growth during rapid blooms and previous laboratory experiments have shown that certain nitrogen species are favored by prorocentrum spp over others investigations into these microbially mediated nitrogen transformations may help improve understanding of the bloom dynamics in the east china sea fan et al 2003 heil et al 2005 varkitzi et al 2010 less predictable is the influence of microbiota on hab via alteration of the marine phosphorus cycle given the patchy ecophysiological understanding of marine microbial phosphorus metabolism previous metagenomic analyses have revealed abundance and omnipresence of diverse phoa phod and phox type alkaline phosphatases ap and c p lyases and hydrolases in seawater microbiomes which have been known to be involved with disintegration of inorganic phosphorus pi from phosphoesters and phosphonates luo et al 2009 luo and moran 2013 sebastian and ammerman 2009 expressions of these organic phosphorus metabolizing enzymes are generally perceived to be under pho regulon control such that they are expressed only under pi deficiency however pi insensitive expression and activity of alkaline phosphatases and c p hydrolases have been experimentally demonstrated in both in situ and laboratory experiments chin et al 2018 suzumura et al 2012 thus bacterial mineralization of organic phosphorus may enrich the inorganic phosphorus pool in situ and increase phosphorus bioavailability to phytoplanktons contributing to formation of hab hoppe 2003 luo et al 2009 thomson et al 2019 marine eukaryotic phytoplankton including prorocentrum spp also synthesize active ap hoppe 2003 labry et al 2005 ou et al 2020 however a recent field study conducted in the east china sea during a late spring p donghaiense bloom showed that the bacterial fraction accounted for the majority of ap activity and that the contribution of eukaryotic algae was minimal mo et al 2020 here a comparative survey of the sea surface microbiomes was performed at two neighboring coastal seas off the coastline of fujian province in southeastern china the sea surrounding pingtan island hereafter referred to as pingtan sea has been regularly and frequently affected by p donghaiense blooms in contrast xiamen bay 200 km to the southwest has stayed mostly free of prorocentrum spp although occasional occurrences of moderate diatom and dinoflagellate blooms have been reported zhuo 2018 during a typical spring dinoflagellate bloom event in the pingtan sea in 2019 surface seawater samples were collected from five locations in pingtan sea and three locations in xiamen bay and the physicochemical properties of the seawater and population densities and compositions of the eukaryotic algae were analyzed the microbiomes of these seawater samples were then analyzed with shotgun metagenome sequencing the compositional and functional features of the microbiomes were analyzed with particular emphasis on those relating to nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism and statistically associated with the severity of hab in the region the findings from the comparative metagenomics analysis warrant further investigation into interactions between key microbial groups e g vibrio spp and eukaryotic algae for a more complete understanding of hab dynamics in coastal seas 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and in situ treatment and characterization sampling was performed at five locations along the coast of pingtan island 25 28 25 36 n 119 49 119 52 e and three coastal locations in the xiamen bay 24 25 24 36 n 118 0 118 10 e in the mornings of april 27 and 29 2018 respectively fig 1 a bulk seawater

china and one liter of the filtrate was passed through a 0 22 μm membrane filter to collect biomass merck millipore burlington ma the phytoplankton nets and membrane filters were preserved in 2 formalin solution for transport to the institute of fish resources in varna bulgaria where the resuspended phytoplankton cells were examined with an olympus bx43 phase contrast microscope tokyo japan olenina et al 2006 the phytoplankton cells resuspended from the phytoplankton nets were used for exhaustive identification of phytoplankton taxa and algal cell counting was performed with the membrane

diego ca the shotgun metagenome libraries were sequenced with an illumina novaseq pe150 platform generating 150 bp paired end reads with a targeted throughput of 12 gb per sample the raw sequence data have been deposited in ncbi sra database under the accession number prjna739281 quantitative pcr qpcr assay targeting the 16s rrna gene was performed with the extracted dna for estimation of prokaryotic population in the seawater samples the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was targeted with the 319f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 degenerate primer pair fadrosh et

with a serial dilution series of 16s rrna gene pcr fragments amplified from dna isolated from a seawater sample and inserted in pcr2 1 vectors 2 3 microbial community analysis and metagenomic analysis

minlen 70 bolger et al 2014 the quality trimmed reads were screened for putative 16s rrna gene fragments using the hmmsearch based meta rna 3 software with the parameters molecule type and e value set to ssu and 1e 10 respectively huang et al 2009 these reads were reconstructed to full length 16s rrna gene sequences using emerge through 100 iterations with silva ssu database release 132 as reference miller et al 2011 a qiime compatible otu table was constructed with these full length 16s rrna gene sequences and the relative abundances of the otus were computed using an in house python script which converted the normalized coverage of each emirge synthesized 16s rrna gene to an otu count the otus were assigned taxonomic classification using rdp classifier v2 10 2 with silva ssu

length in kilobases and the total read count of the sample analyzed in million reads yielding gene coverage values in rpkm reads per kilobase per million mapped reads 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses in this study were performed using nonparametric methods due to the small sample size n 8 all statistical analyses were performed using r v4 0 2 r core team 2013 pairwise comparisons of the environmental parameters between sampling sites were statistically evaluated with student s t test using wilcox test function implemented in the stats package spearman s rank correlation tests were performed to evaluate statistical significance of pairwise correlations between the environmental parameters mantel tests evaluated pairwise correlations among physicochemical parameter matrices the algal biomass data the microbial community profiles the kegg orthology ko number based functional gene abundance profiles and the cazymes profiles the dissimilarity matrices for these datasets were constructed using either bray curtis dissimilatory metrics vegdist function in vegan package or euclidean distance metrics dist function in stats package and these dissimilarity matrices were used as the inputs for the mantel tests performed using the mantel function implemented in vegan package with the correlation method and permutation options set to spearman and 9999 respectively the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses of microbial communities and functional gene compositions were performed based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrices constructed using metamds function embedded in vegan package the co occurrence networks were constructed based on the pairwise spearman s correlation analyses performed with the relative abundances of the selected otus using cor test function in stats package co occurrence networks visualizing the connections between the otus exhibiting significant correlations p 0 05 were constructed using cytoscape v3 7 2 su et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the sampling sites notable differences were observed between the physicochemical characteristics of the surface water samples collected from the pingtan sea pin1 pin5 and the xiamen bay xia1 xia3 fig s1 table s1 the surface water temperature was higher at the xiamen bay sites by approximately 3 c at the time of sampling and the ph and salinity were slightly but significantly higher p 0 05 at the pingtan sea sites the dissolved oxygen do concentration of the surface water ranged between 4 7 and 6 9 mg l but no significant difference was found between the two regions p 0 05 the measured oxidation reduction potential orp values were 43 9 2 5 mv and 22 1 6 5 mv at the pingtan sea and the xiamen bay sites respectively fig s1 overall xiamen bay was more nutrient rich than the pingtan sea the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration was significantly higher p 0 05 in the xiamen bay samples 1 5 0 3 mg n l than in the pingtan sea samples 0 76 0 2 mg n l the no3 and no2 concentrations were both significantly higher p 0 05 in xiamen bay with 1 1 0 2 mg no3 n l and 0 070 0 020 mg no2 n l as compared to 0 53 0 08 mg no3 n l and 0 010 0 001 mg no2 n l measured in pingtan sea nh4 concentrations were not significantly different p 0 05 between xiamen bay 0 31 0 11 mg nh4 n l and pingtan sea 0 23 0 10 mg nh4 n l fig s1 the concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus srp dissolved total phosphorus dtp and total phosphorus tp were all significantly higher in xiamen bay than pingtan sea fig s1 depletion of srp was particularly notable in the surface seawater of the pingtan sea as the srp concentrations measured at the pingtan sea sites were 26 18 of the concentrations measured at the xiamen bay sites the dtn to dtp ratio was significantly higher p 0 05 in pingtan sea according to the criterion based on the carlson s trophic indices tsi three of the five sampling locations in pingtan sea pin1 pin4 and pin5 and two of three in xiamen bay xia1 and xia2 were classified as eutrophic tsi 50 the total eukaryotic algal cell count was the highest at pin4 1 2 106 cells l and the algal cells morphologically identified as prorocentrum spp accounted for 91 0 of the total algal population table s2 the only other site with a substantial prorocentrum spp population was pin5 where 3 6 105 cells l out of the total algal population of 5 2 105 cells l were identified as prorocentrum spp the total 16s rrna gene copy numbers as an indicator of prokaryotic population ranged between 9 9 1 3 107 and 4 2 0 2 108 copies l in pingtan sea and between 9 1 0 9 107 and 2 9 0 9 108 copies l in xiamen bay fig 1b and table s2 3 2 analysis of prokaryotic community and core microbiome designation analysis of the prokaryotic community structures of pin1 5 and xia1 3 identified proteobacteria as the dominant phylum with its relative abundance ranging from 76 4 to 88 2 fig 2 a alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria constituted 18 0 34 6 and 41 5 70 0 of the prokaryotic communities respectively bacteroidia were also abundant constituting 6 3 17 0 of the total prokaryotic community although archaeal otus affiliated to thermoplasmata and nitrososphaeria were found in the metagenomes the cumulative relative abundance of the archaeal otus was below 1 5 in any of the samples analyzed the beta diversity analysis of the sea surface microbiomes clearly set the pingtan sites apart from the xiamen sites fig 2c e the non metric multidimension scaling nmds plots constructed via taxonomic grouping of 16s rrna gene sequences and functional assignments of translated enzyme sequences to kegg orthology ko groups and cazymes groups invariably separated pin1 5 from xia1 3 fig 2c e suggesting disparities between the microbiomes of these two regions in terms of both taxonomic and functional make ups the pairwise mantel tests identified significant correlations between the taxonomic and functional compositions of the microbiomes and the states of the surface seawater at the pingtan and xiamen sites fig 2b significant correlation was observed between algal biomass and 16s rrna based community composition r m 0 39 p 0 04 algal biomass was also significantly correlated with the functional profiles of the microbiomes r m 0 55 p 0 03 and r m 0 55 p 0 03 for correlations with ko based and cazyme based functional profiles respectively a stronger statistically significant correlation was observed between the physicochemical states of the seawater and the prokaryotic community compositions r m 0 61 p 0 002 and the ko based and cazyme based functional profiles r m 0 57 p 0 001 and r m 0 71 p 0 002 respectively of the microbiomes the physicochemical states were not significantly correlated with the algal biomass r m 0 35 p 0 093 suggesting that a snapshot of the physicochemical state of seawater is not sufficient as an indicator for hab possibly the significant correlation between the microbiome composition and the algal biomass may imply that the history of the recent biogeochemical events missing in a snapshot characterization of physicochemical properties is ingrained in the taxonomic and functional compositions of the microbiome luria et al 2016 another possible scenario that can be inferred from the mantel test results is the microbiota shaped by environmental pressure playing a direct role in algal bloom development in a sense analogous to the key principle underlying diet microbiome host interactions in human and animal guts bindels et al 2015 the otus identified in the samples were assigned to 379 bacterial and 5 archaeal taxa according to genus level classification and 47 of these taxa shared by all 8 metagenomes were further considered as the members of the core microbiome table s3 the core microbiome consisted of 46 bacterial taxa and one archaeal taxon most of which are uncultured and understudied the members of the core microbiome constituted vast majority of the total prokaryotic community in each of the analyzed samples such that their cumulative relative abundance ranged between 70 4 and 76 9 at the pingtan sea sites and between 62 6 and 73 6 at the xiamen bay sites table s3 the core microbiome taxa with 1 relative abundance at all sites included the sar11 clade pseudoalteromonas vibrio candidatus actinomarina the ns5 marine group and an unidentified genus of rhodobacteraceae the high abundance of vibrio spp at pin1 pin4 pin5 and xia1 was especially notable vibrio spp constituted 15 2 32 7 9 9 and 19 3 of the prokaryotic populations at the respective sites all of which were categorized as eutrophic according to their tsi values 50 the relative abundance of the vibrio was 4 5 at the other four sites where with sole exception of xia2 the tsi values indicated mesotrophic conditions another core microbiome taxon affiliated to the vibrionaceae family unassignable to any distinct genus was found at pin2 and pin3 sites with 10 relative abundance however its low abundance in pin4 1 3 suggests relevance of this taxon to eutrophication or algal bloom unlikely 3 3 metagenomic analysis of nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism the metagenomic profiles of nitrogen metabolism related genes in the microbiomes suggest possible involvement of the prokaryotic microbiome in altering the availability of labile nitrogen to prorocentrum dominated algal populations fig 3 and table s4 apart from the genes involved with urea uptake and mineralization ureabc and urtabcde all of the most abundant nitrogen functional genes were relevant to dissimilatory and assimilatory no3 to no2 reduction napab and nasa and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra nrfa and nirb the genes encoding for the periplasmic nitrate reductase napab had substantially higher relative abundance at the pingtan sea sites 10 2 39 8 rpkm for napa and 6 0 27 3 rpkm for napb than in the xiamen bay sites 6 9 17 1 rpkm for napa and 8 0 14 2 rpkm for napb although the differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 the nirb and nrfa genes encoding the catalytic subunits of the two distinct forms of nitrite reductases central to the dnra pathway showed high relative abundance at the pingtan sea and xiamen bay sites heo et al 2020 the relative abundance of nirb ranged between 26 6 and 87 5 rpkm in the pingtan sea metagenomes and 17 5 and 50 4 rpkm in the xiamen bay metagenomes the nrfa genes recovered in lower abundance than nirb in all metagenomes were also substantially more abundant in the pingtan sea metagenomes 12 7 8 9 rpkm than in xiamen bay metagenomes 3 1 3 5 rpkm although the differences were not significant due to the large sample to sample variations disproportionately large shares of napa nirb and nrfa genes were phylogenetically affiliated with vibrio spp considering that the relative abundance of vibrio spp did not exceed 33 of the total prokaryotic population according to the 16s rrna based community composition analyses at the pingtan sea sites where this tendency was more pronounced 93 2 95 8 and 56 1 of the reads mapped onto napa napb and nirb respectively were phylogenetically affiliated with the genus vibrio the gene coding sequences identified as nrfa were invariably phylogenetically affiliated with vibrio spp in all metagenomes and the relative abundance of vibrio spp exhibited significant correlation with that of nrfa p 0 05 according to the spearman s rank correlation that the pronounced biases observed with regards to affiliation of napa napb and nirb to vibrio spp and higher relative abundance of nrfa observed in the pingtan sea microbiomes may have been due merely to the higher relative abundance of vibrio spp is possible but unlikely the xia1 sample with the highest 16s rrna based vibrio relative abundance among the samples collected from xiamen bay had lower proportions of napa napb and nirb genes affiliated to vibrio spp than pin2 and pin3 samples with 8 5 and 7 2 fold lower 16s rrna based vibrio relative abundance in the same context the relative abundance of nrfa in the xia1 sample 7 1 rpkm was similar to those of the pin2 6 8 rpkm and pin3 4 9 rpkm samples the nitrite reductases encoded by nirb have an alternate role as assimilatory nitrite reductases however the periplasmic nitrate reductases napab and the nrfa type nitrite reductases have been predominantly associated with anaerobic respiratory no3 to no2 and no2 to nh4 reductions respectively cruz garcía et al 2007 malm et al 2009 thus presence of selection pressure for vibrio spp possessing the dnra related functional genes was highly probable in the pingtan sea region compared to the functional genes involved with no3 to no2 reduction and dnra the functional genes encoding key enzymes for nitrification and denitrification were in general recovered in relatively low abundance fig 3c the gene abundance of amoa was below 3 1 rpkm in all metagenomes 1 8 0 7 and 1 9 1 7 rpkm at the pingtan sea and xiamen bay sites respectively and all recovered amoa sequences were affiliated with ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa of the candidatus genus nitrosomarinus despite relatively high nh4 n concentrations measured at the pingtan and xiamen bay sites 0 23 0 10 and 0 31 0 11 mg l respectively no bacterial amoa was recovered in any of the metagenomes the collective relative abundance of nxrb narg and narz were 5 1 2 7 and 9 1 2 8 rpkm at the pingtan sea and xiamen bay sites respectively no nirs gene encoding cytochrome cd 1 nitrite reductase was found in any metagenome and the relative abundance of nirk genes encoding the copper dependent nitrite reductases was below 1 5 rpkm notably the nrfa to nirk and nirb to nirk ratios were significantly higher in the pingtan sea metagenomes 80 1 68 0 and 352 5 291 2 respectively than in the xiamen bay metagenomes 2 6 2 2 and 34 4 19 8 respectively and the pin4 site with by far the highest algal biomass exhibited the highest nrfa to nirk and nirb to nirk ratio 163 1 and 532 3 respectively this selective enrichment of nrfa and nirb in the pingtan sea metagenomes appear too heavily biased to be solely attributable to the high relative abundance of vibrio spp 12 5 12 5 versus 5 8 9 1 of xiamen bay metagenomes none of the signature genes for nitrogen fixation nifdhk or anammox hzs and hdh was recovered at a significant abundance 1 7 rpkm metagenomic interrogation of phosphorus uptake and metabolism also identified several notable differences between the pingtan sea and xiamen bay microbiomes fig 3a and fig 3d the ugpabce genes encoding atp binding cassette abc transporters for uptake of glycerol 3 phosphate and glycerophocholine were found in significantly higher relative abundance in the pingtan sea metagenomes than in the xiamen bay metagenomes the phosphonate transporter gene phnd and the high affinity phosphate binding protein psts were both also significantly more abundant in the pingtan sea microbiomes 51 7 15 0 rpkm and 75 5 21 6 rpkm respectively than in the xiamen bay microbiomes 27 4 5 7 rpkm and 50 9 11 8 rpkm respectively as these phosphorus uptake genes are known to be expressed under pi deficient conditions to cope for phosphorus starvation their abundance in pingtan sea metagenomes was consistent with the low concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus 7 9 4 3 10 3 mg l at the pingtan sea sites ilikchyan et al 2009 scanlan et al 1997 yang et al 2009 substantial proportions of phnd 35 5 11 5 psts 43 3 15 0 and ugpb 34 8 15 8 sequences recovered from the pingtan sea metagenomes were affiliated with vibrio spp suggesting that possession of these diverse means of alternative phosphorus uptake may have contributed to the disproportionate proliferation of vibrio spp observed in pingtan sea the genes encoding three distinct forms of alkaline phosphatases phoa phox and phod were found in all metagenomes and phoa and phod both with rpkm values above 50 were among the most abundant nitrogen or phosphorus related functional genes in the metagenomes fig 3d the phoa genes were significantly more abundant in the pingtan metagenomes 68 7 8 4 rpkm than in the xiamen bay metagenomes 49 5 2 6 rpkm p 0 05 however the abundances of phox and phod were not significantly different between the two regions p 0 05 in the pingtan metagenomes vibrio affiliated sequences accounted for the majority of phox 62 3 13 4 while only 13 6 7 0 and 0 8 0 5 of phoa and phod both at least 3 4 fold more abundant than phox were affiliated with vibrio spp therefore the abundances of alkaline phosphatase genes appear to have little relevance to vibrio proliferation or prorocentrum bloom 3 4 vibrio dinoflagellate relationship as inferred from the microbial network analysis of the core microbiome microbial network analysis of the core microbiome further substantiated the alleged association between abundance of vibrio spp and dinoflagellate bloom fig 4 a the relative abundances of two core microbiome taxa including pseudoalteromonas and an unidentified genus of the family cryomorphaceae showed significant positive correlation with the algal biomass and the relative abundances of four other core microbiome taxa exhibited significant negative correlation spearman s r 0 7 p 0 05 fig 4b the core microbiome taxon affiliated to the genus vibrio was positively but not significantly correlated with algal biomass r 0 26 p 0 53 however its relative abundance had strong significant positive correlation r 0 81 p 0 015 with the relative abundance of pseudoalteromonas and significant negative correlations with those of three core microbiome taxa negatively correlated with algal biomass including marine group ii of the phylum euryarchaeota an unidentified genus of the family parvibaculaceae and the is 44 subgroup of the family nitrosomonadaceae r 0 71 p 0 047 r 0 71 p 0 047 r 0 79 p 0 021 respectively of note co abundance of pseudoalteromonas spp with eukaryotic algae has been previously observed and mechanistically explained with basis on the capability of the microorganisms belonging to this taxon to prey on eukaryotic algae skovhus et al 2004 alongside the observation that vibrio spp was the single most abundant taxon in the pin4 microbiome most severely affected by hab these co occurrence patterns surrounding vibrio in the core microbiome network corroborate the possibility of a causal association of vibrio spp with hab despite the lack of statistically significant correlation between the relative abundance of the vibrio and the algal biomass 3 5 ecological association of vibrio spp with dinoflagellate algal bloom as these metagenome analyses suggest association of vibrio spp to the prorocentrum dominated algal blooms was apparent in the examined segment of coastal east china sea strong significant correlations between the abundance of vibrio spp and the environmental metrics for eutrophication tsi r 0 833 p 0 011 as well as the chlorophyll a concentration r 0 762 p 0 028 also support that the vibrio and algal proliferation may be mechanistically correlated table s5 these observations are in line with a number of previous studies that have reported occurrences of vibrio blooms in coastal seas simultaneous with blooms of phytoplanktons e g cyanobacteria diatoms and dinoflagellates or immediately following their demise asplund et al 2011 eiler et al 2006 gilbert et al 2012 main et al 2015 takemura et al 2014 in a study that monitored microbial population dynamics over a six year period off the coast of plymouth uk the time point at which a single vibrio sp dominated the prokaryotic population representing 54 of the entire pool of 16s rrna sequences coincided with a peak in the population of a diatom species chaetoceros compressus gilbert et al 2012 another study performed during raphidophyte blooms in delaware s inland bays identified significant correlation between the abundances of particle associated vibrio spp and the raphidophyte population main et al 2015 these previous studies have hypothetically attributed the observed abundance of vibrio spp to the benefits these opportunistic fast growing bacteria may gain from phytoplanktons such as protection from zooplankton predation and provision of algal exudates or detritus as organic substrates asplund et al 2011 main et al 2015 takemura et al 2014 although vibrio spp may form biofilms attached to microalgal cells and detritus physically and chemically protected from grazing recent culture independent studies have repeatedly identified particle associated fractions as minor fractions of vibrio population in seawater liang et al 2019 thus supply of labile organics photosynthetically produced and released by algal counterparts is deemed more likely as the primary mechanism via which algal blooms accommodate disproportionate proliferation of vibrio spp thickman and gobler 2017 further several vibrio species have been physiologically characterized as alginolytic and thus may be able to utilize dead algal biomass or even be algicidal in this study core microbiome analysis identified a strong significant positive correlation between vibrio and pseudoalteromonas a taxon widely known to include algicidal bacteria lee et al 2000 this correlation may be interpreted as two groups of specialists sharing a habitat abound with their common substrates i e live or dead algal biomass and or algae derived organic materials it may also be possible that smaller organic compounds produced from pseudoalteromanas mediated algal biomass digestion may serve as more labile organic substrates for fast growing vibrio spp thickman and gobler 2017 either hypothesized mechanism would be consistent with the co occurrence of vibrio proliferation and prorocentrum dominant algal bloom observed in this study whether the presumed vibrio prorocentrum association may be a commensal relationship benefitting only vibrio spp or a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship cannot be inferred from these previous reports as none of them investigated or discussed how vibrio spp may contribute to algal blooms nevertheless the findings from the comparative metagenomic analysis of the nitrogen functional genes suggest scenarios how vibrio proliferation may provide positive feedback to growth of prorocentrum spp and possibly other eukaryotic microalgae the proportion of vibrio associated functional genes were in general higher at the pingtan sea sites than at the xiamen bay sites probably due merely to the higher vibrio abundance however vibrio s exclusive ownership of dnra related functional genes i e napab and nrfa and the near complete absence of denitrification related functional genes nirk and nirs that are often found in genomes of marine heterotrophic bacteria e g algicidal pseudoalteromonas spp are not explicable merely with the high vibrio abundance the do concentrations of the bulk seawater at the pingtan sea sites including the pin4 site with the highest prorocentrum population and algal biomass indicated that the bulk seawater was oxic at the time of sampling which due to logistical reasons took place during the daytime under oxic conditions dnra is not likely to occur as it is known as a strictly anaerobic process however considering the high populations of the fast metabolizing vibrio and prorocentrum that may be potent o2 sinks at dark hours it is plausible that periodic oxic anoxic shifts may occur in the region especially at highly eutrophicated locales such as the pin4 and pin5 sites broman et al 2021 hitchcock et al 2014 spatial microaerobic or anoxic niches may also exist such as in biofilms attached to particle surfaces microbial aggregates and intracellular spaces within zooplankton or phytoplankton where vibrio spp may be able to colonize bianchi et al 2018 broman et al 2021 espinoza vergara et al 2020 van der henst et al 2016 rapid decay of algal carcass and or upwelling of hypoxic bottom water may also cause temporal anoxia that may not be captured by snapshots of do measurement lee et al 2005 pitcher et al 2014 further the redox potentials measured in situ at the pingtan sea 43 9 2 5 mv sites were in fact substantially lower than the standard redox potentials at ph 7 0 of no3 to no2 420 mv and no2 to nh4 reduction 440 mv despite the do concentrations ranging between 4 73 6 89 mg l 1 thus it is highly likely that at least some of the napab and nrfa possessing vibrio spp become dnra active once initial patchy prorocentrum blooms supported by initially available dissolved nh4 n start to develop the vibrio mediated dnra may promote growth of prorocentrum spp by providing additional supply of nh4 generally known as a more efficient nitrogen source for fast growing dinoflagellates than no3 as a positive feedback bringing about an increase in the area and intensity of hab ou et al 2019 although any decisive conclusion cannot be reached solely based on the metagenome analysis the findings from this study are certainly compelling indications that nh4 production via dnra may be key to the hypothesized symbiotic association between vibrio spp and prorocentrum spp and warrant further attention to the role that dnra may play in prorocentrum dominated hab 4 conclusions occurrences of severe marine algal blooms are often attributed to nitrogen and or phosphorus enrichment relieving nutrient limitations to algal growth however conclusive evidence of the presumed correlation between the nutrient conditions and algal population has remained elusive in this study we attempted a different avenue of approach using comparative metagenomics to investigate any association between surface seawater microbiomes and prorocentrum dominated algal blooms in east china sea the most prominent feature that distinguished the microbiomes of pingtan sea with frequent severe prorocentrum blooms from that of xiamen bay much less frequently affected was enrichment of organisms affiliated with vibrio spp and disproportionately biased affiliation of napab and nrfa to this taxon the alleged association between dnra capable vibrio spp and algal bloom in this locale was further substantiated via core microbiome network analysis the findings suggest a previously unidentified causal association between vibrio proliferation and dinoflagellate bloom in subtropical marine environment and broach the possibility that dnra may play a key role in mutually
