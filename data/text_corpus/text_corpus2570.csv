12850,benzodiazepines and carbamazepine are mental disorder treatment related contaminants of emerging concern cecs routinely detected in water bodies electrochemical oxidation eo processes have been proven effective in reducing cecs levels although the toxic effects of residual compounds formed after eo are still scarcely studied herein ultrapure water up surface water sw municipal wastewater mww and industrial pharmaceutical wastewater iww were spiked with four benzodiazepines alprazolam clonazepam diazepam lorazepam and carbamazepine 100 μg l 1 each and treated by an eo process employing two electrodes a platinum coated titanium ti pt and a boron doped diamond bdd neurotoxicity tests were performed by exposing rat hippocampus slices to eo treated waters to investigate the effects of residual compounds on neuronal activity the eo results indicate that both electrodes were efficient in completely removing the studied drugs from up and sw but that 50 removal was achieved for mww for iww total organic carbon up to 71 and total nitrogen up to 82 removals were achieved at 1000 a m 2 up exposure significantly reduced ros production likely due to the presence of transformation by products sw and mww eo treated waters led to slight neurotoxicity decreased neurotoxicity was mainly observed for the iww after eo using both the bdd and ti pt anodes a ros production evaluation following the application of several untreated effluent cycles demonstrated that long term effects may alter cell functionality and that recovery responses decrease over time graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrooxidation contaminants of emerging concern surface water municipal and industrial wastewater rat brain toxicity 1 introduction contaminants of emerging concern cecs are a category of non regulated pollutants that includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pesticides disinfection by products and other substances present at low concentrations typically ranging from ng l 1 to μl 1 1 2 cecs may cause adverse environmental animal and human health effects 3 4 several cecs including those related to mental disorder treatments are released into natural water bodies through direct disposal into rivers or incomplete degradation following conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp 5 according to the world health organization about 300 million people currently suffer from mental disorders worldwide 6 mainly in metropolitan areas where higher incidences of insomnia depression and stress related diseases are reported 7 these diseases often lead to sleep loss lack of will to interact with others loss of concentration and decreased productivity 8 explaining annual increases in medicinal drug consumption and health care costs for the treatment of insomnia and depression 9 benzodiazepines are among the cecs commonly used to treat insomnia and depression 10 11 while carbamazepine cbz is employed to treat seizures 12 after consumption metabolism and excretion urine and feces pharmaceutical compounds are released into sewage in the form of parent and or metabolite compounds until reaching wastewater treatment units 13 however most conventional wastewater treatment technologies were not designed for cec removal indicating the need for the development and implementation of processes capable of treating various types of effluents 14 biological treatments are widely applied to eliminate organic compounds and several polishing treatments such as advanced oxidation processes have been implemented to subsequently degrade recalcitrant compounds not removed by biological processes 15 16 benzodiazepines and carbamazepine display recalcitrant characteristics and are commonly found in surface waters and at wwtp inlet and outlets 17 alprazolam alp and cbz for example have been detected in swedish rivers at 2 2 ng l 1 and 506 9 ng l 1 respectively 18 while alprazolam diazepam dzp and lorazepam lzp have been detected in spanish rivers at 8 1 25 8 and 86 ng l 1 respectively 19 cbz has also been detected at low concentration levels in indian rivers 128 ng l 1 20 a variety of treatment techniques have been reported over the past decades for the removal of organic compounds including cecs such as adsorption 21 ozonation 21 22 advanced oxidation processes including fenton and photo fenton 23 25 photocatalysis 26 29 electrocoagulation 30 carbon nanotube electrochemical filtration 28 29 31 32 electrochemical oxidation 33 36 and advanced membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis 37 38 and nanofiltration 39 electrochemical oxidation eo is an advanced oxidation process aop characterized by the in situ production of hydroxyl radicals oh a non selective oxidant exhibiting high redox potential 14 33 14 33 this powerful oxidant degrades most organic compounds generally leading to complete mineralization co2 and h2o 40 eo exhibits several advantages such as applications at room temperature and pressure leaving relatively small physical footprints being easily adaptable to other types of treatments and allowing for easy process automation 41 43 eo has been proven efficient in reducing cecs to low concentration levels although the toxic effects of residual compounds formed during oxidation is still scarcely studied the literature is vast in proposing degradation mechanisms and identifying residual compounds after applying different types of aops 44 47 mostly in studies employing synthetic water however the challenges considerably increase when investigating real wastewater samples and scale up reproducibility usually fails due to water matrix complexity 48 this is even more critical in terms of toxicity as oxidized by products may be more toxic than parental compounds 49 51 recently neurotoxicity tests have been proposed as an alternative to study the toxicity of treated waters 33 35 52 tests are performed with rat brain samples focusing on the ca3 region of the hippocampus and assessing how effluents can alter reactive oxygen species ros production 33 53 although ros production is essential for cell functioning contact with certain compounds can alter normal ros production leading to oxidative stress 54 55 and cytotoxicity and dna damage followed by death may ensue if normal cell state is not re established following perfusion 56 57 some studies evaluating the neurotoxicity effects of certain organic compounds can be found elsewhere 33 49 58 most studies report eo treatment using synthetic 59 64 or real effluents 16 65 66 to evaluate process efficiency and degradation mechanisms the literature however is still scarce concerning benzodiazepine and carbamazepine degradation by eo 67 69 in addition only a few publications have addressed the neurotoxicity of eo treated water and conducted simultaneous evaluations on target action systems of pharmaceutically active compounds 33 thus to the best of our knowledge this is the first study comparing the neurotoxicity of synthetic water surface water municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater pre treated by eo under different conditions in this study platinum coated titanium ti pt and boron doped diamond bdd electrodes were employed to remove five pharmaceutically active compounds comprising anti anxiety and antiepileptic drugs from different water matrices namely ultrapure water up surface water sw municipal wastewater mw and industrial pharmaceutical wastewater iww neuronal activity effects of the water matrices following eo were assessed by determining neurotoxicity using rat brain hippocampus slices short term and long term ros production is also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and water matrix

at 100 μg l 1 each the applied current density ranged from 25 to 1000 a m 2 pseudo first order kinetics constants were calculated as described elsewhere preliminary results have demonstrated the adequate performance of the nacl electrolyte at 1 5 g l 1 33 35 as this compound is also part of the composition of artificial cerebrospinal fluid acsf surface water sw was collected from mondego

removal the hippocampus samples were rapidly sliced transversally 350 μm followed by transference to an acsf oxygenated solution 95 o2 and 5 co2 at room temperature after a few minutes the slices were incubated for 1 h in an oxygenated acsf solution 95 o2 and 5 co2 containing a ros indicator h2dcfda 20 μm following the incubation period the hippocampal slices were placed back in the oxygenated acsf

oxygenated acsf solution or the eo treated medium were perfused 1 5 2 0 ml min 1 at a controlled temperature of 30 32 c details of the operating system have been previously described 33 35 49 70 all neurotoxicity experiments were performed in triplicate 2 4 analytical determinations the investigated pharmaceutical compounds were quantified employing a high performance liquid chromatograph

and municipal wastewater mww the degradations of the four investigated benzodiazepines and carbamazepine 100 μg phacs l 1 each were evaluated at an applied current density of 25 a m 2 in ultrapure water up surface water sw and municipal wastewater mww using the ti pt fig 2 and bdd fig 3 anodes electrolyte addition was dispensable for the sw and mww matrices due to their high conductivity according to fig 2a all phacs reached values below the lod after 20 min of reaction with up using the ti pt anode indicating that these compounds are easily degraded under the applied conditions in a pure solution with no interferences eo performance and effectiveness was however reduced when sw was exposed to anodic oxidation fig 2b likely due to the presence of other constituents although the studied compounds were completely degraded after 90 min concerning mww fig 2c a maximum 40 degradation for czp lzp and cbz was obtained after 120 min of eo probably associated to a higher organic and inorganic load compared to the sw matrix table 1 this trend was also observed in the pseudo first order kinetic constants for the up sw and mww matrices table 3 compared to up overall pharmaceutical reaction rates were 4 to 6 fold higher than sw and over 30 fold higher compared to mww where dzp reached kinetic rates up to 75 fold higher for up compared to mww fig 3 highlights the effect of the aqueous matrices in drug degradation using the bdd anode overall bdd anode experiments were faster than ti pt anode degradation rates the complete degradation of all studied compounds in up was achieved after 10 min fig 3a cbz presented the highest pseudo first order kinetic constant 0 25 0 02 min 1 and czp and dzp the lowest 0 16 0 02 min 1 sw results were similar to those obtained with the ti pt anode and complete phac degradation was obtained after 90 min fig 3b except for czp 92 removal compared to up most pseudo first order kinetic constants were 6 fold lower except for lzp which presented the highest kinetic rate 0 045 0 002 min 1 and was only 4 9 fold slower than up for mww fig 3c eo removed around 30 50 of all pharmaceutical compounds after 120 min a slightly higher degradation rate compared to the ti pt experiment suggesting that bdd electrodes can be more effective in removing pharmaceutical contaminants under the applied conditions it is important to note that organic compound degradation through indirect ros oxidation is usually more effective than direct contaminant oxidation and that eo effectiveness is strongly dependent on the electrode material the best bdd anode performance compared to the ti pt electrode may be due to its more efficient indirect eo and unique properties such as corrosion stability high oxygen evolution overvoltage inert surface and higher oxidation potential compared to platinum active electrodes 60 62 64 the hydroxyl radicals formed using the bdd anode eq 1 provide rapid compound degradation and may quickly lead to complete organic contaminant mineralization co2 h2o eq 2 63 1 bdd h 2 o bdd oh h e 2 bdd oh m bdd c o 2 h 2 o h e the faster czp lzp and cbz degradations observed herein may be associated with their pka values pka cbz 13 9 pka czp 1 5 pka lzp 1 3 pka azp 2 4 and pka dzp 3 4 and interactions with generated radicals 33 71 the lower degradation of pharmaceutical compounds in sw and mww is likely associated to the presence of a variety of organic inorganic and biological pollutants in the investigated water matrices that may compete with the produced radicals by direct and indirect pathways during eo 72 76 it is important to highlight that higher current densities increase the produced oxidative radicals the efficiency of the eo process and energy consumption a detailed energy consumption analysis for both electrodes has been previously discussed for the electrochemical oxidation of mww 33 3 1 2 industrial wastewater iww eo of the spiked pharmaceutical industry wastewater was tested at different dilution factors iww up table 2 to simulate real wastewater variations 77 78 and different current densities 75 1000 a m 2 using both electrodes fig 4 displays iww toc removals when employing the bdd fig 4a and ti pt fig 4b anodes toc removal was minimal in experiments with raw iww no dilution and 75 a m 2 applied current density below 3 0 for both iww100bdd75 and iww100ti pt75 a slight increase in toc removal was observed for both electrodes when increasing current density to 250 a m 2 compared to 75 a m 2 and a slightly better performance was observed at a 50 50 dilution ratio compared to 70 30 at the same current density 250 a m 2 after 180 min toc removals of 8 5 9 9 and 55 5 were achieved for iww70bdd250 iww50bdd250 and iww30bdd250 respectively and 4 3 and 8 2 for iww70ti pt250 and iww50ti pt250 interestingly higher removals were noted at higher dilutions the although displaying a non linear increase this suggests that the concentration composition of unknown contaminants in the industrial matrix is relevant and that they act as interferences ros scavengers in the eo process a considerable increase in toc removal was observed for both electrodes at the same dilution factor iww up 50 50 when increasing the current density from 250 to 1000 a m 2 similar to sw and mww better removal rates were observed when using bdd electrode and applying higher current densities the best toc removal rates were obtained for iww50bdd1000 71 and iww30ti pt1000 67 3 increasing current densities are directly related to increased toc removal due to higher radical production degrading several effluent compounds 79 81 a higher toc removal was achieved using the bdd anode probably because this electrode is more powerful concerning radical production compared to the ti pt anode displaying high ability to mineralize intermediates formed during eo 82 bdd has been in fact established as the best anode to produce x oh eq 3 associated to high overvoltage for o2 evolution and low oh anode surface adsorption 83 85 116 3 x h 2 o x oh h e cod removal in iww using the bdd and ti pt anodes was also analyzed data not shown lower current density experiments 250 a m 2 presented cod removal 12 after 180 min iww100bdd75 6 2 iww70bdd250 8 5 iww50bdd250 11 6 iww100ti pt75 5 9 iww70ti pt250 7 4 and iww50ti pt250 10 0 and tests performed at 500 a m 2 indicated a cod removal of 22 2 iww50bdd500 and iww50ti pt500 these low cod removals can be related to the high concentration of other contaminants present in the iww and the production of weak oxidizing agents represented by eqs 4 7 86 88 4 x oh x 1 2 o 2 g h e 5 x oh x 1 2 h 2 o 2 6 h 2 o 2 x oh x ho 2 h 2 o 7 3 h 2 o o 3 g 6 h 6 e similar to the obtained toc removal results an applied current density of 1000 a m 2 led to higher cod removal rates iww50bdd1000 75 1 and iww30ti pt1000 71 2 this indicates that organic removal is directly linked to increased current density which produces more radicals capable of degrading recalcitrant substances organic compound removal increases due to increasing current densities have also been reported by florenza et al 89 fajardo et al 70 associated cod removal and raw effluent dilution in iww30ti pt1000 and reported that the pharmaceutical wastewater dilution may decrease the amount of recalcitrant substances thus favoring ros attacks and increasing organic removal efficiency total nitrogen tn removal was also analyzed displayed in fig 5 similar to toc and cod removal rates a low current density 75 a m 2 resulted in low tn degradation for both electrodes iww100bdd75 7 8 iww100ti pt75 3 1 increasing the current density from 75 to 250 a m 2 resulted in increased tn removal when employing the bdd anode fig 5a more significant as the iww up ratio decreased from 70 30 to 30 70 iww70bdd250 28 0 iww50bdd250 36 3 and iww30bddt250 73 2 a similar trend was observed for the ti pt electrode fig 5b at the same current density when reducing the iww up ratio iww70ti pt250 2 0 iww50ti pt250 21 0 which may be due to the reduction of radical scavengers leading to more efficient degradation rates higher tn removal rates were achieved at current densities higher than 500 a m 2 for both the bdd iww50bdd500 77 7 iww50bdd1000 80 1 and ti pt iww50ti pt500 61 2 iww50ti pt1000 78 6 and iww30ti pt1000 81 2 electrodes the greater tn removal observed when increasing the current density is likely associated to the higher production of radicals capable of degrading the studied compounds and suggests the conversion of nitrogen into volatile compounds probably n2 and nxoy species 90 93 table 4 compares the eo results of the studied pollutants reported in the literature and those obtained herein most published eo studies focus on cbz treatment and only a few publications are devoted to the study of the pharmaceutical compounds assessed herein in sum all eo experiments with iww revealed the presence of the original phacs and by product compounds after treatment and neurotoxicity tests were performed 3 2 neuronal activity effects depending on wastewater composition eo may produce chemical by products displaying different toxic effects than parent compounds components like cl and so4 2 for example can interact with anode surfaces and produce oxidants such as hclo and h2s2o8 which promotes contaminant oxidation and may produce potentially toxic chlorinated organic intermediate compounds 50 95 therefore it is paramount to assess the toxicity of a treated effluent before reuse for irrigation purposes or water body disposal 96 the neurotoxicity effects of the pharmaceutical compounds evaluated herein mixture of alp czp dzp lzp and cbz treated by eo using both ti pt and bdd anodes in different water matrices figs 6 8 were evaluated in the form of neuronal ros signals in rat brain slices hippocampus ros signals are stable during acsf perfusion baseline 0 10 min when perfusing up following eo and using the ti pt electrode fig 6a ros signals decreased and reached a steady state level with a depression amplitude of 14 0 86 0 01 compared to baseline from 20 to 40 min once acsf perfusion was resumed the signal was reestablished to 0 11 0 01 above the baseline signal response 55 70 min similar results were observed for up employing the bbd anode fig 7a where a signal amplitude depression of 19 0 81 0 01 was observed followed by a slight increase in the signal response after acsp reperfusion 0 04 0 03 however regarding the untreated effluent data not shown this decrease was almost 4 fold higher indicating that eo promotes transformation product tp formation in this effluent 97 no published studies are available concerning benzodiazepine eo tps electrochemical cbz degradation using the bbd electrode can take place by bond breakage hydroxylation deamination or desulfation and can produce up to 16 transformation products 98 including 10 11 dihydrocarbamazepine 9 methylacridine acridine iminostilbene 50 and 9 10 dihydroacridine 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine and oxcarbamazepine 94 garcía espinoza and mijaylova nacheva 50 observed increased cbz toxicity in vibrio fischeri during up eo bbd after 150 min of reaction the parent compound and its tps remained in the solution confirming the need for long reaction times for complete substance and toxicity elimination increased cbz toxicity after oxidation treatment ozonation has also been observed in zebrafish embryos embryotoxicity 99 100 zebrafish embryos manifested yolk sac edema yse pericardial edemas pe 100 reduced heart rates and swimming hypoactivity when exposed to cbz ozonated byproducts 99 particularly 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine is more toxic than cbz with lc50 0 2 mg kg 1 and 1 1 mg kg 1 respectively to the macroinvertebrate chironomus riparius 101 decreased ros signals are considered as reflecting synaptic metabolic changes of mitochondrial origin due to flavoproteins as neurotransmitter release depends on energy production by mitochondria 102 103 in the absence of the electro oxidized effluent during the last 30 min ros signals increased indicating a mostly reversible condition thus suggesting cell recovery to almost complete normal function the investigated psychotropic compounds affect membrane voltage dependent and receptor channels altering their potassium calcium and zinc ions levels 104 benzodiazepines bind to the gamma aminobutyric acid receptor gaba the main central nervous system inhibitory neurotransmitter altering ionotropic channels and nerve impulse transmission 105 cbz is associated to decreased neurotransmitter concentrations by arresting ca entry into synaptic membranes 106 thus blocking the voltage dependent sodium channels of excitatory neurons 107 reducing central nervous system synaptic activity decreased ros production leads to calcium channel inhibition mediated by zinc release which activates presynaptic katp channels promoting decreased neuronal activity 108 109 the same reversible ros signal behavior upon washout was observed concerning phenolic wastewater eo using a ti ruo2 electrode 49 and ti iro2 70 anodes fig 6b indicates ros variations for sw and the ti pt anode where a slight increase in the signal response was observed from 10 min reaching 0 05 0 01 above the baseline from 25 to 40 min following subsequent exposure to the acsf solution ros production returned to the baseline without significant variations suggesting that sw affected ros production although neurotoxicity effects were not permanent and total signal recovery was observed on the other hand fig 6c indicates a decreasing ros signal during the first 40 min of mww eo ti pt anode the ros signal increased when the effluent solution was replaced by acsf reaching a maximum in relation to the baseline of 0 11 0 03 at 65 70 min thus the signal did not return to baseline during the recording period suggesting an irreversible effect caused by transformation products remaining in the solution 50 or organochlorinated compounds formed via cl reaction through these ions present in the secondary wastewater effluent 110 111 when the bdd anode was employed for eo in sw fig 7b and mww fig 7c neurotoxicity behavior was similar to that observed for sw using the ti pt electrode fig 7b indicates a slightly increased signal amplitude compared to baseline after 40 min acsf perfusion was re established but the signal response remained high reaching a maximum amplitude value of 0 09 0 01 between 60 and 70 min fig 7c demonstrated that the mww treatment promoted an amplitude variation of 0 08 0 03 like sw mww resulted in a slight increase in ros production even though the different water matrices containing phacs differentially affected ros signals the signal was recovered and returned to near the baseline when the acsf medium was reapplied indicating that the exposed cells recovered part of their normal activity albeit still remaining in a different state this may be associated to substances that affect calcium channels which are responsible for calcium cell and organelle entry and are directly linked to ros production 112 fig 8 presents the ros production results for iww fig 8a indicates the results with no eo 50 50 iww up a decrease in ros signals was observed with the highest values in relation to the baseline of 0 23 0 04 noted between 25 and 40 min at 40 min following acsf perfusion the signals were recovered displaying a value of 0 03 0 02 at 60 70 min which is similar to baseline neurotoxicity effects of iww after eo employing the bdd and ti pt electrodes are presented in fig 8b and fig 8c respectively decreased ros production was observed in both cases with values of 0 09 0 01 and 0 08 0 02 25 40 min relative to baseline for the bdd and ti pt electrodes respectively the eo was thus efficient in reduce the medium toxicity with 60 and 65 improvements for the bdd and ti pt electrodes respectively in relation to the untreated effluent yu et al 113 evaluated the inhibition of luminescent bacteria during the treatment of industrial effluent containing antibiotics using a ti sno2 sb anode inhibition rates reached 88 0 93 1 and 100 at contact times of 15 30 and 45 min respectively although no luminescence inhibition was noted at 90 min thus to reduce toxicity and eliminate toxic intermediates prolonged treatment periods are required 50 moreover decreased effects in bioluminescent vibro fisheri bacteria exposed to cardboard plant effluents after eo have also been reported 114 aravind et al 96 observed decreased toxicity in vigna radiata of real effluents from the textile industry following eo ti iro2 ruo2 tio2 anodes untreated effluents strongly inhibited v radiata seed germination while treated textile effluents enabled 100 germination in another study industry petrochemical effluents were subjected to eo using ti ru and bdd anodes and effects on the germination and growth of lactuca sativa were assessed 115 for both electrodes the seed germination factor increased up to 18 compared to the non treated effluent the growth of seeds exposed to the treated effluent reached 1 7 cm similar to seeds cultivated with the reference samples 1 2 and 2 2 cm for tap and drinking water respectively 115 to evaluate the long term effect of effluents on ros production the industrial pharmaceutical wastewater was applied in three cycles fig 9 when the iww came into contact with the hippocampal slices 10 min ros signals decreased 0 29 0 04 between 25 and 40 min recovering following acsf solution exposure to 0 01 0 04 above the baseline from 55 to 70 min the solution with pharmaceutical wastewater was then applied again between 70 and 100 min and the signals decreased to 0 27 0 04 between 85 and 100 min with the return of the ascf solution the signals recovered to 0 02 0 03 below the baseline between 115 and 130 min the third and last stage of the experiments was performed between 130 and 160 min decreased ros production was observed during this interval with mean values of 0 29 0 02 between 145 and 160 min when returning to the acsf perfusion signals recovered to 0 09 0 01 below the baseline from 175 to 190 min overall ros production increased with increasing number of cycles and signal recovery decreased this may be related to the long term contact of some substances which can be harmful to cells and lead to decreased recovery efficiency of vital organism activities it seems that long term exposure may therefore lead to more severe effects which could be discussed in future assessments in the present study the investigated ros signals are considered as directly associated with synaptic activity and of a mitochondrial origin 102 if normal cellular functioning were to be affected oxidative stress may ensue directly reflected in ros production thus the findings reported herein indicate that the applied effluents can interact with cellular processes 4 conclusions four different water matrices namely ultrapure water surface water municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater were spiked with five mental disorder treatment related contaminants commonly found in surface waters and wastewater treatment plants and treated by eo using bdd and ti pt electrodes the eo of the spiked iww was also tested at different dilution factors and current densities using both electrodes eo was able to completely remove all phacs from up after 20 min and sw after 90 min but overall 40 and 50 was removed with ti pt and bdd respectively from mww concerning iww the bdd anode was more efficient in removing toc cod and tn compared to the ti pt electrode reaching removal rates up to 71 toc 80 cod and 82 tn when a high current density was applied 1000 a m 2 likely due to higher radical production overall higher current densities and iww dilution ratios resulted in better toc and tn removal rates suggesting that the unknown contaminants may act as interferences ros scavengers all water matrices both treated and untreated by eo were tested for neurotoxicity the four water matrices resulted in neurotoxicity with ros signal response variations which in most effluents were recovered to initial values upon acsf re perfusion the eo applied to up was able to significantly reduce ros production probably due to the presence of a tp mixture the sw and mww matrices resulted in slight neurotoxicity except when using the ti pt in mww where irreversible hippocampus cell effects were observed decreased neurotoxicity was observed in the iww after eo when employing both the bdd and ti pt anodes compared to the untreated effluent when three continuous untreated iww and acsf cycles were tested ros production signal responses demonstrated that long term exposure may alter cell functionality and that recovery responses can decrease over time the innovative use of rat brains in toxicity studies is interesting and extremely relevant as these animals mature rapidly and exhibit similar biological and functional characteristics to humans the findings reported herein are valuable and demonstrate that different water matrices may result in different neurotoxicity responses even after advanced oxidation treatment and that complex water matrices as mww and iww may more significantly alter ros production and increase neurotoxicity this study was successful in establishing a new reliable and effective toxicity method to investigate the influence of trace levels of mental disorder related pollutants in neuronal ros formation therefore neurotoxicity evaluations may be implemented for treatment process efficiency analysis complementing physico chemical analyses future work should be focused on optimizing the eo operating conditions

12850,benzodiazepines and carbamazepine are mental disorder treatment related contaminants of emerging concern cecs routinely detected in water bodies electrochemical oxidation eo processes have been proven effective in reducing cecs levels although the toxic effects of residual compounds formed after eo are still scarcely studied herein ultrapure water up surface water sw municipal wastewater mww and industrial pharmaceutical wastewater iww were spiked with four benzodiazepines alprazolam clonazepam diazepam lorazepam and carbamazepine 100 μg l 1 each and treated by an eo process employing two electrodes a platinum coated titanium ti pt and a boron doped diamond bdd neurotoxicity tests were performed by exposing rat hippocampus slices to eo treated waters to investigate the effects of residual compounds on neuronal activity the eo results indicate that both electrodes were efficient in completely removing the studied drugs from up and sw but that 50 removal was achieved for mww for iww total organic carbon up to 71 and total nitrogen up to 82 removals were achieved at 1000 a m 2 up exposure significantly reduced ros production likely due to the presence of transformation by products sw and mww eo treated waters led to slight neurotoxicity decreased neurotoxicity was mainly observed for the iww after eo using both the bdd and ti pt anodes a ros production evaluation following the application of several untreated effluent cycles demonstrated that long term effects may alter cell functionality and that recovery responses decrease over time graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrooxidation contaminants of emerging concern surface water municipal and industrial wastewater rat brain toxicity 1 introduction contaminants of emerging concern cecs are a category of non regulated pollutants that includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pesticides disinfection by products and other substances present at low concentrations typically ranging from ng l 1 to μl 1 1 2 cecs may cause adverse environmental animal and human health effects 3 4 several cecs including those related to mental disorder treatments are released into natural water bodies through direct disposal into rivers or incomplete degradation following conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp 5 according to the world health organization about 300 million people currently suffer from mental disorders worldwide 6 mainly in metropolitan areas where higher incidences of insomnia depression and stress related diseases are reported 7 these diseases often lead to sleep loss lack of will to interact with others loss of concentration and decreased productivity 8 explaining annual increases in medicinal drug consumption and health care costs for the treatment of insomnia and depression 9 benzodiazepines are among the cecs commonly used to treat insomnia and depression 10 11 while carbamazepine cbz is employed to treat seizures 12 after consumption metabolism and excretion urine and feces pharmaceutical compounds are released into sewage in the form of parent and or metabolite compounds until reaching wastewater treatment units 13 however most conventional wastewater treatment technologies were not designed for cec removal indicating the need for the development and implementation of processes capable of treating various types of effluents 14 biological treatments are widely applied to eliminate organic compounds and several polishing treatments such as advanced oxidation processes have been implemented to subsequently degrade recalcitrant compounds not removed by biological processes 15 16 benzodiazepines and carbamazepine display recalcitrant characteristics and are commonly found in surface waters and at wwtp inlet and outlets 17 alprazolam alp and cbz for example have been detected in swedish rivers at 2 2 ng l 1 and 506 9 ng l 1 respectively 18 while alprazolam diazepam dzp and lorazepam lzp have been detected in spanish rivers at 8 1 25 8 and 86 ng l 1 respectively 19 cbz has also been detected at low concentration levels in indian rivers 128 ng l 1 20 a variety of treatment techniques have been reported over the past decades for the removal of organic compounds including cecs such as adsorption 21 ozonation 21 22 advanced oxidation processes including fenton and photo fenton 23 25 photocatalysis 26 29 electrocoagulation 30 carbon nanotube electrochemical filtration 28 29 31 32 electrochemical oxidation 33 36 and advanced membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis 37 38 and nanofiltration 39 electrochemical oxidation eo is an advanced oxidation process aop characterized by the in situ production of hydroxyl radicals oh a non selective oxidant exhibiting high redox potential 14 33 14 33 this powerful oxidant degrades most organic compounds generally leading to complete mineralization co2 and h2o 40 eo exhibits several advantages such as applications at room temperature and pressure leaving relatively small physical footprints being easily adaptable to other types of treatments and allowing for easy process automation 41 43 eo has been proven efficient in reducing cecs to low concentration levels although the toxic effects of residual compounds formed during oxidation is still scarcely studied the literature is vast in proposing degradation mechanisms and identifying residual compounds after applying different types of aops 44 47 mostly in studies employing synthetic water however the challenges considerably increase when investigating real wastewater samples and scale up reproducibility usually fails due to water matrix complexity 48 this is even more critical in terms of toxicity as oxidized by products may be more toxic than parental compounds 49 51 recently neurotoxicity tests have been proposed as an alternative to study the toxicity of treated waters 33 35 52 tests are performed with rat brain samples focusing on the ca3 region of the hippocampus and assessing how effluents can alter reactive oxygen species ros production 33 53 although ros production is essential for cell functioning contact with certain compounds can alter normal ros production leading to oxidative stress 54 55 and cytotoxicity and dna damage followed by death may ensue if normal cell state is not re established following perfusion 56 57 some studies evaluating the neurotoxicity effects of certain organic compounds can be found elsewhere 33 49 58 most studies report eo treatment using synthetic 59 64 or real effluents 16 65 66 to evaluate process efficiency and degradation mechanisms the literature however is still scarce concerning benzodiazepine and carbamazepine degradation by eo 67 69 in addition only a few publications have addressed the neurotoxicity of eo treated water and conducted simultaneous evaluations on target action systems of pharmaceutically active compounds 33 thus to the best of our knowledge this is the first study comparing the neurotoxicity of synthetic water surface water municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater pre treated by eo under different conditions in this study platinum coated titanium ti pt and boron doped diamond bdd electrodes were employed to remove five pharmaceutically active compounds comprising anti anxiety and antiepileptic drugs from different water matrices namely ultrapure water up surface water sw municipal wastewater mw and industrial pharmaceutical wastewater iww neuronal activity effects of the water matrices following eo were assessed by determining neurotoxicity using rat brain hippocampus slices short term and long term ros production is also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and water matrix

and municipal wastewater mww the degradations of the four investigated benzodiazepines and carbamazepine 100 μg phacs l 1 each were evaluated at an applied current density of 25 a m 2 in ultrapure water up surface water sw and municipal wastewater mww using the ti pt fig 2 and bdd fig 3 anodes electrolyte addition was dispensable for the sw and mww matrices due to their high conductivity according to fig 2a all phacs reached values below the lod after 20 min of reaction with up using the ti pt anode indicating that these compounds are easily degraded under the applied conditions in a pure solution with no interferences eo performance and effectiveness was however reduced when sw was exposed to anodic oxidation fig 2b likely due to the presence of other constituents although the studied compounds were completely degraded after 90 min concerning mww fig 2c a maximum 40 degradation for czp lzp and cbz was obtained after 120 min of eo probably associated to a higher organic and inorganic load compared to the sw matrix table 1 this trend was also observed in the pseudo first order kinetic constants for the up sw and mww matrices table 3 compared to up overall pharmaceutical reaction rates were 4 to 6 fold higher than sw and over 30 fold higher compared to mww where dzp reached kinetic rates up to 75 fold higher for up compared to mww fig 3 highlights the effect of the aqueous matrices in drug degradation using the bdd anode overall bdd anode experiments were faster than ti pt anode degradation rates the complete degradation of all studied compounds in up was achieved after 10 min fig 3a cbz presented the highest pseudo first order kinetic constant 0 25 0 02 min 1 and czp and dzp the lowest 0 16 0 02 min 1 sw results were similar to those obtained with the ti pt anode and complete phac degradation was obtained after 90 min fig 3b except for czp 92 removal compared to up most pseudo first order kinetic constants were 6 fold lower except for lzp which presented the highest kinetic rate 0 045 0 002 min 1 and was only 4 9 fold slower than up for mww fig 3c eo removed around 30 50 of all pharmaceutical compounds after 120 min a slightly higher degradation rate compared to the ti pt experiment suggesting that bdd electrodes can be more effective in removing pharmaceutical contaminants under the applied conditions it is important to note that organic compound degradation through indirect ros oxidation is usually more effective than direct contaminant oxidation and that eo effectiveness is strongly dependent on the electrode material the best bdd anode performance compared to the ti pt electrode may be due to its more efficient indirect eo and unique properties such as corrosion stability high oxygen evolution overvoltage inert surface and higher oxidation potential compared to platinum active electrodes 60 62 64 the hydroxyl radicals formed using the bdd anode eq 1 provide rapid compound degradation and may quickly lead to complete organic contaminant mineralization co2 h2o eq 2 63 1 bdd h 2 o bdd oh h e 2 bdd oh m bdd c o 2 h 2 o h e the faster czp lzp and cbz degradations observed herein may be associated with their pka values pka cbz 13 9 pka czp 1 5 pka lzp 1 3 pka azp 2 4 and pka dzp 3 4 and interactions with generated radicals 33 71 the lower degradation of pharmaceutical compounds in sw and mww is likely associated to the presence of a variety of organic inorganic and biological pollutants in the investigated water matrices that may compete with the produced radicals by direct and indirect pathways during eo 72 76 it is important to highlight that higher current densities increase the produced oxidative radicals the efficiency of the eo process and energy consumption a detailed energy consumption analysis for both electrodes has been previously discussed for the electrochemical oxidation of mww 33 3 1 2 industrial wastewater iww eo of the spiked pharmaceutical industry wastewater was tested at different dilution factors iww up table 2 to simulate real wastewater variations 77 78 and different current densities 75 1000 a m 2 using both electrodes fig 4 displays iww toc removals when employing the bdd fig 4a and ti pt fig 4b anodes toc removal was minimal in experiments with raw iww no dilution and 75 a m 2 applied current density below 3 0 for both iww100bdd75 and iww100ti pt75 a slight increase in toc removal was observed for both electrodes when increasing current density to 250 a m 2 compared to 75 a m 2 and a slightly better performance was observed at a 50 50 dilution ratio compared to 70 30 at the same current density 250 a m 2 after 180 min toc removals of 8 5 9 9 and 55 5 were achieved for iww70bdd250 iww50bdd250 and iww30bdd250 respectively and 4 3 and 8 2 for iww70ti pt250 and iww50ti pt250 interestingly higher removals were noted at higher dilutions the although displaying a non linear increase this suggests that the concentration composition of unknown contaminants in the industrial matrix is relevant and that they act as interferences ros scavengers in the eo process a considerable increase in toc removal was observed for both electrodes at the same dilution factor iww up 50 50 when increasing the current density from 250 to 1000 a m 2 similar to sw and mww better removal rates were observed when using bdd electrode and applying higher current densities the best toc removal rates were obtained for iww50bdd1000 71 and iww30ti pt1000 67 3 increasing current densities are directly related to increased toc removal due to higher radical production degrading several effluent compounds 79 81 a higher toc removal was achieved using the bdd anode probably because this electrode is more powerful concerning radical production compared to the ti pt anode displaying high ability to mineralize intermediates formed during eo 82 bdd has been in fact established as the best anode to produce x oh eq 3 associated to high overvoltage for o2 evolution and low oh anode surface adsorption 83 85 116 3 x h 2 o x oh h e cod removal in iww using the bdd and ti pt anodes was also analyzed data not shown lower current density experiments 250 a m 2 presented cod removal 12 after 180 min iww100bdd75 6 2 iww70bdd250 8 5 iww50bdd250 11 6 iww100ti pt75 5 9 iww70ti pt250 7 4 and iww50ti pt250 10 0 and tests performed at 500 a m 2 indicated a cod removal of 22 2 iww50bdd500 and iww50ti pt500 these low cod removals can be related to the high concentration of other contaminants present in the iww and the production of weak oxidizing agents represented by eqs 4 7 86 88 4 x oh x 1 2 o 2 g h e 5 x oh x 1 2 h 2 o 2 6 h 2 o 2 x oh x ho 2 h 2 o 7 3 h 2 o o 3 g 6 h 6 e similar to the obtained toc removal results an applied current density of 1000 a m 2 led to higher cod removal rates iww50bdd1000 75 1 and iww30ti pt1000 71 2 this indicates that organic removal is directly linked to increased current density which produces more radicals capable of degrading recalcitrant substances organic compound removal increases due to increasing current densities have also been reported by florenza et al 89 fajardo et al 70 associated cod removal and raw effluent dilution in iww30ti pt1000 and reported that the pharmaceutical wastewater dilution may decrease the amount of recalcitrant substances thus favoring ros attacks and increasing organic removal efficiency total nitrogen tn removal was also analyzed displayed in fig 5 similar to toc and cod removal rates a low current density 75 a m 2 resulted in low tn degradation for both electrodes iww100bdd75 7 8 iww100ti pt75 3 1 increasing the current density from 75 to 250 a m 2 resulted in increased tn removal when employing the bdd anode fig 5a more significant as the iww up ratio decreased from 70 30 to 30 70 iww70bdd250 28 0 iww50bdd250 36 3 and iww30bddt250 73 2 a similar trend was observed for the ti pt electrode fig 5b at the same current density when reducing the iww up ratio iww70ti pt250 2 0 iww50ti pt250 21 0 which may be due to the reduction of radical scavengers leading to more efficient degradation rates higher tn removal rates were achieved at current densities higher than 500 a m 2 for both the bdd iww50bdd500 77 7 iww50bdd1000 80 1 and ti pt iww50ti pt500 61 2 iww50ti pt1000 78 6 and iww30ti pt1000 81 2 electrodes the greater tn removal observed when increasing the current density is likely associated to the higher production of radicals capable of degrading the studied compounds and suggests the conversion of nitrogen into volatile compounds probably n2 and nxoy species 90 93 table 4 compares the eo results of the studied pollutants reported in the literature and those obtained herein most published eo studies focus on cbz treatment and only a few publications are devoted to the study of the pharmaceutical compounds assessed herein in sum all eo experiments with iww revealed the presence of the original phacs and by product compounds after treatment and neurotoxicity tests were performed 3 2 neuronal activity effects depending on wastewater composition eo may produce chemical by products displaying different toxic effects than parent compounds components like cl and so4 2 for example can interact with anode surfaces and produce oxidants such as hclo and h2s2o8 which promotes contaminant oxidation and may produce potentially toxic chlorinated organic intermediate compounds 50 95 therefore it is paramount to assess the toxicity of a treated effluent before reuse for irrigation purposes or water body disposal 96 the neurotoxicity effects of the pharmaceutical compounds evaluated herein mixture of alp czp dzp lzp and cbz treated by eo using both ti pt and bdd anodes in different water matrices figs 6 8 were evaluated in the form of neuronal ros signals in rat brain slices hippocampus ros signals are stable during acsf perfusion baseline 0 10 min when perfusing up following eo and using the ti pt electrode fig 6a ros signals decreased and reached a steady state level with a depression amplitude of 14 0 86 0 01 compared to baseline from 20 to 40 min once acsf perfusion was resumed the signal was reestablished to 0 11 0 01 above the baseline signal response 55 70 min similar results were observed for up employing the bbd anode fig 7a where a signal amplitude depression of 19 0 81 0 01 was observed followed by a slight increase in the signal response after acsp reperfusion 0 04 0 03 however regarding the untreated effluent data not shown this decrease was almost 4 fold higher indicating that eo promotes transformation product tp formation in this effluent 97 no published studies are available concerning benzodiazepine eo tps electrochemical cbz degradation using the bbd electrode can take place by bond breakage hydroxylation deamination or desulfation and can produce up to 16 transformation products 98 including 10 11 dihydrocarbamazepine 9 methylacridine acridine iminostilbene 50 and 9 10 dihydroacridine 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine and oxcarbamazepine 94 garcía espinoza and mijaylova nacheva 50 observed increased cbz toxicity in vibrio fischeri during up eo bbd after 150 min of reaction the parent compound and its tps remained in the solution confirming the need for long reaction times for complete substance and toxicity elimination increased cbz toxicity after oxidation treatment ozonation has also been observed in zebrafish embryos embryotoxicity 99 100 zebrafish embryos manifested yolk sac edema yse pericardial edemas pe 100 reduced heart rates and swimming hypoactivity when exposed to cbz ozonated byproducts 99 particularly 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine is more toxic than cbz with lc50 0 2 mg kg 1 and 1 1 mg kg 1 respectively to the macroinvertebrate chironomus riparius 101 decreased ros signals are considered as reflecting synaptic metabolic changes of mitochondrial origin due to flavoproteins as neurotransmitter release depends on energy production by mitochondria 102 103 in the absence of the electro oxidized effluent during the last 30 min ros signals increased indicating a mostly reversible condition thus suggesting cell recovery to almost complete normal function the investigated psychotropic compounds affect membrane voltage dependent and receptor channels altering their potassium calcium and zinc ions levels 104 benzodiazepines bind to the gamma aminobutyric acid receptor gaba the main central nervous system inhibitory neurotransmitter altering ionotropic channels and nerve impulse transmission 105 cbz is associated to decreased neurotransmitter concentrations by arresting ca entry into synaptic membranes 106 thus blocking the voltage dependent sodium channels of excitatory neurons 107 reducing central nervous system synaptic activity decreased ros production leads to calcium channel inhibition mediated by zinc release which activates presynaptic katp channels promoting decreased neuronal activity 108 109 the same reversible ros signal behavior upon washout was observed concerning phenolic wastewater eo using a ti ruo2 electrode 49 and ti iro2 70 anodes fig 6b indicates ros variations for sw and the ti pt anode where a slight increase in the signal response was observed from 10 min reaching 0 05 0 01 above the baseline from 25 to 40 min following subsequent exposure to the acsf solution ros production returned to the baseline without significant variations suggesting that sw affected ros production although neurotoxicity effects were not permanent and total signal recovery was observed on the other hand fig 6c indicates a decreasing ros signal during the first 40 min of mww eo ti pt anode the ros signal increased when the effluent solution was replaced by acsf reaching a maximum in relation to the baseline of 0 11 0 03 at 65 70 min thus the signal did not return to baseline during the recording period suggesting an irreversible effect caused by transformation products remaining in the solution 50 or organochlorinated compounds formed via cl reaction through these ions present in the secondary wastewater effluent 110 111 when the bdd anode was employed for eo in sw fig 7b and mww fig 7c neurotoxicity behavior was similar to that observed for sw using the ti pt electrode fig 7b indicates a slightly increased signal amplitude compared to baseline after 40 min acsf perfusion was re established but the signal response remained high reaching a maximum amplitude value of 0 09 0 01 between 60 and 70 min fig 7c demonstrated that the mww treatment promoted an amplitude variation of 0 08 0 03 like sw mww resulted in a slight increase in ros production even though the different water matrices containing phacs differentially affected ros signals the signal was recovered and returned to near the baseline when the acsf medium was reapplied indicating that the exposed cells recovered part of their normal activity albeit still remaining in a different state this may be associated to substances that affect calcium channels which are responsible for calcium cell and organelle entry and are directly linked to ros production 112 fig 8 presents the ros production results for iww fig 8a indicates the results with no eo 50 50 iww up a decrease in ros signals was observed with the highest values in relation to the baseline of 0 23 0 04 noted between 25 and 40 min at 40 min following acsf perfusion the signals were recovered displaying a value of 0 03 0 02 at 60 70 min which is similar to baseline neurotoxicity effects of iww after eo employing the bdd and ti pt electrodes are presented in fig 8b and fig 8c respectively decreased ros production was observed in both cases with values of 0 09 0 01 and 0 08 0 02 25 40 min relative to baseline for the bdd and ti pt electrodes respectively the eo was thus efficient in reduce the medium toxicity with 60 and 65 improvements for the bdd and ti pt electrodes respectively in relation to the untreated effluent yu et al 113 evaluated the inhibition of luminescent bacteria during the treatment of industrial effluent containing antibiotics using a ti sno2 sb anode inhibition rates reached 88 0 93 1 and 100 at contact times of 15 30 and 45 min respectively although no luminescence inhibition was noted at 90 min thus to reduce toxicity and eliminate toxic intermediates prolonged treatment periods are required 50 moreover decreased effects in bioluminescent vibro fisheri bacteria exposed to cardboard plant effluents after eo have also been reported 114 aravind et al 96 observed decreased toxicity in vigna radiata of real effluents from the textile industry following eo ti iro2 ruo2 tio2 anodes untreated effluents strongly inhibited v radiata seed germination while treated textile effluents enabled 100 germination in another study industry petrochemical effluents were subjected to eo using ti ru and bdd anodes and effects on the germination and growth of lactuca sativa were assessed 115 for both electrodes the seed germination factor increased up to 18 compared to the non treated effluent the growth of seeds exposed to the treated effluent reached 1 7 cm similar to seeds cultivated with the reference samples 1 2 and 2 2 cm for tap and drinking water respectively 115 to evaluate the long term effect of effluents on ros production the industrial pharmaceutical wastewater was applied in three cycles fig 9 when the iww came into contact with the hippocampal slices 10 min ros signals decreased 0 29 0 04 between 25 and 40 min recovering following acsf solution exposure to 0 01 0 04 above the baseline from 55 to 70 min the solution with pharmaceutical wastewater was then applied again between 70 and 100 min and the signals decreased to 0 27 0 04 between 85 and 100 min with the return of the ascf solution the signals recovered to 0 02 0 03 below the baseline between 115 and 130 min the third and last stage of the experiments was performed between 130 and 160 min decreased ros production was observed during this interval with mean values of 0 29 0 02 between 145 and 160 min when returning to the acsf perfusion signals recovered to 0 09 0 01 below the baseline from 175 to 190 min overall ros production increased with increasing number of cycles and signal recovery decreased this may be related to the long term contact of some substances which can be harmful to cells and lead to decreased recovery efficiency of vital organism activities it seems that long term exposure may therefore lead to more severe effects which could be discussed in future assessments in the present study the investigated ros signals are considered as directly associated with synaptic activity and of a mitochondrial origin 102 if normal cellular functioning were to be affected oxidative stress may ensue directly reflected in ros production thus the findings reported herein indicate that the applied effluents can interact with cellular processes 4 conclusions four different water matrices namely ultrapure water surface water municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater were spiked with five mental disorder treatment related contaminants commonly found in surface waters and wastewater treatment plants and treated by eo using bdd and ti pt electrodes the eo of the spiked iww was also tested at different dilution factors and current densities using both electrodes eo was able to completely remove all phacs from up after 20 min and sw after 90 min but overall 40 and 50 was removed with ti pt and bdd respectively from mww concerning iww the bdd anode was more efficient in removing toc cod and tn compared to the ti pt electrode reaching removal rates up to 71 toc 80 cod and 82 tn when a high current density was applied 1000 a m 2 likely due to higher radical production overall higher current densities and iww dilution ratios resulted in better toc and tn removal rates suggesting that the unknown contaminants may act as interferences ros scavengers all water matrices both treated and untreated by eo were tested for neurotoxicity the four water matrices resulted in neurotoxicity with ros signal response variations which in most effluents were recovered to initial values upon acsf re perfusion the eo applied to up was able to significantly reduce ros production probably due to the presence of a tp mixture the sw and mww matrices resulted in slight neurotoxicity except when using the ti pt in mww where irreversible hippocampus cell effects were observed decreased neurotoxicity was observed in the iww after eo when employing both the bdd and ti pt anodes compared to the untreated effluent when three continuous untreated iww and acsf cycles were tested ros production signal responses demonstrated that long term exposure may alter cell functionality and that recovery responses can decrease over time the innovative use of rat brains in toxicity studies is interesting and extremely relevant as these animals mature rapidly and exhibit similar biological and functional characteristics to humans the findings reported herein are valuable and demonstrate that different water matrices may result in different neurotoxicity responses even after advanced oxidation treatment and that complex water matrices as mww and iww may more significantly alter ros production and increase neurotoxicity this study was successful in establishing a new reliable and effective toxicity method to investigate the influence of trace levels of mental disorder related pollutants in neuronal ros formation therefore neurotoxicity evaluations may be implemented for treatment process efficiency analysis complementing physico chemical analyses future work should be focused on optimizing the eo operating conditions and testing the neurotoxicity of different types of contaminants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

12851,this study aims to investigate the impact of the aerator position on the dissolved oxygen spatial distribution and stability of aerobic granular sludge ags three sbrs with 2 5 mm mesh screen were established under condition of different aerator positions the aerators of r1 r2 and r3 were set at the bottom 1 6 and 1 3 height of reactors respectively the results revealed that r2 was more favorable to improve the sludge settling behavior and structural stability of ags resulting in 83 7 1 4 of total nitrogen tn removal however r3 led to an anoxic environment at the bottom of reactor which prevented the formation of ags and made a large amount of sludge lost do distribution indicated that oxygen content at the bottom of r2 was at the optimum range of 18 9 20 1 being beneficial to realize the simultaneous nitrification denitrification therefore the functional microbes of zoogloea spp 17 4 paracoccus spp 12 5 thaurea spp 13 6 and rhodobacter spp 10 8 were highly enriched in r2 overall raising the aerator position to 1 6 height of reactor led to 7 4 increase of tn removal efficiency and 15 4 decrease of energy consumption which favors the application of ags technology

generation wastewater treatment 1 3 comparison to the traditional activated sludge technology ags technology has obvious technical advantages such as excellent settling ability compact structure small footprint high microbial abundance and the tolerance for fluctuant influent loading 4 5 in addition simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal can be achieved through sludge granulation the dissolved oxygen do distribution difference in ags promotes the formation of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones 6 several investigations have found that granular size is important for the stability of ags because it can lead to limited matrix and dissolved oxygen do transfer by increasing the internal mass transfer resistance inside granules which is the primary cause of ags disintegration 7 8 previous researches have shown that the average granular size can be reduced and the mass transfer characteristics of dissolved oxygen and matrix inside the particles can be improved by increasing hydraulic shear force 7 recently for achieving rapid granulation of aerobic sludge and high pollutants removal efficiency researchers have restricted excessive granular growth by increasing aeration intensity and adding stirring blades 9 10 however these strategies are often accompanied by an increase in the energy consumption of the system therefore previous research in our group have effectively controlled the granular size by adding a funnel type mesh screen under low superficial gas velocity in the sequencing batch reactor sbr which is conducive to enhancing the granule structure stability 11 12 but the nitrogen removal performance needs to be further improved simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd is recognized as one of the most promising alternative for efficient nitrogen

air recycling of ags process causing to decreasing do concentration present many studies also have suggested that efficient nitrogen removal can be achieved by limited the do concentration in the bioreactor 6 17 which could create the necessary condition for snd in addition strubbe et al 18 found that controlling the position of the aeration device can regulate the distribution of dissolved oxygen do in the reactor however long term stable operation of ags is a major limiting issue for the wider application of this novel technology which might collapse under some inappropriate conditions meanwhile there is a lack of relevant information about the operation of nitrogen removal system of ags in sbr with different aerator positions microbial community of ags is critical to the pollutants removal efficiencies in the biological wastewater treatment system therefore based on previous research three groups of sequencing batch reactors sbrs were established with the same funnel type mesh screens and different aerator positions the present study aims to 1 explore the difference in the operating performance of the three reactors with different aerator positions 2 investigate the influence of aerator position on the sludge characteristics and microbial community and 3 reveal the possible enhancement mechanism of ags technology in terms of do distribution the present work intends to provide the support for the development of efficiency stable and energy saving operation for the ags technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation three identical sbrs were established with an internal diameter of 12 cm and a working volume of 5 l in this study a 2 5 mm mesh screen was installed at 70 cm from the bottom in each reactor the configuration was an inverted hollow circular platform with an outer diameter upward of 10 cm an inner diameter downward of 5 cm and an inclination angle of 60 12 the aerators of r1 r2 and r3 were set at the bottom 1 6 and 1 3 height of the reactors respectively the sbr cycle was 4 h with a volume exchange ratio of 50 including feeding 10 min aeration 210 min settling 10 min and discharge 10 min the up flow superficial air velocity was maintained constant 1 0 cm s for the reactors activated sludge from a secondary sedimentation tank in a municipal sewage treatment plant at hangzhou china was used as the seed sludge for sbr the initial concentration of the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and sludge volume index at 30 min svi30 were approximately 4000 mg l and 110 ml g respectively the sbrs were fed with synthetic wastewater with influent chemical oxygen demand cod and tn constant at 1000 and 100 mg l respectively the composition of synthetic wastewater was in table s1 the ambient temperature was kept at 25 2 c in the laboratory and ph was regulated between 7 0 and 7 2 during the operation by adding kh2po4 and k2hpo4 5h2o solutions 2 2 analysis methods 2 2 1 water quality the influent and effluent for cod nh4 n and tn concentration analyses were sampled filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose filters the concentrations were determined by the standard methods apha 2005 2 2 2 analysis of sludge physical properties sludge physical properties included mlss svi30 the granular size microstructure and morphology mlss and svi30 were measured by the standard methods apha 2005 the granular size distribution was analyzed by using dynamic particle image analyzer sympatec qicpic germany according to the international standards k s association 2001 the morphology of sludge was observed by a german leica stereo microscope s8apo leica germany the surface structure of ags was observed by scanning electron microscope sem 19 the specific analysis steps were provided in supplementary data 2 2

calculation formula is as follows s do do actual do saturation 100 2 2 4 aeration power consumption the aeration power consumption was characterized by using water pump shaft power calculation method in the reactor the calculation formula is as follows w qρgh η where w is the shaft power w q is the flow m3 s ρ is the density of sludge water mixture in the reactor kg m3 g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 h is the lift m η is the pump efficiency 2 2 5 analysis of sludge microbial community the genomic dna of the biomass from granule samples was extracted through the power soil dna extraction kit mobio laboratory usa total dna extracted from the samples was used as a template and the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna was amplified with the primer 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3

was performed amplicon pyrosequencing was implemented using a roche genome sequencer gs flx titanium platform personalbio shanghai china 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis of all the variables was determined by the t test using spss spss 17 0 p 0 05 was considered to be statistically different and p 0 01 was considered to be significantly different 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of sludge with different aerator positions to investigate the effect of the aerator position on the physical properties of the ags during operation the changes in the mlss svi30 granular size and granule morphology of the three groups of reactors were measured mlss and svi30 alterations in r1 and r2 were both similar and notably different from those in r3 during the operation fig 1a and b mlss of r1 and r2 increased to 7800 120 mg l on day 30 and remained steady at around 8300 mg l until the end of the operation in contrast mlss of r3 increased to 4820 100 mg l on day 5 and decreased sharply to 980 80 mg l on day 15 which indicated that a substantial amount of sludge was washed out followed by system collapse due to the sludge with poor settlement performance fig 1b the above content revealed that the reactors with the aerator at the bottom and 1 6 height of reactor is conducive to maintaining a high sludge concentration furthermore both r1 and r2 had excellent sludge settling characteristics with the svi30 decreasing from initial value of 131 ml g and stabilizing at 35 ml g the previous research has shown that the svi30 of sludge has good settling characteristics at 20 40 ml g 20 unfortunately the svi30 of r3 decreased to 105 ml g after 7 days of operation and rapidly increased to 240 ml g in the following 8 days due to the sludge bulking which led to large amount of sludge being washed out and system collapsed in conclusion excellent sludge settling and retention properties can be achieved in the reactors with the aerators set at 0 r1 and 1 6 r2 heights of the reactor respectively the results showed that ags formation was positive relationship with the nitrogen removal performance and microbial community 21 the granular sludge from the bottom in r1 and r2 were collected and measured during the sedimentation period average granular size dmean and the aeration period bottom granular size dbottom the trends of granule size variation in r1 and r2 were similar while the granulation rates were significantly different fig 1c on day 10 the dmean of the two groups of reactors exceeded 500 μm and sludge granulation was realized 22 afterwards comparing with r1 the increase rate of granule diameter in r2 was remarkably higher during the stage of granule growth the dbottom of r1 was slightly higher than the dmean and the difference between them was not noticeable however the dbottom of r2 was much higher than the dmean which indicated that more quantities of large granules remained the bottom of r2 meanwhile stereo microscopic examination results fig s2 showed the granular size was uniform and the shape was closer to spherical in r1 and r2 however the granular sludge in r3 was uneven in shape and size and a great number of flocs sludge was observed the sludge disintegrated after 15 days and large amount of sludge was washed out causing collapse of the system comparing the two groups of reactors it was found that putting the aerator at 1 6 height of the reactor will promote the retention of large granules zone at the bottom and speed up the aerobic sludge granulation process considering that the sludge structure had an important effect on the stability of ags the steady state sludge in the r1 and r2 was sampled for sem analysis and the results were shown in fig s3 ags in the two reactors was similar in size and had clear contours ags in r1 has a relatively irregular shape with lots of gullies on the surface of granules the granule structures were loose due to the presence of many filamentous bacteria on the surface in comparison to r1 ags in r2 was smoother with a large number of filamentous bacteria cocci and bacilli covering the surface forming a compact granular structure without apparent gullies it indicated that the ags cultured in the reactor with the aerator set at 1 6 height of the reactor has a denser and more stable structure 3 2 pollutants removal performance the variations in cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies during operation was shown in fig 2 the cod removal efficiency declined significantly to 66 1 0 4 in r3 on day 15 because of the poor sludge settling performance and massive loss of sludge meanwhile the nh4 n and tn removal rates both decreased significantly to 39 1 1 4 and 31 1 1 4 respectively oxygen couldn t reach the bottom of r3 because the aerator was installed too high which leaded the sludge to deteriorate and resulting in low nutrient removal efficiency in comparison due to the compact structure of ags cod removal rates of r1 and r2 stabilized at 96 1 0 4 and 97 2 0 6 respectively it indicated that the changes of do content fig 4 by raising the aerator at the 1 6 height of reactor had no impact on cod removal because naac was used as the carbon source which is easily degraded by heterotrophic microorganisms 23 under the 3 kg cod m3 d of the organic load rate nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies in r2 increased to 98 1 0 4 and 83 7 1 4 after 15 days respectively and remained stable later while they were stable in r1 until 25 days furthermore tn removal rate of r2 83 7 1 4 was significantly higher to that of r1 76 3 0 3 the results indicated that more excellent nitrogen removal performance can be achieved in the reactor with an aerator setting at 1 6 height of the reactor in order to further reveal the nitrogen removal performance of reactors r1 and r2 the concentration changes of nitrogen species nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn during one cycle were analyzed fig 3 the nh4 n of the two reactors was both basically removed within 120 min achieving the efficient nitrification the trends of nh4 n and tn concentrations variation in r1 and r2 were similar while the removal rates of nh4 n and tn concentrations in r2 were significantly higher than those in r1 at the end of a cycle the concentrations of nh4 n and tn in r1 and r2 were 1 8 and 13 3 mg n l 1 5 and 9 1 mg n l respectively these results indicated that raising the aerator at 1 6 height of reactor had no effect on the removal of nh4 n while significantly improved the tn removal efficiency which was in agreement with the experimental results fig 2b and c no2 n concentrations in the two reactors were both basically at a low level 1 0 mg n l during the whole cycle when both nh4 n and no2 n are less present in effluent then nitrogen removal efficiency is determined by the denitrification performance of the reactor 24 in the study no3 n concentrations varied to the varying degrees no3 n concentration in r1 increased from 5 5 mg n l to 12 6 mg n l while that in r2 remained basically unchanged at the end of aeration process in the two reactors no3 n concentration was 10 9 and 7 2 mg n l respectively yan et al founded that do was a key factor in realizing simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd 25 the oxygen content at the bottom of r2 18 9 20 1 much lower than that of r1 37 2 fig 4 it is possible that a lower do content is beneficial to realize the snd which is consistent with previous studies 25 27 3 3 analysis of do distribution and energy consumption 3 3 1 the change of do distribution during the reactor cycle in order to further explore the impact of different aerator positions on the do distribution inside the reactor the do concentration at the bottom middle 50 cm from the bottom and top part of the reactor during the cycle was analyzed and the results were shown in fig 4 during feeding period 0 10 min the do in different areas inside the three reactors was basically the same with the highest do concentration at the top and the lowest at the bottom during the aeration period the variations in do content were comparable in the middle and top of the three reactors but different at the bottom the oxygen content at the bottom of r1 quickly increased to 37 2 and maintained this level throughout the cycle the initial value of the oxygen content at the bottom of r2 was 0 2 and it rose to 18 9 20 1 during the aeration period however the oxygen content at the bottom was 1 during the entire cycle of r3 although the change of do between the top and the middle of the three reactors had no difference it is worth noting that there was a considerable variance in the oxygen content at the bottom some studies have indicated that the most suitable oxygen rate range for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification of granular sludge is 20 25 28 29 too high oxygen content will inhibit the progress of the denitrification whereas too low oxygen content will lead to anaerobic acid production inside the granules causing the granules to disintegrate the oxygen content at the bottom of r1 reached 37 2 during the aeration period which was adverse for the process of denitrification at the bottom of r2 it was 18 20 which met the optimal range and gave better simultaneous nitrification denitrification environment at the bottom of the reactor however due to the excessively high position of the aerator in r3 the bottom zone has been under anaerobic circumstances which couldn t ensure the normal progress of simultaneous nitrification denitrification resulting in ags instability disintegration and system collapse the results are consistent with the previous results 3 3 2 comparison of aeration power consumption in different reactors the specific calculation process of aeration power consumption was provided in supplementary data and the results of the three reactors r1 r2 and r3 were 17 25 w 14 60 w and 11 55 w respectively compared to the conventional reactor r1 the aeration energy consumption of the r2 reduced by 15 4 it indicated that in the case where the density of the mud water mixture of the three reactors is relatively small reducing the position of the aerator in reactor means decreasing the power consumption in comparison to previous studies that adding agitator or increasing aeration intensity in 17 the strategy of increasing the position of the aerator in the reactor can reduce energy consumption while maintaining the same aeration intensity it is of great significance to the industrial application of ags technology 3 4 microbial communities of different granular sludge microorganisms in granules determine the granular physical properties and pollutant removal performance the high throughput sequencing yielded high quality and effective reads from different stages during the operation of two reactors r1 and r2 all with 98 coverage shannon index can describe microbial community diversity with a higher number indicating higher diversity the microbial community diversity value in r1 and r2 at different stages were showed in table s2 it was found that the shannon index increased with the operation of the reactor the shannon index of the inoculated sludge was 4 42 which increased to 5 31 and 4 87 respectively after 20 days of operation in r1 and r2 the shannon index of r2 reached the highest value of 6 95 at 40 d changes in granular size shape and the internal and exterior microenvironment of granules could all contribute to an increase in bacterial population diversity 30 after 60 days of operation it dropped slightly to 6 83 due to the enrichment of functional flora and the elimination of non functional flora while the shannon index of r1 continued to rise to 6 91 indicating more rich flora composition analysis of the microbial community composition of the steady state sludge 60 day in the two reactors fig 5a showed that proteobacteria 40 2 and bacteroidetes 35 4 of inoculated sludge were the dominant and second most dominant phyla respectively which are very common species found in a wide variety of biological sewage treatments 31 the microbial community structure at phylum level changed significantly during the operation the proportion of bacteroidetes in r1 and r2 changed to 17 4 and 5 4 respectively meanwhile proteobacteria was still the dominant bacteria and the proportions rose to 70 2 and 74 5 respectively proteobacteria plays an significant role in ags which could secret eps promote the granulation process and improve the treatment performance of pollutants 32 34 which might be the reason why the proportion of proteobacteria found in the sludge granulation process was much higher than the inoculated sludge besides the percentage of actinobacteria in r1 and r2 declined from the initial 10 2 to 0 6 and 2 7 respectively dong et al 35 has found that actinobacteria plays an dominate role in floc sludge while its abundance will gradually decline during the process of sludge granulation besides the granule size reached 500 μm fig 1c at 10 days the results indicated that ags was gradually formed the microbial abundance of the two reactors were significant different in the genus level fig 5b the relative abundance of zoogloea spp was the highest in r1 and r2 14 8 and 17 4 respectively which can strengthen the intercellular adhesion by secreting eps 36 the abundance of traditional nitrifying bacteria like nitrosomonas spp and nitrospira spp in the two reactors were quite low 1 although nh4 n had an excellent removal efficiency during the stable stage fig 3b c the phenomenon was similar to that reported in previous literatures 37 38 besides heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria paracoccus spp 7 1 and 12 5 maybe also the ammonia oxidation process 38 there were heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying bacteria like zoogloea spp thauera spp 8 2 and 13 6 pseudomonas spp 6 4 and 11 5 and paracoccus spp which was significantly enriched in r2 the presence of these microorganisms is beneficial to achieve the simultaneous nitrification denitrification in aerobic condition there were also traditional denitrifying bacteria such as rhodobacter spp 5 6 and 10 8 and flavobacterium spp 1 8 and 2 2 39 as typical denitrifying bacteria thauera spp is widely present in various sewage biological treatment processes 40 it contains denitrification functional genes nirs nirk and can denitrify with nitrate as an electron acceptor 41 these functional microbes accumulated in the reactor with the aerator setting at 1 6 height of the reactor mainly because of the optimization of do distribution in the reactor by adjusting the aerator to 1 6 height of the reactor the oxygen content at the bottom could be controlled within the optimal range 18 9 20 1 fig 4b which is beneficial to realize simultaneous nitrification denitrification and the facultative anaerobic environment facilitates anoxic microbe i e rhodobacter enrichment above all the enrichment of the functional microbes in r2 improved the granulation and stability of the aerobic sludge fig 1c as well as the nitrogen removal performance of the system fig 3b and c compared with r1 correlation analysis for nitrogen removal efficiency with environmental parameters do physiochemical properties mlss svi and granule size and abundance of dominate genus were shown in fig 6 the nitrogen removal efficiency had positive correlation with the relative abundance of dominate genus zoogloea spp thauera spp paracoccus spp rhodobacter spp and pseudomonas spp suggesting these microorganisms beneficial to the nitrogen removal it also was positively related to mlss and granule size but negatively related to svi and do the difference between various indicators of r1 and r2 was mainly caused by the change of the aerator position which alters the do distribution in the reactor fig 4 for r1 and r2 the oxygen content at the bottom of the aeration period was 37 2 and 20 1 respectively it indicated that r2 could control the oxygen content at the bottom within the optimal range by adjusting the aerator to 1 6 height of the reactor which provides the favorable condition for the snd and the environment was beneficial to enrich the functional bacteria such as thauera spp paracoccus spp and rhodobacter spp which enhanced the tn removal performance at the same time the shearing effect of built in 2 5 mm screen effectively suppressed the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria and optimized the granule size distribution 11 42 thus the main eps secretion microorganisms such as zoogloea spp and pseudomonas spp can grow and enriched quickly forming the stable ags 4 conclusion under the new aeration strategy with an aerator installed at suitable height of the reactor ags could form stable structure and efficient tn removal performance under this condition do distribution in the reactor was optimized which selectively enriched functional microbes of zoogloea spp pseudomonas spp thauera spp paracoccus spp and rhodobacter spp to achieve rapid granulation and structural stability of ags furthermore the aeration energy consumption reduced by 15 4 with suitable aerator position declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

calculation formula is as follows s do do actual do saturation 100 2 2 4 aeration power consumption the aeration power consumption was characterized by using water pump shaft power calculation method in the reactor the calculation formula is as follows w qρgh η where w is the shaft power w q is the flow m3 s ρ is the density of sludge water mixture in the reactor kg m3 g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 h is the lift m η is the pump efficiency 2 2 5 analysis of sludge microbial community the genomic dna of the biomass from granule samples was extracted through the power soil dna extraction kit mobio laboratory usa total dna extracted from the samples was used as a template and the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna was amplified with the primer 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3

was performed amplicon pyrosequencing was implemented using a roche genome sequencer gs flx titanium platform personalbio shanghai china 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis of all the variables was determined by the t test using spss spss 17 0 p 0 05 was considered to be statistically different and p 0 01 was considered to be significantly different 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of sludge with different aerator positions to investigate the effect of the aerator position on the physical properties of the ags during operation the changes in the mlss svi30 granular size and granule morphology of the three groups of reactors were measured mlss and svi30 alterations in r1 and r2 were both similar and notably different from those in r3 during the operation fig 1a and b mlss of r1 and r2 increased to 7800 120 mg l on day 30 and remained steady at around 8300 mg l until the end of the operation in contrast mlss of r3 increased to 4820 100 mg l on day 5 and decreased sharply to 980 80 mg l on day 15 which indicated that a substantial amount of sludge was washed out followed by system collapse due to the sludge with poor settlement performance fig 1b the above content revealed that the reactors with the aerator at the bottom and 1 6 height of reactor is conducive to maintaining a high sludge concentration furthermore both r1 and r2 had excellent sludge settling characteristics with the svi30 decreasing from initial value of 131 ml g and stabilizing at 35 ml g the previous research has shown that the svi30 of sludge has good settling characteristics at 20 40 ml g 20 unfortunately the svi30 of r3 decreased to 105 ml g after 7 days of operation and rapidly increased to 240 ml g in the following 8 days due to the sludge bulking which led to large amount of sludge being washed out and system collapsed in conclusion excellent sludge settling and retention properties can be achieved in the reactors with the aerators set at 0 r1 and 1 6 r2 heights of the reactor respectively the results showed that ags formation was positive relationship with the nitrogen removal performance and microbial community 21 the granular sludge from the bottom in r1 and r2 were collected and measured during the sedimentation period average granular size dmean and the aeration period bottom granular size dbottom the trends of granule size variation in r1 and r2 were similar while the granulation rates were significantly different fig 1c on day 10 the dmean of the two groups of reactors exceeded 500 μm and sludge granulation was realized 22 afterwards comparing with r1 the increase rate of granule diameter in r2 was remarkably higher during the stage of granule growth the dbottom of r1 was slightly higher than the dmean and the difference between them was not noticeable however the dbottom of r2 was much higher than the dmean which indicated that more quantities of large granules remained the bottom of r2 meanwhile stereo microscopic examination results fig s2 showed the granular size was uniform and the shape was closer to spherical in r1 and r2 however the granular sludge in r3 was uneven in shape and size and a great number of flocs sludge was observed the sludge disintegrated after 15 days and large amount of sludge was washed out causing collapse of the system comparing the two groups of reactors it was found that putting the aerator at 1 6 height of the reactor will promote the retention of large granules zone at the bottom and speed up the aerobic sludge granulation process considering that the sludge structure had an important effect on the stability of ags the steady state sludge in the r1 and r2 was sampled for sem analysis and the results were shown in fig s3 ags in the two reactors was similar in size and had clear contours ags in r1 has a relatively irregular shape with lots of gullies on the surface of granules the granule structures were loose due to the presence of many filamentous bacteria on the surface in comparison to r1 ags in r2 was smoother with a large number of filamentous bacteria cocci and bacilli covering the surface forming a compact granular structure without apparent gullies it indicated that the ags cultured in the reactor with the aerator set at 1 6 height of the reactor has a denser and more stable structure 3 2 pollutants removal performance the variations in cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies during operation was shown in fig 2 the cod removal efficiency declined significantly to 66 1 0 4 in r3 on day 15 because of the poor sludge settling performance and massive loss of sludge meanwhile the nh4 n and tn removal rates both decreased significantly to 39 1 1 4 and 31 1 1 4 respectively oxygen couldn t reach the bottom of r3 because the aerator was installed too high which leaded the sludge to deteriorate and resulting in low nutrient removal efficiency in comparison due to the compact structure of ags cod removal rates of r1 and r2 stabilized at 96 1 0 4 and 97 2 0 6 respectively it indicated that the changes of do content fig 4 by raising the aerator at the 1 6 height of reactor had no impact on cod removal because naac was used as the carbon source which is easily degraded by heterotrophic microorganisms 23 under the 3 kg cod m3 d of the organic load rate nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies in r2 increased to 98 1 0 4 and 83 7 1 4 after 15 days respectively and remained stable later while they were stable in r1 until 25 days furthermore tn removal rate of r2 83 7 1 4 was significantly higher to that of r1 76 3 0 3 the results indicated that more excellent nitrogen removal performance can be achieved in the reactor with an aerator setting at 1 6 height of the reactor in order to further reveal the nitrogen removal performance of reactors r1 and r2 the concentration changes of nitrogen species nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn during one cycle were analyzed fig 3 the nh4 n of the two reactors was both basically removed within 120 min achieving the efficient nitrification the trends of nh4 n and tn concentrations variation in r1 and r2 were similar while the removal rates of nh4 n and tn concentrations in r2 were significantly higher than those in r1 at the end of a cycle the concentrations of nh4 n and tn in r1 and r2 were 1 8 and 13 3 mg n l 1 5 and 9 1 mg n l respectively these results indicated that raising the aerator at 1 6 height of reactor had no effect on the removal of nh4 n while significantly improved the tn removal efficiency which was in agreement with the experimental results fig 2b and c no2 n concentrations in the two reactors were both basically at a low level 1 0 mg n l during the whole cycle when both nh4 n and no2 n are less present in effluent then nitrogen removal efficiency is determined by the denitrification performance of the reactor 24 in the study no3 n concentrations varied to the varying degrees no3 n concentration in r1 increased from 5 5 mg n l to 12 6 mg n l while that in r2 remained basically unchanged at the end of aeration process in the two reactors no3 n concentration was 10 9 and 7 2 mg n l respectively yan et al founded that do was a key factor in realizing simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd 25 the oxygen content at the bottom of r2 18 9 20 1 much lower than that of r1 37 2 fig 4 it is possible that a lower do content is beneficial to realize the snd which is consistent with previous studies 25 27 3 3 analysis of do distribution and energy consumption 3 3 1 the change of do distribution during the reactor cycle in order to further explore the impact of different aerator positions on the do distribution inside the reactor the do concentration at the bottom middle 50 cm from the bottom and top part of the reactor during the cycle was analyzed and the results were shown in fig 4 during feeding period 0 10 min the do in different areas inside the three reactors was basically the same with the highest do concentration at the top and the lowest at the bottom during the aeration period the variations in do content were comparable in the middle and top of the three reactors but different at the bottom the oxygen content at the bottom of r1 quickly increased to 37 2 and maintained this level throughout the cycle the initial value of the oxygen content at the bottom of r2 was 0 2 and it rose to 18 9 20 1 during the aeration period however the oxygen content at the bottom was 1 during the entire cycle of r3 although the change of do between the top and the middle of the three reactors had no difference it is worth noting that there was a considerable variance in the oxygen content at the bottom some studies have indicated that the most suitable oxygen rate range for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification of granular sludge is 20 25 28 29 too high oxygen content will inhibit the progress of the denitrification whereas too low oxygen content will lead to anaerobic acid production inside the granules causing the granules to disintegrate the oxygen content at the bottom of r1 reached 37 2 during the aeration period which was adverse for the process of denitrification at the bottom of r2 it was 18 20 which met the optimal range and gave better simultaneous nitrification denitrification environment at the bottom of the reactor however due to the excessively high position of the aerator in r3 the bottom zone has been under anaerobic circumstances which couldn t ensure the normal progress of simultaneous nitrification denitrification resulting in ags instability disintegration and system collapse the results are consistent with the previous results 3 3 2 comparison of aeration power consumption in different reactors the specific calculation process of aeration power consumption was provided in supplementary data and the results of the three reactors r1 r2 and r3 were 17 25 w 14 60 w and 11 55 w respectively compared to the conventional reactor r1 the aeration energy consumption of the r2 reduced by 15 4 it indicated that in the case where the density of the mud water mixture of the three reactors is relatively small reducing the position of the aerator in reactor means decreasing the power consumption in comparison to previous studies that adding agitator or increasing aeration intensity in 17 the strategy of increasing the position of the aerator in the reactor can reduce energy consumption while maintaining the same aeration intensity it is of great significance to the industrial application of ags technology 3 4 microbial communities of different granular sludge microorganisms in granules determine the granular physical properties and pollutant removal performance the high throughput sequencing yielded high quality and effective reads from different stages during the operation of two reactors r1 and r2 all with 98 coverage shannon index can describe microbial community diversity with a higher number indicating higher diversity the microbial community diversity value in r1 and r2 at different stages were showed in table s2 it was found that the shannon index increased with the operation of the reactor the shannon index of the inoculated sludge was 4 42 which increased to 5 31 and 4 87 respectively after 20 days of operation in r1 and r2 the shannon index of r2 reached the highest value of 6 95 at 40 d changes in granular size shape and the internal and exterior microenvironment of granules could all contribute to an increase in bacterial population diversity 30 after 60 days of operation it dropped slightly to 6 83 due to the enrichment of functional flora and the elimination of non functional flora while the shannon index of r1 continued to rise to 6 91 indicating more rich flora composition analysis of the microbial community composition of the steady state sludge 60 day in the two reactors fig 5a showed that proteobacteria 40 2 and bacteroidetes 35 4 of inoculated sludge were the dominant and second most dominant phyla respectively which are very common species found in a wide variety of biological sewage treatments 31 the microbial community structure at phylum level changed significantly during the operation the proportion of bacteroidetes in r1 and r2 changed to 17 4 and 5 4 respectively meanwhile proteobacteria was still the dominant bacteria and the proportions rose to 70 2 and 74 5 respectively proteobacteria plays an significant role in ags which could secret eps promote the granulation process and improve the treatment performance of pollutants 32 34 which might be the reason why the proportion of proteobacteria found in the sludge granulation process was much higher than the inoculated sludge besides the percentage of actinobacteria in r1 and r2 declined from the initial 10 2 to 0 6 and 2 7 respectively dong et al 35 has found that actinobacteria plays an dominate role in floc sludge while its abundance will gradually decline during the process of sludge granulation besides the granule size reached 500 μm fig 1c at 10 days the results indicated that ags was gradually formed the microbial abundance of the two reactors were significant different in the genus level fig 5b the relative abundance of zoogloea spp was the highest in r1 and r2 14 8 and 17 4 respectively which can strengthen the intercellular adhesion by secreting eps 36 the abundance of traditional nitrifying bacteria like nitrosomonas spp and nitrospira spp in the two reactors were quite low 1 although nh4 n had an excellent removal efficiency during the stable stage fig 3b c the phenomenon was similar to that reported in previous literatures 37 38 besides heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria paracoccus spp 7 1 and 12 5 maybe also the ammonia oxidation process 38 there were heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying bacteria like zoogloea spp thauera spp 8 2 and 13 6 pseudomonas spp 6 4 and 11 5 and paracoccus spp which was significantly enriched in r2 the presence of these microorganisms is beneficial to achieve the simultaneous nitrification denitrification in aerobic condition there were also traditional denitrifying bacteria such as rhodobacter spp 5 6 and 10 8 and flavobacterium spp 1 8 and 2 2 39 as typical denitrifying bacteria thauera spp is widely present in various sewage biological treatment processes 40 it contains denitrification functional genes nirs nirk and can denitrify with nitrate as an electron acceptor 41 these functional microbes accumulated in the reactor with the aerator setting at 1 6 height of the reactor mainly because of the optimization of do distribution in the reactor by adjusting the aerator to 1 6 height of the reactor the oxygen content at the bottom could be controlled within the optimal range 18 9 20 1 fig 4b which is beneficial to realize simultaneous nitrification denitrification and the facultative anaerobic environment facilitates anoxic microbe i e rhodobacter enrichment above all the enrichment of the functional microbes in r2 improved the granulation and stability of the aerobic sludge fig 1c as well as the nitrogen removal performance of the system fig 3b and c compared with r1 correlation analysis for nitrogen removal efficiency with environmental parameters do physiochemical properties mlss svi and granule size and abundance of dominate genus were shown in fig 6 the nitrogen removal efficiency had positive correlation with the relative abundance of dominate genus zoogloea spp thauera spp paracoccus spp rhodobacter spp and pseudomonas spp suggesting these microorganisms beneficial to the nitrogen removal it also was positively related to mlss and granule size but negatively related to svi and do the difference between various indicators of r1 and r2 was mainly caused by the change of the aerator position which alters the do distribution in the reactor fig 4 for r1 and r2 the oxygen content at the bottom of the aeration period was 37 2 and 20 1 respectively it indicated that r2 could control the oxygen content at the bottom within the optimal range by adjusting the aerator to 1 6 height of the reactor which provides the favorable condition for the snd and the environment was beneficial to enrich the functional bacteria such as thauera spp paracoccus spp and rhodobacter spp which enhanced the tn removal performance at the same time the shearing effect of built in 2 5 mm screen effectively suppressed the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria and optimized the granule size distribution 11 42 thus the main eps secretion microorganisms such as zoogloea spp and pseudomonas spp can grow and enriched quickly forming the stable ags 4 conclusion under the new aeration strategy with an aerator installed at suitable height of the reactor ags could form stable structure and efficient tn removal performance under this condition do distribution in the reactor was optimized which selectively enriched functional microbes of zoogloea spp pseudomonas spp thauera spp paracoccus spp and rhodobacter spp to achieve rapid granulation and structural stability of ags furthermore the aeration energy consumption reduced by 15 4 with suitable aerator position declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

12852,the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob suppression largely restricts the implementation of partial nitritation and anammox pn a process for low strength ammonium wastewater treatment the main goal of the present study was to verify the feasibility of sequencing moving bed biofilm reactor smbbr treating synthetic low strength ammonium wastewater and the influence of operating conditions and microbial competitions on nob suppression the reactor was operated in sequencing batch reactor sbr mode with influent ammonium of 50 mg l in which the seeded biofilm harvested from an existing similar pn a reactor treating high ammonium synthetic wastewater after increasing the dissolved oxygen do from 0 50 to 1 25 mg l with hydraulic retention time hrt gradually decreasing from 15 to 5 h stable nitrogen removal through pn a was obtained the long term operation results showed nitrogen removal efficiencies of 66 23 7 78 were stably obtained at a relatively low filling ratio of 25 the reactor operated in sbr mode allowed nob suppression and low effluent ammonium due to the ammonium gradient created in cycles further the activity of nob was controlled at a low level at medium do concentration both ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob competition acting as do cut and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox amx competition acting as nitrite sink were found to be essential for nob suppression and do cut played a dominated role a simple hypothetical microstructure of one stage pn a biofilm assuming aob layered in the surface of the biofilm while amx and nob in the interior was proposed to define the mechanism of do cut and nitrite sink the obtained results demonstrated smbbr could be regarded as an alternative guideline for successful operation of mainstream pn a as compared to the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas systems keywords partial nitritation anammox mainstream nitrite sink microbial competitions data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction partial nitritation and anammox process pn a has been developed in recent years as one efficient and economical method to remove ammonium from wastewater without organic carbon consumption 1 in pn a process half of ammonia is oxidized to nitrite by aob then the produced nitrite and residual ammonia are converted to nitrogen gas by amx 2 3 pn a process has been successfully used to treat high ammonium concentration wastewater like reject water and landfill leachate 4 however there are still some challenges in treating low strength ammonium wastewater such as domestic sewage 5 the application of mainstream pn a remains challenging largely due to the amx washout and unstable partial nitritation due to the long generation time of around 15 30 days of amx at mesophilic temperature 6 8 the retention of these microorganisms in the treatment systems is difficult to guarantee at levels required for process functionality 9 10 for excellent biomass retention in mainstream pn a process significant progresses have been made wett et al 11 explored the potentials for amx retention by a cyclone device in suspended growth deammonification process laureni et al 12 confirmed that the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr could be used for amx retention due to its capacity for separate control of hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt chen et al 9 demonstrated that a pn a reactor based on granules had reached stable nitrogen removal efficiencies of 71 8 given these research results it is proved that the use of biofilms or the form of granular bio aggregates would be the effective pathways for amx retention it has great significance for implementation of pn a process in low strength ammonium wastewater treatment since sewage anammox process would not be limited by amx washout the suppression of nob has been another main challenge for successful implementation of the pn a process for sewage treatment 5 to suppress nob over aob for the high nitrogen concentration wastewaters ammonium concentration of 500 mg l a number of strategies have been proposed including applying free ammonium fa free nitrite acid fna inhibition mesophilic temperatures 30 c and low do concentration 13 16 however these operational strategies implemented in side stream applications are not feasible under main stream conditions ammonium concentration in mainstream is too low for nob to be inhibited by fa and fna 17 in addition the temperature in mainstream varied from 10 and 20 c which would not allow selective nob washout based on the minimal differences in growth rates between aob and nob 18 thereafter the low do was regarded as the main selection factor 14 19 however operation with low do inherently limits the growth of aob and thus the nitrogen removal rate 20 moreover despite the generally accepted higher affinity of aob for do 19 nob dominated with nitrospira are known to adapt to low do 21 22 and several studies have reported higher oxygen affinities for nob dominated by nitrospira than aob dominated by nitrosomonas 23 consequently the suitable strategies for nob suppression should be further investigated recent advances included more complex reaction operation in so called hybrid reactor technologies where flocs with high nitritation activity coexist together with biofilm with amx activity this configuration enables efficient nob suppression due to the direct competition for nitrite between nob and amx acting as nitrite sink and aggressive srt 20 24 however when such complex operation was implemented in full scale wwtps the simpler and more economic operation in practical project would be inevitably deprived remarkably the phenomenon of nitrite sink proceeded by amx in biofilm made nitrite concentration decrease in bulk and suppressed the growth of nob in flocs it is hypothesized that the phenomenon of nitrite sink could also exist in solely biofilm systems since the stable nob suppression could be easily achieved in mainstream pn a controlling the residual ammonium has been suggested as a possible strategy for nob repression in activated sludge reactor for sewage treatment 15 25 27 however such operational strategy operated in a continuous mode would not meet increasingly stringent demand of emission thereafter the use of sbr mode for pn a reactor might be preferred due to the substrate gradient created in a cycle in which both nob suppression and low effluent ammonium concentration could be obtained in this study a solely biofilm reactor treated synthetic low strength ammonium 25 0 5 c for a period of more than a year the reactor was operated in sbr mode to create ammonium gradient in cycles ensuring nob suppression and low ammonium concentration in effluent continuous aeration strategy with medium do concentration was implemented to facilitate nob out selection the definite mechanism of nob suppression was assessed experimentally in batch tests in parallel a hypothetical microstructure in one stage pn a biofilm was developed to better understand the spatial distribution of functional bacteria and competition relationship among amx aob and nob the final goal was to obtain feasible effective strategies for nob suppression 2 materials and methods 2 1 smbbr set up and operation fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of a lab scale mbbr operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr to achieve one stage pn a process the working volume of the smbbr was 5 l which was filled at a volumetric ratio of 25 with k3 biofilm carriers surface of 500 m2 m3 mixed by a mixer notably it was discharged without settling to ensure the flocs expelled as much as possible leading the biofilm to be the dominated reaction zone the reactor was operated for 480 days at 25 0 5 c each cycle consisted of three steps feeding 10 min reaction phase i 340 min phase ii and iii 160 min and effluent discharge 10 min table 1 the do was supplied continuously by an air pump during the reaction time and the ph was controlled at a constant of 7 5 0 2 through adding sodium bicarbonate the do and ph in the reactor were regularly measured using an online do probe mettler toledo inpro 6050 switzerland and a ph probe mettler toledo inpro 4010 switzerland the nh4 n in the influent was made of nh4cl together with 0 7 1 2 g l nahco3 0 5 g l

reactor treating high ammonium synthetic wastewater 2 2 maximum activities of amx aob and nob the maximum activities of amx aob and nob are defined as the surface rate mg n m2 day of nitrogen components removal in the optimized condition with non limiting concentration of substrates the activities of amx ramx max were measured regularly in the smbbr by shifting the feed solution which contained 30 mg l nh4 n and 40 mg l no2 n under fully anoxic conditions 0 05 mgo2 l the maximum activities of aob and nob raob max and rnob max were also measured regularly in the reactor by shifting the feed solution which separately contained 20 mg l nh4 n and 20 mg l no2 n under fully aerobic conditions 6 mgo2 l mixing was provided with a mixer and the temperature was maintained at 25 0 5 c the measurement duration was 120 min and samples were collected every 30 min and the surface consumption rates were calculated by linear regression of laboratory measurements 2 3 working activities of amx aob and nob during regular cycle the working activities of the three functional bacteria ramx working raob working and rnob working expressed as mg n m2 day during regular operation determined once 20

can be divided into 3 phases see table 1 the characteristics of the reactor in each phase are detailed as follows fig 2 3 1 1 phase i the phase i days 1 60 was used for the adaption of the smbbr to influent ammonium concentration of 100 mg l compared to the original operation mode the fa concentration decreased from 1 42 0 76 to 0 72 0 45 mg l which was below the reported nob inhibition threshold of 1 mg l 30 in this period the nrr and removal efficiencies were 702 47 107 53 mg m2 day and 51 28 7 85 respectively and the average effluent ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentration were 23 53 10 46 0 54 0 22 and 24 65 5 51 mg l 3 1 2 phase ii to investigate the feasibilities of pn a smbbr treating low strength ammonium wastewater the influent nh4 n concentration was decreased to 50 mg l together with decreasing the hrt from 15 to 7 5 h to maintain the same nitrogen loading rate nlr with the influent ammonium concentration decreased the fa was further decreased to 0 61 0 25 mg l in this period the average nrr and removal efficiencies were 714 92 140 45 mg m2 day and 51 77 9 30 respectively and the corresponding average effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration were 9 69 5 11 0 67 0 31 and 13 83 1 91 mg l 3 1 3 phase iii in phase iii the hrt of smbbr was decreased from 7 5 to 5 0 h with do increase to 0 90 mg l with this change in operation the nrr and removal efficiencies increased to 1169 74 195 20 mg m2 day and 57 02 9 31 and the average effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration were 11 57 3 18 1 10 0 18 and 9 62 1 14 mg l it could be concluded that the nrr was enhanced with the increase of nlr and do building upon the previous reports that operation at medium do was verified to be successful for nob suppression in activated sludge systems 31 33 the do was further increased to 1 25 mg l to enhance nitritation activity operating with medium do the nrr and removal efficiencies reached to 1448 44 275 60 mg m2 day and 66 23 7 78 and the effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration were 5 55 2 83 1 43 0 98 and 10 89 1 72 mg l it was shown that the stable nitrogen removal through pn a process could be maintained in a solely biofilm reactor at medium do to provide a better understanding of nitrogen conversion in smbbr a typical cycle and nitrogen mass balance in phase iii measured in 450th day are presented in fig 3 during the feeding fig 3a the nh4 n concentration increased while the no3 n was progressively diluted the maximum fa concentration after feeding was 0 55 mg l that less than the inhibited threshold of nob 30 indicating that fa inhibition was not available for nob suppression during the reaction of 160 min 19 71 mg nh4 n l was removed and 3 65 mg no3 n l was produced resulting in a nitrogen loss of 16 24 mg n l in the representative cycle no obvious no2 n accumulation was observed the maximum no2 n concentration was 1 60 mg l indicating that the produced nitrite was immediately consumed by nob or amx similar trends have also been observed in hybrid reactor 12 which proved that ammonium oxidation by aob could be the common limiting step in these two systems the nitrogen mass balance of the smbbr reactor is presented in fig 3b as can be seen close to 58 46 of influent ammonium was directly oxidized to nitrite through aob and about 30 86 oxidized to nitrogen gas through anammox process notably nearly 14 88 of produced nitrite was further oxidized to nitrate due to the existence of nob leading the low removal efficiencies in this study table 2 shows the comparison of the reactor performance in this study with other studies reported in literatures about the characteristics using single stage pn a process treating low strength wastewater these results indicated that stable operation with high tn removal efficiencies is still a challenge in this experiment the smbbr was operated at a relatively long hrt because the carriers filling ratio was only 25 v v thus leading a relatively low nlr in the reactor if the filling ratio increased to 40 or higher the smbbr would achieve an even better performance than other reactors 3 2 the activities of amx aob and nob activity is generally used to describe the maximum substrates utilization potential of targeted microorganisms in a community the higher percentage of a targeted microbe in a mixed culture the higher activity will be observed 37 activity changes of amx aob and nob in the biofilm along with operation time are presented in fig 4 the highest ramx max was observed at the initial of phase i 3276 73 mg nh4 n m2 day then showed a decreased trend reduced to 2922 27 mg nh4 n m2 day at the end of phase i fig 4a regarding aob with the increase of the do concentration in operation the raob max increased significantly from 2066 40 mg nh4 n m2 day to 4234 57 mg nh4 n m2 day in addition rnob max increased apparently for 1 21 days and then maintained as a constant of 1822 10 mg no2 n m2 day for phase ii and iii ramx max continued to decrease and at last maintained a constant of 1712 96 115 59 mg nh4 n m2 day as for aob and nob when the reactor could be deemed to have achieved its steady state operation the raob max and rnob max maintained a constant of 2918 14 144 92 mg nh4 n m2 day and 1497 02 169 61 mg no2 n m2 day the working activities of the three functional bacteria were measured during the regular cycle fig 4b during the whole operation of the smbbr the working activities of three bacteria were differently lower than the maximum activities the average ratios of the working activity to the maximum activity fi ri working ri max of amx aob and nob in phase iii were 36 71 2 09 38 60 2 12 and 10 67 2 29 respectively suggesting that three bacteria were all suppressed due to substrate limitations or microbial competitions remarkably the fnob was obviously lower than faob and famx suggesting that nob was deeply suppressed in the biofilm in this respect it is worth noting that nob could not be completely eliminated but its activity can be suppressed at a low level to guarantee a higher nitrogen removal efficiency in smbbr to further investigate the impact of these factors on nob suppression the batch experiments were carried out in the following sections the biofilm formed in the carrier was in brownish red color with rough outlines fig 5 as has been reported by tijhuis et al 38 the calculated penetration depth of oxygen in biofilm is in a range of 100 to 150 μm in this study the average thickness of biofilm was 247 56 56 29 μm this value was clearly higher than that reported the thick biofilm could provide a habitat for amx and aob to multiply in biofilm based on their acceptability to obtain substrates and environment 3 3 microbial community in biofilm fig 6 presented the main functional bacteria at phylum level collected on 380th day the most abundant phylum across the samples analyzed was chloroflexi proteobacteria and planctomycetes chloroflexi has been commonly found in anammox reactors 39 41 and proteobacteria has been recognized to include members capable of nitrification 42 43 in addition all known amx genera so far are only found in phylum planctomycetes 2 44 as for the functional species associated with pn a process ca brocadia was determined to be the dominated amx with a relative abundance of 31 49 which was consistent with the typically dominated genus detected in anammox based systems under mainstream conditions 45 46 regarding aob nitrosomonas were the most dominated microorganism for the biological nitrogen conversion during the whole operation and the relative abundance was 2 34 despite the relative abundance of nitrosomonas significantly lower than that of amx the maximum specific ammonium consumption rate of aob is approximately 7 19 times higher than that of amx 47 therefore sufficient nitrite could be produced and fed to amx in addition nitrospira a common genus of nob with a relative abundance of 0 69 were detected much lower than that of nitrosomonas this result was consistent with the determination of nob activities suggesting that nob dominated by nitrospira could not be eliminated and coexisted with nob and amx in solely biofilm systems a comparison of microbial community with recent research is shown in table 3 the detected dominant species for amx aob and nob were ca brocadia nitrosomonas and nitrospira in this study which was quite similar with others reported from the data of the high throughput sequencing it could be seen that the relative abundance of functional bacteria in pn a process were comparable which suggested that pn a process conducting stable partial nitritation contained analogous community structure notably the ratio of aob nob in this study was 3 39 which was integrally higher to previously reported works it confirmed that nob coexisted with amx and nob but had been well suppressed under such operating conditions 3 4 fish images of biofilm the spatial distribution of amx aob and nob bacteria in biofilm was visualized by fish fig 7a and b based on the fish images of biofilm it could be concluded that amx and aob bacteria were the two most dominant bacteria in biofilm which was homologous to analysis of microbial community the association of amx and aob established a sensible microstructure 1 a majority of the aob bacteria layered in the surface of biofilm due to the need of oxygen 2 amx cells distributed in the interior of biofilm where an anoxic environment could be created similar specific structure have been also recently reported in granular systems 9 in general the closer to the surface of biofilm the higher the do concentration however the amx bacteria in this study located near the surface of biofilm which was similar to the hybrid biofilm system 20 regarding to nob the nitrospira bacteria were detected in the interior of the biofilm with a small minority of the nob colonies which could be associated with their high do affinity but need a further investigation 4 discussion 4 1 ammonium gradient is critical for successful pn a in smbbr ammonium accumulation could be a good strategy for reactor start up since nob repression would be efficiently maintained 15 27 however maintaining residual ammonium to obtain nob repression in continuous reactor for low strength ammonium wastewater treatment evidently worsens the effluent quality in this study an ammonium gradient can be created in the mbbr operated in a sbr mode as shown in fig 3 which would be beneficial to both nob suppression and low effluent ammonium based on the ammonium concentration the whole cycle could be divided into two stages the first stage with high ammonium concentration would allow to nob suppression and the second stage with low ammonium concentration would be favorable to effluent quality table 4 compared the nrr and rnob working at different residual ammonium in phase iii at the same nlr but operating with different residual ammonium the increase of rnob working was negligible as compared to increase of nrr indicating that nob suppression could be maintained even if residual ammonium concentration decreased to 5 55 2 83 mg l as modeled by perez et al 27 at do 1 20 mg l nob suppression would be attained when the bulk ammonium concentration is 8 60 mg l or higher and the corresponding nlr and removal efficiencies were 300 mg n l day and 55 remarkably our reactor operated in sbr mode succeeded stable operation and 66 23 7 78 nitrogen removal with effluent ammonium concentration of 5 55 2 83 mg l which showed integrally superior as compared to analog value as a result the use of sbr mode for pn a reactor could achieve both nob suppression and low effluent ammonium due to the ammonium gradient created in a cycle nevertheless due to the differentials in granule and biofilm system it requires further experimental investigation 4 2 suppression of nob nitrite sink or do limitation compared to the rnob max the rnob working was significantly lower which indicated that nob bacteria in regular cycles were limited to confirm the definite suppression mechanisms on nob batch tests were designed with three substrate conditions table 5 the do concentration and temperature were maintained as constant of 1 25 mg l and 25 0 5 c to simulate the regular operation nitrogen components nh4 n 20 mg l no2 n 20 mg l were simultaneously or separately added into smbbr to meet the demand of different microbial activity tests in addition allylthiourea atu 5 mg l was injected into the reactor for aob inhibition to verify the existence of nitrite sink in biofilm the results of rnob working under three substrate conditions are presented in fig 8 the rnob working without microbial competitions was measured as high as 652 81 mg m2 day scenario 1 however compared to the rnob max the rnob working was still reduced suggesting that do limitation played an important role in nob suppression even at medium do when aob was inactivated scenario 2 the rnob working decreased from 652 81 scenario 1 to 466 62 mg m2 day indicating that amx competition acting as nitrite sink indeed existed in solely biofilm as compared to hybrid biofilm reactors 20 24 when both amx and aox competition existed scenario 3 the rnob working further decreased to 143 23 mg m2 day suggesting that aob competition also played an important role in nob suppression as for aob competition it could be regarded as a reinforcement for do limitation acting as do cut the absolute competitive superiority of nob would be broken when aob competed for do thus leading a further suppression on nob given all that efficient nob suppression could be achieved through nitrite sink and do cut the reduction of rnob working contributed by do cut raob is 342 13 mg n m2 day and that by nitrite sink ramx is 186 19 mg n m2 day thereafter do cut played a dominated role in nob suppression as compared to nitrite sink 4 3 spatial distribution of functional bacteria based on the actual spatial distribution of amx aob and nob detected by fish a two layer microstructure is hypothesized for the pn a biofilm fig 9 aob layered in the surface of the biofilm as an outer rim to provide protection for amx from do inhibition 2 amx and nob in hybrid layered in interior of the biofilm due to their physiological characteristics with this distribution the ammonium in the bulk firstly migrates to aob layer where part of them will be oxidized into nitrite and most of do was consumed leading a do limitation acting as do cut for nob in the interior then the remnant ammonium and produced nitrite would move towards the interior of biofilm where amx and nob attached together due to the absolute competitive advantage of amx to out compete for nitrite with nob the nitrite concentration in interior would be decreased leading a suppression acting as nitrite sink on nob thereafter the suppression of do cut and nitrite sink existed in biofilm would allow for the selective nob suppression to better understand the formation of do cut and nitrite sink in biofilm the possible mechanisms were discussed in our study the dominated aob and nob were nitrosomonas and nitrospira respectively and the reported half oxygen saturation ko of nitrospira was lower than nitrosomonas the average ko of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were 0 36 0 4 mg l and 0 19 0 15 mg l 23 the nob nitrospira with higher do affinity would mostly locate in interior of biofilm leading the majority of do was consumed by aob nitrosomonas layered in surface with a priority and thus the formation of do cut regarding the formation of nitrite sink it was greatly due to the significant gap in relative abundance of amx ca brocadia and nob nitrospira the nitrite concentration in interior of biofilm was decreased with the relatively high raob working thus leading the formation of nitrite sink that could suppress nob in addition when the biofilm achieved its steady state the growth of biomass is equal to the amount of bacteria decay and loss of biofilm detachment the biomass detachment mainly occurred in the surface of biofilm 50 due to aob layered in the surface and nob located in the interior the biomass detachment for nob would be negligible thereafter aob bacteria would be washed away quickly and nob bacteria would accumulate possibly in the interior and was found to be essential for nitrite competition as a result it could be concluded that the nob suppression contributed by biomass detachment was limited in this study but the do cut and nitrite sink played important roles in nob control in solely biofilm reactor with this characteristic of substrate transmission and utilization in biofilm nitrogen removal ratio η in one stage pn a is critically dependent on nitrite utilized by amx and nob if we supposed that the molecular fraction of nitrite used by amx is x the molecular fraction used by nob will be 1 x the stoichiometry of reactions taking place in two layers can be expressed as follows eqs 4 6 aob 4 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 amx 5 x 1 26 nh 4 x no 2 x 1 26 n 2 0 26 x 1 26 no 3 nob 6 1 x no 2 0 5 1 x o 2 1 x no 3 then the total stoichiometry of nitrogen conversion in biofilm can be expressed as eq 7 7 1 26 x 1 26 nh 4 2 0 5 x o 2 x 1 26 n 2 1 26 x 1 26 no 3 therefore η based on eq 7 can be given as eq 8 if influent ammonium is completely converted 8 η 2 x 1 26 x the theoretical maximum η could reach as high as 88 50 if the produced nitrite is completely bio converted through anammox process x 1 in our experiment phase iii the estimated x tended to be 71 81 6 60 suggesting that the produced nitrite was not completely converted to nitrogen gas by amx this result explained the reason for relatively low nitrogen removal efficiencies 66 23 7 78 in this study and nob only could be partly suppressed though microbial competitions nitrite sink and do cut rather than thorough eliminated similarly it pointed out the insufficiencies of nitrite sink and do cut on nob suppression and put forward the direction for future research 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that one stage pn a process could be maintained in the solely biofilm reactor for treating synthetic low strength ammonium wastewater long term operation results showed 66 23 7 78 of nitrogen removal efficiencies were stably obtained under influent ammonium concentration of 50 mg l and medium do concentration of 1 25 mg l the pn a smbbr operated in sbr mode contributed to both nob suppression and low effluent ammonium due to the ammonium gradient created in cycles both aob competition acting as do cut and amx competition acting as nitrite sink were found to be essential for nob suppression especially do cut played a dominated role these results provided an alternative pn a process configuration and demonstrated that microbial competitions could be used for nob repression through actual determinations further studies are needed

12852,the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob suppression largely restricts the implementation of partial nitritation and anammox pn a process for low strength ammonium wastewater treatment the main goal of the present study was to verify the feasibility of sequencing moving bed biofilm reactor smbbr treating synthetic low strength ammonium wastewater and the influence of operating conditions and microbial competitions on nob suppression the reactor was operated in sequencing batch reactor sbr mode with influent ammonium of 50 mg l in which the seeded biofilm harvested from an existing similar pn a reactor treating high ammonium synthetic wastewater after increasing the dissolved oxygen do from 0 50 to 1 25 mg l with hydraulic retention time hrt gradually decreasing from 15 to 5 h stable nitrogen removal through pn a was obtained the long term operation results showed nitrogen removal efficiencies of 66 23 7 78 were stably obtained at a relatively low filling ratio of 25 the reactor operated in sbr mode allowed nob suppression and low effluent ammonium due to the ammonium gradient created in cycles further the activity of nob was controlled at a low level at medium do concentration both ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob competition acting as do cut and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox amx competition acting as nitrite sink were found to be essential for nob suppression and do cut played a dominated role a simple hypothetical microstructure of one stage pn a biofilm assuming aob layered in the surface of the biofilm while amx and nob in the interior was proposed to define the mechanism of do cut and nitrite sink the obtained results demonstrated smbbr could be regarded as an alternative guideline for successful operation of mainstream pn a as compared to the integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas systems keywords partial nitritation anammox mainstream nitrite sink microbial competitions data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction partial nitritation and anammox process pn a has been developed in recent years as one efficient and economical method to remove ammonium from wastewater without organic carbon consumption 1 in pn a process half of ammonia is oxidized to nitrite by aob then the produced nitrite and residual ammonia are converted to nitrogen gas by amx 2 3 pn a process has been successfully used to treat high ammonium concentration wastewater like reject water and landfill leachate 4 however there are still some challenges in treating low strength ammonium wastewater such as domestic sewage 5 the application of mainstream pn a remains challenging largely due to the amx washout and unstable partial nitritation due to the long generation time of around 15 30 days of amx at mesophilic temperature 6 8 the retention of these microorganisms in the treatment systems is difficult to guarantee at levels required for process functionality 9 10 for excellent biomass retention in mainstream pn a process significant progresses have been made wett et al 11 explored the potentials for amx retention by a cyclone device in suspended growth deammonification process laureni et al 12 confirmed that the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr could be used for amx retention due to its capacity for separate control of hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt chen et al 9 demonstrated that a pn a reactor based on granules had reached stable nitrogen removal efficiencies of 71 8 given these research results it is proved that the use of biofilms or the form of granular bio aggregates would be the effective pathways for amx retention it has great significance for implementation of pn a process in low strength ammonium wastewater treatment since sewage anammox process would not be limited by amx washout the suppression of nob has been another main challenge for successful implementation of the pn a process for sewage treatment 5 to suppress nob over aob for the high nitrogen concentration wastewaters ammonium concentration of 500 mg l a number of strategies have been proposed including applying free ammonium fa free nitrite acid fna inhibition mesophilic temperatures 30 c and low do concentration 13 16 however these operational strategies implemented in side stream applications are not feasible under main stream conditions ammonium concentration in mainstream is too low for nob to be inhibited by fa and fna 17 in addition the temperature in mainstream varied from 10 and 20 c which would not allow selective nob washout based on the minimal differences in growth rates between aob and nob 18 thereafter the low do was regarded as the main selection factor 14 19 however operation with low do inherently limits the growth of aob and thus the nitrogen removal rate 20 moreover despite the generally accepted higher affinity of aob for do 19 nob dominated with nitrospira are known to adapt to low do 21 22 and several studies have reported higher oxygen affinities for nob dominated by nitrospira than aob dominated by nitrosomonas 23 consequently the suitable strategies for nob suppression should be further investigated recent advances included more complex reaction operation in so called hybrid reactor technologies where flocs with high nitritation activity coexist together with biofilm with amx activity this configuration enables efficient nob suppression due to the direct competition for nitrite between nob and amx acting as nitrite sink and aggressive srt 20 24 however when such complex operation was implemented in full scale wwtps the simpler and more economic operation in practical project would be inevitably deprived remarkably the phenomenon of nitrite sink proceeded by amx in biofilm made nitrite concentration decrease in bulk and suppressed the growth of nob in flocs it is hypothesized that the phenomenon of nitrite sink could also exist in solely biofilm systems since the stable nob suppression could be easily achieved in mainstream pn a controlling the residual ammonium has been suggested as a possible strategy for nob repression in activated sludge reactor for sewage treatment 15 25 27 however such operational strategy operated in a continuous mode would not meet increasingly stringent demand of emission thereafter the use of sbr mode for pn a reactor might be preferred due to the substrate gradient created in a cycle in which both nob suppression and low effluent ammonium concentration could be obtained in this study a solely biofilm reactor treated synthetic low strength ammonium 25 0 5 c for a period of more than a year the reactor was operated in sbr mode to create ammonium gradient in cycles ensuring nob suppression and low ammonium concentration in effluent continuous aeration strategy with medium do concentration was implemented to facilitate nob out selection the definite mechanism of nob suppression was assessed experimentally in batch tests in parallel a hypothetical microstructure in one stage pn a biofilm was developed to better understand the spatial distribution of functional bacteria and competition relationship among amx aob and nob the final goal was to obtain feasible effective strategies for nob suppression 2 materials and methods 2 1 smbbr set up and operation fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of a lab scale mbbr operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr to achieve one stage pn a process the working volume of the smbbr was 5 l which was filled at a volumetric ratio of 25 with k3 biofilm carriers surface of 500 m2 m3 mixed by a mixer notably it was discharged without settling to ensure the flocs expelled as much as possible leading the biofilm to be the dominated reaction zone the reactor was operated for 480 days at 25 0 5 c each cycle consisted of three steps feeding 10 min reaction phase i 340 min phase ii and iii 160 min and effluent discharge 10 min table 1 the do was supplied continuously by an air pump during the reaction time and the ph was controlled at a constant of 7 5 0 2 through adding sodium bicarbonate the do and ph in the reactor were regularly measured

reactor treating high ammonium synthetic wastewater 2 2 maximum activities of amx aob and nob the maximum activities of amx aob and nob are defined as the surface rate mg n m2 day of nitrogen components removal in the optimized condition with non limiting concentration of substrates the activities of amx ramx max were measured regularly in the smbbr by shifting the feed solution which contained 30 mg l nh4 n and 40 mg l no2 n under fully anoxic conditions 0 05 mgo2 l the maximum activities of aob and nob raob max and rnob max were also measured regularly in the reactor by shifting the feed solution which separately contained 20 mg l nh4 n and 20 mg l no2 n under fully aerobic conditions 6 mgo2 l mixing was provided with a mixer and the temperature was maintained at 25 0 5 c the measurement duration was 120 min and samples were collected every 30 min and the surface consumption rates were calculated by linear regression of laboratory measurements 2 3 working activities of amx

can be divided into 3 phases see table 1 the characteristics of the reactor in each phase are detailed as follows fig 2 3 1 1 phase i the phase i days 1 60 was used for the adaption of the smbbr to influent ammonium concentration of 100 mg l compared to the original operation mode the fa concentration decreased from 1 42 0 76 to 0 72 0 45 mg l which was below the reported nob inhibition threshold of 1 mg l 30 in this period the nrr and removal efficiencies were 702 47 107 53 mg m2 day and 51 28 7 85 respectively and the average effluent ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentration were 23 53 10 46 0 54 0 22 and 24 65 5 51 mg l 3 1 2 phase ii to investigate the feasibilities of pn a smbbr treating low strength ammonium wastewater the influent nh4 n concentration was decreased to 50 mg l together with decreasing the hrt from 15 to 7 5 h to maintain the same nitrogen loading rate nlr with the influent ammonium concentration decreased the fa was further decreased to 0 61 0 25 mg l in this period the average nrr and removal efficiencies were 714 92 140 45 mg m2 day and 51 77 9 30 respectively and the corresponding average effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration were 9 69 5 11 0 67 0 31 and 13 83 1 91 mg l 3 1 3 phase iii in phase iii the hrt of smbbr was decreased from 7 5 to 5 0 h with do increase to 0 90 mg l with this change in operation the nrr and removal efficiencies increased to 1169 74 195 20 mg m2 day and 57 02 9 31 and the average effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration were 11 57 3 18 1 10 0 18 and 9 62 1 14 mg l it could be concluded that the nrr was enhanced with the increase of nlr and do building upon the previous reports that operation at medium do was verified to be successful for nob suppression in activated sludge systems 31 33 the do was further increased to 1 25 mg l to enhance nitritation activity operating with medium do the nrr and removal efficiencies reached to 1448 44 275 60 mg m2 day and 66 23 7 78 and the effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration were 5 55 2 83 1 43 0 98 and 10 89 1 72 mg l it was shown that the stable nitrogen removal through pn a process could be maintained in a solely biofilm reactor at medium do to provide a better understanding of nitrogen conversion in smbbr a typical cycle and nitrogen mass balance in phase iii measured in 450th day are presented in fig 3 during the feeding fig 3a the nh4 n concentration increased while the no3 n was progressively diluted the maximum fa concentration after feeding was 0 55 mg l that less than the inhibited threshold of nob 30 indicating that fa inhibition was not available for nob suppression during the reaction of 160 min 19 71 mg nh4 n l was removed and 3 65 mg no3 n l was produced resulting in a nitrogen loss of 16 24 mg n l in the representative cycle no obvious no2 n accumulation was observed the maximum no2 n concentration was 1 60 mg l indicating that the produced nitrite was immediately consumed by nob or amx similar trends have also been observed in hybrid reactor 12 which proved that ammonium oxidation by aob could be the common limiting step in these two systems the nitrogen mass balance of the smbbr reactor is presented in fig 3b as can be seen close to 58 46 of influent ammonium was directly oxidized to nitrite through aob and about 30 86 oxidized to nitrogen gas through anammox process notably nearly 14 88 of produced nitrite was further oxidized to nitrate due to the existence of nob leading the low removal efficiencies in this study table 2 shows the comparison of the reactor performance in this study with other studies reported in literatures about the characteristics using single stage pn a process treating low strength wastewater these results indicated that stable operation with high tn removal efficiencies is still a challenge in this experiment the smbbr was operated at a relatively long hrt because the carriers filling ratio was only 25 v v thus leading a relatively low nlr in the reactor if the filling ratio increased to 40 or higher the smbbr would achieve an even better performance than other reactors 3 2 the activities of amx aob and nob activity is generally used to describe the maximum substrates utilization potential of targeted microorganisms in a community the higher percentage of a targeted microbe in a mixed culture the higher activity will be observed 37 activity changes of amx aob and nob in the biofilm along with operation time are presented in fig 4 the highest ramx max was observed at the initial of phase i 3276 73 mg nh4 n m2 day then showed a decreased trend reduced to 2922 27 mg nh4 n m2 day at the end of phase i fig 4a regarding aob with the increase of the do concentration in operation the raob max increased significantly from 2066 40 mg nh4 n m2 day to 4234 57 mg nh4 n m2 day in addition rnob max increased apparently for 1 21 days and then maintained as a constant of 1822 10 mg no2 n m2 day for phase ii and iii ramx max continued to decrease and at last maintained a constant of 1712 96 115 59 mg nh4 n m2 day as for aob and nob when the reactor could be deemed to have achieved its steady state operation the raob max and rnob max maintained a constant of 2918 14 144 92 mg nh4 n m2 day and 1497 02 169 61 mg no2 n m2 day the working activities of the three functional bacteria were measured during the regular cycle fig 4b during the whole operation of the smbbr the working activities of three bacteria were differently lower than the maximum activities the average ratios of the working activity to the maximum activity fi ri working ri max of amx aob and nob in phase iii were 36 71 2 09 38 60 2 12 and 10 67 2 29 respectively suggesting that three bacteria were all suppressed due to substrate limitations or microbial competitions remarkably the fnob was obviously lower than faob and famx suggesting that nob was deeply suppressed in the biofilm in this respect it is worth noting that nob could not be completely eliminated but its activity can be suppressed at a low level to guarantee a higher nitrogen removal efficiency in smbbr to further investigate the impact of these factors on nob suppression the batch experiments were carried out in the following sections the biofilm formed in the carrier was in brownish red color with rough outlines fig 5 as has been reported by tijhuis et al 38 the calculated penetration depth of oxygen in biofilm is in a range of 100 to 150 μm in this study the average thickness of biofilm was 247 56 56 29 μm this value was clearly higher than that reported the thick biofilm could provide a habitat for amx and aob to multiply in biofilm based on their acceptability to obtain substrates and environment 3 3 microbial community in biofilm fig 6 presented the main functional bacteria at phylum level collected on 380th day the most abundant phylum across the samples analyzed was chloroflexi proteobacteria and planctomycetes chloroflexi has been commonly found in anammox reactors 39 41 and proteobacteria has been recognized to include members capable of nitrification 42 43 in addition all known amx genera so far are only found in phylum planctomycetes 2 44 as for the functional species associated with pn a process ca brocadia was determined to be the dominated amx with a relative abundance of 31 49 which was consistent with the typically dominated genus detected in anammox based systems under mainstream conditions 45 46 regarding aob nitrosomonas were the most dominated microorganism for the biological nitrogen conversion during the whole operation and the relative abundance was 2 34 despite the relative abundance of nitrosomonas significantly lower than that of amx the maximum specific ammonium consumption rate of aob is approximately 7 19 times higher than that of amx 47 therefore sufficient nitrite could be produced and fed to amx in addition nitrospira a common genus of nob with a relative abundance of 0 69 were detected much lower than that of nitrosomonas this result was consistent with the determination of nob activities suggesting that nob dominated by nitrospira could not be eliminated and coexisted with nob and amx in solely biofilm systems a comparison of microbial community with recent research is shown in table 3 the detected dominant species for amx aob and nob were ca brocadia nitrosomonas and nitrospira in this study which was quite similar with others reported from the data of the high throughput sequencing it could be seen that the relative abundance of functional bacteria in pn a process were comparable which suggested that pn a process conducting stable partial nitritation contained analogous community structure notably the ratio of aob nob in this study was 3 39 which was integrally higher to previously reported works it confirmed that nob coexisted with amx and nob but had been well suppressed under such operating conditions 3 4 fish images of biofilm the spatial distribution of amx aob and nob bacteria in biofilm was visualized by fish fig 7a and b based on the fish images of biofilm it could be concluded that amx and aob bacteria were the two most dominant bacteria in biofilm which was homologous to analysis of microbial community the association of amx and aob established a sensible microstructure 1 a majority of the aob bacteria layered in the surface of biofilm due to the need of oxygen 2 amx cells distributed in the interior of biofilm where an anoxic environment could be created similar specific structure have been also recently reported in granular systems 9 in general the closer to the surface of biofilm the higher the do concentration however the amx bacteria in this study located near the surface of biofilm which was similar to the hybrid biofilm system 20 regarding to nob the nitrospira bacteria were detected in the interior of the biofilm with a small minority of the nob colonies which could be associated with their high do affinity but need a further investigation 4 discussion 4 1 ammonium gradient is critical for successful pn a in smbbr ammonium accumulation could be a good strategy for reactor start up since nob repression would be efficiently maintained 15 27 however maintaining residual ammonium to obtain nob repression in continuous reactor for low strength ammonium wastewater treatment evidently worsens the effluent quality in this study an ammonium gradient can be created in the mbbr operated in a sbr mode as shown in fig 3 which would be beneficial to both nob suppression and low effluent ammonium based on the ammonium concentration the whole cycle could be divided into two stages the first stage with high ammonium concentration would allow to nob suppression and the second stage with low ammonium concentration would be favorable to effluent quality table 4 compared the nrr and rnob working at different residual ammonium in phase iii at the same nlr but operating with different residual ammonium the increase of rnob working was negligible as compared to increase of nrr indicating that nob suppression could be maintained even if residual ammonium concentration decreased to 5 55 2 83 mg l as modeled by perez et al 27 at do 1 20 mg l nob suppression would be attained when the bulk ammonium concentration is 8 60 mg l or higher and the corresponding nlr and removal efficiencies were 300 mg n l day and 55 remarkably our reactor operated in sbr mode succeeded stable operation and 66 23 7 78 nitrogen removal with effluent ammonium concentration of 5 55 2 83 mg l which showed integrally superior as compared to analog value as a result the use of sbr mode for pn a reactor could achieve both nob suppression and low effluent ammonium due to the ammonium gradient created in a cycle nevertheless due to the differentials in granule and biofilm system it requires further experimental investigation 4 2 suppression of nob nitrite sink or do limitation compared to the rnob max the rnob working was significantly lower which indicated that nob bacteria in regular cycles were limited to confirm the definite suppression mechanisms on nob batch tests were designed with three substrate conditions table 5 the do concentration and temperature were maintained as constant of 1 25 mg l and 25 0 5 c to simulate the regular operation nitrogen components nh4 n 20 mg l no2 n 20 mg l were simultaneously or separately added into smbbr to meet the demand of different microbial activity tests in addition allylthiourea atu 5 mg l was injected into the reactor for aob inhibition to verify the existence of nitrite sink in biofilm the results of rnob working under three substrate conditions are presented in fig 8 the rnob working without microbial competitions was measured as high as 652 81 mg m2 day scenario 1 however compared to the rnob max the rnob working was still reduced suggesting that do limitation played an important role in nob suppression even at medium do when aob was inactivated scenario 2 the rnob working decreased from 652 81 scenario 1 to 466 62 mg m2 day indicating that amx competition acting as nitrite sink indeed existed in solely biofilm as compared to hybrid biofilm reactors 20 24 when both amx and aox competition existed scenario 3 the rnob working further decreased to 143 23 mg m2 day suggesting that aob competition also played an important role in nob suppression as for aob competition it could be regarded as a reinforcement for do limitation acting as do cut the absolute competitive superiority of nob would be broken when aob competed for do thus leading a further suppression on nob given all that efficient nob suppression could be achieved through nitrite sink and do cut the reduction of rnob working contributed by do cut raob is 342 13 mg n m2 day and that by nitrite sink ramx is 186 19 mg n m2 day thereafter do cut played a dominated role in nob suppression as compared to nitrite sink 4 3 spatial distribution of functional bacteria based on the actual spatial distribution of amx aob and nob detected by fish a two layer microstructure is hypothesized for the pn a biofilm fig 9 aob layered in the surface of the biofilm as an outer rim to provide protection for amx from do inhibition 2 amx and nob in hybrid layered in interior of the biofilm due to their physiological characteristics with this distribution the ammonium in the bulk firstly migrates to aob layer where part of them will be oxidized into nitrite and most of do was consumed leading a do limitation acting as do cut for nob in the interior then the remnant ammonium and produced nitrite would move towards the interior of biofilm where amx and nob attached together due to the absolute competitive advantage of amx to out compete for nitrite with nob the nitrite concentration in interior would be decreased leading a suppression acting as nitrite sink on nob thereafter the suppression of do cut and nitrite sink existed in biofilm would allow for the selective nob suppression to better understand the formation of do cut and nitrite sink in biofilm the possible mechanisms were discussed in our study the dominated aob and nob were nitrosomonas and nitrospira respectively and the reported half oxygen saturation ko of nitrospira was lower than nitrosomonas the average ko of nitrosomonas and nitrospira were 0 36 0 4 mg l and 0 19 0 15 mg l 23 the nob nitrospira with higher do affinity would mostly locate in interior of biofilm leading the majority of do was consumed by aob nitrosomonas layered in surface with a priority and thus the formation of do cut regarding the formation of nitrite sink it was greatly due to the significant gap in relative abundance of amx ca brocadia and nob nitrospira the nitrite concentration in interior of biofilm was decreased with the relatively high raob working thus leading the formation of nitrite sink that could suppress nob in addition when the biofilm achieved its steady state the growth of biomass is equal to the amount of bacteria decay and loss of biofilm detachment the biomass detachment mainly occurred in the surface of biofilm 50 due to aob layered in the surface and nob located in the interior the biomass detachment for nob would be negligible thereafter aob bacteria would be washed away quickly and nob bacteria would accumulate possibly in the interior and was found to be essential for nitrite competition as a result it could be concluded that the nob suppression contributed by biomass detachment was limited in this study but the do cut and nitrite sink played important roles in nob control in solely biofilm reactor with this characteristic of substrate transmission and utilization in biofilm nitrogen removal ratio η in one stage pn a is critically dependent on nitrite utilized by amx and nob if we supposed that the molecular fraction of nitrite used by amx is x the molecular fraction used by nob will be 1 x the stoichiometry of reactions taking place in two layers can be expressed as follows eqs 4 6 aob 4 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 amx 5 x 1 26 nh 4 x no 2 x 1 26 n 2 0 26 x 1 26 no 3 nob 6 1 x no 2 0 5 1 x o 2 1 x no 3 then the total stoichiometry of nitrogen conversion in biofilm can be expressed as eq 7 7 1 26 x 1 26 nh 4 2 0 5 x o 2 x 1 26 n 2 1 26 x 1 26 no 3 therefore η based on eq 7 can be given as eq 8 if influent ammonium is completely converted 8 η 2 x 1 26 x the theoretical maximum η could reach as high as 88 50 if the produced nitrite is completely bio converted through anammox process x 1 in our experiment phase iii the estimated x tended to be 71 81 6 60 suggesting that the produced nitrite was not completely converted to nitrogen gas by amx this result explained the reason for relatively low nitrogen removal efficiencies 66 23 7 78 in this study and nob only could be partly suppressed though microbial competitions nitrite sink and do cut rather than thorough eliminated similarly it pointed out the insufficiencies of nitrite sink and do cut on nob suppression and put forward the direction for future research 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that one stage pn a process could be maintained in the solely biofilm reactor for treating synthetic low strength ammonium wastewater long term operation results showed 66 23 7 78 of nitrogen removal efficiencies were stably obtained under influent ammonium concentration of 50 mg l and medium do concentration of 1 25 mg l the pn a smbbr operated in sbr mode contributed to both nob suppression and low effluent ammonium due to the ammonium gradient created in cycles both aob competition acting as do cut and amx competition acting as nitrite sink were found to be essential for nob suppression especially do cut played a dominated role these results provided an alternative pn a process configuration and demonstrated that microbial competitions could be used for nob repression through actual determinations further studies are needed

12853,catalytic oxidation of dissolved divalent mn ion mn2 by free chlorine and superfine powdered activated carbon spac before microfiltration has been emerged as a new technology to remove mn from natural water for drinking water production however mn was not sufficiently removed in pilot plant experiments yet the present study clarified underlaying removal mechanisms in natural water soluble mn exists as colloidal mn with a molecular weight 10 000 da in the oxidized form in addition to mn2 mn2 was removed by spac chlorine but ca2 mg2 and nom decreased the mn2 removal rate as a result of competitive adsorption the colloidal mn was not removed by spac chlorine but could be removed by coagulation and microfiltration or ultrafiltration alone with the addition of coagulant poly aluminum chloride the soluble mn concentration increased because of redissolution of precipitated oxidized mn due an increase in local acidity in particular at low temperature and coagulation reduced soluble mn removal rate due to hindrance of mass transfer these negative impacts may be partially attenuated by using high intensity mixing or waiting to add the coagulant after the oxidation of mn2 has progressed sufficiently mn removal rate changed with temperature and mixing intensity in the same trend as predicted by the mass transfer model but it was smaller than the prediction together with the effects of ca2 mg2 and nom it appears that not only mass transfer but also the process of adsorption is a factor affecting the overall mn removal rate graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords manganese oxidation spac mass transfer 1 introduction in the presence of free chlorine for disinfection generally 1 0 mg cl2 l or less redox potential of around 0 7 v dissolved divalent mn mn2 remaining in finished drinking water is gradually oxidized to an insoluble form either mn iii or mn iv oxide redox potential of 0 6 0 8 v hereinafter referred to as mnox s 1 mnox s gradually accumulates on the walls of concrete tanks and distribution pipes which can lead to operational problems like pipe narrowing or black water at the tap 2 even low concentrations of mn that do not cause aesthetic problems may leave stains on laundry 3 because these problems can result in consumer complaints and loss of confidence in the quality of the water mn levels in municipal drinking water are purposefully kept low 4 8 several countries have established acceptable mn levels for treated water canada 0 02 mg l 9 and japan us 0 05 mg l 10 11 however these problems can occur even at mn concentrations as low as 0 02 mg l 12 and 0 01 mg l 3 therefore many water utilities set their own maximum acceptable mn concentrations that are much lower than the national drinking water quality standards for example several water utilities in japan have set maximum mn concentrations of 0 001 mg l 13 15 a widely used approach for removing mn2 from drinking water is adsorption and catalytic oxidation by using an mnox s coated medium in the presence of free chlorine in this process mn2 is adsorbed on the surface of the mnox s coating where it is catalytically oxidized by the free chlorine to mnox s which then forms a new coating for the removal of more mn2 the advantages of this approach are that the filter media used for sand filtration in a conventional water purification system can be used as mnox s coated media 16 19 however using this approach in other systems such as membrane filtration necessitates the use of a contactor for the mnox s coated media recently li et al 20 have reported that powdered activated carbon pac also catalyzes the oxidation of mn2 by free chlorine independent of their work we discovered in a pilot scale membrane filtration plant experiment that superfine powdered activated carbon spac in the presence of free chlorine hereafter spac chlorine was able to remove soluble mn from natural water at a level suitable for practical application of the approach in real world water treatment facilities 21 furthermore we clarified in the batch experiments using mn2 spiked pure water that decreasing the particle size of the pac from a median diameter of tens of micrometers i e conventionally sized pac to a median diameter of 1 μm by micro milling resulted in a substantial increase in the rate of soluble mn removal highlighting the importance of particle size on mn removal rate by activated carbon 21 during mn removal by spac chlorine mn2 is oxidized on the spac surface to form mnox s precipitate 21 the spac particles are then separated from the bulk water by a solid liquid separation process such as membrane filtration taking with it the mnox s unlike the conventional catalytic oxidation method using mnox s coated media this spac chlorine method does not require a media contactor and thus can be applied as a simple pretreatment for membrane filtration to remove mn from drinking water 21 however because activated carbon also has adsorbent activities for soluble compounds 22 24 the mn removal performance of spac chlorine may be affected by the presence of other compounds found in natural water such as soluble organic substances in addition the mn removal performance may also be affected by the coagulation treatment which is often used as a pretreatment before membrane filtration especially when spac is used 25 26 therefore factors influencing the mn removal by the spac chlorine method in real world water treatment conditions must be clarified for ensuring stable removal performance here we conducted pilot scale experiments and batch experiments to examine the factors that affect the performance of the mn removal by spac chlorine based on our findings we provide quantitative data that describe the key factors that influence the mn removal by spac chlorine with or without coagulation treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples two water series were prepared one comprising 6 natural waters and the other comprising 21 artificial waters table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the waters the natural waters were sampled from toyohira river sapporo japan and were determined to contain soluble mn that was able to pass through a microfilter pore size 0 2 μm the experiments using the natural waters were conducted within 12 h of water sampling to ensure that the mn had not oxidized and precipitated a 15 decrease in the concentration of soluble mn concentration was observed at 24 h after sampling data not shown the artificial waters were prepared by adding mn stock solution carbonate buffer sodium bicarbonate nahco3 sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl magnesium chloride mgcl2 calcium chloride cacl2 sodium sulfate na2so4 nitric acid hno3 guaranteed reagents fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation osaka japan and a natural organic matter nom stock solution to ultrapure water milli q advantage a10 merck kgaa darmstadt germany the mn stock solution was prepared by adding mncl2 4h2o guaranteed reagent fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation and sulfuric acid h2so4 to ultrapure water at concentrations of 100 mg mn l and 0 05 mol l respectively the low ph of about 2 in the mn stock solution ensured the mn remained in its dissolved divalent form nom stock solution with a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 200 mg l was prepared by adding suwanee river nom powder 1r101n international humic substances society denver colorado usa to ultrapure water and then passing the water through a membrane filter 0 2 μm pore size hereafter 0 2 μm microfilter dismic 25hp020an toyo roshi kaisha ltd tokyo japan the turbidity of the natural waters was determined by using a ratio turbidimetric determination method 2100q portable turbidimeter hach co loveland colorado usa and the alkalinity of both series of waters was determined by titration against 0 01 m h2so4 the concentrations of ions and soluble mn were measured by using an ion chromatography system ics 1000 and ics 1100 thermo fisher scientific inc waltham massachusetts usa and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry system hp 7700 agilent technologies inc santa clara california usa respectively the concentrations of doc and ultraviolet absorbance at 260 nm uv260 were measured as surrogate parameters for nom concentration by using a toc analyzer model 900 sievers instruments boulder colorado usa and a spectrophotometer uv 1800 with a 5 cm cell shimadzu kyoto japan respectively prior to the doc uv260 ion and mn measurements the water samples were filtered through a 0 2 μm microfilter 2 2 superfine powdered activated carbon we used milling to produce spac from wood based pac taiko w futamura chemical co ltd nagoya japan the pac was added to ultrapure water to produce a slurry which was then milled with a wet type bead mill lmz015 ashizawa finetech chiba japan to obtain a spac slurry after vacuum conditioning to remove air from the pores in the carbon the spac slurry was stored at 4 c the particle size distribution of the spac in the dispersed state was determined by means of a laser diffraction method microtrac mt3300exii microtracbel corp osaka to prepare samples for analysis a dispersant triton x 100 kanto chemical co inc tokyo final concentration 0 08 w v was added to the spac followed by ultrasonication for 1 min us 300e nihonseiki kaisha ltd tokyo the particle size distribution of the spac in the as is state partially aggregated state was determined by the same method but without the dispersion treatment the median diameter of the dispersed and as is spac particle size distribution was 1 2 μm and 2 2 μm respectively fig 1s 2 3 mn removal using a membrane filtration pilot plant pilot plant experiments were conducted at the shiraikawa water purification plant sapporo japan the treatment line of the pilot plant consisted of h2so4 dosing for ph adjustment spac dosing pre chlorination coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration fig 1 the processes up to ceramic membrane filtration were conducted entirely inline the plant was operated at a constant flow rate of 133 l h the hydraulic retention times hrts from spac free chlorine and coagulant dosing to the ceramic membrane module were 7 32 7 30 and 4 40 min respectively poly aluminum chloride pacl north pac basicity 50 hokkaido soda co tomakomai japan was used as the coagulant and naocl was used as the free chlorine source the dosages of spac free chlorine and coagulant were 1 0 mg l 1 0 mg cl2 l and 1 08 mg al l respectively the ph of the water before ceramic membrane filtration was monitored and kept constant at ph 6 8 by automated dosing with h2so4 via a feedback control system this ph was selected for optimum filterability details of the plant and ceramic membrane are described elsewhere 21 table 2 summarizes the experimental conditions during the experiment water samples were collected periodically from each of five sampling ports located 1 before the spac dosing 2 before the pacl dosing 3 after the line mixer after pacl dosing 4 before the ceramic membrane module and 5 after the ceramic membrane module the hrts at these ports from the reaction start free chlorine dosing were 0 00 2 87 3 07 7 26 and 7 30 min respectively the water samples except for the ceramic membrane filtrate sampled from port 5 were immediately filtered through a 0 2 μm microfilter to remove spac and any suspended matter 2 4 batch mn removal experiments batch experiments were conducted in a transparent polyvinyl chloride beaker 1 l capacity equipped with a floating magnetic stirrer nalgene suspended magnetic stir bar thermo fisher scientific inc massachusetts usa table 2 summarizes the experimental conditions prior to the experiments the beaker and stirrer were soaked in 5 v v nitric acid solution to dissolve any metal residual a water sample of 1000 ml was placed in the beaker and mixed at 400 rpm g value of 509 s 1 at 20 c throughout the experiment unless otherwise noted spac was dosed at 1 0 mg l after adjusting the ph of the water to 6 9 7 0 after 5 min unless otherwise noted from the spac dose free chlorine was dosed at 1 0 mg cl2 l unless otherwise noted to initiate the oxidative removal of mn during the experiment which was continued for up to 30 min the solution ph was adjusted to 6 9 7 1 by adding h2so4 hcl or naoh at 0 1 meq l in some experiments pacl was added after the free chlorine dose the ph and water temperature were monitored continuously water samples were withdrawn from the beaker and immediately filtered through a 0 2 μm microfilter in some experiments using natural water the filtrate was filtered again through a regenerated cellulose ultrafilter with a nominal molecular weight cut off mwco of 10 000 da plgc04310 merck kgaa the concentrations of mn and free chlorine in the filtrates were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine colorimetric method dr 900 hach co respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 mn removal performance in the pilot plant and batch experiments first we examined the changes in the concentration of soluble mn over time using natural water 1 and the membrane filtration pilot plant fig 2a before the start of the oxidation reaction i e at the time of free chlorine dosing hrt 0 min the soluble mn concentration in the water was 33 μg l in the presence of free chlorine and spac just before the addition of coagulant hrt 2 87 min the mn concentration had decreased to 14 μg l however soon after the addition of coagulant pacl hrt 3 07 min the mn concentration had increased to 20 μg l this elevation after the addition of coagulant was not observed in the absence of spac in addition the rate of the decrease of the mn concentration was lower after the addition of coagulant hrt 3 07 7 26 min compared with before the addition of coagulant hrt 0 00 2 87 min indicating that the coagulant had decreased the rate of mn removal the mn concentration just before the ceramic membrane filtration stage hrt 7 26 min was 14 μg l however after the filtration stage hrt 7 30 min it had decreased to 9 2 μg l it was believed that high performance separation or some reaction had occurred within the ceramic membrane pore size 0 1 μm module to decrease the mn concentration e g adsorption and or catalytic oxidation possibly by the mnox s accumulated on the membrane during long term filtration operation in the pilot plant experiments the soluble mn concentration was decreased by approximately 30 with free chlorine alone even in the absence of spac however based on the results of other groups who have reported that the mn2 oxidation rate by free chlorine in the absence of catalyst is very low 27 28 it is estimated that the mn concentration does not decrease that much with free chlorine alone after a contact time of a few minutes in our batch experiment using the same source water as in the pilot plant experiment soluble mn concentration did not decrease with the addition of free chlorine alone fig 2s this indicates that in the pilot plant experiments catalytic oxidation possibly by mnox s that had accumulated on the inner walls of the pipes in the pilot plant had occurred we next compared the changes of soluble mn concentration in the presence of spac in the pilot plant and batch experiments using the same type of water natural water 1 fig 2b the mn concentration in the pilot plant experiment just before the ceramic membrane filtration stage hrt 7 26 min was 14 μg l which was about 5 times higher than the concentration 2 6 μg l at a similar reaction time of 7 5 min in the batch experiment focusing on the mn concentration before the addition of coagulant hrt and reaction time of approx 3 min the concentrations in the pilot plant and batch experiments with spac chlorine were comparable fig 2b however it is hard to conclude that the batch experiment reproduced the findings of the pilot plant experiment because even in the absence of spac soluble mn was removed to some extent in the pilot plant experiment fig 2a but not in the batch experiment fig 2s li et al 20 and saito et al 21 have reported that changes of mn concentration with time by activated carbon chlorine follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics 1 ln c mn c 0 mn kt where k is the rate coefficient of the pseudo first order reaction s 1 c mn is the bulk phase mn concentration μg l and c 0 mn is the initial concentration of mn μg l using eq 1 we calculated the rate coefficients from the changes in mn concentration in the pilot plant runs p1 and p2 a tubular plug flow reactor is assumed and batch experiments run b1 fig 3s in the pilot plant experiment the rate coefficient was 0 0046 s 1 in the presence of spac and 0 0020 s 1 in the absence of spac thus assuming that the mn removal rate is additive the rate coefficient of mn removal due to spac was 0 0026 s 1 in contrast in the batch experiment the rate coefficient in the presence of spac was 0 0054 s 1 and presumably almost zero in the absence of spac fig 2s comparing these coefficients the mn removal rate was substantially lower in the pilot plant experiment than in the batch experiment even for the same raw water further indicating that there are conditions other than coagulation treatment that affect the mn removal performance by spac chlorine including water temperature 3 0 4 0 c for the pilot plant experiment 19 20 c for the batch experiments mixing intensity in line mixing for the pilot plant experiment and stirrer mixing for the batch experiments and interval between spac dosing and free chlorine dosing 0 02 min for the pilot plant experiment and 5 min for the batch experiments in the batch experiment run b1 fig 2b the soluble mn concentration was observed up to a reaction time of 30 min at 15 min the decrease of mn concentration began to plateau and finally reached 0 2 μg l this result is not consistent with the findings from a previous study using artificial water supplemented with mn2 in which the mn concentration decreased exponentially with time and was reduced to 0 1 μg l 21 however in the present study we were able to observe an exponential decrease of mn concentration to 0 1 μg l when an mn2 spiked artificial water was tested in a batch experiment run b8 fig 2b together these findings indicate that a very small portion of the soluble mn in natural water that can pass through a 0 2 μm microfilter cannot be removed by spac chlorine treatment in addition in the batch experiments the rate of decrease of mn concentration for the natural water was slower than that for the artificial water i e the half life of mn concentration in the natural and artificial waters were 1 9 min and 1 2 min respectively the implication is that co existing compounds in the natural water retarded the removal of mn thus to summarize the findings to this point we found that many factors affected removal of mn from water by spac chlorine treatment in the remainder of the study we examined the effects of the following factors 1 presence of soluble mn that is not removed by catalytic oxidation 2 effects of co existing compounds on mn removal rate 3 effects of water temperature mixing intensity and timing of free chlorine dosing 4 effects of coagulant treatment we did not investigate the effect of ph in the present study since it had already been known that the effect is small in the practical range of ph 6 8 7 8 changes in the rate coefficients of the pseudo first order reaction in ph of 6 8 7 1 7 5 and 7 8 were 8 3 21 in the present study the ph during the reaction was in the range of 6 9 7 1 in the batch experiment and slightly higher than 6 8 in the pilot plant experiment but such a small difference of ph should have no effect on mn removal rate 3 2 presence of soluble mn that is not removed by catalytic oxidation in the previous section we hypothesized that the presence of soluble mn in natural water that cannot be removed by spac chlorine carlson et al 29 have reported that mn in natural water is present in three physicochemical forms particulate colloidal and dissolved mn particulate mn is easily removed by using a microfilter a pore size of 0 2 μm or 0 45 μm is generally used but the two remaining forms colloidal and dissolved mn are not the importance of distinguishing colloidal mn and dissolved mn reduced form mn2 for appropriate evaluation of mn removal has been discussed elsewhere 29 32 thus it is possible that the soluble mn that could not be removed in the batch experiment using natural water was colloidal mn possible in the form of mno2 31 hereafter referred to as mnox s colloids and or ha humic acid mn iii colloids 32 33 if the mechanism of soluble mn removal by activated carbon and free chlorine is oxidation and precipitation of mn2 on the surface of the activated carbon fig 4s 21 the colloidal mn which is already oxidized or bound to ha could not be a target of the removal process carlson et al 29 point to the presence of mn in colloidal form with mw 3000 30 000 da based on the experimental results that mn concentrations in 3000 10 000 and 30 000 mwco ultrafiltrates were comparable but that in 100 000 mwco filtrate was higher we used a ultrafilter with a mwco 10 000 da which is the middle value between mw 3000 and 30 000 and a 0 2 μm microfilter and determined the colloidal mn concentration by defining it as the difference between the mn concentrations in the two filtrates fig 3 the mn concentration in the 0 2 μm microfiltrate decreased with time but the decrease plateaued from a reaction time of 20 min 0 3 μg l of mn remained at a reaction time of 30 min in contrast the mn concentration in the 10 000 mwco ultrafiltrate decreased to below the limit of quantification 0 1 μg l and the decrease was linear in addition the colloidal mn concentration i e the difference between the mn concentrations in the two filtrates did not change with time remaining at 0 3 μg l even after 5 or 10 min of reaction time the value at 12 5 min of reaction could not be accurately determined because the mn concentration in the ultrafiltrate was below the limit of quantification but it was estimated to be in the range of 0 3 0 4 μg l which accounted for 75 100 of the mn concentration in the microfiltrate moreover the colloidal mn concentration was almost the same as the final residual soluble mn concentration observed in the microfiltrate at a reaction time of 30 min the final residual soluble mn concentration was the same regardless of free chlorine dosage fig 5s thus these results indicate that the unremovable soluble mn was colloidal mn in other words the colloidal mn in natural water is removable neither by the adsorption onto spac nor the catalytic oxidation by free chlorine on the spac surface this suggest that the colloidal mn would be the mnox s colloids rather than ha mn iii colloids because ha is adsorbable on activated carbon under real world water treatment conditions using spac a coagulant is almost always used before membrane filtration therefore the fate of mnox s colloids in this coagulation process was clarified fig 6s when pacl was added as the coagulant after the soluble mn concentration had plateaued at around 0 3 μg l the soluble mn concentration quickly decreased to below the limit of quantification 0 1 μg l this indicates that even though the mnox s colloids which is an oxidized form and therefore cannot be removed by spac chlorine treatment followed by microfiltration alone can be removed by spac chlorine treatment followed by coagulation and microfiltration this is in accordance with the previous finding that the mnox s colloids created by strong oxidants permanganate chlorine dioxide and ozone is destabilized and removed by coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration 8 though the removal mn concentration levels targeted in the studies are very different furthermore this suggests that the presence of the colloidal mn cannot be ignored in mn removal although the colloidal mn concentration in the water we sampled was as low as 0 3 μg l it should be also noted that colloidal mn can be removed without coagulation pretreatment by using ultrafiltration instead of microfiltration 3 3 effect of co existing compounds in natural water the decrease of soluble mn concentration in natural water was slower than that in artificial water fig 2b to examine this phenomenon in more detail we obtained the pseudo first order reaction rate coefficients for the batch experiments by fitting the change of the dissolved mn2 concentration which was obtained by subtracting the concentration of the unremovable soluble mn i e colloidal mn see section 3 2 from the mn concentration in the microfiltrate 0 2 μm pore size to eq 1 section 3 1 the rate coefficient was 0 0061 s 1 for natural water 1 which was substantially lower than the value of 0 0098 s 1 for artificial water 1 fig 7s the fact that the experimental conditions were the same except for the raw waters indicates that co existing compounds in natural water 1 decreased the rate coefficient to clarify the types of co existing compounds that caused the decrease in the rate coefficient we conducted batch experiments using three different raw waters environmental water natural water 6 pure water adjusted so that the ion concentrations were the same as those in natural water 6 artificial water 2 and pure water supplemented with carbonate buffer alone artificial water 1 because the rate coefficient depends on free chlorine concentration especially in the low concentration region 21 the experiments were conducted at several free chlorine dosages changes in dissolved mn2 concentration were well fitted to eq 1 fig 8s and the results were summarized by plotting the rate coefficient against the free chlorine dosage fig 4 the rate coefficient decreased in the order of artificial water 1 artificial water 2 natural water 6 because the rate coefficient for artificial water 1 was greater than that of artificial water 2 these results confirmed that co existing ions made a marked contribution to the decrease of the rate coefficient in the natural water next we examined which ions were responsible for the decrease in the rate coefficient by using 13 different waters artificial waters 3 15 prepared by adding different cations and anions to carbonate buffered 0 2 mmol l nahco3 pure water fig 5a and b overall the cations induced a larger decrease in the rate coefficient compared with the anions the greatest decrease was observed in the presence of ca2 followed by mg2 whereas no decreases were observed in the presence of k or na we also examined the effect of carbonate buffer nahco3 on the mn removal rate fig 10s the rate coefficients were comparable at nahco3 concentrations of 0 2 mmol l and 1 2 mmol l confirming that the carbonate buffer had no effect on the removal rate both natural water 6 and artificial water 2 contained ca2 and mg2 but the concentration of ca2 0 26 mmol l was higher than that of mg2 0 09 mmol l taking these findings together we concluded that the observed decrease in the rate coefficient was the result mainly of the presence of ca2 when the carbonate buffered pure water artificial water 1 was supplemented with ca2 to make artificial water 10 ca2 at 0 25 mmol l the rate coefficient of the water was similar to that of artificial water 2 ca2 at 0 26 mmol l mg2 at 0 09 mmol l na 0 60 mmol l and k 0 05 mmol l thus ca2 was considered the co existing ion with the greatest impact on mn removal rate assuming that the process of catalytic oxidation of mn begins with adsorption of mn2 on the surface of a catalyst via ion exchange mechanism 20 21 34 36 it is reasonable to suggest that ca2 competes with mn2 for adsorption on activated carbon 37 lowering the mn2 removal performance nom is also adsorbed on activated carbon 38 39 and may competes with mn2 therefore we also examined the effect of co existing nom on the mn removal rate by using five different waters artificial waters 16 20 that were prepared by adding different levels of nom to the ion adjusted water artificial water 2 the relationship between the rate coefficient at a free chlorine dosage of 1 0 mg cl2 l and the doc concentration as an index of nom level is shown in fig 5c the rate coefficient decreased with increasing doc concentration this decrease might have been partially due to a decrease in the amount of free chlorine available for the mn removal because free chlorine demand increases with increasing nom concentration however when the residual free chlorine concentration during the reaction at 5 min was similar the same trend decreasing rate coefficient with increasing doc concentration was observed fig 12s this indicated that the presence of nom decreased the mn removal rate the rate coefficient for natural water 6 is also plotted in fig 5c the data are taken from fig 4 at the same free chlorine dosage as that used for fig 5c the plot of natural water 6 was consistent with that of the artificial water with a similar doc concentration this may be a coincidence because it is possible that the effect of nom on the mn removal rate varied depending on the characteristics of the nom however the fact that the supplementation of ions and nom to pure water at the same concentrations as those in natural water 6 resulted in a very similar mn removal rate supports the assertion that nom and ca2 have marked negative effects on mn removal rate tobiason et al 40 has reported that the mn uptake capacity of mnox s adsorption in the absence of free chlorine decreases with increasing nom concentration whereas overall oxidative mn removal performance by mnox s and free chlorine remains good regardless of nom concentration our results are not consistent with those of tobiason et al 40 in that catalytic oxidation by mnox s was not affected by co existing nom whereas that of spac was we consider this inconsistency to originate from the difference in the type of catalyst used in the two studies that is the affinity of spac to nom was stronger than that of mnox s to nom the difference in catalytic activity between activated carbon and mnox s is a subject of interest but it is beyond the scope of the present study further studies are warranted 3 4 effects of water temperature mixing intensity and timing of free chlorine dosing we examined the effect of water temperature on the mn removal rate coefficient fig 6a the rate coefficient decreased with decreasing water temperature clearly indicating that water temperature affected mn removal performance the rate coefficient decreased to almost half when the water temperature was reduced from 20 c to 4 0 c the rate coefficients for natural water 1 in the pilot plant and batch experiments are also plotted in fig 6a the data are taken from section 3 1 although only one temperature condition for each experiment was examined these data are consistent with the temperature dependence observed in the artificial waters indicating that the low mn removal rate in the pilot plant compared with the batch experiment was due to the temperature difference a similar dependency on temperature can also be seen in the experimental data of li et al 20 although they reported that mn removal by activated carbon and free chlorine was still fast regardless of the water temperature their data interpretation may be due to the small dependency within the narrower room temperature range they used 15 30 c compared with the range used in the present study 3 3 23 c which extended to include much cooler temperatures real world water purification plants are operated year round with the water temperature ranging from around 0 to over 30 c the effect of reactor mixing intensity on mn removal rate was examined by conducting batch experiments at eight different agitation speeds using g value as an index of mixing intensity fig 6b the rate coefficient gradually increased with increasing g value indicating that the mixing condition affected the mn removal performance by spac chlorine however the change in the rate coefficient was limited even when the g value was increased from 23 s 1 to 1440 s 1 which is an increase of 60 times the rate coefficient increased only from 0 0077 to 0 0102 s 1 which is an increase of only 1 3 times therefore in real world application the effect of mixing condition on mn removal rate should only be considered after considering the water temperature and co existing compounds which have much larger effects on the rate coefficient in the pilot plant experiment mn removal by spac chlorine proceeded via a line mixer and pipe the g value at 4 c in the line mixer was 9000 s 1 and in the pipe it was 400 s 1 although the g value in the line mixer was very large the hrt was only around 0 1 s which was extremely short compared to the hrt of 2 9 min in the pipe thus it can be assumed that the mn removal in the pilot plant experiment occurred almost entirely in the pipe and therefore at a g value of 400 s 1 the g value in the batch experiments shown in fig 2b was 509 s 1 thus the mixing intensity was not a main cause of the difference observed in the mn removal rate between the pilot plant and batch experiments shown in fig 2b mn removal by mnox s in the presence of free chlorine comprises three sequential processes mass transfer of mn2 from the bulk liquid to the mnox s surface local equilibrium adsorption of mn2 at active sites on the mnox s surface and oxidation of adsorbed mn2 by free chlorine 41 43 when this model is applied to mn removal by activated carbon and free chlorine the fact that the mn removal follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics suggests that external film mass transfer is the rate determining step 21 in addition the fact that ca2 and nom influence mn removal rate suggests that adsorption and oxidation also play roles in the kinetics therefore we examined whether mn removal by activated carbon and free chlorine as well as the effects of mixing intensity and water temperature could be explained using the external film mass transfer model see text 1s and table 1s the rate coefficients predicted by the mass transfer model are shown in fig 6a and b the dependences observed in the experimental rate coefficients i e the rate coefficient increased with increasing water temperature and mixing intensity were also observed in the calculated rate coefficients however the values of the rate coefficients themselves were always larger in the calculation than in the experiment this implies that the mn removal rate is determined not only by the external film mass transfer process but also by adsorption oxidation as inferred from the results of the experiments examining the effects of co existing ions and nom see section 3 3 the effects of the timing of spac and free chlorine dosing on mn removal rate were also examined by batch experiment mn removal rates were comparable when spac and free chlorine were dosed at the same time or at an interval of 2 5 or 5 0 min fig 16s this time range included the conditions used in the pilot plant experiment at almost the same time interval 0 02 min and the batch experiment interval 5 min fig 2 thus the timing of the spac and free chlorine dosing had little effect on the difference between the mn removal rates of the pilot plant and batch experiments 3 5 effects of coagulation treatment in the pilot plant experiment the addition of pacl to induce coagulation prior to membrane filtration was observed to have two effects on mn removal by spac chlorine 1 it increased the soluble mn concentration soon after addition and 2 it decreased the rate of mn removal we hypothesized that the increase in the mn concentration was due to redissolution of some of the mnox s that had precipitated on the surface of the spac as a result of coming into contact with acidic pacl solution ph around 4 the decrease in the rate of mn removal was assumed to be due to the hindrance of mn2 transfer from the bulk solution to the adsorption site on the surface of spac due to induction of flocculation of the spac particles or by the blockage of the active sites on the spac surface by the attachment of aluminum hydroxide formed from pacl 44 as reported for the adsorptive removal of an organic micro pollutant by pac 45 47 to examine these two effects in more detail we conducted batch experiments using pacl the changes of soluble mn concentration with time in the batch experiments are shown in fig 7a pacl was added at 2 9 min after free chlorine dosing the timing and dosage of the pacl were the same as those used in the pilot plant experiment the decrease in the concentration of mn became slower after the addition of pacl compared with before particularly when the low temperature from the pilot plant experiment 3 0 4 0 c was used at the low water temperature the mn concentration had decreased by only 5 at 4 6 min after the addition of pacl from 18 8 μg l at a reaction time of 2 75 min to 17 9 μg l at 7 5 min in addition in the low temperature experiment a small increase in the mn concentration was observed immediately after the addition of pacl although the magnitude of this increase was smaller than that observed in the pilot plant experiment thus these findings confirm the presence of the two pacl effects observed earlier in the pilot plant experiment the increase of mn concentration by the addition of pacl was further examined using seven different mixing conditions g value 50 1135 s 1 which included the low g value present in the pipe in the pilot plant experiment fig 7b shows the changes of mn concentration with g values of 50 142 401 and 1135 s 1 the results of the remaining conditions are shown in fig 17s under the condition with the lowest g value 50 s 1 the largest mn concentration increase by the addition of pacl was observed although the magnitude of the increase 1 1 μg l in average value of the three trials was still smaller than that observed in the pilot plant experiment the increase was observed in all of the triplicate experiments 16 2 0 1 to 17 8 0 1 μg l 16 5 0 2 to 17 7 0 1 μg l and 17 4 0 1 to 17 8 0 1 μg l respectively fig 18s taking our findings together the increase in the mn concentration after the addition of pacl was largest at a low water temperature and under conditions of low mixing intensity we thought that the pacl which is a liquid with a ph around 4 that hydrolyzes slowly at low temperatures 48 was able to come into contact with the mnox s on the surface of the spac under low turbulent flow conditions and dissolve it in the pilot plant the pacl was dosed in the middle of the pipeline under a low g value of 70 s 1 water was transferred to a line mixer under a high g value 9000 s 1 but its hrt was extremely short at 0 1 s thus the low temperature and the low mixing intensity at the pacl addition point the pipe contributed to the large increase in the mn concentration in the pilot plant experiment we hypothesized that if the mn concentration increase by the addition of pacl was due to redissolution of mnox s then the effect would be greater if the pacl was dosed after the removal of mn had progressed and more mnox s had been deposited on spac thus we examined this hypothesis by conducting batch experiments with pacl added at 2 9 4 4 9 4 or 14 4 min after the start of mn oxidation by the addition of free chlorine fig 8 an increase in soluble mn concentration was observed when the pacl was added at 2 9 min the shortest time after free chlorine dosing although the increase was only small an increase of 1 1 μg l no increase in mn concentration was observed when the pacl was added at the longer times 4 4 9 4 or 14 4 min after free chlorine dosing contrary to our hypothesis this suggests that the more the oxidation reaction has progressed the harder it is for the mnox s on the surface of spac to redissolve overall these findings do confirm that the addition of pacl could retard mn removal by spac chlorine because it dissolves the mnox s this retardation was marked at low temperatures but could be attenuated by increasing the mixing intensity or by adding the pacl after sufficient mn removal has occurred furthermore it should not be forgotten that coagulation by pacl prior to membrane filtration is an effective means of removing colloidal mn see section 3 2 4 conclusions 1 dissolved mn that is able to pass through a 10 000 mwco ultrafilter that is mn2 is removed by spac chlorine however a portion of soluble mn in natural water is present in colloidal form that is retained by the ultrafilter and this mn cannot be removed by spac chlorine because it is already oxidized however this colloidal mn can be removed by coagulation microfiltration therefore microfiltration after pretreatment by spac free chlorine and the coagulant pacl is a potential option for the removal of mn 2 addition of pacl during mn removal by spac chlorine resulted in a decrease in the mn removal rate due to hindrance of mass transfer and redissolution of mnox s from the surface of the spac the latter effect is large at low temperatures but can be alleviated by using a high mixing intensity preventing local acidity and by dosing pacl at a sufficient period of time after the mn removal has progressed and the mn is fully oxidized 3 the rate of mn removal by spac chlorine was decreased in the presence of co existing species in the water particularly ca2 and nom mg2 also had an effect but the effect per molar concentration was smaller than that of ca2 it is thought that these species compete with mn2 for adsorption on the surface of the spac 4 water temperature and mixing intensity affect mn removal rate water temperature had a particularly marked effect on mn removal rate the pseudo first order reaction rate coefficient of mn removal decreased to about 50 by reducing the water temperature from 20 c to 4 c the effect of mixing intensity was less changing the g value from 1440 to 23 s 1 decreased the rate coefficient by 25 enhancing the spac dosage would be a practical solution to maintain an acceptable mn removal rate at low temperatures 5 the dependences of the pseudo first order reaction rate coefficient for mn removal on water temperature and mixing intensity in the present experiments showed similar trends compared with that of the external film mass transfer coefficient predicted independently from the correlation equation however the values of the rate coefficient were smaller than the values predicted from the mass transfer model alone in addition the decrease in the mn removal rate due to co existing compounds is not in accordance with the mass transfer model therefore reaction processes adsorption and or oxidation other than the mass transfer also influence mn removal rate 6 the form of soluble mn presence of ca2 presence of nom water temperature mixing intensity and coagulation treatment are

12853,catalytic oxidation of dissolved divalent mn ion mn2 by free chlorine and superfine powdered activated carbon spac before microfiltration has been emerged as a new technology to remove mn from natural water for drinking water production however mn was not sufficiently removed in pilot plant experiments yet the present study clarified underlaying removal mechanisms in natural water soluble mn exists as colloidal mn with a molecular weight 10 000 da in the oxidized form in addition to mn2 mn2 was removed by spac chlorine but ca2 mg2 and nom decreased the mn2 removal rate as a result of competitive adsorption the colloidal mn was not removed by spac chlorine but could be removed by coagulation and microfiltration or ultrafiltration alone with the addition of coagulant poly aluminum chloride the soluble mn concentration increased because of redissolution of precipitated oxidized mn due an increase in local acidity in particular at low temperature and coagulation reduced soluble mn removal rate due to hindrance of mass transfer these negative impacts may be partially attenuated by using high intensity mixing or waiting to add the coagulant after the oxidation of mn2 has progressed sufficiently mn removal rate changed with temperature and mixing intensity in the same trend as predicted by the mass transfer model but it was smaller than the prediction together with the effects of ca2 mg2 and nom it appears that not only mass transfer but also the process of adsorption is a factor affecting the overall mn removal rate graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords manganese oxidation spac mass transfer 1 introduction in the presence of free chlorine for disinfection generally 1 0 mg cl2 l or less redox potential of around 0 7 v dissolved divalent mn mn2 remaining in finished drinking water is gradually oxidized to an insoluble form either mn iii or mn iv oxide redox potential of 0 6 0 8 v hereinafter referred to as mnox s 1 mnox s gradually accumulates on the walls of concrete tanks and distribution pipes which can lead to operational problems like pipe narrowing or black water at the tap 2 even low concentrations of mn that do not cause aesthetic problems may leave stains on laundry 3 because these problems can result in consumer complaints and loss of confidence in the quality of the water mn levels in municipal drinking water are purposefully kept low 4 8 several countries have established acceptable mn levels for treated water canada 0 02 mg l 9 and japan us 0 05 mg l 10 11 however these problems can occur even at mn concentrations as low as 0 02 mg l 12 and 0 01 mg l 3 therefore many water utilities set their own maximum acceptable mn concentrations that are much lower than the national drinking water quality standards for example several water utilities in japan have set maximum mn concentrations of 0 001 mg l 13 15 a widely used approach for removing mn2 from drinking water is adsorption and catalytic oxidation by using an mnox s coated medium in the presence of free chlorine in this process mn2 is adsorbed on the surface of the mnox s coating where it is catalytically oxidized by the free chlorine to mnox s which then forms a new coating for the removal of more mn2 the advantages of this approach are that the filter media used for sand filtration in a conventional water purification system can be used as mnox s coated media 16 19 however using this approach in other systems such as membrane filtration necessitates the use of a contactor for the mnox s coated media recently li et al 20 have reported that powdered activated carbon pac also catalyzes the oxidation of mn2 by free chlorine independent of their work we discovered in a pilot scale membrane filtration plant experiment that superfine powdered activated carbon spac in the presence of free chlorine hereafter spac chlorine was able to remove soluble mn from natural water at a level suitable for practical application of the approach in real world water treatment facilities 21 furthermore we clarified in the batch experiments using mn2 spiked pure water that decreasing the particle size of the pac from a median diameter of tens of micrometers i e conventionally sized pac to a median diameter of 1 μm by micro milling resulted in a substantial increase in the rate of soluble mn removal highlighting the importance of particle size on mn removal rate by activated carbon 21 during mn removal by spac chlorine mn2 is oxidized on the spac surface to form mnox s precipitate 21 the spac particles are then separated from the bulk water by a solid liquid separation process such as membrane filtration taking with it the mnox s unlike the conventional catalytic oxidation method using mnox s coated media this spac chlorine method does not require a media contactor and thus can be applied as a simple pretreatment for membrane filtration to remove mn from drinking water 21 however because activated carbon also has adsorbent activities for soluble compounds 22 24 the mn removal performance of spac chlorine may be affected by the presence of other compounds found in natural water such as soluble organic substances in addition the mn removal performance may also be affected by the coagulation treatment which is often used as a pretreatment before membrane filtration especially when spac is used 25 26 therefore factors influencing the mn removal by the spac chlorine method in real world water treatment conditions must be clarified for ensuring stable removal performance here we conducted pilot scale experiments and batch experiments to examine the factors that affect the performance of the mn removal by spac chlorine based on our findings we provide quantitative data that describe the key factors that influence the mn removal by spac chlorine with or without coagulation treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples two water series were prepared one comprising 6 natural waters and the other comprising 21 artificial waters table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the waters the natural waters were sampled from toyohira river sapporo japan and were determined to contain soluble mn that was able to pass through a microfilter pore size 0 2 μm the experiments using the natural waters were conducted within 12 h of water sampling to ensure that the mn had not oxidized and precipitated a 15 decrease in the concentration of soluble mn concentration was observed at 24 h after sampling data not shown the artificial waters were prepared by adding mn stock solution carbonate buffer sodium bicarbonate nahco3 sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl magnesium chloride mgcl2 calcium chloride cacl2 sodium sulfate na2so4 nitric acid hno3 guaranteed reagents fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation osaka japan and a natural organic matter nom stock solution to ultrapure water milli q advantage a10 merck kgaa darmstadt germany the mn stock solution was prepared by adding mncl2 4h2o guaranteed reagent fujifilm wako pure chemical corporation and sulfuric acid h2so4 to ultrapure water at concentrations of 100 mg mn l and 0 05 mol l respectively the low ph of about 2 in the mn stock solution ensured the mn remained in its dissolved divalent form nom stock solution with a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 200 mg l was prepared by adding suwanee river nom

25hp020an toyo roshi kaisha ltd tokyo japan the turbidity of the natural waters was determined by using a ratio turbidimetric determination method 2100q portable turbidimeter hach co loveland colorado usa and the alkalinity of both series of waters was determined by titration against 0 01 m h2so4 the concentrations of ions and soluble mn were measured by using an ion chromatography system ics 1000 and ics 1100 thermo fisher scientific inc waltham massachusetts usa and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry system hp 7700 agilent technologies inc santa clara california usa respectively the concentrations of doc and ultraviolet absorbance at 260 nm uv260 were measured as surrogate parameters for nom concentration by using a toc analyzer model 900 sievers instruments boulder colorado usa and a spectrophotometer uv 1800 with a 5 cm cell shimadzu kyoto japan respectively prior to the doc uv260 ion and mn measurements the water samples were filtered through a 0 2 μm microfilter 2 2 superfine powdered activated carbon we used milling to produce spac from wood based pac taiko w futamura chemical co ltd nagoya japan the pac was added to ultrapure water to produce a slurry which was then milled with a wet type bead mill lmz015 ashizawa finetech chiba japan to obtain a spac slurry after vacuum conditioning to remove air from the pores in the carbon the spac slurry was stored at 4 c the particle size distribution of the spac in the dispersed state was determined by means of a laser diffraction method microtrac mt3300exii microtracbel corp osaka to prepare samples for analysis a dispersant triton x 100 kanto chemical co inc tokyo final concentration 0 08 w v was added to the spac followed by ultrasonication for 1 min us 300e nihonseiki kaisha ltd tokyo the particle size distribution of the spac in the as is state partially aggregated state was determined by the same method but without the dispersion treatment the median diameter of the dispersed and as is spac particle size distribution was 1 2 μm and 2 2 μm respectively fig 1s 2 3 mn removal using a membrane filtration pilot plant pilot plant experiments were conducted at the shiraikawa water purification plant sapporo japan the treatment line of the pilot plant consisted of h2so4 dosing for ph adjustment spac dosing pre chlorination coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration fig 1 the processes up to ceramic membrane filtration were conducted entirely inline the plant was operated at a constant flow rate of 133 l h the hydraulic retention times hrts from spac free chlorine and coagulant dosing to the ceramic membrane module were 7 32 7 30 and 4 40 min respectively poly aluminum chloride pacl north pac basicity 50 hokkaido soda co tomakomai japan was used as the coagulant and naocl was used as the free chlorine source the dosages of spac free chlorine and coagulant were 1 0 mg l 1 0 mg cl2 l and 1 08 mg al l respectively the ph of the water before ceramic membrane filtration was monitored and kept constant at ph 6 8 by automated dosing with h2so4 via a feedback control system this ph was selected for optimum filterability details of the plant and ceramic membrane are described elsewhere 21 table 2 summarizes the experimental conditions during the experiment water samples were collected periodically from each of five sampling ports located 1 before the spac dosing 2 before the pacl dosing 3 after the line mixer after pacl dosing 4 before the ceramic membrane module and 5 after the ceramic membrane module the hrts at these ports from the reaction start free chlorine dosing were 0 00 2 87 3 07 7 26 and 7 30 min respectively the water samples except for the ceramic membrane filtrate sampled from port 5 were immediately filtered through a 0 2 μm microfilter to remove spac and any suspended matter 2 4 batch mn removal experiments batch experiments were conducted in a transparent polyvinyl chloride beaker 1 l capacity equipped with a floating magnetic stirrer nalgene suspended magnetic stir bar thermo fisher scientific inc massachusetts usa table 2 summarizes the experimental conditions prior to the experiments the beaker and stirrer were soaked in 5 v v nitric acid solution to dissolve any metal residual a water sample of 1000 ml was placed in the beaker and mixed at 400 rpm g value of 509 s 1 at 20 c throughout the experiment unless otherwise noted spac was dosed at 1 0 mg l after adjusting the ph of the water to 6 9 7 0 after 5 min unless otherwise noted from the spac dose free chlorine was dosed at 1 0 mg cl2 l unless otherwise noted to initiate the oxidative removal of mn during the experiment which was continued for up to 30 min the solution ph was adjusted to 6 9 7 1 by adding h2so4 hcl or naoh at 0 1 meq l in some experiments pacl was added after the free chlorine dose the ph and water temperature were monitored continuously water samples were withdrawn from the beaker and immediately filtered through a 0 2 μm microfilter in some experiments using natural water the filtrate was filtered again through a regenerated cellulose ultrafilter with a nominal molecular weight cut off mwco of 10 000 da plgc04310 merck kgaa the

respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 mn removal performance in the pilot plant and batch experiments first we examined the changes in the concentration of soluble mn over time using natural water 1 and the membrane filtration pilot plant fig 2a before the start of the oxidation reaction i e at the time of free chlorine dosing hrt 0 min the soluble mn concentration in the water was 33 μg l in the presence of free chlorine and spac just before the addition of coagulant hrt 2 87 min the mn concentration had decreased to 14 μg l however soon after the addition of coagulant pacl hrt 3 07 min the mn concentration had increased to 20 μg l this elevation after the addition of coagulant was not observed in the absence of spac in addition the rate of the decrease of the mn concentration was lower after the addition of coagulant hrt 3 07 7 26 min compared with before the addition of coagulant hrt 0 00 2 87 min indicating that the coagulant had decreased the rate of mn removal the mn concentration just before the ceramic membrane filtration stage hrt 7 26 min was 14 μg l however after the filtration stage hrt 7 30 min it had decreased to 9 2 μg l it was believed that high performance separation or some reaction had occurred within the ceramic membrane pore size 0 1 μm module to decrease the mn concentration e g adsorption and or catalytic oxidation possibly by the mnox s accumulated on the membrane during long term filtration operation in the pilot plant experiments the soluble mn concentration was decreased by approximately 30 with free chlorine alone even in the absence of spac however based on the results of other groups who have reported that the mn2 oxidation rate by free chlorine in the absence of catalyst is very low 27 28 it is estimated that the mn concentration does not decrease that much with free chlorine alone after a contact time of a few minutes in our batch experiment using the same source water as in the pilot plant experiment soluble mn concentration did not decrease with the addition of free chlorine alone fig 2s this indicates that in the pilot plant experiments catalytic oxidation possibly by mnox s that had accumulated on the inner walls of the pipes in the pilot plant had occurred we next compared the changes of soluble mn concentration in the presence of spac in the pilot plant and batch experiments using the same type of water natural water 1 fig 2b the mn concentration in the pilot plant experiment just before the ceramic membrane filtration stage hrt 7 26 min was 14 μg l which was about 5 times higher than the concentration 2 6 μg l at a similar reaction time of 7 5 min in the batch experiment focusing on the mn concentration before the addition of coagulant hrt and reaction time of approx 3 min the concentrations in the pilot plant and batch experiments with spac chlorine were comparable fig 2b however it is hard to conclude that the batch experiment reproduced the findings of the pilot plant experiment because even in the absence of spac soluble mn was removed to some extent in the pilot plant experiment fig 2a but not in the batch experiment fig 2s li et al 20 and saito et al 21 have reported that changes of mn concentration with time by activated carbon chlorine follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics 1 ln c mn c 0 mn kt where k is the rate coefficient of the pseudo first order reaction s 1 c mn is the bulk phase mn concentration μg l and c 0 mn is the initial concentration of mn μg l using eq 1 we calculated the rate coefficients from the changes in mn concentration in the pilot plant runs p1 and p2 a tubular plug flow reactor is assumed and batch experiments run b1 fig 3s in the pilot plant experiment the rate coefficient was 0 0046 s 1 in the presence of spac and 0 0020 s 1 in the absence of spac thus assuming that the mn removal rate is additive the rate coefficient of mn removal due to spac was 0 0026 s 1 in contrast in the batch experiment the rate coefficient in the presence of spac was 0 0054 s 1 and presumably almost zero in the absence of spac fig 2s comparing these coefficients the mn removal rate was substantially lower in the pilot plant experiment than in the batch experiment even for the same raw water further indicating that there are conditions other than coagulation treatment that affect the mn removal performance by spac chlorine including water temperature 3 0 4 0 c for the pilot plant experiment 19 20 c for the batch experiments mixing intensity in line mixing for the pilot plant experiment and stirrer mixing for the batch experiments and interval between spac dosing and free chlorine dosing 0 02 min for the pilot plant experiment and 5 min for the batch experiments in the batch experiment run b1 fig 2b the soluble mn concentration was observed up to a reaction time of 30 min at 15 min the decrease of mn concentration began to plateau and finally reached 0 2 μg l this result is not consistent with the findings from a previous study using artificial water supplemented with mn2 in which the mn concentration decreased exponentially with time and was reduced to 0 1 μg l 21 however in the present study we were able to observe an exponential decrease of mn concentration to 0 1 μg l when an mn2 spiked artificial water was tested in a batch experiment run b8 fig 2b together these findings indicate that a very small portion of the soluble mn in natural water that can pass through a 0 2 μm microfilter cannot be removed by spac chlorine treatment in addition in the batch experiments the rate of decrease of mn concentration for the natural water was slower than that for the artificial water i e the half life of mn concentration in the natural and artificial waters were 1 9 min and 1 2 min respectively the implication is that co existing compounds in the natural water retarded the removal of mn thus to summarize the findings to this point we found that many factors affected removal of mn from water by spac chlorine treatment in the remainder of the study we examined the effects of the following factors 1 presence of soluble mn that is not removed by catalytic oxidation 2 effects of co existing compounds on mn removal rate 3 effects of water temperature mixing intensity and timing of free chlorine dosing 4 effects of coagulant treatment we did not investigate the effect of ph in the present study since it had already been known that the effect is small in the practical range of ph 6 8 7 8 changes in the rate coefficients of the pseudo first order reaction in ph of 6 8 7 1 7 5 and 7 8 were 8 3 21 in the present study the ph during the reaction was in the range of 6 9 7 1 in the batch experiment and slightly higher than 6 8 in the pilot plant experiment but such a small difference of ph should have no effect on mn removal rate 3 2 presence of soluble mn that is not removed by catalytic oxidation in the previous section we hypothesized that the presence of soluble mn in natural water that cannot be removed by spac chlorine carlson et al 29 have reported that mn in natural water is present in three physicochemical forms particulate colloidal and dissolved mn particulate mn is easily removed by using a microfilter a pore size of 0 2 μm or 0 45 μm is generally used but the two remaining forms colloidal and dissolved mn are not the importance of distinguishing colloidal mn and dissolved mn reduced form mn2 for appropriate evaluation of mn removal has been discussed elsewhere 29 32 thus it is possible that the soluble mn that could not be removed in the batch experiment using natural water was colloidal mn possible in the form of mno2 31 hereafter referred to as mnox s colloids and or ha humic acid mn iii colloids 32 33 if the mechanism of soluble mn removal by activated carbon and free chlorine is oxidation and precipitation of mn2 on the surface of the activated carbon fig 4s 21 the colloidal mn which is already oxidized or bound to ha could not be a target of the removal process carlson et al 29 point to the presence of mn in colloidal form with mw 3000 30 000 da based on the experimental results that mn concentrations in 3000 10 000 and 30 000 mwco ultrafiltrates were comparable but that in 100 000 mwco filtrate was higher we used a ultrafilter with a mwco 10 000 da which is the middle value between mw 3000 and 30 000 and a 0 2 μm microfilter and determined the colloidal mn concentration by defining it as the difference between the mn concentrations in the two filtrates fig 3 the mn concentration in the 0 2 μm microfiltrate decreased with time but the decrease plateaued from a reaction time of 20 min 0 3 μg l of mn remained at a reaction time of 30 min in contrast the mn concentration in the 10 000 mwco ultrafiltrate decreased to below the limit of quantification 0 1 μg l and the decrease was linear in addition the colloidal mn concentration i e the difference between the mn concentrations in the two filtrates did not change with time remaining at 0 3 μg l even after 5 or 10 min of reaction time the value at 12 5 min of reaction could not be accurately determined because the mn concentration in the ultrafiltrate was below the limit of quantification but it was estimated to be in the range of 0 3 0 4 μg l which accounted for 75 100 of the mn concentration in the microfiltrate moreover the colloidal mn concentration was almost the same as the final residual soluble mn concentration observed in the microfiltrate at a reaction time of 30 min the final residual soluble mn concentration was the same regardless of free chlorine dosage fig 5s thus these results indicate that the unremovable soluble mn was colloidal mn in other words the colloidal mn in natural water is removable neither by the adsorption onto spac nor the catalytic oxidation by free chlorine on the spac surface this suggest that the colloidal mn would be the mnox s colloids rather than ha mn iii colloids because ha is adsorbable on activated carbon under real world water treatment conditions using spac a coagulant is almost always used before membrane filtration therefore the fate of mnox s colloids in this coagulation process was clarified fig 6s when pacl was added as the coagulant after the soluble mn concentration had plateaued at around 0 3 μg l the soluble mn concentration quickly decreased to below the limit of quantification 0 1 μg l this indicates that even though the mnox s colloids which is an oxidized form and therefore cannot be removed by spac chlorine treatment followed by microfiltration alone can be removed by spac chlorine treatment followed by coagulation and microfiltration this is in accordance with the previous finding that the mnox s colloids created by strong oxidants permanganate chlorine dioxide and ozone is destabilized and removed by coagulation sedimentation and sand filtration 8 though the removal mn concentration levels targeted in the studies are very different furthermore this suggests that the presence of the colloidal mn cannot be ignored in mn removal although the colloidal mn concentration in the water we sampled was as low as 0 3 μg l it should be also noted that colloidal mn can be removed without coagulation pretreatment by using ultrafiltration instead of microfiltration 3 3 effect of co existing compounds in natural water the decrease of soluble mn concentration in natural water was slower than that in artificial water fig 2b to examine this phenomenon in more detail we obtained the pseudo first order reaction rate coefficients for the batch experiments by fitting the change of the dissolved mn2 concentration which was obtained by subtracting the concentration of the unremovable soluble mn i e colloidal mn see section 3 2 from the mn concentration in the microfiltrate 0 2 μm pore size to eq 1 section 3 1 the rate coefficient was 0 0061 s 1 for natural water 1 which was substantially lower than the value of 0 0098 s 1 for artificial water 1 fig 7s the fact that the experimental conditions were the same except for the raw waters indicates that co existing compounds in natural water 1 decreased the rate coefficient to clarify the types of co existing compounds that caused the decrease in the rate coefficient we conducted batch experiments using three different raw waters environmental water natural water 6 pure water adjusted so that the ion concentrations were the same as those in natural water 6 artificial water 2 and pure water supplemented with carbonate buffer alone artificial water 1 because the rate coefficient depends on free chlorine concentration especially in the low concentration region 21 the experiments were conducted at several free chlorine dosages changes in dissolved mn2 concentration were well fitted to eq 1 fig 8s and the results were summarized by plotting the rate coefficient against the free chlorine dosage fig 4 the rate coefficient decreased in the order of artificial water 1 artificial water 2 natural water 6 because the rate coefficient for artificial water 1 was greater than that of artificial water 2 these results confirmed that co existing ions made a marked contribution to the decrease of the rate coefficient in the natural water next we examined which ions were responsible for the decrease in the rate coefficient by using 13 different waters artificial waters 3 15 prepared by adding different cations and anions to carbonate buffered 0 2 mmol l nahco3 pure water fig 5a and b overall the cations induced a larger decrease in the rate coefficient compared with the anions the greatest decrease was observed in the presence of ca2 followed by mg2 whereas no decreases were observed in the presence of k or na we also examined the effect of carbonate buffer nahco3 on the mn removal rate fig 10s the rate coefficients were comparable at nahco3 concentrations of 0 2 mmol l and 1 2 mmol l confirming that the carbonate buffer had no effect on the removal rate both natural water 6 and artificial water 2 contained ca2 and mg2 but the concentration of ca2 0 26 mmol l was higher than that of mg2 0 09 mmol l taking these findings together we concluded that the observed decrease in the rate coefficient was the result mainly of the presence of ca2 when the carbonate buffered pure water artificial water 1 was supplemented with ca2 to make artificial water 10 ca2 at 0 25 mmol l the rate coefficient of the water was similar to that of artificial water 2 ca2 at 0 26 mmol l mg2 at 0 09 mmol l na 0 60 mmol l and k 0 05 mmol l thus ca2 was considered the co existing ion with the greatest impact on mn removal rate assuming that the process of catalytic oxidation of mn begins with adsorption of mn2 on the surface of a catalyst via ion exchange mechanism 20 21 34 36 it is reasonable to suggest that ca2 competes with mn2 for adsorption on activated carbon 37 lowering the mn2 removal performance nom is also adsorbed on activated carbon 38 39 and may competes with mn2 therefore we also examined the effect of co existing nom on the mn removal rate by using five different waters artificial waters 16 20 that were prepared by adding different levels of nom to the ion adjusted water artificial water 2 the relationship between the rate coefficient at a free chlorine dosage of 1 0 mg cl2 l and the doc concentration as an index of nom level is shown in fig 5c the rate coefficient decreased with increasing doc concentration this decrease might have been partially due to a decrease in the amount of free chlorine available for the mn removal because free chlorine demand increases with increasing nom concentration however when the residual free chlorine concentration during the reaction at 5 min was similar the same trend decreasing rate coefficient with increasing doc concentration was observed fig 12s this indicated that the presence of nom decreased the mn removal rate the rate coefficient for natural water 6 is also plotted in fig 5c the data are taken from fig 4 at the same free chlorine dosage as that used for fig 5c the plot of natural water 6 was consistent with that of the artificial water with a similar doc concentration this may be a coincidence because it is possible that the effect of nom on the mn removal rate varied depending on the characteristics of the nom however the fact that the supplementation of ions and nom to pure water at the same concentrations as those in natural water 6 resulted in a very similar mn removal rate supports the assertion that nom and ca2 have marked negative effects on mn removal rate tobiason et al 40 has reported that the mn uptake capacity of mnox s adsorption in the absence of free chlorine decreases with increasing nom concentration whereas overall oxidative mn removal performance by mnox s and free chlorine remains good regardless of nom concentration our results are not consistent with those of tobiason et al 40 in that catalytic oxidation by mnox s was not affected by co existing nom whereas that of spac was we consider this inconsistency to originate from the difference in the type of catalyst used in the two studies that is the affinity of spac to nom was stronger than that of mnox s to nom the difference in catalytic activity between activated carbon and mnox s is a subject of interest but it is beyond the scope of the present study further studies are warranted 3 4 effects of water temperature mixing intensity and timing of free chlorine dosing we examined the effect of water temperature on the mn removal rate coefficient fig 6a the rate coefficient decreased with decreasing water temperature clearly indicating that water temperature affected mn removal performance the rate coefficient decreased to almost half when the water temperature was reduced from 20 c to 4 0 c the rate coefficients for natural water 1 in the pilot plant and batch experiments are also plotted in fig 6a the data are taken from section 3 1 although only one temperature condition for each experiment was examined these data are consistent with the temperature dependence observed in the artificial waters indicating that the low mn removal rate in the pilot plant compared with the batch experiment was due to the temperature difference a similar dependency on temperature can also be seen in the experimental data of li et al 20 although they reported that mn removal by activated carbon and free chlorine was still fast regardless of the water temperature their data interpretation may be due to the small dependency within the narrower room temperature range they used 15 30 c compared with the range used in the present study 3 3 23 c which extended to include much cooler temperatures real world water purification plants are operated year round with the water temperature ranging from around 0 to over 30 c the effect of reactor mixing intensity on mn removal rate was examined by conducting batch experiments at eight different agitation speeds using g value as an index of mixing intensity fig 6b the rate coefficient gradually increased with increasing g value indicating that the mixing condition affected the mn removal performance by spac chlorine however the change in the rate coefficient was limited even when the g value was increased from 23 s 1 to 1440 s 1 which is an increase of 60 times the rate coefficient increased only from 0 0077 to 0 0102 s 1 which is an increase of only 1 3 times therefore in real world application the effect of mixing condition on mn removal rate should only be considered after considering the water temperature and co existing compounds which have much larger effects on the rate coefficient in the pilot plant experiment mn removal by spac chlorine proceeded via a line mixer and pipe the g value at 4 c in the line mixer was 9000 s 1 and in the pipe it was 400 s 1 although the g value in the line mixer was very large the hrt was only around 0 1 s which was extremely short compared to the hrt of 2 9 min in the pipe thus it can be assumed that the mn removal in the pilot plant experiment occurred almost entirely in the pipe and therefore at a g value of 400 s 1 the g value in the batch experiments shown in fig 2b was 509 s 1 thus the mixing intensity was not a main cause of the difference observed in the mn removal rate between the pilot plant and batch experiments shown in fig 2b mn removal by mnox s in the presence of free chlorine comprises three sequential processes mass transfer of mn2 from the bulk liquid to the mnox s surface local equilibrium adsorption of mn2 at active sites on the mnox s surface and oxidation of adsorbed mn2 by free chlorine 41 43 when this model is applied to mn removal by activated carbon and free chlorine the fact that the mn removal follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics suggests that external film mass transfer is the rate determining step 21 in addition the fact that ca2 and nom influence mn removal rate suggests that adsorption and oxidation also play roles in the kinetics therefore we examined whether mn removal by activated carbon and free chlorine as well as the effects of mixing intensity and water temperature could be explained using the external film mass transfer model see text 1s and table 1s the rate coefficients predicted by the mass transfer model are shown in fig 6a and b the dependences observed in the experimental rate coefficients i e the rate coefficient increased with increasing water temperature and mixing intensity were also observed in the calculated rate coefficients however the values of the rate coefficients themselves were always larger in the calculation than in the experiment this implies that the mn removal rate is determined not only by the external film mass transfer process but also by adsorption oxidation as inferred from the results of the experiments examining the effects of co existing ions and nom see section 3 3 the effects of the timing of spac and free chlorine dosing on mn removal rate were also examined by batch experiment mn removal rates were comparable when spac and free chlorine were dosed at the same time or at an interval of 2 5 or 5 0 min fig 16s this time range included the conditions used in the pilot plant experiment at almost the same time interval 0 02 min and the batch experiment interval 5 min fig 2 thus the timing of the spac and free chlorine dosing had little effect on the difference between the mn removal rates of the pilot plant and batch experiments 3 5 effects of coagulation treatment in the pilot plant experiment the addition of pacl to induce coagulation prior to membrane filtration was observed to have two effects on mn removal by spac chlorine 1 it increased the soluble mn concentration soon after addition and 2 it decreased the rate of mn removal we hypothesized that the increase in the mn concentration was due to redissolution of some of the mnox s that had precipitated on the surface of the spac as a result of coming into contact with acidic pacl solution ph around 4 the decrease in the rate of mn removal was assumed to be due to the hindrance of mn2 transfer from the bulk solution to the adsorption site on the surface of spac due to induction of flocculation of the spac particles or by the blockage of the active sites on the spac surface by the attachment of aluminum hydroxide formed from pacl 44 as reported for the adsorptive removal of an organic micro pollutant by pac 45 47 to examine these two effects in more detail we conducted batch experiments using pacl the changes of soluble mn concentration with time in the batch experiments are shown in fig 7a pacl was added at 2 9 min after free chlorine dosing the timing and dosage of the pacl were the same as those used in the pilot plant experiment the decrease in the concentration of mn became slower after the addition of pacl compared with before particularly when the low temperature from the pilot plant experiment 3 0 4 0 c was used at the low water temperature the mn concentration had decreased by only 5 at 4 6 min after the addition of pacl from 18 8 μg l at a reaction time of 2 75 min to 17 9 μg l at 7 5 min in addition in the low temperature experiment a small increase in the mn concentration was observed immediately after the addition of pacl although the magnitude of this increase was smaller than that observed in the pilot plant experiment thus these findings confirm the presence of the two pacl effects observed earlier in the pilot plant experiment the increase of mn concentration by the addition of pacl was further examined using seven different mixing conditions g value 50 1135 s 1 which included the low g value present in the pipe in the pilot plant experiment fig 7b shows the changes of mn concentration with g values of 50 142 401 and 1135 s 1 the results of the remaining conditions are shown in fig 17s under the condition with the lowest g value 50 s 1 the largest mn concentration increase by the addition of pacl was observed although the magnitude of the increase 1 1 μg l in average value of the three trials was still smaller than that observed in the pilot plant experiment the increase was observed in all of the triplicate experiments 16 2 0 1 to 17 8 0 1 μg l 16 5 0 2 to 17 7 0 1 μg l and 17 4 0 1 to 17 8 0 1 μg l respectively fig 18s taking our findings together the increase in the mn concentration after the addition of pacl was largest at a low water temperature and under conditions of low mixing intensity we thought that the pacl which is a liquid with a ph around 4 that hydrolyzes slowly at low temperatures 48 was able to come into contact with the mnox s on the surface of the spac under low turbulent flow conditions and dissolve it in the pilot plant the pacl was dosed in the middle of the pipeline under a low g value of 70 s 1 water was transferred to a line mixer under a high g value 9000 s 1 but its hrt was extremely short at 0 1 s thus the low temperature and the low mixing intensity at the pacl addition point the pipe contributed to the large increase in the mn concentration in the pilot plant experiment we hypothesized that if the mn concentration increase by the addition of pacl was due to redissolution of mnox s then the effect would be greater if the pacl was dosed after the removal of mn had progressed and more mnox s had been deposited on spac thus we examined this hypothesis by conducting batch experiments with pacl added at 2 9 4 4 9 4 or 14 4 min after the start of mn oxidation by the addition of free chlorine fig 8 an increase in soluble mn concentration was observed when the pacl was added at 2 9 min the shortest time after free chlorine dosing although the increase was only small an increase of 1 1 μg l no increase in mn concentration was observed when the pacl was added at the longer times 4 4 9 4 or 14 4 min after free chlorine dosing contrary to our hypothesis this suggests that the more the oxidation reaction has progressed the harder it is for the mnox s on the surface of spac to redissolve overall these findings do confirm that the addition of pacl could retard mn removal by spac chlorine because it dissolves the mnox s this retardation was marked at low temperatures but could be attenuated by increasing the mixing intensity or by adding the pacl after sufficient mn removal has occurred furthermore it should not be forgotten that coagulation by pacl prior to membrane filtration is an effective means of removing colloidal mn see section 3 2 4 conclusions 1 dissolved mn that is able to pass through a 10 000 mwco ultrafilter that is mn2 is removed by spac chlorine however a portion of soluble mn in natural water is present in colloidal form that is retained by the ultrafilter and this mn cannot be removed by spac chlorine because it is already oxidized however this colloidal mn can be removed by coagulation microfiltration therefore microfiltration after pretreatment by spac free chlorine and the coagulant pacl is a potential option for the removal of mn 2 addition of pacl during mn removal by spac chlorine resulted in a decrease in the mn removal rate due to hindrance of mass transfer and redissolution of mnox s from the surface of the spac the latter effect is large at low temperatures but can be alleviated by using a high mixing intensity preventing local acidity and by dosing pacl at a sufficient period of time after the mn removal has progressed and the mn is fully oxidized 3 the rate of mn removal by spac chlorine was decreased in the presence of co existing species in the water particularly ca2 and nom mg2 also had an effect but the effect per molar concentration was smaller than that of ca2 it is thought that these species compete with mn2 for adsorption on the surface of the spac 4 water temperature and mixing intensity affect mn removal rate water temperature had a particularly marked effect on mn removal rate the pseudo first order reaction rate coefficient of mn removal decreased to about 50 by reducing the water temperature from 20 c to 4 c the effect of mixing intensity was less changing the g value from 1440 to 23 s 1 decreased the rate coefficient by 25 enhancing the spac dosage would be a practical solution to maintain an acceptable mn removal rate at low temperatures 5 the dependences of the pseudo first order reaction rate coefficient for mn removal on water temperature and mixing intensity in the present experiments showed similar trends compared with that of the external film mass transfer coefficient predicted independently from the correlation equation however the values of the rate coefficient were smaller than the values predicted from the mass transfer model alone in addition the decrease in the mn removal rate due to co existing compounds is not in accordance with the mass transfer model therefore reaction processes adsorption and or oxidation other than the mass transfer also influence mn removal rate 6 the form of soluble mn presence of ca2 presence of nom water temperature mixing intensity and coagulation treatment are

12854,the coupled photoelectrocatalytic and biodegradation of p chloronitrobenzene p cnb was developed with the reduced graphene oxide biobr tio2 nanotube arrays gb tnas as the photoelectrodes the p cnb removal performance microbial activity and microbial community were systematically investigated in different bioreactors the photoelectrocatalytic degradation improved the biodegradability of p cnb compared to single biodegradation the coupled degradation process exhibited higher p cnb removal and mineralization efficiency the specific oxygen utilization rate and dehydrogenase activity in single biodegradation bioreactor declined by 48 63 and 41 14 on day 25 indicating that p cnb inhibited the microbial metabolic activity however the photoelectrocatalytic degradation could effectively reduce the inhibition of p cnb on microbial activity of bioreactors the variations of microbial reactive oxygen species production antioxidant enzyme activity and lactate dehydrogenase release confirmed that photoelectrocatalytic degradation declined the biotoxicity of p cnb to the microorganisms in the coupled degradation process p cnb reduced the microbial richness and diversity in the single biodegradation process whereas they increased obviously with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time in the combined degradation process keywords p chloronitrobenzene photoelectrocatalytic degradation microbial activity reactive oxygen species microbial richness data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chloronitrobenzene cnb is a typical halogenated nitroaromatic compound which was widely used in manufacture of pesticides dyes pharmaceuticals antioxidants and other industrial chemicals 1 2 the extensive application and improper disposition of cnb would unavoidably result in its release to environment cnb can induce carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic effects to humans and animals which is listed as the priority controlled pollutants by many countries 3 5 considering the high toxicity bioaccumulation and recalcitrance of cnb it is urgent to develop an effective technology to remove cnb from water some researchers have proposed several approaches for cnb removal including adsorption 6 chemical oxidation 7 8 and biodegradation 9 10 although these methods exhibited various advantages they were still limited by several limitations the physical adsorption merely achieves the phase migration of cnb the chemical oxidation can consume plenty of chemicals and energy due to the strong electron withdrawing groups nitro and chloro 11 the biodegradation needs time consuming due to high biotoxicity and low biodegradability of cnb 12 recently the sequentially coupled chemical biological treatment technology was developed to eliminate the shortcomings of single physicochemical and biological treatment processes the application of fenton oxidation as a pre treatment increased the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater by contrast to the single biological treatment 13 the ozonation biological treatment processes improved the biodegradability and removal performance of wastewater containing chlorinated nitroaromatic compounds 14 the photoelectrocatalysis is regarded as a promising and green technology for the efficient degradation of persistent pollutants 15 16 among numerous photoelectrodes materials tio2 nanotube arrays tnas attracted extensive concerns owing to low cost non toxicity stability and high activity 17 however the low visible light utilization and high electron hole recombination limited its practical application the semiconductor coupling to construct heterojunction is considered to be an effective strategy to solve these defects 18 19 our previous researches also confirmed that biobr tio2 nanotube arrays b tnas and reduced graphene oxide biobr tnas gb tnas photoelectrodes could resolve the recycle of powdered catalysts and exhibited high efficiency visible light photoelectrocatalytic performance for p cnb 20 21 it was reported that photocatalysis was adopted as the pretreatment in coupled treatment processes for eliminating phenols 22 24 surfactants 25 herbicides 26 and other organic pollutants 27 28 although these researches detailed the potential of coupled photo electro catalysis and biodegradation the effects of photo electro catalytic effluents on subsequent microbial activity and microbial community were not clear the objects of the present study focused on a investigating p cnb removal in the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process b analyzing the changes of microbial activity in different bioreactors c evaluating the biotoxicity of p cnb to microorganisms in bioreactors and d analyzing the changes of microbial richness and diversity after photoelectrocatalytic degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of gb tnas photoelectrodes the gb tnas photoelectrodes

investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem and jem2100f transmission electron microscope tem the elemental composition has been analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 2 2 photoelectrocatalytic degradation of p cnb the single photoelectrocatalytic degradation of p cnb was performed in a cylindrical quartz reactor the inner diameter and height of photoelectrocatalytic reactor were 3 2 and 8 0 cm respectively the distance between gb tnas anode and pt foil cathode was maintained at 2 cm a dc power was adopted to output the voltage potential of 1 0 v the visible light was provided by a 300 w xenon lamp with uv cut off filter the reactor was firstly placed in dark for 60 min to reach adsorption equilibrium and then irradiated under visible light the p cnb solution in the reactor was continuously stirred by a magnetic stirrer during the whole reaction 2 3 synergic photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation of p cnb the synergic photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation of p cnb was operated intermittently the p cnb solutions were firstly degraded in the above mentioned photoelectrocatalytic reactor for 2 5 and 8 h and then entered the bioreactors for further degradation the bioreactors used in this study were graduated serum bottles with effective volume of 250 ml the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss in the bioreactors were maintained at approximately 4500 mg l the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactors was set as 12 h including 6 h aerobic period 4 h anoxic period and 2 h settling period an aeration pump was used to supply oxygen and the dissolved oxygen do concentration was approximately 2 0 mg l during the aerobic period the corresponding synergic degradation processes with different photoelectrocatalytic degradation time were marked as r2 r5 and r8 respectively the single biodegradation process was conducted by feeding wastewater containing p cnb into bioreactor directly which was marked as r0 the wastewater was manually configured using ultrapure water which contained an appropriate amount of inorganic salts and trace elements needed for microbial growth besides p cnb the changes of bod5 for p cnb solutions before and after photoelectrocatalytic degradation were measured to analyze p cnb biodegradability 2 4 analytical methods the p cnb concentration was investigated

every bioreactor the linear discriminant analysis lda score log10 3 8 was applied to estimate the magnitude of difference 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structure analysis of gb tnas photoelectrodes the sem and tem images revealed that gb tnas was formed by highly ordered nanotubes which were covered by some tiny floccules or flakes fig s1 these nanotubes exhibited hollow structure with inside diameter of approximately 150 nm the eds indicated that the elemental compositions of gb tnas were ti o bi br and c which were further confirmed by survey xps spectra fig s2 the characteristic peaks in high resolution bi 4f and br 3d spectra were corresponding to bi3 and br respectively indicating that biobr was deposited on the tnas surface 31 the peak at 458 72 ev in ti 2p spectra was attributed to ti 2p3 2 whereas the peak at 465 75 ev was assigned to the stacking of ti 2p1 2 464 45 ev and bi 4d3 2 466 17 ev 32 the characteristic peaks at 529 73 530 12 and 532 21 ev in o 1 s spectra were identified as bi o bonds ti o bonds and surface oh respectively 33 the sem tem and xps results demonstrated the successful synthesis of gb tnas photoelectrodes with tight biobr tio2 heterojunction 3 2 removal performance of p cnb 3 2 1 effects of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time on the p cnb removal fig 1a showed the p cnb 100 mg l removal after different photoelectrocatalytic degradation time by gb tnas photoelectrodes the p cnb removal efficiency was 21 2 45 4 and 61 7 after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 2 5 and 8 h respectively therefore the effluent of three photoelectrocatalytic reactors contained 78 8 mg l 54 6 mg l and 38 3 mg l p cnb as well as the corresponding intermediate products as illustrated in fig 1b p cnb removal efficiency was 30 after the single biodegradation since the p cnb was resistant to be biodegraded the small amount of p cnb was removed owing to the adsorption property of activated sludge during the preliminary experiment the removal efficiency of p cnb by activated sludge without domestication was obviously limited after adsorption equilibrium the average p cnb removal efficiency in the combined degradation process obviously increased from 50 3 to 70 1 with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time from 2 to 8 h compared to the single photoelectrocatalytic degradation the p cnb removal efficiency exhibited an increase of about 10 30 in the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process therefore we concluded that the combined degradation process played a synergistic effect by contrast with single biodegradation p cnb mineralization efficiency in the combined degradation process increased from 20 to 64 3 after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 8 h fig 1c the bod5 change of p cnb was investigated after different photoelectrocatalytic degradation time table s1 the low bod5 value 4 7 mg l of p cnb confirmed that it was refractory to be biodegraded the bod5 value increased from 19 0 to 43 3 mg l with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time from 2 to 8 h demonstrating that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation improved the biodegradability of p cnb the above results suggested that the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process played a synergistic effect due to the improved biodegradability of p cnb 3 2 2 effects of initial concentrations on the p cnb removal as shown in fig 1d the p cnb removal efficiency was 66 4 61 7 and 56 6 at the initial p cnb concentrations of 50 100 and 150 mg l after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 8 h respectively the corresponding mineralization efficiency was 54 3 47 5 and 34 7 respectively previous researches had reported that the active sites would be occupied by concentrations of pollutant or its intermediates which affected the formation of radicals and reduced pollutant removal 34 compared to the absence of photoelectrocatalytic degradation the bod5 values of different p cnb concentrations obviously increased after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 8 h table s2 fig 1e showed the p cnb removal performance of combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process at different p cnb concentrations the average p cnb removal of the combined process could reach 74 6 69 7 and 63 6 at 50 100 and 150 mg l p cnb and the corresponding mineralization efficiency was 63 4 57 7 and 40 7 respectively the present results demonstrated that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation improved the biodegradability of p cnb which further improved the p cnb removal and mineralization efficiency in the combined degradation process 3 3 changes of microbial activity in bioreactors p cnb would inevitably cause adverse effects on the microbial activity in bioreactors due to its potential biotoxicity thus reducing the removal performance of pollutants sour was an important indicator for evaluating the microbial metabolic activity 35 as shown in fig 2a the sour of r0 r2 r5 and r8 was stable at about 36 0 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 5 the sour of r0 declined obviously from 36 5 to 26 9 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 10 indicating that p cnb inhibited the microbial metabolic activity in the single biodegradation process the sour of r0 declined with an increase in operational time which eventually stabilized at 18 8 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 25 however the sour of r2 r5 and r8 declined to 22 0 25 5 and 28 4 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 25 by contrast to that of r0 respectively according to our previous research p cnb was degraded into intermediate products with less toxicity after photoelectrocatalytic degradation 20 in the present study the sour of r2 r5 and r8 was obviously higher than r0 on days 5 25 which further confirmed that the intermediate products of p cnb after photoelectrocatalytic degradation were less than pure p cnb dha could catalyze the dehydrogenation process of organic pollutants which also usually used to evaluate the microbial activity under toxic substances stress 36 as shown in fig 2b the dha of four bioreactors was stable at about 16 0 mg tf g mlvss h on day 5 the dha of r0 declined obviously to 9 6 mg tf g mlvss h with an increase in operational time from 5 to 25 d however the inhibitory effects of dha were reduced in the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process after the photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 2 5 and 8 h the dha of r2 r5 and r8 declined to 10 3 11 4 and 12 7 mg tf g mlvss h on day 25 suggesting that photoelectrocatalytic degradation reduced the inhibition of p cnb on the dehydrogenase activity in bioreactors the photoelectrocatalytic degradation could decrease p cnb concentration and the toxicity of its intermediates which reduced the inhibition of p cnb on the microbial activity and improved the removal performance of pollutants 3 4 microbial toxicity response in bioreactors the presence of p cnb caused some inhibitory effects on the microbial activity in bioreactors to further evaluate the biotoxicity of p cnb to microorganisms in different bioreactors the ros production antioxidant enzyme activity and ldh release were investigated on days 5 10 15 and 20 ros was a kind of normal by products from microorganism metabolism which played crucial roles among various physiological activities 37 nevertheless the excessive ros production could destroy intracellular constituents and cause severe adverse effects on cellular activities 38 as shown in fig 3a ros production of r0 enhanced obviously to 158 7 on day 25 by contrast to that on day 5 indicating that the presence of p cnb stimulated the cells to generate higher ros levels the excessive ros would induce severe oxidative stress on microorganism which further inhibited the microbial activity sour dha etc in bioreactors 39 although the ros levels in r2 r5 and r8 exhibited the increasing trends with the increase of operational time the corresponding ros production of the three bioreactors was obviously lower than that of r0 the present results indicated that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation effectively declined the oxidative stress levels which further declined the inhibition of p cnb to microbial activity under normal conditions some antioxidative enzymes including sod and cat could catalyze the decomposition of reactive oxygen species and maintain the dynamic equilibrium of intracellular ros levels 40 as shown in fig 3b and c the sod and cat activities of r0 enhanced to 144 3 and 156 7 on day 25 by contrast to that on day 5 suggesting that the single p cnb biodegradation reactor exhibited a higher oxidative stress levels nevertheless sod and cat activities of r2 r5 and r8 were obviously lower than r0 under the same operational time which further confirmed that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation declined the oxidative stress levels in bioreactors compared to day 5 the ldh release of r0 increased obviously to 136 9 148 1 and 166 9 on day 10 15 and 25 respectively fig 3d the higher ldh levels suggested that p cnb damaged the integrity of cytomembrane in the single degradation reactors 41 although the ldh levels in r2 r5 and r8 exhibited the increasing trends with the increase of operational time the corresponding ldh release of the three bioreactors was obviously lower than that of r0 the changes of ros production antioxidant enzyme activity and ldh release demonstrated the photoelectrocatalytic degradation could reduce the biotoxicity of p cnb to microorganisms in bioreactors 3 5 changes of microbial community in bioreactors considering the biodegradation processes were closely associated with microbial community composition the microbial community in different bioreactors was compared on day 25 the rarefaction curves of all sludge samples tended to flatten toward the right indicating the sequencing depth was accurate and reasonable fig s3 42 as shown in table 1 the effective sequences of seed sludge s0 s2 s5 and s8 were classified to 1049 30 500 59 790 66 810 72 and 897 98 amplicon sequence variants asvs after dada2 denoise the good s coverage of the five samples were 1 000 demonstrating that all the microbial species were covered in the present sequencing fig 4 illustrated the box plots of alpha diversity index differences between groups the larger observed otus and chao1 indices indicated higher microbial richness while the larger shannon and simpson indices meant higher microbial diversity 43 compared to seed sludge the observed otus and chao1 indices of s0 declined from 1049 30 and 1052 30 to 500 59 and 500 59 p 0 05 and the shannon and simpson indices of s0 declined from 7 479 0 087 and 0 983 0 001 to 6 177 0 215 and 0 959 0 005 p 0 05 the results suggesting p cnb reduced the microbial richness and diversity during the single biodegradation process due to the high biotoxicity however the above indices increased obviously with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time in the combined degradation process the observed otus chao1 shannon and simpson indices of s8 were 897 98 901 98 7 146 0 493 and 0 971 0 014 p 0 05 which confirmed that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation reduced the inhibition of p cnb on microbial richness and diversity in subsequent biodegradation process the venn diagram could reflect the shared and unique asvs numbers which was used to analyze the changes of microbial similarity and difference under different treatment processes 44 as shown in fig 5 the shared asvs numbers were 551 among the five sludge samples accounting for 25 06 of total asvs 2199 the majority of common asvs was classified as proteobacteria 43 01 bacteroidota 23 59 chloroflexi 8 35 firmicutes 5 44 actinobacteriota 4 17 acidobacteriota 3 27 patescibacteria 2 54 planctomycetota 1 45 desulfobacterota 1 27 and verrucomicrobiota 1 09 the number of shared asvs between seed sludge and s0 was 685 whereas that between seed sludge and s2 s5 and s8 was 924 949 and 944 respectively the results indicated that the activated sludge samples after photoelectrocatalytic degradation were more similar to seed sludge the smaller distance between seed sludge and sludge samples after photoelectrocatalytic degradation in principal co ordinates analysis and non metric multi dimensional scaling further confirmed their higher similarity fig s4 45 46 it could be concluded photoelectrocatalytic degradation reduced effects of p cnb on the microbial community in the subsequent biological treatment process lefse analysis was performed to evaluate significant differences under phyla levels among different sludge samples as shown in fig 6a circles from inside to outside represented bacteria classification from kingdom to genera level and the homologous colors in each sample denoted bacteria taxa with significant difference according to statistically significant differences p 0 05 27 biomarkers for five samples were observed in the lda threshold of 3 8 including 3 phylum 4 class 5 order 7 family and 8 genera fig 6b the bacteroidota and firmicutes were enriched in s8 while proteobacteria was enriched in s0 the class gammaproteobacteria and bacilli were markedly enriched in s0 and s2 and clostridia and bacteroidia had significantly differential relative abundance in s8 the genera of significant differences exhibited relatively larger abundance top 32 among the five sludge samples the bdellovibrio and acinetobacter were identified as biomarkers in s0 of the single biodegradation process while flavobacterium and dokdonella were enriched in s8 of the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation the results suggested microbial community in bioreactor changed significantly after photoelectrocatalytic degradation by gb tnas photoelectrodes 47 fig 7 illustrated the microbial community composition of seed sludge s2 s5 and s8 at genus level the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in s0 reduced from 0 30 and 0 73 to 0 07 and 0 15 by contrast to seed sludge indicating that p cnb caused adverse effects to nitrifying bacteria in the single biodegradation process 48 compared to seed sludge the relative abundance of some denitrifying bacteria including dokdonella pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium in s0 declined from 1 83 1 08 and 0 48 to 1 23 0 90 and 0 32 respectively 49 50 the relative abundance of candidatus accumulibacter in s0 also declined from 0 23 to 0 05 by contrast to seed sludge which was known as the main polyphosphate accumulating organisms 51 the inhibitory effects of p cnb on the above mentioned bacteria could further reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus removal however the relative abundance of these bacteria exhibited some increase in s2 s5 and s8 which suggested the photoelectrocatalytic degradation reduced the inhibition of p cnb on these functional bacteria compared to seed sludge the relative abundance of terrimonas ferruginibacter trichococcus youngiibacter arenimonas kapabacteriales candidatus competibacter aeromonas and sphingobium in s0 declined from 2 77 2 53 0 67 0 54 0 54 0 47 0 24 0 25 and 1 17 to 1 05 0 84 0 26 0 42 0 36 0 13 0 13 0 12 and 0 49 respectively the relative abundance in s2 s5 and s8 increased after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 2 5 and 8 h in the combined degradation process it could be concluded that the coupled photoelectrocatalytic and biodegradation achieved higher p cnb removal as well as reducing the inhibition of p cnb on microbial community in the subsequent bioreactor 4 conclusions the coupled photoelectrocatalytic degradation and biodegradation exhibited higher p cnb removal efficiency owing to the improved biodegradability the sour and dha in single biodegradation bioreactor declined by 48 63 and 41 14 on day 25 indicating that p cnb inhibited microbial metabolic activity however photoelectrocatalytic degradation reduced the inhibition of p cnb on these microbial activity in bioreactors the changes of ros ldh sod and cat activity demonstrated that photoelectrocatalytic degradation declined the biotoxicity of p cnb to microorganism in coupled degradation process p cnb reduced microbial richness and diversity in single biodegradation process whereas it increased obviously with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time in the

single biodegradation bioreactor declined by 48 63 and 41 14 on day 25 indicating that p cnb inhibited the microbial metabolic activity however the photoelectrocatalytic degradation could effectively reduce the inhibition of p cnb on microbial activity of bioreactors the variations of microbial reactive oxygen species production antioxidant enzyme activity and lactate dehydrogenase release confirmed that photoelectrocatalytic degradation declined the biotoxicity of p cnb to the microorganisms in the coupled degradation process p cnb reduced the microbial richness and diversity in the single biodegradation process whereas they increased obviously with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time in the combined degradation process keywords p chloronitrobenzene photoelectrocatalytic degradation microbial activity reactive oxygen species microbial richness data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chloronitrobenzene cnb is a typical halogenated nitroaromatic compound which was widely used in manufacture of pesticides dyes pharmaceuticals antioxidants and other industrial chemicals 1 2 the extensive application and improper disposition of cnb would unavoidably result in its release to environment cnb can induce carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic effects to humans and animals which is listed as the priority controlled pollutants by many countries 3 5 considering the high toxicity bioaccumulation and recalcitrance of cnb it is urgent to develop an effective technology to remove cnb from water some researchers have proposed several approaches for cnb removal including adsorption 6 chemical oxidation 7 8 and biodegradation 9 10 although these methods exhibited various advantages they were still limited by several limitations the physical adsorption merely achieves the phase migration of cnb the chemical oxidation can consume plenty of chemicals and energy due to the strong electron withdrawing groups nitro and chloro 11 the biodegradation needs time consuming due to high biotoxicity and low biodegradability of cnb 12 recently the sequentially coupled chemical biological treatment technology was developed to eliminate the shortcomings of single physicochemical and biological treatment processes the application of fenton oxidation as a pre treatment increased the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater by contrast to the single biological treatment 13 the ozonation biological treatment processes improved the biodegradability and removal performance of wastewater containing chlorinated nitroaromatic compounds 14 the photoelectrocatalysis is regarded as a promising and green technology for the efficient degradation of persistent pollutants 15 16 among numerous photoelectrodes materials tio2 nanotube arrays tnas attracted extensive concerns owing to low cost non toxicity stability and high activity 17 however the low visible light utilization and high electron hole recombination limited its practical application the semiconductor coupling to construct heterojunction is considered to be an effective strategy to solve these defects 18 19 our previous researches also confirmed that biobr tio2 nanotube arrays b tnas and reduced graphene oxide biobr tnas gb tnas photoelectrodes could resolve the recycle of powdered catalysts and exhibited high efficiency visible light photoelectrocatalytic performance for p cnb 20 21 it was reported that photocatalysis was adopted as the pretreatment in coupled treatment processes for eliminating phenols 22 24 surfactants 25 herbicides 26 and other organic pollutants 27 28 although these researches detailed the potential of coupled photo electro catalysis and biodegradation the effects of photo electro catalytic effluents on subsequent microbial activity and microbial community were not clear the objects of the present study focused on a investigating p cnb removal in the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process b analyzing the changes of microbial activity in different bioreactors c evaluating the biotoxicity of p cnb to microorganisms in bioreactors and d analyzing the changes of microbial richness and diversity after photoelectrocatalytic degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of gb tnas photoelectrodes the gb tnas photoelectrodes

investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem and jem2100f transmission electron microscope tem the elemental composition has been analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 2 2 photoelectrocatalytic degradation of p cnb the single photoelectrocatalytic degradation of p cnb was performed in a cylindrical quartz reactor the inner diameter and height of photoelectrocatalytic reactor were 3 2 and 8 0 cm respectively the distance between gb tnas anode and pt foil cathode was maintained at 2 cm a dc power was adopted to output the voltage potential of 1 0 v the visible light was provided by a 300 w xenon lamp with uv cut off filter the reactor was firstly placed in dark for 60 min to reach adsorption equilibrium and then irradiated under visible light the p cnb solution in the reactor was continuously stirred by a magnetic stirrer during the whole reaction 2 3 synergic photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation of p cnb the synergic photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation of p cnb was operated intermittently the p cnb solutions were firstly degraded in the above mentioned photoelectrocatalytic reactor for 2 5 and 8 h and then entered the bioreactors for further degradation the bioreactors used in this study were graduated serum bottles with effective volume of 250 ml the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss in the bioreactors were maintained at approximately 4500 mg l the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactors was set as 12 h including 6 h aerobic period 4 h anoxic period and 2 h settling period an aeration pump was used to supply oxygen and the dissolved oxygen do concentration was approximately 2 0 mg l during the aerobic period the corresponding synergic degradation processes with different photoelectrocatalytic degradation time were marked as r2 r5 and r8 respectively the single biodegradation process was conducted by feeding wastewater containing p cnb into bioreactor directly which was marked as r0 the wastewater was manually configured using ultrapure water which contained an appropriate amount of inorganic salts and trace elements needed for microbial growth besides p cnb the changes of bod5 for p cnb solutions before and after photoelectrocatalytic degradation were measured to analyze p cnb biodegradability 2 4 analytical methods the p cnb concentration was investigated by high performance liquid chromatography the mobile phase was methanol water 70 30 with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and detection wavelength of 280 nm the total organic carbon toc was measured by toc analyzer the specific oxygen utilization rate sour and dehydrogenase activity dha were measured according to previous research 29 lactate dehydrogenase ldh reactive oxygen species ros catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod were measured with the corresponding cytotoxicity assay kit high throughput sequencing was adopted to investigate the microbial richness and diversity of samples in different bioreactors on day 25 linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse were conducted by hutlab galaxy web application http huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy to investigate potential biomarkers in every bioreactor the linear discriminant analysis lda score log10 3 8 was applied to estimate the magnitude of difference 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structure analysis of gb tnas photoelectrodes the sem and tem images revealed that gb tnas was formed by highly ordered nanotubes which were covered by some tiny floccules or flakes fig s1 these nanotubes exhibited hollow structure with inside diameter of approximately 150 nm the eds indicated that the elemental compositions of gb tnas were ti o bi br and c which were further confirmed by survey xps spectra fig s2 the characteristic peaks in high resolution bi 4f and br 3d spectra were corresponding to bi3 and br respectively indicating that biobr was deposited on the tnas surface 31 the peak at 458 72 ev in ti 2p spectra was attributed to ti 2p3 2 whereas the peak at 465 75 ev was assigned to the stacking of ti 2p1 2 464 45 ev and bi 4d3 2 466 17 ev 32 the characteristic peaks at 529 73 530 12 and 532 21 ev in o 1 s spectra were identified as bi o bonds ti o bonds and surface oh respectively 33 the sem tem and xps results demonstrated the successful synthesis of gb tnas photoelectrodes with tight biobr tio2 heterojunction 3 2 removal performance of p cnb 3 2 1 effects of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time on the p cnb removal fig 1a showed the p cnb 100 mg l removal after different photoelectrocatalytic degradation time by gb tnas photoelectrodes the p cnb removal efficiency was 21 2 45 4 and 61 7 after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 2 5 and 8 h respectively therefore the effluent of three photoelectrocatalytic reactors contained 78 8 mg l 54 6 mg l and 38 3 mg l p cnb as well as the corresponding intermediate products as illustrated in fig 1b p cnb removal efficiency was 30 after the single biodegradation since the p cnb was resistant to be biodegraded the small amount of p cnb was removed owing to the adsorption property of activated sludge during the preliminary experiment the removal efficiency of p cnb by activated sludge without domestication was obviously limited after adsorption equilibrium the average p cnb removal efficiency in the combined degradation process obviously increased from 50 3 to 70 1 with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time from 2 to 8 h compared to the single photoelectrocatalytic degradation the p cnb removal efficiency exhibited an increase of about 10 30 in the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process therefore we concluded that the combined degradation process played a synergistic effect by contrast with single biodegradation p cnb mineralization efficiency in the combined degradation process increased from 20 to 64 3 after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 8 h fig 1c the bod5 change of p cnb was investigated after different photoelectrocatalytic degradation time table s1 the low bod5 value 4 7 mg l of p cnb confirmed that it was refractory to be biodegraded the bod5 value increased from 19 0 to 43 3 mg l with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time from 2 to 8 h demonstrating that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation improved the biodegradability of p cnb the above results suggested that the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process played a synergistic effect due to the improved biodegradability of p cnb 3 2 2 effects of initial concentrations on the p cnb removal as shown in fig 1d the p cnb removal efficiency was 66 4 61 7 and 56 6 at the initial p cnb concentrations of 50 100 and 150 mg l after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 8 h respectively the corresponding mineralization efficiency was 54 3 47 5 and 34 7 respectively previous researches had reported that the active sites would be occupied by concentrations of pollutant or its intermediates which affected the formation of radicals and reduced pollutant removal 34 compared to the absence of photoelectrocatalytic degradation the bod5 values of different p cnb concentrations obviously increased after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 8 h table s2 fig 1e showed the p cnb removal performance of combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process at different p cnb concentrations the average p cnb removal of the combined process could reach 74 6 69 7 and 63 6 at 50 100 and 150 mg l p cnb and the corresponding mineralization efficiency was 63 4 57 7 and 40 7 respectively the present results demonstrated that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation improved the biodegradability of p cnb which further improved the p cnb removal and mineralization efficiency in the combined degradation process 3 3 changes of microbial activity in bioreactors p cnb would inevitably cause adverse effects on the microbial activity in bioreactors due to its potential biotoxicity thus reducing the removal performance of pollutants sour was an important indicator for evaluating the microbial metabolic activity 35 as shown in fig 2a the sour of r0 r2 r5 and r8 was stable at about 36 0 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 5 the sour of r0 declined obviously from 36 5 to 26 9 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 10 indicating that p cnb inhibited the microbial metabolic activity in the single biodegradation process the sour of r0 declined with an increase in operational time which eventually stabilized at 18 8 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 25 however the sour of r2 r5 and r8 declined to 22 0 25 5 and 28 4 mg o2 g mlvss h on day 25 by contrast to that of r0 respectively according to our previous research p cnb was degraded into intermediate products with less toxicity after photoelectrocatalytic degradation 20 in the present study the sour of r2 r5 and r8 was obviously higher than r0 on days 5 25 which further confirmed that the intermediate products of p cnb after photoelectrocatalytic degradation were less than pure p cnb dha could catalyze the dehydrogenation process of organic pollutants which also usually used to evaluate the microbial activity under toxic substances stress 36 as shown in fig 2b the dha of four bioreactors was stable at about 16 0 mg tf g mlvss h on day 5 the dha of r0 declined obviously to 9 6 mg tf g mlvss h with an increase in operational time from 5 to 25 d however the inhibitory effects of dha were reduced in the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation process after the photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 2 5 and 8 h the dha of r2 r5 and r8 declined to 10 3 11 4 and 12 7 mg tf g mlvss h on day 25 suggesting that photoelectrocatalytic degradation reduced the inhibition of p cnb on the dehydrogenase activity in bioreactors the photoelectrocatalytic degradation could decrease p cnb concentration and the toxicity of its intermediates which reduced the inhibition of p cnb on the microbial activity and improved the removal performance of pollutants 3 4 microbial toxicity response in bioreactors the presence of p cnb caused some inhibitory effects on the microbial activity in bioreactors to further evaluate the biotoxicity of p cnb to microorganisms in different bioreactors the ros production antioxidant enzyme activity and ldh release were investigated on days 5 10 15 and 20 ros was a kind of normal by products from microorganism metabolism which played crucial roles among various physiological activities 37 nevertheless the excessive ros production could destroy intracellular constituents and cause severe adverse effects on cellular activities 38 as shown in fig 3a ros production of r0 enhanced obviously to 158 7 on day 25 by contrast to that on day 5 indicating that the presence of p cnb stimulated the cells to generate higher ros levels the excessive ros would induce severe oxidative stress on microorganism which further inhibited the microbial activity sour dha etc in bioreactors 39 although the ros levels in r2 r5 and r8 exhibited the increasing trends with the increase of operational time the corresponding ros production of the three bioreactors was obviously lower than that of r0 the present results indicated that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation effectively declined the oxidative stress levels which further declined the inhibition of p cnb to microbial activity under normal conditions some antioxidative enzymes including sod and cat could catalyze the decomposition of reactive oxygen species and maintain the dynamic equilibrium of intracellular ros levels 40 as shown in fig 3b and c the sod and cat activities of r0 enhanced to 144 3 and 156 7 on day 25 by contrast to that on day 5 suggesting that the single p cnb biodegradation reactor exhibited a higher oxidative stress levels nevertheless sod and cat activities of r2 r5 and r8 were obviously lower than r0 under the same operational time which further confirmed that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation declined the oxidative stress levels in bioreactors compared to day 5 the ldh release of r0 increased obviously to 136 9 148 1 and 166 9 on day 10 15 and 25 respectively fig 3d the higher ldh levels suggested that p cnb damaged the integrity of cytomembrane in the single degradation reactors 41 although the ldh levels in r2 r5 and r8 exhibited the increasing trends with the increase of operational time the corresponding ldh release of the three bioreactors was obviously lower than that of r0 the changes of ros production antioxidant enzyme activity and ldh release demonstrated the photoelectrocatalytic degradation could reduce the biotoxicity of p cnb to microorganisms in bioreactors 3 5 changes of microbial community in bioreactors considering the biodegradation processes were closely associated with microbial community composition the microbial community in different bioreactors was compared on day 25 the rarefaction curves of all sludge samples tended to flatten toward the right indicating the sequencing depth was accurate and reasonable fig s3 42 as shown in table 1 the effective sequences of seed sludge s0 s2 s5 and s8 were classified to 1049 30 500 59 790 66 810 72 and 897 98 amplicon sequence variants asvs after dada2 denoise the good s coverage of the five samples were 1 000 demonstrating

reduced the microbial richness and diversity during the single biodegradation process due to the high biotoxicity however the above indices increased obviously with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time in the combined degradation process the observed otus chao1 shannon and simpson indices of s8 were 897 98 901 98 7 146 0 493 and 0 971 0 014 p 0 05 which confirmed that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation reduced the inhibition of p cnb on microbial richness and diversity in subsequent biodegradation process the venn diagram could reflect the shared

sludge and s2 s5 and s8 was 924 949 and 944 respectively the results indicated that the activated sludge samples after photoelectrocatalytic degradation were more similar to seed sludge the smaller distance between seed sludge and sludge samples after photoelectrocatalytic degradation in principal co ordinates analysis and non metric multi dimensional scaling further confirmed their higher

observed in the lda threshold of 3 8 including 3 phylum 4 class 5 order 7 family and 8 genera fig 6b the bacteroidota and firmicutes were enriched in s8 while proteobacteria was enriched in s0 the class gammaproteobacteria and bacilli were markedly enriched in s0 and s2 and clostridia and bacteroidia had significantly differential relative abundance in s8 the genera of significant differences exhibited relatively larger abundance top 32 among the five sludge samples the bdellovibrio and acinetobacter were identified as biomarkers in s0 of the single biodegradation process while flavobacterium and dokdonella were enriched in s8 of the combined photoelectrocatalytic and biological degradation the results suggested microbial community in bioreactor changed significantly after photoelectrocatalytic degradation by gb tnas photoelectrodes 47 fig 7 illustrated the microbial community composition of seed sludge s2 s5 and s8 at genus level the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira in s0 reduced from 0 30 and 0 73 to 0 07 and 0 15 by contrast to seed sludge indicating that p cnb caused adverse effects to nitrifying bacteria in the single biodegradation process 48 compared to seed sludge the relative abundance of some denitrifying bacteria including dokdonella pseudomonas and hyphomicrobium in s0 declined from 1 83 1 08 and 0 48 to 1 23 0 90 and 0 32 respectively 49 50 the relative abundance of candidatus accumulibacter in s0 also declined from 0 23 to 0 05 by contrast to seed sludge which was known as the main polyphosphate accumulating organisms 51 the inhibitory effects of p cnb on the above mentioned bacteria could further reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus removal however the relative abundance of these bacteria exhibited some increase in s2 s5 and s8 which suggested the photoelectrocatalytic degradation reduced the inhibition of p cnb on these functional bacteria compared to seed sludge the relative abundance of terrimonas ferruginibacter trichococcus youngiibacter arenimonas kapabacteriales candidatus competibacter aeromonas and sphingobium in s0 declined from 2 77 2 53 0 67 0 54 0 54 0 47 0 24 0 25 and 1 17 to 1 05 0 84 0 26 0 42 0 36 0 13 0 13 0 12 and 0 49 respectively the relative abundance in s2 s5 and s8 increased after photoelectrocatalytic degradation for 2 5 and 8 h in the combined degradation process it could be concluded that the coupled photoelectrocatalytic and biodegradation achieved higher p cnb removal as well as reducing the inhibition of p cnb on microbial community in the subsequent bioreactor 4 conclusions the coupled photoelectrocatalytic degradation and biodegradation exhibited higher p cnb removal efficiency owing to the improved biodegradability the sour and dha in single biodegradation bioreactor declined by 48 63 and 41 14 on day 25 indicating that p cnb inhibited microbial metabolic activity however photoelectrocatalytic degradation reduced the inhibition of p cnb on these microbial activity in bioreactors the changes of ros ldh sod and cat activity demonstrated that photoelectrocatalytic degradation declined the biotoxicity of p cnb to microorganism in coupled degradation process p cnb reduced microbial richness and diversity in single biodegradation process whereas it increased obviously with the increase of photoelectrocatalytic degradation time in the
