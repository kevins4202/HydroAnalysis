22170,marine risers are the main transportation channels of offshore oil and gas from the wellheads to the floating platforms in mixed oil and gas transportation natural gas hydrates are produced at low temperatures and high pressures which makes the multiphase internal flow quite complex in order to explore the effects of multiphase internal flows considering hydrate phase transitions on the streamwise oscillation of marine risers a numerical multiphase internal flow model considering hydrate phase transitions is established where the flow parameters are solved with the finite difference method subsequently based on the virtual work principle a non linear vibration equation for marine risers is deduced the parameters of the multiphase internal flow are introduced and solved numerically with the finite element method the results show that the gas pressure and density decrease and the gas velocity and acceleration increase from the riser inlet to the outlet due to gas expansion and the hydrate phase transitions the natural frequencies of the riser increase with an increase of gas intake and the changing trends at higher modes are more obvious under current excitation the amplitude envelope of the riser decreases with an increase of gas intake under wave excitation the gas intake has little effect on the vibration frequency of the riser however when gas intake changes the natural frequency of the riser changes which leads to a change of the resonance amplification coefficient thus affecting the vibration amplitude of the riser keywords vertical risers multiphase internal flows hydrate phase transitions streamwise oscillation 1 introduction marine risers are important equipment for deep water oil and gas exploration and development their upper ends are controlled by the top tension provided by the floating platform and their lower ends are connected with the wellhead of the seabed during a marine riser s service period a high pressure oil flow passes through its interior and external environmental loads such as waves and currents act upon it hence the dynamic response of a top tension riser is very complex at present research on the dynamic response of a top tension riser mainly focuses on the environmental load and top excitation khan et al 2011 conducted a numerical analysis of the force acting on a riser under random ocean loads and identified the effects of current velocity long term drift oscillations and nonlinearities on the bending stress lou and yu 2014 studied the dynamic response of a riser under the combined excitation of internal waves and ocean currents under the excitation of a background current the displacement of the riser will increase significantly in the case of a forward internal wave and a countercurrent lei et al 2017 studied the dynamic response of marine risers under combined axial and transverse excitation through a nonlinear coupled model it was found that especially when the variable tension was located in the classical parametric resonance region the transverse response of the risers could be significantly increased by the axial excitation thereby increasing the bending stress yin et al 2019 studied the influence of ship motion on the top tension riser through experiments and numerical simulations their results showed that the dynamic response of the riser is affected by both the ship s motion and vortex induced vibrations for deep water risers the internal flow has received considerable attention for its effect on the dynamic characteristics and vibration response of risers in recent years guo et al 2004 studied the effects of external conditions and the internal flow on the vortex induced vibration of risers their results showed that when the natural frequency of the riser is close to the vortex shedding frequency the internal flow velocity has a greater impact on the response of the vortex induced vibration kaewunruen et al 2005 investigated nonlinear free vibrations of marine risers pipes transporting fluids and their results showed that the internal flows clearly reduced the degree of hardening and tended to turn the riser s vibration type from a hardening phase to a softening one monprapussorn et al 2007 studied the effects of a pulsating flow on the large deformation of flexible risers it was found that the pulsating acceleration of the internal flow would reposition the vibrational balancing position of the riser and the fluctuations of the pulsating flow increased the amplitude and decreased the vibration frequency of the riser guo and lou 2008 carried out experiments in still water and water flows to study the effect of the internal flow on the vortex induced vibrations their experimental results showed that with an increase of the internal flow velocity the response amplitude increased and the vibration frequency decreased meng and chen 2012 proposed a model formulation that considered internal flow and drew the conclusion that the effect of internal fluid velocities on the nonlinear dynamics of riser is significant dai et al 2013 examined the vortex induced vibrations of a pipe transporting a fluid by considering the internal fluid velocities montoya hernandez and vazquez hernandez 2014 calculated the natural frequencies of coupled vertical risers with a hydrodynamic model that considered multiphase internal flows consisting of oil gas and water zhang et al 2015a investigated the axial and transverse coupled vibration law of a deep water top tensioned riser under the combined effects of the internal fluid flow external waves and current loads their results showed that the vibration of the riser is insensitive to changes of the internal flow velocity wang et al 2018 conducted pressure experiments of to identify the effects of the void fraction and elastic foundation on the natural structural characteristics of marine risers yang et al 2019 established a vortex induced vibration prediction model of a flexible riser conveying a two phase flow and they found that an increase in the gas fraction leads to a linear increase in the natural frequencies and a wider synchronization region manuel cabrera miranda and paik 2019 investigated the nonlinear planar vibrations of a steel lazy wave riser excited by a slug flow and constructed frequency response curves for the curvature effective tension fatigue damage and usage factor according to the reported literature above most studies of the dynamic characteristics and responses of marine risers that considered internal flows have focused on uniform flows and slug flows and to our knowledge no literature has investigated the effect of a multiphase internal flow containing hydrate phase transitions on the streamwise oscillation of marine risers in mixed oil and gas transportation there are always multiphase fluids such as crude oil natural gas and water in the riser because of the low temperatures and high pressures in the riser natural gas and water will produce natural gas hydrates as the internal fluid flow is upward the natural gas hydrates will decompose into natural gas after leaving the stable region the hydrate phase transitions will affect the flow characteristics of the multiphase internal flow thus making the dynamic response of the riser more complex generally speaking the streamwise oscillation and transverse vortex induced vibration are usually analyzed separately jauvtis and williamson 2003 kocabiyik and bozkaya 2015 this paper is organized as follows first a numerical multiphase internal flow model by considering hydrate phase transitions is established in section 2 then the flow parameters are solved with the finite difference method subsequently the parameters of the multiphase internal flow are introduced into the non linear vibration equation in section 3 finally the effect of the multiphase flow in terms of hydrate phase transitions on the streamwise oscillation of marine risers is discussed in section 4 2 numerical model of multiphase internal flow multiphase internal flow is a multiple phase and multiple component mixing system that arises due to hydrate phase transitions in this work a numerical model of multiphase internal flow that considers hydrate phase transitions is presented 2 1 phase transition model of natural gas hydrates 1 phase equilibrium model the chen guo model is based on statistical thermodynamics theory which has good accuracy and wide applicability and easily converges to a solution hence the chen guo

due to the complexity of the multiphase flow model it is impossible to derive an accurate analytical solution rather only a numerical solution can be obtained in order to ensure convergence and computational speed the governing equations were discretized with a four point difference scheme and the discrete scheme is expressed as follows 9 1 f w y j 1 n y j n f w y j 1 n 1 y j n 1 δ z 2 δ t x

factor where f w 0 5 for central time approximation and f w 1 for full implicit approximation because the full implicit approximation can give a more stable solution the difference scheme in this paper adopts the full implicit scheme the scheme can then be solved iteratively using a forecast correction method here we assume that at time n the parameters for any two nodes j and j 1 in the riser are known let us take nodes j and j 1 from time n to n 1 as an example the solution process is shown in fig 3 through the above steps the parameters of all nodes at time n 1 can be calculated and according to the boundary conditions at time n 2 the parameters at time n 2 can be obtained similarly the flow parameters at all times can be calculated 2 4 definite conditions 1 definite conditions

where ε 0 is the initial deformation of the riser s element and d s 0 is the initial differential arc length of the riser s element the curvature of the riser s element is given in eq 15 15 κ u 1 u 2 2 3 u s 3 in this paper the vibration equation of the riser is established based on the principle of virtual work according to this principle the total deformation energy produced by the virtual work done by the internal force is equal to the total virtual work done by all external forces as shown in eq 16 16 δ π δ u δ w 0 where π is the total energy u is the total strain energy of the system and w is the total virtual work done by the external forces 3 1 1 strain energy for marine risers in deep water shear deformation and torsional deformation are small enough to be ignored the axial deformation and bending deformation of the riser are thus mainly considered when building the vibration equation athisakul et al 2011 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015b 1 axial strain energy the axial strain of the riser is mainly caused by the axial tension and the fluid pressure difference inside and outside the riser chucheepsakul et al 2003 therefore the axial strain energy of the riser is given as eq 17 17 u a 0 s 1 2 e a ε 2 d s 0 s σ o v a ε d s where e is the elastic modulus and σ o v is the stress arising from hydrostatic pressure caused by the poisson effect as shown in eq 18 18 σ

riser respectively the variational formula of the axial strain energy is shown in eq 19 19 δ u a 0 l t e u δ u d z further t e can be calculated by eq 20 20 t e ea ε 2 v p e a e sgn h z p i a i where sgn x 0 x 0 1 x 0 2 bending strain energy according to the modified lagrange formula the bending strain energy of riser is as given in eq 21 21 u b 0 s 1 2 e i κ 2 d s 0 l 1 2 e i κ 2 s d z where i is

s 5 d z 3 1 2 virtual work caused by an external force when a marine riser vibrates in its equilibrium position in the marine environment the virtual work caused by external forces includes not only its own gravity but also structural resistance inertial force and hydrodynamic force 1 virtual work done by effective gravity the effective gravity per unit length riser is shown in eq 23 23 ω g ρ r a ρ i a i ρ e a e g the variational formula of the virtual work caused by effective gravity is given in eq 24 24 δ w g 0 l ω g s δ ω d z where ρ r ρ i and ρ e represent the density of the riser internal and external fluids respectively and ω is the vertical displacement of the riser 2 virtual work done by structural resistance the structural resistance of the riser is shown in eq 25 25 f c 0 s c u d

done by hydrodynamic forces the external diameter ratio of the top tension riser to the wavelength ratio is very small and the existence of the riser does not affect the external flow field the commonly used method for solving the hydrodynamic forces on small scale cylinders is the morison equation therefore the hydrodynamic forces on a unit length riser is shown in eq 27 27 f l 1 2 ρ c d u

paper in the process of solving the vibration equation of riser in this paper there is a nonlinear term related to the large deformation of the riser at present the direct integral solution of the structural dynamics can be divided into an explicit integral method and an implicit integral method the central difference method is usually used in dynamic analyses however the central difference method is a conditional stable algorithm where the time step length must be less than a certain critical value otherwise the calculation results can easily be distorted for marine deep water risers and for problems with large response time scales an implicit algorithm with unconditional stability is usually used deep water risers are long flexible pipes that are prone to large deformations and non linear deformations under marine environmental loads the newmark β method is an implicit direct integration algorithm which is unconditionally stable it can use large time steps in the calculation process so it is especially suitable for the transient response analysis of a riser system with a long time history therefore the newmark β method was used here to solve the dynamic response of a marine riser under a multiphase internal flow to ensure the accuracy and stability of the integration the integration constants used are α 1 4 δ 1 2 and the solution process is shown in fig 5 3 3 program verification according to the established numerical model of the multiphase internal flow and the vibration equation of the marine riser the drcm m program was developed based on matlab further this program was validated by calculating the internal pressure and natural frequency with the parameters given by montoya hernandez and vazquez hernandez 2014 the parameters of the multiphase internal flow are shown in table 1 and the parameters of the dynamic analysis of the risers are shown in table 2 the results of this program were then compared with data in the literature fig 6 a shows that the internal pressure predicted by the internal flow analysis model in this paper is in good agreement with that predicted in the literature and the maximum error is less than 4 4 the reason for the small error is that the influence of the hydrate phase transition on the pressure is taken into account in our internal flow model hence the predicted internal pressure is smaller due to us considering hydrate phase transitions fig 6b shows that the calculated results of the first to fifth order natural frequencies of the risers from the proposed dynamic model and the model in the literature are basically the same and the maximum error is less than 2 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the flow parameters of the multiphase internal flow the multiphase internal flow containing hydrate phase transitions was modelled as a multiphase and multicomponent mixing system in this part the hydrate phase transition region and the multiphase internal flow parameters with different gas intake ratios are obtained with the parameters given in table 3 because the density of natural gas is determined by its temperature and pressure the density is calculated as follows 36 ρ g 3486 6 p ρ g s z t where ρ g s is the relative density of natural gas where the composition of natural gas only includes methane in this paper ρ g s 0 5548 and z is the compression factor of natural gas dimensionless fig 7 a shows the internal temperature and phase equilibrium temperature under different gas intake ratios the intersection point between the internal temperature curve and the phase equilibrium curve is the critical point of the hydrate phase transition below this critical point the hydrate is in the formation region above the critical point the hydrate is in the decomposition region fig 7b displays the heat produced by friction between the internal flow and the wall the hydrate phase transition and the heat transfer between the internal flow and the external seawater when the gas intake ratio is 20 it can be seen that the internal temperature is mainly affected by the heat transfer from the external seawater while the hydrate phase transition and the friction between the internal flow and the wall have little influence on the internal temperature assuming that the inlet temperature of the internal flow is 10 c the internal temperature decreases when the external seawater temperature is lower than the internal temperature reaching the lowest value at 900 m below the water s surface the inlet temperature then rises with the rapid increase of the sea water temperature near the water s surface reaching a maximum at the outlet it can be seen from fig 7a that the outlet temperature at gas intake ratios of 10 20 30 and 40 are 17 97 c 17 43 c 17 04 c and 16 67 c respectively that is to say when the inlet temperature is the same the higher the gas intake ratio the lower the outlet temperature this is because as the gas intake ratio increases the internal flow velocity increases see fig 7c resulting in a decrease in the heat transfer time at the same time an increase of the gas volume fraction decreases the specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the internal flow both of which reduce the heat transfer between the internal flow and the external sea water therefore at the same inlet temperature the temperature of a lower gas intake ratio is closer to the ambient temperature fig 7c f shows the changes of the velocity acceleration density and pressure respectively at different gas intake ratios as the fluid flows upward the expansion of the gas and the decomposition of the hydrate increase the gas volume fraction the mixed phase velocity and the acceleration while the density decreases the low density causes the gravity pressure to decrease while the high velocity caused by the high gas intake ratio increases the frictional pressure drop rate but the effect of the gravity pressure drop is much greater than the frictional pressure drop resulting in a net decrease in the total pressure drop when the riser outlet pressure remains unchanged the overall internal pressure decreases therefore the phase equilibrium curve shifts to the left and the hydrate formation region descends in depth at the same time it can be observed that the formation of the hydrates consumes gas and slows down the change of the flow parameters caused by gas expansion in the hydrate decomposition region gas generated by hydrate decomposition accelerates the changes of the multiphase flow parameters especially near the water s surface according to the above discussion the flow parameters such as the velocity acceleration density and pressure constantly change in the upward flow changes in the flow parameters will affect the stiffness matrix mass matrix and damping matrix in the discrete vibration differential equation of the riser in the next section the effect of the multiphase internal flow on the dynamic characteristics and response of the riser will be further discussed based on the calculated results given in this section 4 2 effect of the gas intake ratio on the dynamic characteristics of the riser fig 8 a d are the first fifth tenth and fifteenth order natural frequencies of the riser for constant flow velocities v 0 m s and v 0 79 m s and gas intake ratios 10 20 30 and 40 when the internal flow is purely liquid and the velocity is constant v 0 m s and v 0 79 m s the first fifth tenth and fifteenth order natural frequencies decrease with an increase of the internal flow velocity however when the velocity increment is small the natural frequency of the riser decreases slightly which is consistent with the conclusions of montoya hernandez and vazquez hernandez 2014 when the fluid in the riser is a multiphase flow arising from the hydrate phase transitions the natural frequencies of the riser at different gas intake ratios were obtained based on the calculated results of the internal flow parameters presented in section 4 1 the results show that the natural frequencies of risers in the first fifth tenth and fifteenth modes increase with an increase of the gas intake ratio the natural frequencies of different modes show similar regularity with an increase of air volume but the trend of increasing natural frequencies with an increase of the gas intake ratio is more obvious in the higher modes according to the results given in section 4 1 the presence of gas will increase the velocity of the internal flow causing the natural frequency to decrease however the presence of gas simultaneously causes the pressure density and acceleration to increase resulting in an increase in the natural frequency so when the fluid in the riser is a multiphase flow arising from hydrate phase transitions the natural vibration frequency of the riser generally shows an increasing trend with an increase of the gas intake ratio 4 3 effects of gas intake on the dynamic response of the riser during its service life the dynamic response of a riser is affected by both the marine environment and its internal flow in order to study the dynamic response of a marine riser under a multiphase internal flow and environmental excitation two cases are considered in this paper the environmental load parameters are shown in table 4 and the other calculation parameters are shown in table 3 fig 9 a c shows the amplitude envelope of the riser under a uniform excitation flow of 0 1 m s 0 3 m s and 0 5 m s respectively from these figures it can be observed that the effect of the current velocity on the amplitude envelope of the riser is significant under the same gas intake ratio when the current velocity is 0 1 m s 0 3 m s and 0 5 m s the maximum amplitude of the riser is 0 2897 m 2 6077 mm and 7 2437 m respectively when the current velocity is constant the amplitude envelope decreases with an increase of gas intake the maximum amplitude of the riser decreases by 0 0055 m 0 0496 m and 0 1379 m respectively when the gas intake ratio increases from 0 to 40 for current velocities of 0 1 m s 0 3 m s and 0 5 m s this is because the increase of gas intake ratio increases the velocity and acceleration of the internal flow decreases the density and pressure and then increases the rigidity of the riser under the same external load the amplitude of the riser decreases fig 10 a c shows the amplitude envelopes of the riser at different gas intake ratios under wave excitations from a 3 m high wave and 6 8 and 10 s wave periods respectively fig 10c shows that the amplitude envelope decreases with an increase of the gas intake ratio meanwhile in fig 10a and b when the riser is excited by a wave with a height of 3 m and periods of 8 s and 6 s respectively the opposite behaviour to that seen in fig 10c whereby the amplitude envelope increases with an increase of gas intake when comparing fig 10b with fig 10c the riser has a larger amplitude at a wave period of 10 s than that at 8 s because the former wave period is very near the third order natural frequency of the riser and hence the riser resonates as the gas intake ratio increases from 0 to 40 the third order natural frequency of the riser increases from 0 1092 hz to 0 1127 hz gradually deviating from the resonance region and the amplitude decreases when the wave period is 8 s as the gas intake ratio increases the third order natural frequency of the riser increases gradually toward the resonance region and the amplitude increases furthermore the effect of the gas intake ratio on the vibration frequency under the wave parameters h w 3 m and t w 6 s was studied with a spectral analysis which was applied to the time series of the dynamic forces fig 11 a c shows the spanwise distribution of the power spectral density in the frequency domain for gas intake ratios of 0 20 and 40 respectively which show that there is a single frequency of 0 16 hz excited by the waves at different gas intake ratios that dominates the oscillations along the riser s span this is because when the structural response is stable the influence of the current on the streamwise oscillation is a static load which only causes an offset to the riser and the streamwise dynamic response of the riser is only caused by waves so only one response frequency corresponding to the wave period appears it can be seen from fig 11a c that the frequency and peak of the wave induced structural response do not change significantly with an increase of the gas intake ratio 5 conclusions in this paper a numerical multiphase internal flow model that considers hydrate phase transitions was established the multiphase internal flow that includes oil gas water and hydrates was regarded as a pseudo single phase mixture and the velocity acceleration density and pressure were solved using the finite difference method then based on the virtual work principle and variational principle a non linear vibration equation of the riser was established the parameters of the multiphase internal flow were introduced and solved numerically using the finite element method the dynamic response of the riser to the multiphase internal flow consisting of hydrate phase transitions currents and wave excitations was discussed and the effects of the gas intake on the dynamic characteristics and response of the riser were studied the following conclusions are drawn 1 from the riser s inlet to its outlet the pressure and density of the internal flow decrease while the velocity and acceleration increase in the hydrate formation region because the formation of hydrates consumes gas the flow parameters changed slowly in the hydrate decomposition region the decomposition of the hydrates increases the gas volume fraction and accelerates the changing trend of the flow parameters at the same time the pressure and density of the internal flow decrease while the velocity and acceleration increase with an increase of gas intake 2 the natural frequency of the riser decreases with an increase of the internal flow velocity but an increase of gas intake also changes other flow parameters including the acceleration pressure and density which result in an increase of the natural frequency of the riser with the increase of gas intake where the changing trend is more obvious in higher modes 3 the stiffness of the riser increases with an increase of gas intake so the amplitude envelope of the riser decreases with an increase of gas intake under current excitation under the excitation of waves the gas intake has no obvious effect on the vibration frequency of the riser for the riser s amplitude a change of the gas intake will cause a change of the natural vibration frequency of the riser which will cause the resonance amplification factor to change thus affecting the vibration amplitude author contributions section min lou contributed significantly to the conception and the analysis

22170,marine risers are the main transportation channels of offshore oil and gas from the wellheads to the floating platforms in mixed oil and gas transportation natural gas hydrates are produced at low temperatures and high pressures which makes the multiphase internal flow quite complex in order to explore the effects of multiphase internal flows considering hydrate phase transitions on the streamwise oscillation of marine risers a numerical multiphase internal flow model considering hydrate phase transitions is established where the flow parameters are solved with the finite difference method subsequently based on the virtual work principle a non linear vibration equation for marine risers is deduced the parameters of the multiphase internal flow are introduced and solved numerically with the finite element method the results show that the gas pressure and density decrease and the gas velocity and acceleration increase from the riser inlet to the outlet due to gas expansion and the hydrate phase transitions the natural frequencies of the riser increase with an increase of gas intake and the changing trends at higher modes are more obvious under current excitation the amplitude envelope of the riser decreases with an increase of gas intake under wave excitation the gas intake has little effect on the vibration frequency of the riser however when gas intake changes the natural frequency of the riser changes which leads to a change of the resonance amplification coefficient thus affecting the vibration amplitude of the riser keywords vertical risers multiphase internal flows hydrate phase transitions streamwise oscillation 1 introduction marine risers are important equipment for deep water oil and gas exploration and development their upper ends are controlled by the top tension provided by the floating platform and their lower ends are connected with the wellhead of the seabed during a marine riser s service period a high pressure oil flow passes through its interior and external environmental loads such as waves and currents act upon it hence the dynamic response of a top tension riser is very complex at present research on the dynamic response of a top tension riser mainly focuses on the environmental load and top excitation khan et al 2011 conducted a numerical analysis of the force acting on a riser under random ocean loads and identified the effects of current velocity long term drift oscillations and nonlinearities on the bending stress lou and yu 2014 studied the dynamic response of a riser under the combined excitation of internal waves and ocean currents under the excitation of a background current the displacement of the riser will increase significantly in the case of a forward internal wave and a countercurrent lei et al 2017 studied the dynamic response of marine risers under combined axial and transverse excitation through a nonlinear coupled model it was found that especially when the variable tension was located in the classical parametric resonance region the transverse response of the risers could be significantly increased by the axial excitation thereby increasing the bending stress yin et al 2019 studied the influence of ship motion on the top tension riser through experiments and numerical simulations their results showed that the dynamic response of the riser is affected by both the ship s motion and vortex induced vibrations for deep water risers the internal flow has received considerable attention for its effect on the dynamic characteristics and vibration response of risers in recent years guo et al 2004 studied the effects of external conditions and the internal flow on the vortex induced vibration of risers their results showed that when the natural frequency of the riser is close to the vortex shedding frequency the internal flow velocity has a greater impact on the response of the vortex induced vibration kaewunruen et al 2005 investigated nonlinear free vibrations of marine risers pipes transporting fluids and their results showed that the internal flows clearly reduced the degree of hardening and tended to turn the riser s vibration type from a hardening phase to a softening one monprapussorn et al 2007 studied the effects of a pulsating flow on the large deformation of flexible risers it was found that the pulsating acceleration of the internal flow would reposition the vibrational balancing position of the riser and the fluctuations of the pulsating flow increased the amplitude and decreased the vibration frequency of the riser guo and lou 2008 carried out experiments in still water and water flows to study the effect of the internal flow on the vortex induced vibrations their experimental results showed that with an increase of the internal flow velocity the response amplitude increased and the vibration frequency decreased meng and chen 2012 proposed a model formulation that considered internal flow and drew the conclusion that the effect of internal fluid velocities on the nonlinear dynamics of riser is significant dai et al 2013 examined the vortex induced vibrations of a pipe transporting a fluid by considering the internal fluid velocities montoya hernandez and vazquez hernandez 2014 calculated the natural frequencies of coupled vertical risers with a hydrodynamic model that considered multiphase internal flows consisting of oil gas and water zhang et al 2015a investigated the axial and transverse coupled vibration law of a deep water top tensioned riser under the combined effects of the internal fluid flow external waves and current loads their results showed that the vibration of the riser is insensitive to changes of the internal flow velocity wang et al 2018 conducted pressure experiments of to identify the effects of the void fraction and elastic foundation on the natural structural characteristics of marine risers yang et al 2019 established a vortex induced vibration prediction model of a flexible riser conveying a two phase flow and they found that an increase in the gas fraction leads to a linear increase in the natural frequencies and a wider synchronization region manuel cabrera miranda and paik 2019 investigated the nonlinear planar vibrations of a steel lazy wave riser excited by a slug flow and constructed frequency response curves for the curvature effective tension fatigue damage and usage factor according to the reported literature above most studies of the dynamic characteristics and responses of marine risers that considered internal flows have focused on uniform flows and slug flows and to our knowledge no literature has investigated the effect of a multiphase internal flow containing hydrate phase transitions on the streamwise oscillation of marine risers in mixed oil and gas transportation there are always multiphase fluids such as crude oil natural gas and water in the riser because of the low temperatures and high pressures in the riser natural gas and water will produce natural gas hydrates as the internal fluid flow is upward the natural gas hydrates will decompose into natural gas after leaving the stable region the hydrate phase transitions will affect the flow characteristics of the multiphase internal flow thus making the dynamic response of the riser more complex generally speaking the streamwise oscillation and transverse vortex induced vibration are usually analyzed separately jauvtis and williamson 2003 kocabiyik and bozkaya 2015 this paper is organized as follows first a numerical multiphase internal flow model by considering hydrate phase transitions is established in section 2 then the flow parameters are solved with the finite difference method subsequently the parameters of the multiphase internal flow are introduced into the non linear vibration equation in section 3 finally the effect of the multiphase flow in terms of hydrate phase transitions on the streamwise oscillation of marine risers is discussed in section 4 2 numerical model of multiphase internal flow multiphase internal flow is a multiple phase and multiple component mixing system that arises due to hydrate phase transitions in this work a numerical model of multiphase internal flow that considers hydrate phase transitions is presented 2 1 phase transition model of natural gas

due to the complexity of the multiphase flow model it is impossible to derive an accurate analytical solution rather only a numerical solution can be obtained in order to ensure convergence and computational speed the governing equations were discretized with a four point difference scheme and the discrete scheme is expressed as follows 9 1 f w y j 1 n y j n f w y j 1 n 1 y j n 1 δ z 2 δ t x

factor where f w 0 5 for central time approximation and f w 1 for full implicit approximation because the full implicit approximation can give a more stable solution the difference scheme in this paper adopts the full implicit scheme the scheme can then be solved iteratively using a forecast correction method here we assume that at time n the parameters for any two nodes j and j 1 in the riser are known let us take nodes j and j 1 from time n to n 1 as an example the solution process is shown in fig 3 through the above steps the parameters of all nodes at time n 1 can be calculated and according to the boundary conditions at time n 2 the parameters at time n 2 can be obtained similarly the flow parameters at all times can be calculated 2 4 definite conditions 1 definite conditions

where ε 0 is the initial deformation of the riser s element and d s 0 is the initial differential arc length of the riser s element the curvature of the riser s element is given in eq 15 15 κ u 1 u 2 2 3 u s 3 in this paper the vibration equation of the riser is established based on the principle of virtual work according to this principle the total deformation energy produced by the virtual work done by the internal force is equal to the total virtual work done by all external forces as shown in eq 16 16 δ π δ u δ w 0 where π is the total energy u is the total strain energy of the system and w is the total virtual work done by the external forces 3 1 1 strain energy for marine risers in deep water shear deformation and torsional deformation are small enough to be ignored the axial deformation and bending deformation of the riser are thus mainly considered when building the vibration equation athisakul et al 2011 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015b 1 axial strain energy the axial strain of the riser is mainly caused by the axial tension and the fluid pressure difference inside and outside the riser chucheepsakul et al 2003 therefore the axial strain energy of the riser is given as eq 17 17 u a 0 s 1 2 e a ε 2 d s 0 s σ o v a ε d s where e is the elastic modulus and σ o v is the stress arising from hydrostatic pressure caused by the poisson effect as shown in eq 18 18 σ

riser respectively the variational formula of the axial strain energy is shown in eq 19 19 δ u a 0 l t e u δ u d z further t e can be calculated by eq 20 20 t e ea ε 2 v p e a e sgn h z p i a i where sgn x 0 x 0 1 x 0 2 bending strain energy according to the modified lagrange formula the bending strain energy of riser is as given in eq 21 21 u b 0 s 1 2 e i κ 2 d s 0 l 1 2 e i κ 2 s d z where i is

s 5 d z 3 1 2 virtual work caused by an external force when a marine riser vibrates in its equilibrium position in the marine environment the virtual work caused by external forces includes not only its own gravity but also structural resistance inertial force and hydrodynamic force 1 virtual work done by effective gravity the effective gravity per unit length riser is shown in eq 23 23 ω g ρ r a ρ i a i ρ e a e g the variational formula of the virtual work caused by effective gravity is given in eq 24 24 δ w g 0 l ω g s δ ω d z where ρ r ρ i and ρ e represent the density of the riser internal and external fluids respectively and ω is the vertical displacement of the riser 2 virtual work done by structural resistance the structural resistance of the riser is shown in eq 25 25 f c 0 s c u d

done by hydrodynamic forces the external diameter ratio of the top tension riser to the wavelength ratio is very small and the existence of the riser does not affect the external flow field the commonly used method for solving the hydrodynamic forces on small scale cylinders is the morison equation therefore the hydrodynamic forces on a unit length riser is shown in eq 27 27 f l 1 2 ρ c d u

paper in the process of solving the vibration equation of riser in this paper there is a nonlinear term related to the large deformation of the riser at present the direct integral solution of the structural dynamics can be divided into an explicit integral method and an implicit integral method the central difference method is usually used in dynamic analyses however the central difference method is a conditional stable algorithm where the time step length must be less than a certain critical value otherwise the calculation results can easily be distorted for marine deep water risers and for problems with large response time scales an implicit algorithm with unconditional stability is usually used deep water risers are long flexible pipes that are prone to large deformations and non linear deformations under marine environmental loads the newmark β method is an implicit direct integration algorithm which is unconditionally stable it can use large time steps in the calculation process so it is especially suitable for the transient response analysis of a riser system with a long time history therefore the newmark β method was used here to solve the dynamic response of a marine riser under a multiphase internal flow to ensure the accuracy and stability of the integration the integration constants used are α 1 4 δ 1 2 and the solution process is shown in fig 5 3 3 program verification according to the established numerical model of the multiphase internal flow and the vibration equation of the marine riser the drcm m program was developed based on matlab further this program was validated by calculating the internal pressure and natural frequency with the parameters given by montoya hernandez and vazquez hernandez 2014 the parameters of the multiphase internal flow are shown in table 1 and the parameters of the dynamic analysis of the risers are shown in table 2 the results of this program were then compared with data in the literature fig 6 a shows that the internal pressure predicted by the internal flow analysis model in this paper is in good agreement with that predicted in the literature and the maximum error is less than 4 4 the reason for the small error is that the influence of the hydrate phase transition on the pressure is taken into account in our internal flow model hence the predicted internal pressure is smaller due to us considering hydrate phase transitions fig 6b shows that the calculated results of the first to fifth order natural frequencies of the risers from the proposed dynamic model and the model in the literature are basically the same and the maximum error is less than 2 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the flow parameters of the multiphase internal flow the multiphase internal flow containing hydrate phase transitions was modelled as a multiphase and multicomponent mixing system in this part the hydrate phase transition region and the multiphase internal flow parameters with different gas intake ratios are obtained with the parameters given in table 3 because the density of natural gas is determined by its temperature and pressure the density is calculated as follows 36 ρ g 3486 6 p ρ g s z t where ρ g s is the relative density of natural gas where the composition of natural gas only includes methane in this paper ρ g s 0 5548 and z is the compression factor of natural gas dimensionless fig 7 a shows the internal temperature and phase equilibrium temperature under different gas intake ratios the intersection point between the internal temperature curve and the phase equilibrium curve is the critical point of the hydrate phase transition below this critical point the hydrate is in the formation region above the critical point the hydrate is in the decomposition region fig 7b displays the heat produced by friction between the internal flow and the wall the hydrate phase transition and the heat transfer between the internal flow and the external seawater when the gas intake ratio is 20 it can be seen that the internal temperature is mainly affected by the heat transfer from the external seawater while the hydrate phase transition and the friction between the internal flow and the wall have little influence on the internal temperature assuming that the inlet temperature of the internal flow is 10 c the internal temperature decreases when the external seawater temperature is lower than the internal temperature reaching the lowest value at 900 m below the water s surface the inlet temperature then rises with the rapid increase of the sea water temperature near the water s surface reaching a maximum at the outlet it can be seen from fig 7a that the outlet temperature at gas intake ratios of 10 20 30 and 40 are 17 97 c 17 43 c 17 04 c and 16 67 c respectively that is to say when the inlet temperature is the same the higher the gas intake ratio the lower the outlet temperature this is because as the gas intake ratio increases the internal flow velocity increases see fig 7c resulting in a decrease in the heat transfer time at the same time an increase of the gas volume fraction decreases the specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the internal flow both of which reduce the heat transfer between the internal flow and the external sea water therefore at the same inlet temperature the temperature of a lower gas intake ratio is closer to the ambient temperature fig 7c f shows the changes of the velocity acceleration density and pressure respectively at different gas intake ratios as the fluid flows upward the expansion of the gas and the decomposition of the hydrate increase the gas volume fraction the mixed phase velocity and the acceleration while the density decreases the low density causes the gravity pressure to decrease while the high velocity caused by the high gas intake ratio increases the frictional pressure drop rate but the effect of the gravity pressure drop is much greater than the frictional pressure drop resulting in a net decrease in the total pressure drop when the riser outlet pressure remains unchanged the overall internal pressure decreases therefore the phase equilibrium curve shifts to the left and the hydrate formation region descends in depth at the same time it can be observed that the formation of the hydrates consumes gas and slows down the change of the flow parameters caused by gas expansion in the hydrate decomposition region gas generated by hydrate decomposition accelerates the changes of the multiphase flow parameters especially near the water s surface according to the above discussion the flow parameters such as the velocity acceleration density and pressure constantly change in the upward flow changes in the flow parameters will affect the stiffness matrix mass matrix and damping matrix in the discrete vibration differential equation of the riser in the next section the effect of the multiphase internal flow on the dynamic characteristics and response of the riser will be further discussed based on the calculated results given in this section 4 2 effect of the gas intake ratio on the dynamic characteristics of the riser fig 8 a d are the first fifth tenth and fifteenth order natural frequencies of the riser for constant flow velocities v 0 m s and v 0 79 m s and gas intake ratios 10 20 30 and 40 when the internal flow is purely liquid and the velocity is constant v 0 m s and v 0 79 m s the first fifth tenth and fifteenth order natural frequencies decrease with an increase of the internal flow velocity however when the velocity increment is small the natural frequency of the riser decreases slightly which is consistent with the conclusions of montoya hernandez and vazquez hernandez 2014 when the fluid in the riser is a multiphase flow arising from the hydrate phase transitions the natural frequencies of the riser at different gas intake ratios were obtained based on the calculated results of the internal flow parameters presented in section 4 1 the results show that the natural frequencies of risers in the first fifth tenth and fifteenth modes increase with an increase of the gas intake ratio the natural frequencies of different modes show similar regularity with an increase of air volume but the trend of increasing natural frequencies with an increase of the gas intake ratio is more obvious in the higher modes according to the results given in section 4 1 the presence of gas will increase the velocity of the internal flow causing the natural frequency to decrease however the presence of gas simultaneously causes the pressure density and acceleration to increase resulting in an increase in the natural frequency so when the fluid in the riser is a multiphase flow arising from hydrate phase transitions the natural vibration frequency of the riser generally shows an increasing trend with an increase of the gas intake ratio 4 3 effects of gas intake on the dynamic response of the riser during its service life the dynamic response of a riser is affected by both the marine environment and its internal flow in order to study the dynamic response of a marine riser under a multiphase internal flow and environmental excitation two cases are considered in this paper the environmental load parameters are shown in table 4 and the other calculation parameters are shown in table 3 fig 9 a c shows the amplitude envelope of the riser under a uniform excitation flow of 0 1 m s 0 3 m s and 0 5 m s respectively from these figures it can be observed that the effect of the current velocity on the amplitude envelope of the riser is significant under the same gas intake ratio when the current velocity is 0 1 m s 0 3 m s and 0 5 m s the maximum amplitude of the riser is 0 2897 m 2 6077 mm and 7 2437 m respectively when the current velocity is constant the amplitude envelope decreases with an increase of gas intake the maximum amplitude of the riser decreases by 0 0055 m 0 0496 m and 0 1379 m respectively when the gas intake ratio increases from 0 to 40 for current velocities of 0 1 m s 0 3 m s and 0 5 m s this is because the increase of gas intake ratio increases the velocity and acceleration of the internal flow decreases the density and pressure and then increases the rigidity of the riser under the same external load the amplitude of the riser decreases fig 10 a c shows the amplitude envelopes of the riser at different gas intake ratios under wave excitations from a 3 m high wave and 6 8 and 10 s wave periods respectively fig 10c shows that the amplitude envelope decreases with an increase of the gas intake ratio meanwhile in fig 10a and b when the riser is excited by a wave with a height of 3 m and periods of 8 s and 6 s respectively the opposite behaviour to that seen in fig 10c whereby the amplitude envelope increases with an increase of gas intake when comparing fig 10b with fig 10c the riser has a larger amplitude at a wave period of 10 s than that at 8 s because the former wave period is very near the third order natural frequency of the riser and hence the riser resonates as the gas intake ratio increases from 0 to 40 the third order natural frequency of the riser increases from 0 1092 hz to 0 1127 hz gradually deviating from the resonance region and the amplitude decreases when the wave period is 8 s as the gas intake ratio increases the third order natural frequency of the riser increases gradually toward the resonance region and the amplitude increases furthermore the effect of the gas intake ratio on the vibration frequency under the wave parameters h w 3 m and t w 6 s was studied with a spectral analysis which was applied to the time series of the dynamic forces fig 11 a c shows the spanwise distribution of the power spectral density in the frequency domain for gas intake ratios of 0 20 and 40 respectively which show that there is a single frequency of 0 16 hz excited by the waves at different gas intake ratios that dominates the oscillations along the riser s span this is because when the structural response is stable the influence of the current on the streamwise oscillation is a static load which only causes an offset to the riser and the streamwise dynamic response of the riser is only caused by waves so only one response frequency corresponding to the wave period appears it can be seen from fig 11a c that the frequency and peak of the wave induced structural response do not change significantly with an increase of the gas intake ratio 5 conclusions in this paper a numerical multiphase internal flow model that considers hydrate phase transitions was established the multiphase internal flow that includes oil gas water and hydrates was regarded as a pseudo single phase mixture and the velocity acceleration density and pressure were solved using the finite difference method then based on the virtual work principle and variational principle a non linear vibration equation of the riser was established the parameters of the multiphase internal flow were introduced and solved numerically using the finite element method the dynamic response of the riser to the multiphase internal flow consisting of hydrate phase transitions currents and wave excitations was discussed and the effects of the gas intake on the dynamic characteristics and response of the riser were studied the following conclusions are drawn 1 from the riser s inlet to its outlet the pressure and density of the internal flow decrease while the velocity and acceleration increase in the hydrate formation region because the formation of hydrates consumes gas the flow parameters changed slowly in the hydrate decomposition region the decomposition of the hydrates increases the gas volume fraction and accelerates the changing trend of the flow parameters at the same time the pressure and density of the internal flow decrease while the velocity and acceleration increase with an increase of gas intake 2 the natural frequency of the riser decreases with an increase of the internal flow velocity but an increase of gas intake also changes other flow parameters including the acceleration pressure and density which result in an increase of the natural frequency of the riser with the increase of gas intake where the changing trend is more obvious in higher modes 3 the stiffness of the riser increases with an increase of gas intake so the amplitude envelope of the riser decreases with an increase of gas intake under current excitation under the excitation of waves the gas intake has no obvious effect on the vibration frequency of the riser for the riser s amplitude a change of the gas intake will cause a change of the natural vibration frequency of the riser which will cause the resonance amplification factor to change thus affecting the vibration amplitude author contributions section min lou contributed significantly to the conception and the analysis

is of great significance for its structural design in the uneven flow field the propeller excitation is transmitted to the hull along with the propulsion shaft system which is the main exciting force that causes the structural vibration of the ship the uneven excitation force is transmitted to the hull through the stern middle and thrust bearing seat meanwhile the excitation force of the uneven flow field acting on the surface of the hull is also transmitted to the propulsion shafting through the bearing causing coupled vibration between the shaft system and the hull the transverse vibration aroused by these excitations and interaction effects between shaft and hull generates underwater far field radial noise the vibration and radiation noise of the cylindrical shell and the conical shell

based on the study of general conical shells and cylindrical shells various additional structures have been considered caresta and kessissoglou 2010b built a conical cylindrical conical shell model included internal bulkheads stiffeners and external fluids wave method and power series method are used to solve the equations of motion of cylindrical shell and conical shell respectively the

vibration characteristics and far field acoustic radiation characteristics of conical cylindrical coupled shell in low frequencies power series method and wave method were used to solve the equations of motion of conical shell and cylindrical shell respectively the numerical results were verified by fem bem when the propulsion shaft system and the hull are connected by bearings vibrations are transmitted to each other thus the coupling effects between substructures occurs merz et al 2009 built a stiffened shell by fem bem method it is coupled to propulsion shafting by simplified spring damping caresta and kessissoglou 2010c and caresta 2011 built a conical cylindrical conical shell containing fluid loads the hull was connected to the shaft by continuous conditions the use of

isolation performance of various isolators were analyzed as described above in the current research on shaft shell coupled vibration most of them used numerical method such as fem bem merz et al 2009 xie et al 2019 experimental method wang et al 2019 or frf chen et al 2019 the research of the analytical method mostly focused on the longitudinal vibration of coupled shaft shell caresta and kessissoglou 2010c caresta 2011 or analyzed the transmission of axial force by thrust bearing xie et al 2017a b due to the large longitudinal excitation of the propeller however the number of radial bearings is more than that of thrust bearings resulting in more complicated coupling between the hull and the shaft and transverse vibration has a great influence on acoustic radiation therefore transverse vibration also has a high research value in addition in the existing research on the vibration and transmission characteristics of the shafting hull system most studies on forced vibrations consider propeller excitation as external excitation while the excitation of the hull is rarely considered in this study an analytical method was used to investigate the transverse vibration of the

verification the model for numerical calculation is shown in fig 6 the length of the conical shell along the axis is l c o 8 5 m the length of the cylindrical shell is l c y 45 m the length of the shaft is l s 9 m the radius of the small end of the conical shell is r 1 0 5 m the radius of the large end of the conical shell that is the radius of the cylindrical shell is r 2 2 5 m the radius of the shaft is r s 0 1 m the thickness of the conical shell and the cylindrical shell are both h 0 05 m there are three radial bearings in the model the conical shell is divided into four sections with lengths of 2 m 2 m 2 m 2 5 m in the axial direction the shaft is divided into four sections with lengths of 2 3 m 2 m 2 m 2 7 m all bearings have a stiffness of k 1 10 5 n m the density of the

bearing and the shaft and the shell that are s 1 s 2 s 3 c 1 c 2 c 3 in fig 6 fem bem is used to verify the correctness of the model the finite element model and boundary element model of the system is established in the software ansys the shell shaft and bearing are composed of shell 63 element beam 188 element and combin14 element respectively the model is imported into the software virtual lab for boundary element calculation as shown in fig 7 excitation f 1 is applied at the small end of the conical shell with the amplitude 1 n the vibration response of each response point can be obtained the vibration response of c 1 is compared with the analytical method as shown in fig 8 a logarithmic scale was used to emphasize the small differences in the results it can be seen from the fig 8 that the analytical method has the same trend as the vibration response curve obtained by fem bem the resonant frequencies of the curves obtained by two methods are nearly the same there is a slight deviation in peak value especially at high frequencies mainly due to the difference in the approximation of the fluid pressure between the two methods the reason is that in this paper the conical shell is segmented and each segment is treated as a cylindrical shell of equal length to apply fluid pressure while fem bem applies fluid pressure to the boundary element of the conical cylindrical shell directly besides only the transverse vibration of the shaft is considered in analytical method without considering longitudinal vibration torsional vibration and coupling furthermore errors always occur due to the modal truncation when the response calculation is performed by the modal superposition method in fem bem in general the analytical method for calculating the vibration response of the coupled system of the shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell used in this paper is correct and effective 4 results and discussion the calculation model is shown in fig 6 and the parameters are the same as in chapter 3 the effects of fluid excitation and bearing stiffness on the transverse vibration of the coupled system of the shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell are discussed respectively 4 1 effect of fluid the transverse vibration responses of the coupled system of shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell in fluid and in vacuo are calculated respectively excitation f 1 is applied at the small end of the conical shell with the amplitude 1 n the vibration responses of response points c 1 s 1 are used to examine the effect of fluid on the transverse vibration of the coupled system of shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell in fig 9 firstly it can be observed that the effect of fluid on the transverse vibration of the system is mainly reflected in the additional mass which makes the resonance frequency move to the lower frequencies and the number of resonance frequencies increases at low frequencies furthermore the amplitude of the curve peak in fluid is smaller than that in vacuo due to the damping effect 4 2 effect of excitations the excitations are applied at the small end of the conical shell f 1 and the propeller end of the shaft f 2 respectively the amplitudes of both excitations are 1 n the vibration responses of various response points are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 when the excitation is applied to the shell the displacement of the shell is greater than the shaft when the excitation is applied to the shaft the displacement of the shaft is greater than the shell in general the displacement of the substructure vibrated by external excitation is greater than the displacement of the substructure vibrated by the bearing force that is the transmitted excitations the reason is that when the vibration is transmitted between the shaft and the shell through the bearing the energy is continuously attenuated 4 3 effect of bearing stiffness the effect of bearing stiffness on the transverse vibration characteristics of the coupled system of shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell is investigated by setting the stiffness of all bearings in the model to k 1 10 5 n m k 2 10 6 n m k 3 10 7 n m k 4 10 8 n m respectively the excitations are still f 1 and f 2 the vibration responses of response points c 1 s 1 are used to examine the effect of bearing stiffness on the transverse vibration of the coupled system of shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell in fig 12 and fig 13 when the excitation is applied to the conical shell as the bearing stiffness increases the displacement of shell decreases slightly and the displacement of shaft increases the displacements of the shaft and the shell gradually become consistent as do most of the resonant frequencies when the excitation is applied to the shaft as the bearing stiffness increases the displacement of shaft decreases slightly and the displacement of shell increases also the displacements and resonant frequencies of the shaft and the shell gradually become consistent in general as the bearing stiffness increases the displacement of the substructure vibrated by external excitation decreases slightly while the displacement of the substructure vibrated by the bearing force increases the displacements and resonant frequencies of both substructures gradually become consistent thus bearing stiffness has a greater impact on the substructure vibrated by the bearing force than on the substructure vibrated by the external excitation as the main connection of the shell and the shaft the bearing cannot be ignored in the vibration transmission 5 conclusions an analytical method to solve the vibration of the coupled system of the shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell was introduced in this paper the boundary conditions and continuous conditions of the shaft and the shell were given continuous conditions of the shaft and the shell were established at the bearing joint an effective analytical method for transverse vibration analysis of the system was presented the transverse vibration characteristics of the system under load were discussed the accuracy of the model was verified by fem bem conclusions are gained as follows 1 the fluid on the cylindrical conical shell makes the coupled system has lower resonance frequencies and smaller peak amplitudes due to the additional mass and damping effect 2 the displacement of the substructure vibrated by external excitation is greater than the displacement of the substructure vibrated by the bearing force due to the principle of energy decay 3 bearing stiffness has a great impact on the transverse vibration of shaft and hull and make their vibration tend to be consistent when it increases declaration of competing interest we declare

order to apply it to curved structures and cylindrical shells chronopoulos et al 2014 modeled a layered structure composed of a combination of conical and cylindrical shells and solved the dynamic response by the wfem fem method esl method was used in the mid low frequency range and the coupling loss factors clf in the statistical energy analysis sea method was used in the high frequency range based on the study of general conical shells and cylindrical shells various additional structures have been considered caresta and kessissoglou 2010b built a conical cylindrical conical shell model included internal bulkheads stiffeners and external fluids wave method and power series method are used to solve the equations of motion of cylindrical shell and conical shell respectively the vibration characteristics and radiation noise characteristics of the system are studied bagheri et al 2018 obtained the equations of motion of the conical cylindrical conical shell system based on the

vibration characteristics and far field acoustic radiation characteristics of conical cylindrical coupled shell in low frequencies power series method and wave method were used to solve the equations of motion of conical shell and cylindrical shell respectively the numerical results were verified by fem bem when the propulsion shaft system and the hull are connected by bearings vibrations are transmitted to each other thus the coupling effects between substructures occurs merz et al 2009 built a stiffened shell by fem bem method it is coupled to propulsion shafting by simplified spring damping caresta and kessissoglou 2010c and caresta 2011 built a conical cylindrical conical shell containing fluid loads the hull was connected to the shaft by continuous conditions the use of

the propeller shaft hull structural system submerged in a heavy fluid and studied the structure and acoustic response of the system under different propeller excitations song et al 2014 built a propeller shaft hull system based on the modular method using the periodic structure theory the acoustic and vibration characteristics of the system due to excitation from propeller forces and the isolation performance of various isolators were analyzed as described above in the current research on shaft shell coupled vibration most of them used numerical method such as fem bem merz et al 2009 xie et al 2019 experimental method wang et al 2019 or frf chen et al 2019 the research of the analytical method mostly focused on the longitudinal vibration of coupled shaft shell caresta and kessissoglou 2010c caresta 2011 or analyzed the transmission of axial force by thrust bearing xie et al 2017a b due to the large longitudinal excitation of the propeller however the number of radial bearings is more than that of thrust bearings resulting in more complicated coupling between the hull and the shaft and transverse vibration has a great influence on acoustic radiation therefore transverse vibration also has a high research value in addition in the existing research on the vibration and transmission characteristics of the shafting hull system most studies on forced vibrations consider propeller excitation as external excitation while the excitation of the hull is rarely considered in this study an analytical method was used to investigate the transverse vibration of the

verification the model for numerical calculation is shown in fig 6 the length of the conical shell along the axis is l c o 8 5 m the length of the cylindrical shell is l c y 45 m the length of the shaft is l s 9 m the radius of the small end of the conical shell is r 1 0 5 m the radius of the large end of the conical shell that is the radius of the cylindrical shell is r 2 2 5 m the radius of the shaft is r s 0 1 m the thickness of the conical shell and the cylindrical shell are both h 0 05 m there are three radial bearings in the model the conical shell is divided into four sections with lengths of 2 m 2 m 2 m 2 5 m in the axial direction the shaft is divided into four sections with lengths of 2 3 m 2 m 2 m 2 7 m all bearings have a stiffness of k 1 10 5 n m the density of the

bearing and the shaft and the shell that are s 1 s 2 s 3 c 1 c 2 c 3 in fig 6 fem bem is used to verify the correctness of the model the finite element model and boundary element model of the system is established in the software ansys the shell shaft and bearing are composed of shell 63 element beam 188 element and combin14 element respectively the model is imported into the software virtual lab for boundary element calculation as shown in fig 7 excitation f 1 is applied at the small end of the conical shell with the amplitude 1 n the vibration response of each response point can be obtained the vibration response of c 1 is compared with the analytical method as shown in fig 8 a logarithmic scale was used to emphasize the small differences in the results it can be seen from the fig 8 that the analytical method has the same trend as the vibration response curve obtained by fem bem the resonant frequencies of the curves obtained by two methods are nearly the same there is a slight deviation in peak value especially at high frequencies mainly due to the difference in the approximation of the fluid pressure between the two methods the reason is that in this paper the conical shell is segmented and each segment is treated as a cylindrical shell of equal length to apply fluid pressure while fem bem applies fluid pressure to the boundary element of the conical cylindrical shell directly besides only the transverse vibration of the shaft is considered in analytical method without considering longitudinal vibration torsional vibration and coupling furthermore errors always occur due to the modal truncation when the response calculation is performed by the modal superposition method in fem bem in general the analytical method for calculating the vibration response of the coupled system of the shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell used in this paper is correct and effective 4 results and discussion the calculation model is shown in fig 6 and the parameters are the same as in chapter 3 the effects of fluid excitation and bearing stiffness on the transverse vibration of the coupled system of the shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell are discussed respectively 4 1 effect of fluid the transverse vibration responses of the coupled system of shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell in fluid and in vacuo are calculated respectively excitation f 1 is applied at the small end of the conical shell with the amplitude 1 n the vibration responses of response points c 1 s 1 are used to examine the effect of fluid on the transverse vibration of the coupled system of shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell in fig 9 firstly it can be observed that the effect of fluid on the transverse vibration of the system is mainly reflected in the additional mass which makes the resonance frequency move to the lower frequencies and the number of resonance frequencies increases at low frequencies furthermore the amplitude of the curve peak in fluid is smaller than that in vacuo due to the damping effect 4 2 effect of excitations the excitations are applied at the small end of the conical shell f 1 and the propeller end of the shaft f 2 respectively the amplitudes of both excitations are 1 n the vibration responses of various response points are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 when the excitation is applied to the shell the displacement of the shell is greater than the shaft when the excitation is applied to the shaft the displacement of the shaft is greater than the shell in general the displacement of the substructure vibrated by external excitation is greater than the displacement of the substructure vibrated by the bearing force that is the transmitted excitations the reason is that when the vibration is transmitted between the shaft and the shell through the bearing the energy is continuously attenuated 4 3 effect of bearing stiffness the effect of bearing stiffness on the transverse vibration characteristics of the coupled system of shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell is investigated by setting the stiffness of all bearings in the model to k 1 10 5 n m k 2 10 6 n m k 3 10 7 n m k 4 10 8 n m respectively the excitations are still f 1 and f 2 the vibration responses of response points c 1 s 1 are used to examine the effect of bearing stiffness on the transverse vibration of the coupled system of shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell in fig 12 and fig 13 when the excitation is applied to the conical shell as the bearing stiffness increases the displacement of shell decreases slightly and the displacement of shaft increases the displacements of the shaft and the shell gradually become consistent as do most of the resonant frequencies when the excitation is applied to the shaft as the bearing stiffness increases the displacement of shaft decreases slightly and the displacement of shell increases also the displacements and resonant frequencies of the shaft and the shell gradually become consistent in general as the bearing stiffness increases the displacement of the substructure vibrated by external excitation decreases slightly while the displacement of the substructure vibrated by the bearing force increases the displacements and resonant frequencies of both substructures gradually become consistent thus bearing stiffness has a greater impact on the substructure vibrated by the bearing force than on the substructure vibrated by the external excitation as the main connection of the shell and the shaft the bearing cannot be ignored in the vibration transmission 5 conclusions an analytical method to solve the vibration of the coupled system of the shaft and submerged conical cylindrical shell was introduced in this paper the boundary conditions and continuous conditions of the shaft and the shell were given continuous conditions of the shaft and the shell were established at the bearing joint an effective analytical method for transverse vibration analysis of the system was presented the transverse vibration characteristics of the system under load were discussed the accuracy of the model was verified by fem bem conclusions are gained as follows 1 the fluid on the cylindrical conical shell makes the coupled system has lower resonance frequencies and smaller peak amplitudes due to the additional mass and damping effect 2 the displacement of the substructure vibrated by external excitation is greater than the displacement of the substructure vibrated by the bearing force due to the principle of energy decay 3 bearing stiffness has a great impact on the transverse vibration of shaft and hull and make their vibration tend to be consistent when it increases declaration of competing interest we declare

22172,the application of vertical drains along with preloading to accelerate the consolidation rate of dredged soil has been widely used however the conventional analytical or numerical models cannot predict the nonlinear finite strain consolidation behavior of dredge soil deposits accurately because the vertical drains are installed in the middle of a self weight consolidation process this paper establishes a mathematical and numerical model for a 2 d axisymmetric nonlinear finite strain consolidation for which the self weight consolidation and the radial drainage through vertical drains are considered besides a series of lab scale self weight consolidation tests were conducted which can simulate the vertical drain installation experimental results along with those of the simplified method lee et al 2016 were then utilized to verify performance of the proposed model the results demonstrate that the proposed model appropriately predicts the nonlinear finite strain self weight consolidation behavior of dredged soils and its application with vertical drains is suitable for designing dredged soil improvement moreover the most important advantage of the proposed model is to optimize the schedule of dredging landfilling construction keywords self weight consolidation nonlinear finite strain consolidation numerical model vertical drain 1 introduction for dredged soil improvements vertical drains are widely utilized along with preloading by a surcharge embankment in order to expedite the consolidation of dredged materials vertical drains have been successfully adopted in soft soil improvements because the installation of vertical drains additionally provides a radial drainage path that can accelerate the consolidation rate effectively by reducing the drainage distance advantages of vertical drains are as follows a acceleration of the primary consolidation during preloading b rapid construction through the increasing of undrained shear strength c reduction in post surcharge settlements and d reduction in the differential settlements during the primary consolidation stage however because vertical drains are commonly installed during the self weight consolidation procedure it is difficult to predict the settlement behavior of dredged soil formations terzaghi s one dimensional 1 d consolidation theory 1923 cannot properly evaluate the consolidation of highly deformable soft clays such as dredged soils cargill 1982 1985 stark et al 2005a lee et al 2013 gibson et al 1967 proposed a nonlinear finite strain consolidation analysis to extend the applications of terzaghi s theory accordingly a 1 d nonlinear finite strain numerical model called psddf primary consolidation secondary compression and desiccation of dredge fill was developed cargill 1982 1985 stark et al 2005a several rigorous methods have been recently published for nonlinear finite strain consolidation with consideration of vertical drains such as geng et al 2011 walker et al 2012 hu et al 2014 lu et al 2015 geng and yu 2017 and cao et al 2018 these approaches adopt the one dimensional nonlinear finite strain theory gibson et al 1967 to be extended to the 2 d axisymmetric geometry considering radial drainage induced by vertical drains which are exclusively applicable to the geostatic stress condition after self weight consolidation lee et al 2016 proposed a semi analytical method that can consider both the vertical and radial direction of the dredged soil deposit to simulate the combined consolidation process in which vertical drains are installed during the nonlinear finite strain consolidation in the semi analytical method lee et al 2016 morris s analytical solution 2002 and the psddf analysis were applied to a 1 d finite strain self consolidation in the vertical direction and the radial consolidation was considered complying with baron s vertical drain theory 1948 carillo s formula 1942 was used to estimate the overall average consolidation rate at the vertical and radial directions cao et al 2018 tried to consider vertical self weight consolidation and radial drainage simultaneously the limitation of these approaches is that a vertical drain should be activated only at the beginning of a self weight consolidation process in this paper a mathematical and numerical model for a two dimensional 2 d axisymmetric nonlinear finite strain consolidation named axi selcon was developed the developed model can simultaneously consider the self weight consolidation and the radial drainage induced by a vertical drain installed in the middle of a self weight consolidation process nonlinear relationships of void ratio effective stress and void ratio hydraulic conductivity are also considered during the consolidation process in addition axi selcon considers surcharge induced preloading implemented at any stage of consolidation besides a series of lab scale self weight consolidation experiments with 100 cm thick dredged material was performed in consideration of the installation time of a vertical drain to verify the proposed model an artificial vertical drain was designed and installed at the designated times at the 0 50 and 70 degree of the self weight consolidation the experimental results along with the simplified method proposed by lee et al 2016 were utilized to verify the accuracy of the axi selcon model in order to show the applicability of the proposed method the consolidation behavior for the imaginary dredged deposit was examined by simulating the axi selcon model the simulation was made in the typical conditions that vertical drains were installed at the predetermined degree of consolidation that is 10 30 50 70 and 90 in addition to predict the real consolidation process of the dredged soil with preloading as well as vertical drains numerical simulations were conducted with consideration of preloading and vertical drains when the degree of consolidation was 30 50 and 70 1 1 2 d axisymmetric nonlinear finite strain self weight consolidation model vertical drains are generally installed in the pattern of a triangular or square lattice so that one vertical drain should cover the cylindrical domain of soil formations as shown in fig 1 gibson et al 1967 proposed the material coordinate system and the relations between each coordinate system and the void ratio e as follows 1 d ξ ξ z d z ξ a d a 1 e d z 1 e 1 e 0 d a where z is the material coordinate a is the lagrangian coordinate ξ is the convective coordinate and e 0 is the void ratio before deforming as shown in fig 1 alternatively assuming the axisymmetric condition with no flow in the θ direction of the cylindrical coordinate system the net flux q net that is a difference between the inflow and outflow during a time increment can be expressed by considering darcy s law as follows 2 q n e t ξ k v h ξ r d r d θ d ξ r k h r h r d r d θ d ξ where h is the total head and k v and k h are the hydraulic conductivity in the vertical and horizontal or radial directions the volume of water in the soil formation v w changes with time during consolidation and the time rate change can be expressed in the infinitesimal soil element as follows 3 v w t 1 1 e e t r d r d θ d ξ to satisfy the continuity for pore water flow in the infinitesimal soil element the net flux rate eq 2 and the change of water volume eq 3 should be equal in addition provided the pore water pressure u is substituted for the total head the governing equation is derived as 4 1 1 e e t 1 γ w ξ k v u ξ 1 γ w r r k h r u r where γw is the unit weight of water to apply the relationship between the void ratio and effective stress corresponding to the self weight consolidation and the stress stage of

infinitesimal soil element is expressed as follows 5 σ ξ e γ w γ s 1 e 0 where σ is the total stress in the infinitesimal soil element and γs is the unit weight of soil particles because the pore

the numerical model axi selcon implemented by the finite difference method fdm was developed to step wisely linearize the governing equation and obtain the solution the finite difference mesh that was adopted in the axi selcon model is shown in fig 2 where r s is the effective radius of a vertical drain r d is the radius of a vertical drain and δr and δz are the vertical and radial mesh size

equation 10 was applied to calculate the void ratio explicitly at the current state t 1 along with the void ratio at the previous time t 1 3 self weight consolidation experiment with vertical drain lab scale self weight consolidation experiments have been performed to allow the measurement of surface settlement of a poured dredged soil with time and to verify the developed axi selcon model the test equipment consists of a cylindrical acrylic chamber whose dimension is 100 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter a detail description of the transparent acrylic chamber can be referred to lee et al 2016 in the center of the acrylic chamber a perforated acrylic pipe with the diameter of 6 cm is assembled to simulate a vertical drain the perforated pipe is filled with standard sand for allowing free drainage inside the pipe and is connected to a separate valve to measure the amount of water drained through the pipe as shown in fig 3 the surface of the perforated pipe is wrapped in a polypropylene pp filter that is usually adopted for a prefabricated vertical drain the polypropylene filter adopted in the lab scale self weight consolidation tests possesses the apparent opening size aos of 75 μm which ensures the filtering capacity of it in this study kaolinite was used to perform the self weight consolidation experiment assuming that it behaves similarly to a dredged soil the fundamental soil properties of kaolinite are summarized as specific gravity gs 2 65 liquid limit ll 61 2 and plastic limit pl 30 4 the kaolinite sample is classified as ch according to the uscs from the x ray diffraction analysis the content of kaolin minerals is dominantly measured to be 90 3 when the dredged material reaches the end of the sedimentation process the solid particles begin to form a continuous soil matrix the void ratio at this time is defined as an initial void ratio e00 or the void ratio at zero effective stress cargill 1982 1986 stark et al 2005b lee et al 2016 measured the initial void ratio of kaolinite after the completion of sedimentation to be 7 38 in addition they provided the void ratio effective stress and void ratio hydraulic conductivity relationships by performing a series of the self weight consolidation tests and constant rate of strain crs consolidation tests lee et al 2016 which are employed for performing analyses with the axi selcon model in this paper the surface level of the poured kaolinite in the cylindrical chamber was measured with time the double drainage condition upper and lower boundary in the vertical direction was allowed during the test fig 4 shows the change in the kaolinite surface level for the three different cases i e the vertical drain is activated at the time of 0 50 and 70 degree of self weight consolidation it can be observed in fig 4 the self weight consolidation more rapidly proceeded when the vertical drain is activated earlier that is the activations at the time of 0 and 50 yielded considerably faster self weight consolidation compared with that of 70 2 model verifications and applications 2 1 model verifications results of the laboratory experiment were used to validate the performance of the axi selcon model since the laboratory tests were carried out with homogeneous kaolinite samples the anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity was not considered in the lab scale self weight consolidation tests that is assumed to be k v k h in the proposed model in axi selcon a vertical drain can be activated at any time during self weight consolidation that is at the beginning the numerical model turns on a 1 d consolidation mode and then it turns into an axisymmetric consolidation mode when a designated time is reached matching up with the scale of the test equipment the domain of the numerical model represented r d 3 cm r s 15 cm and h 100 cm fig 5 shows comparisons between self weight consolidation test results and axi selcon simulations for the double drainage condition in the vertical direction the axisymmetric mode was turned on at the time of 0 50 and 70 degree of self weight consolidation the consolidation rates were significantly increased immediately after installation of the vertical drain during self weight consolidation in each case which implies the effect of vertical drains on the rate of self weight consolidation as shown in fig 5 the lab scale self weight consolidation with consideration of a vertical drain was accurately simulated by the axi selcon model an additional verification of axi selcon was carried out by comparing with the simplified method proposed by lee et al 2016 which can consider both the vertical and radial direction of the dredged soil deposit to semi analytically simulate the combined consolidation process in the simplified method lee et al 2016 the psddf analysis was exclusively selected to simulate a 1 d finite strain self consolidation in the vertical direction and the radial consolidation is considered by adopting baron s vertical drain theory 1948 carillo s formula 1942 is used to estimate the overall degree of consolidation by averaging the vertical and radial direction the boundary conditions adopted in the lab scale test was used for the simplified method and the axi selcon simulation it is assumed that a vertical drain was activated at the beginning of a self weight consolidation process fig 6 shows the comparison of the simplified method and the axi selcon simulation for the single and double drainage condition the axi selcon simulations show the similar consolidation behavior with the simplified method 2 2 model applications in this section to examine the applicability of the developed model axi selcon was applied to predict consolidation behavior of the dredged soil with a vertical drain considering an imaginary dredged soil stratum with the thicknesses of 10 m and 20 m a vertical drain was virtually installed at the different consolidation stages of 10 30 50 70 and 90 degree of self weight consolidation in each case the axi selcon simulations were performed in consideration of radial drainage to the vertical drain the simulation results are illustrated in fig 7 along with the 1 d psddf simulation results for comparison purpose the comparison shows that the installation of a vertical drain in the dredged soil formation significantly reduces the consolidation time and the effect of vertical drain installation becomes more significant when the vertical drain is installed at the early stage of self weight consolidation this implies that for improving a dredged landfill it is highly recommended to install vertical drains as early as possible if the ground surface strength satisfies a minimum requirement of the vertical drain installation procedure in addition to predict a real consolidation process for an imaginary dredged soil formation 10 m thick with consideration of preloading as well as the installation of vertical drains axi selcon simulations were conducted under three different scenarios i e the application of preloading and installation of vertical drains were made at 30 50 and 70 degree of self weight consolidation at each stage the preloading of 50 kpa was applied on the dredged landfill surface it was assumed that the dredged deposits were homogeneous and isotropic with the double drainage condition in the vertical direction the three scenarios are compared in fig 8 along with the 1 d psddf simulation result without the preloading and vertical drain for comparison purposes as shown in fig 8 it takes about 1000 days to complete 1 d self weight consolidation with no vertical drain refer to the psddf result however provided vertical drains are installed the self weight consolidation terminated approximately at 30 60 and 120 days when the vertical drains are installed at 30 50 and 70 degree of self weight consolidation which brings about significant reduction in consolidation time accordingly axi selcon permits reliable estimation for the nonlinear finite strain self weight consolidation of a thick dredged deposit with consideration of the effect of vertical drains and preloading during self weight consolidation 3 conclusion a mathematical and numerical model for the 2 d axisymmetric nonlinear finite strain consolidation named axi selcon was developed in this paper in consideration of the self weight consolidation and the radial drainage induced by the installation of vertical drains in soft dredged deposits the findings from the current study are summarized as follows 1 the governing equation considering the effect of vertical drains in the soft dredging formation was derived by combining the mass conservation for the pore water phase darcy s law for the groundwater fluid rate and the force equilibrium the nonlinearity of soil self weight void ratio effective stress and void ratio hydraulic conductivity were effectively considered additionally an fdm scheme was implemented to solve the nonlinear governing equations under the axisymmetric condition 2 for the double drainage condition a lab scale self weight consolidation experiment of a height of 100 cm was conducted in consideration of the placement of a vertical drain at the points of the 0 50 and 70 degree of self weight consolidation as expected the installation of vertical drains significantly expedited the self weight consolidation process 3 the verification of the axi selcon model was made by comparing with the lab scale self weight consolidation experiments and with the simplified method proposed by lee et al 2016 in which the vertical and radial direction flows are simultaneously considered under the limited condition however it is necessary to compare with field cases in order to show the reliability and robustness of the axi selcon model 4 the application of the axi selcon model was examined by predicting consolidation behavior of an imaginary dredged soil stratum with the thicknesses of 10 m and 20 m for different times of vertical drain installation in addition a real consolidation process with consideration of preloading as well as the installation of vertical drains was simulated by the axi selcon model which shows the proposed model can be used to optimize the schedule of dredging landfilling construction author contribution statement hyobum lee writing original draft preparation

22172,the application of vertical drains along with preloading to accelerate the consolidation rate of dredged soil has been widely used however the conventional analytical or numerical models cannot predict the nonlinear finite strain consolidation behavior of dredge soil deposits accurately because the vertical drains are installed in the middle of a self weight consolidation process this paper establishes a mathematical and numerical model for a 2 d axisymmetric nonlinear finite strain consolidation for which the self weight consolidation and the radial drainage through vertical drains are considered besides a series of lab scale self weight consolidation tests were conducted which can simulate the vertical drain installation experimental results along with those of the simplified method lee et al 2016 were then utilized to verify performance of the proposed model the results demonstrate that the proposed model appropriately predicts the nonlinear finite strain self weight consolidation behavior of dredged soils and its application with vertical drains is suitable for designing dredged soil improvement moreover the most important advantage of the proposed model is to optimize the schedule of dredging landfilling construction keywords self weight consolidation nonlinear finite strain consolidation numerical model vertical drain 1 introduction for dredged soil improvements vertical drains are widely utilized along with preloading by a surcharge embankment in order to expedite the consolidation of dredged materials vertical drains have been successfully adopted in soft soil improvements because the installation of vertical drains additionally provides a radial drainage path that can accelerate the consolidation rate effectively by reducing the drainage distance advantages of vertical drains are as follows a acceleration of the primary consolidation during preloading b rapid construction through the increasing of undrained shear strength c reduction in post surcharge settlements and d reduction in the differential settlements during the primary consolidation stage however because vertical drains are commonly installed during the self weight consolidation procedure it is difficult to predict the settlement behavior of dredged soil formations terzaghi s one dimensional 1 d consolidation theory 1923 cannot properly evaluate the consolidation of highly deformable soft clays such as dredged soils cargill 1982 1985 stark et al 2005a lee et al 2013 gibson et al 1967 proposed a nonlinear finite strain consolidation analysis to extend the applications of terzaghi s theory accordingly a 1 d nonlinear finite strain numerical model called psddf primary consolidation secondary compression and desiccation of dredge fill was developed cargill 1982 1985 stark et al 2005a several rigorous methods have been recently published for nonlinear finite strain consolidation with consideration of vertical drains such as geng et al 2011 walker et al 2012 hu et al 2014 lu et al 2015 geng and yu 2017 and cao et al 2018 these approaches adopt the one dimensional nonlinear finite strain theory gibson et al 1967 to be extended to the 2 d axisymmetric geometry considering radial drainage induced by vertical drains which are exclusively applicable to the geostatic stress condition after self weight consolidation lee et al 2016 proposed a semi analytical method that can consider both the vertical and radial direction of the dredged soil deposit to simulate the combined consolidation process in which vertical drains are installed during the nonlinear finite strain consolidation in the semi analytical method lee et al 2016 morris s analytical solution 2002 and the psddf analysis were applied to a 1 d finite strain self consolidation in the vertical direction and the radial consolidation was considered complying with baron s vertical drain theory 1948 carillo s formula 1942 was used to estimate the overall average consolidation rate at the vertical and radial directions cao et al 2018 tried to consider vertical self weight consolidation and radial drainage simultaneously the limitation of these approaches is that a vertical drain should be activated only at the beginning of a self weight consolidation process in this paper a mathematical and numerical model for a two dimensional 2 d axisymmetric nonlinear finite strain consolidation named axi selcon was developed the developed model can simultaneously consider the self weight consolidation and the radial drainage induced by a vertical drain installed in the middle of a self weight consolidation process nonlinear relationships of void ratio effective stress and void ratio hydraulic conductivity are also considered during the consolidation process in addition axi selcon considers surcharge induced preloading implemented at any stage of consolidation besides a series of lab scale self weight consolidation experiments with 100 cm thick dredged material was performed in consideration of the installation time of a vertical drain to verify the proposed model an artificial vertical drain was designed and installed at the designated times at the 0 50 and 70 degree of the self weight consolidation the experimental results along with the simplified method proposed by lee et al 2016 were utilized to verify the accuracy of the axi selcon model in order to show the applicability of the proposed method the consolidation behavior for the imaginary dredged deposit was examined by simulating the axi selcon model the simulation was made in the typical conditions that vertical drains were installed at the predetermined degree of consolidation that is 10 30 50 70 and 90 in addition to predict the real consolidation process of the dredged soil with preloading as well as vertical drains numerical simulations were conducted with consideration of preloading and vertical drains when the degree of consolidation was 30 50 and 70 1 1 2 d axisymmetric nonlinear finite strain self weight consolidation model vertical drains are generally installed in the pattern of a triangular or square lattice so that one vertical drain should cover the cylindrical domain of soil formations as shown in fig 1 gibson et al 1967 proposed the material coordinate system and the relations between each coordinate

22173,this discussion is based on the paper by cui et al 2019 hereafter identified as the original authors or the original paper the original authors present a review on the application of cfd in the analysis of self rectifying turbines for owc wave energy conversion devices we feel that this review is incomplete as it overlooks a number of papers published in recent years that gave a new explanation for a phenomenon largely studied in the last two decades and discussed in the original paper the hysteresis in wells turbine performance in addition the original authors in their conclusions envisage a larger use of cfd in the coming years especially for the unsteady analysis of the chamber turbine interaction probably ignoring that several cfd studies focusing on this aspect have already been published in fact it is through three dimensional time dependent cfd studies of the unsteady interaction between chamber and turbine that the explanation of the cause of the hysteresis was found the objective of this discussion is to clarify two important aspects the chamber turbine interaction and the turbine hysteresis that in our opinion were not correctly analyzed in the original review paper by cui et al keywords cfd owc wells turbine systems hysteresis unsteady simulations 1 introduction the work by cui et al 2019 presents a review of the use of cfd in the analysis of self rectifying turbines wells and impulse used in owc systems one section section 3 2 1 focuses on a particular phenomenon that has been described and analyzed in owc wells turbine systems the difference in performance between the acceleration and deceleration phases i e when the mass flow through the turbine is increasing and decreasing respectively this phenomenon has been often referred to with the term hysteresis the description given to this phenomenon by the authors of the original paper appears quite outdated the most recent work cited kinoue et al 2004 is 15 years old and ignores some recent works that gave a different explanation for its cause while we do not expect the authors of a review paper to conduct themselves the analyses required to understand such a complex problem we would have appreciated a thorough and unbiased analysis of the existing literature which should have included the different existing explanations for this phenomenon the papers ignored by the authors of this review have all been published in the last 5 years involve three dimensional unsteady analyses of wells turbines including the simulation of the owc chamber while the majority of the referenced studies focus on steady simulations given the conclusions of the original paper in the near future it will be possible to realize a transformation from the quasi steady analysis to the transient simulation and investigate the unsteady performance of air turbines in a way that more closely reflects reality in addition the model of chamber turbine coupling can be established to predict the overall efficiency of owc system and facilitate turbine selection according to different design conditions we feel that the clarifications presented in this discussion are necessary the rest of this discussion is organized as follows section 2 introduces the phenomenon of the hysteresis in owc wells turbine systems section 3 summarized the early experimental and numerical studies on the topic section 4 presents several recent relevant and thoroughly verified and validated by comparison with experiments cfd works on the subject overlooked in cui et al 2019 and section 5 summarizes a few experimental studies important to validate the results presented in the previous section and the recent explanation of the cause of the hysteresis in owc wells turbine systems finally section 6 summarizes the results and draws some conclusions 2 the phenomenon hysteresis in owc wells turbine systems a wells turbine is an axial flow turbine consisting of a rotor usually with symmetric uncambered blades staggered at a 90 angle relative to the axis of rotation this turbine is used within oscillating water column owc systems which convert the sea wave motion into a bi directional flow of air the wells turbine transforms this energy into mechanical energy by means of the aerodynamic forces that are generated on the blades by the relative air motion as the mass flow passing through the turbine is always changing the blades experience a continuous variation in incidence angle and this corresponds to a continuous variation in the turbine operating point the hysteresis in owc turbine systems is a phenomenon that has been discussed largely since the 1990s it had been first found in experiments mainly in laboratory which replicated the owc device by means of a piston moving inside a chamber that alternatively pushed or pulled the air in a duct where the wells turbine was placed a schematic of the experimental setup used by setoguchi et al 1998 and others is shown in fig 1 the hysteretic loop appeared when turbine force coefficients were plotted as a function of piston speed an example of a typical hysteretic loop reported in the experiments from setoguchi et al 1998 is reproduced in fig 2 where ϕ p is the flow coefficient and p and t are the pressure drop and torque coefficients defined as follows 1 ϕ p v 2 x ω r m t t ρ ω 2 r m 5 p δ p ρ ω 2 r m 2 it is important to note how in the experiments setoguchi et al 1998 the flow speed v 2 x inside the turbine duct was not directly measured but rather calculated assuming zero mass accumulation inside the air chamber i e neglecting compressibility effects 2 v 2 x v p a 1 a 2 ϕ p v p ω r m a 1 a 2 3 the traditional explanation of the phenomenon not too long after their experimental studies professor setoguchi and his group presented an explanation of the causes of the hysteresis kim et al 2002 which was repeated in several other works by the same group of authors kinoue et al 2003 2004 2007 setoguchi et al 2003 mamun et al 2004 2005 and several more papers this explanation is summarized in the review paper by cui et al and attributes the cause of the hysteresis to the interaction of the vorticity shed by the blades with other vortical structures developing on its suction surface it is important to highlight how the cfd simulations used to explain the cause of the hysteresis did not include the full experimental system fig 1 but only considered the turbine duct fig 3 this means that the boundary condition i e the flow velocity was imposed at the duct inlet therefore assuming no compressibility or delay between the movement of the piston and the flow passing through the turbine a schematic of the computational domain used in kim et al 2002 kinoue et al 2003 2004 2007 setoguchi et al 2003 mamun et al 2004 2005 is shown in fig 3 their numerical results matched the experimental data with reasonable accuracy leading the authors to believe that the hysteresis was caused by an aerodynamic hysteresis of the turbine caused by the temporal variation in operating conditions it is interesting to note how a similar phenomenon hysteresis in the aerodynamic forces caused by the continuous variation in incidence angle had been studied for decades in oscillating airfoils and wings carr et al 1977 mccroskey 1981 ericsson and reding 1988 however oscillating airfoils and wings present hysteretic loops in their performance curves only at reduced frequencies orders of magnitude larger than the ones wells turbines operate at ghisu et al 2015 ghisu et al 2018 the reduced frequency is defined as follows 3 k π f c u where f is the frequency of the unsteady forcing the wave for a wells turbine c is the chord of the airfoil or blade and u is the average relative velocity of the flow for a wells turbine reduced frequencies are typically lower than 10 3 the values required to produce hysteresis in oscillating airfoils and wings are between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude larger ericsson and reding 1988 4 the recent explanation for the cause of the hysteresis the traditional explanation of the hysteresis was disputed in recent works ghisu et al 2015 ghisu et al 2018 ghisu et al 2017a ghisu et al 2017b ghisu et al 2018 which have been ignored by the review paper by cui et al 2019 these works replicated the same cfd analyses conducted by setoguchi and its group same numerical model boundary conditions and solution methods for several turbine and chamber geometries and showed how in all cases the alleged hysteresis disappears if the time step used for the temporal discretization is sufficiently reduced meaning that the hysteresis found in previous numerical simulations was likely to be generated by numerical errors it should be highlighted how none of the previous cfd works kim et al 2002 kinoue et al 2003 2004 2007 setoguchi et al 2003 mamun et al 2004 2005 presented an analysis of the sensitivity of the numerical results to the temporal discretization the asme journal of fluids engineering editorial policy statement on the control of numerical accuracy freitas 1993 highlights the importance of presenting results that are independent from the temporal discretization in time dependent solutions temporal accuracy must be demonstrated so that the spurious effects of phase error are shown to be limited ensuring the absence of numerical phase errors is of particular importance when studying a hysteresis which is itself a phase delay fig 4 reports the torque coefficient as a function of the flow coefficient for different values of the time step used to discretize the unsteady problem these results are taken from ghisu et al 2019 where the interested reader is referred to for more information about numerical approach spatial and temporal discretization verification and more detailed results it should be highlighted how the numerical approach has been chosen as close as possible to the one used by kim et al 2002 kinoue et al 2003 2004 2007 setoguchi et al 2003 mamun et al 2004 2005 similar results on different geometries have been presented in ghisu et al 2015 ghisu et al 2018 ghisu et al 2017a ghisu et al 2017b ghisu et al 2018 the actual cause of the hysteresis was found in ghisu et al 2015 ghisu et al 2018 ghisu et al 2017a ghisu et al 2017b by studying a domain more representative of the actual experimental setup of setoguchi et al 1998 the domain included the air chamber and the moving piston used to replicate the motion of the waves inside a real owc and is reported in fig 5 in ghisu et al 2015 ghisu et al 2018 ghisu et al 2017a ghisu et al 2017b the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were solved with compressible ideal gas hypothesis the turbulence problem was closed with the k ω sst model although other models were also tried for comparison a multi block structured grid consisting of a total of about 10 6 cells verified for spatial convergence was used and the y value was of the order of one for all the surface cells a dynamic mesh was used to simulate the moving piston and the consequent variation in chamber size the transient simulations were run for at least 3 piston periods ensuring that periodically stable results had been obtained with a time step sufficient to achieve time step independent results more details about the numerical model as well as a thorough verification of the spatial and temporal discretization approaches can be found in the cited papers fig 6 reproduced from ghisu et al 2018 reports results from a medium solidity turbine σ 0 57 in comparison with experimental non dimensional torque and pressure drop coefficients reported by setoguchi et al 1998 as a function of the global piston based flow coefficient ϕ p the numerical results closely reproduce the experimental data with the hysteresis largely discussed in previous works similar results have been obtained for different turbine and chamber geometries and are reported in ghisu et al 2015 ghisu et al 2018 ghisu et al 2017a ghisu et al 2017b the fact that when a time step verified for numerical accuracy is used the hysteresis is present only in simulations including the turbine chamber fig 5 and not in simulations with only the turbine duct fig 3 meant that the cause of the hysteresis was to be found in the compressibility of air inside the chamber this aspect was completely neglected in previous experimental and numerical studies piston based flow coefficient ϕ p and actual flow coefficient ϕ l calculated measuring the flow velocity one chord upstream of the turbine blade are reported in fig 7 the delay between piston and flow velocity is caused by the compressibility of the air inside the chamber and is the cause for the hysteretic loops reported in fig 6 and found in the experimental analyses of setoguchi setoguchi et al 1998 this is not a phenomenon unique to owc systems in pressure measurement systems the delay between the pressure that one wants to measure near the probe and the one that is actually measured in the transducer needs to be considered and is caused by the presence of a chamber tube system not dissimilar to the owc turbine system doebelin and manik 2007 being caused by compressibility effects in the chamber and not by turbine aerodynamics the hysteresis disappears when performance is reported as a function of the local flow coefficient ϕ l measured in the vicinity of the blade performance as a function of the local flow coefficient are reported in fig 8 the different vortical structures between acceleration and deceleration phases reported in kinoue et al 2003 and summarized by the authors of the original review paper cui et al 2019 are caused by the insufficient temporal discretization and disappear when the correct time step is used if the flow is analyzed for the same value of the local flow coefficient ϕ l an example taken from ghisu et al 2017a is reported in fig 9 where the contours of tangential vorticity for several positions along the blade chord are reported in fig 9a the formation of the two legs of the horseshoe vortex at the blade hub a is clear as well as the wake generated by the preceding blade and the clockwise vortex generated by the interaction of two successive suction side vortices with the wake b slightly more pronounced during deceleration the strength of the horseshoe vortices decreases toward the trailing edge fig 9a and 9b as the vortex pair moves away from the blade in fig 9b the formation of a tip leakage vortex can be noticed c the strength of this vortex is increased by the tip leakage flow moving toward the trailing edge of the blade fig 9c the strong tip leakage vortex is not dissipated easily and the vortex generated by the preceding blade is still evident further downstream d a corner separation with consequent boundary layer thickening is also present e these flow structures do not present any considerable differences between acceleration and deceleration phases as the hysteresis is generated by compressibility effects in the owc system and not by a different flow behavior 5 validation of the numerical results numerical errors are always present in numerical simulation and it is good practice to evaluate their extent and impact on the solution before analyzing any results this process is called verification and for unsteady cfd simulation it includes both spatial and temporal discretizations freitas 1993 verification has the objective of assessing the correctness of the numerical simulation of the governing equations it is distinct and different from the validation which determines how appropriate the chosen model is in representing the reality and is usually accomplished by comparing the numerical results with experimental data it is important to highlight how unambiguous validation can be achieved only once discretization and iteration errors are isolated only if computational uncertainties are negligible then the uncertainties resulting from the conceptual model can be obtained through validation rizzi and vos 1998 a thorough verification of the numerical results was presented in ghisu et al 2015 ghisu et al 2018 ghisu et al 2017a ghisu et al 2017b ghisu et al 2018 and this ensures that the numerical results are not affected by discretization error to verify that the numerical problem domain boundary conditions governing equations is a good representation of the reality the verified numerical results need to be compared with experimental data validation since the hypothesis that we want to prove is that the hysteresis in owc turbine systems is caused by compressibility in the chamber rather than by turbine aerodynamics the experiments need to measure both the piston speed and the flow velocity inside the turbine chamber this was done in the experiments from puddu et al paderi and puddu 2013 puddu et al 2014 that confirm that the hysteresis which is present when performance is presented as a function of the piston speed disappears when they are reported as a function of the local flow coefficient as shown in fig 10 the cause of the hysteresis is the compressibility of the air inside the owc chamber and not as erroneously assumed in earlier studies and as reported by cui et al 2019 an aerodynamic hysteresis of the turbine 6 conclusions in this manuscript a critical appraisal of the review paper by cui et al 2019 is presented in particular two limitations are discussed the description given for the phenomenon of the hysteresis in owc wells turbine systems appears quite outdated the most recent work cited kinoue et al 2004 is 15 years old and ignores some recent works that found a different explanation the authors of the original review paper foresee a larger use of unsteady cfd approaches for transient turbine analyses including the interaction between owc chamber and turbine ignoring that several studies have already been published on this topic the objective of this discussion paper is to fill these important gaps that are present in the review paper from cui et al 2019 in order to give the readers of this journal as an up to date overview of the existing literature as possible acknowledgements this work has been funded by the regione autonoma sardegna under grant f72f16002880002 l r 7 2 007 n 7 year 2015 
22173,this discussion is based on the paper by cui et al 2019 hereafter identified as the original authors or the original paper the original authors present a review on the application of cfd in the analysis of self rectifying turbines for owc wave energy conversion devices we feel that this review is incomplete as it overlooks a number of papers published in recent years that gave a new explanation for a phenomenon largely studied in the last two decades and discussed in the original paper the hysteresis in wells turbine performance in addition the original authors in their conclusions envisage a larger use of cfd in the coming years especially for the unsteady analysis of the chamber turbine interaction probably ignoring that several cfd studies focusing on this aspect have already been published in fact it is through three dimensional time dependent cfd studies of the unsteady interaction between chamber and turbine that the explanation of the cause of the hysteresis was found the objective of this discussion is to clarify two important aspects the chamber turbine interaction and the turbine hysteresis that in our opinion were not correctly analyzed in the original review paper by cui et al keywords cfd owc wells turbine systems hysteresis unsteady simulations 1 introduction the work by cui et al 2019 presents a review of the use of cfd in the analysis of self rectifying turbines wells and impulse used in owc systems one section section 3 2 1 focuses on a particular phenomenon that has been described and analyzed in owc wells turbine systems the difference in performance between the acceleration and deceleration phases i e when the mass flow through the turbine is increasing and decreasing respectively this phenomenon has been often referred to with the term hysteresis the description given to this phenomenon by the authors of the original paper appears quite outdated the most recent work cited kinoue et al 2004 is 15 years old and ignores some recent works that gave a different explanation for its cause while we do not expect the authors of a review paper to conduct themselves the analyses required to understand such a complex problem we would have appreciated a thorough and unbiased analysis of the existing literature which should have included the different existing explanations for this phenomenon the papers ignored by the authors of this review have all been published in the last 5 years involve three dimensional unsteady analyses of wells turbines including the simulation of the owc chamber while the majority of the referenced studies focus on steady simulations given the conclusions of the original paper in the near future it will be possible to realize a transformation from the quasi steady analysis to the transient simulation and investigate the unsteady performance of air turbines in a way that more closely reflects reality in addition the model of chamber turbine coupling can be established to predict the overall efficiency of owc system and facilitate turbine selection according to different design conditions we feel that the clarifications presented in this discussion are necessary the rest of this discussion is organized as follows section 2 introduces the phenomenon of the hysteresis in owc wells turbine systems section 3 summarized the early experimental and numerical studies on the topic section 4 presents several recent relevant and thoroughly verified and validated by comparison with experiments cfd works on the subject overlooked in cui et al 2019 and

22174,this work is a response to the discussion paper by ghisu t and cambuli f on our recent review paper ciu er al 2019 published in ocean engineering two main reasons are given for the exclusion of parts of their papers from our review first our literature retrieval process was not able to use any published work from after our submission date nor any work with considerable and inappropriate self duplications under the academic criterion of citing references second we are skeptical of ghisu s transient model which employed a multiple reference frame model to coordinate with unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and was unconvincing due to the lack of sufficient validation 1 introduction this work is a response to the discussion paper by ghisu t and cambuli f on our recent review paper cui et al 2019 published in ocean engineering the comments claimed that our review was incomplete because we had overlooked several published papers from their research group and they claimed that these papers gave a new and accurate explanation for the hysteresis of the wells turbine and the dynamic interactions between the chamber and the air turbine their attention is appreciated as is this valuable opportunity provided by the editor in chief to discuss our work in further detail in this reply we clarify the principle of selecting reference literature and the reason we excluded parts of their papers from our review it was also found that ghisu et al may lack sufficient recognition of chamber turbine coupling and what the real transient simulation of air turbines signifies overall our reply is organized point by point to address all comments raised by ghisu et al and to complement our review work 2 principle of citing reference literature reply to the comment this review is incomplete we the authors conducted a review of cfd studies on axial flow self rectifying turbines for owc wave energy conversion through literature retrieval in total 156 reference studies were cited in the review cui et al 2019 the principle was to extensively select high quality literature generally accepted by the community with respect to previous typical research achievements moreover the authors also tried to provide the readers with a scientific overview on this specific topic for the hysteresis work conducted by ghisu et al we have cited their typical paper as proposed in the discussion ref ghisu et al 2015 which was published before we finished and submitted our review to the journal it is curious and captious to force review authors to add papers published after submission of the review itself in the discussion ref ghisu et al 2018 if this were so all reviews would suffer from a process of endless labor and amendment authors must reserve the right to select the papers that meet their own standards in terms of the other three works ghisu urged us to cite in the discussion refs ghisu et al 2016 2017a 2017b considerable and inappropriate self duplications in our opinion could be found especially in the results and discussion sections which we found to be inappropriate to be included in our review in addition ghisu et al should take note of the review conducted by falcão et al 2018 which commented on the hysteresis phenomena caused by stall at the rotor blades when the critical flow rate was exceeded followed by boundary layer reattachment in the receding flow rate no paper by the team of ghisu et al was cited in fact shehata et al have an identical viewpoint on the hysteresis effects that is that they are caused by asymmetry in the boundary layer development on the blade surface and the oscillating motion of the wake the extent of which can be appreciable at low reynolds numbers shehata et al 2016 similarly no comments from ghisu et al on the hysteresis effects were cited it is in our opinion inappropriate to make a simple assertion as to whether academic content is right or wrong this should be left to the judgement of the scientific community in our review we show respect towards each academic contribution and provide a more comprehensive overview to the readership especially on viewpoints that differ from the previous results therefore we still included some work without any inappropriate self duplication problems from ghisu et al 3 supplemental statement on perspectives of transient cfd simulations reply to the same transient cfd studies of the owc turbine coupling were overlooked by the authors it was discussed that in section 5 3 of the review with the development of experimental and cfd techniques research activity into owc technology had moved on to the establishment of a wave to wire model for the prediction of overall efficiency the exploration of chamber turbine coupling mechanisms and practical applications in prototype plants cui et al 2019 several attempts have been made to study the combination of chamber and air turbines using theoretical experimental and numerical methods however most previous studies were based on the simplified assumption of turbine damping with a substitute replacing the air turbine which means that the interaction between the air chamber and turbines was still under a one way simulation recently it has become possible to realize an actual two way simulation of the overall owc system using the turbine directly in the model in our opinion ghisu et al misunderstood the concept of chamber turbine coupling therefore we would like to clarify it here the discussed wave to wire model or chamber turbine model is a coupling model covering the entire process of the overall system from wave input to turbine or electric output the coupling or interaction exists between the hydrodynamic process of wave energy absorption and the aerodynamic process of turbine power take off it is affected by the relationship between pressure in the air chamber and air flow rate through the turbine the so called damping effect falcão et al 2016 however the cfd model proposed by ghisu et al only simulated the piston motion which in their opinion was simply equivalent to the motion of the free water surface inside the chamber their model ignored the similarity laws of coupling model and the interaction between the wave elevation and the turbine rotation the forced motion of the piston is evidently different from the actual dynamic effects of the turbine on the free surface elevation these are related through the air pressure variation in the chamber furthermore there was no validation work such as by comparing the numerical results with experimental wave flume test data of a model scale or prototype scale owc it is obvious that the cfd study of ghisu et al with forced piston assumptions could not be regarded as a practical and precise model of chamber turbine coupling therefore all the works ghisu urged us to cite were inconsistent with the main idea of section 5 3 4 reply to the numerical study by ghisu et al from the perspective of the wells turbine we thought the cfd model by ghisu et al was not an exact transient simulation of the hysteretic phenomenon although the flow condition was modeled to be unsteady the employment of the multiple reference frame mrf model with this piston condition in their work is another confusing point it is well known that the mrf model is a steady state approximation that is the turbine motion is considered to be of a steady state it completely neglects the unsteady interactions between the stationary and rotating components such as flow unsteadiness due to pressure waves and wakes neither the rotor nor the blade actually rotated the user s guide of ansys fluent also emphasizes that the mrf model should be used only for the steady state calculation although it can be set up in the unsteady options with a sinusoidal profiled air flow inlet condition in the software it is extremely dubious for the unsteady calculations and is not recommended by ansys fluent ansysinc 2011 hence we are skeptical of the reliability and accuracy of the application of the mrf model employed in most of ghisu et al s papers which seem to lack sufficient and convincing validations from actual unsteady turbine experiments or wave flume tests in addition as ghisu et al stressed a complete benchmark should at least include spatial and temporal discretization verification and validation with experimental data however by the submission date of our review we could not find a complete benchmark test for ghisu s full geometry model in any single published work their so called verification works were based on setoguchi s simplified geometry model and they analyzed in great detail the effects of time step and mesh number on the numerical results while rough and limited comparisons with experimental data were presented to convince readers of the reliability and accuracy of their numerical simulations in other words ghisu et al claimed that hysteresis would disappear when the time step was small enough but what we are most concerned with is which setting is closer to the experimental results with this in mind we decided to publish our reservations about their numerous works discussion refs ghisu et al 2016 2017a 2017b that lack solid validation ghisu et al emphasized the concept of reduced frequency they proposed the values required to produce hysteresis in oscillating airfoils and wings were between one and two orders of magnitude larger discussion ref ericsson and reding 1988 based on a conclusion obtained from a totally different topic 30 years ago ghisu et al arbitrarily negated any possibility of the existence of aerodynamic hysteresis because the reduced frequencies of a wells turbine are typically lower than 10 3 in our opinion this is unconvincing without any additional exploration and validation ignoring the fact that the wells turbine airfoil has no oscillating motion in their study ghisu et al claimed that the compressibility of air inside the chamber should be responsible for hysteretic loops of pressure drop and torque which is another confusing explanation according to the work by falcão and henriques 2014 2019 sheng and lewis sheng and lewis 2016 and viviano et al 2018 the spring like air compressibility effect only exists in prototypes or large scale models and is always difficult to find in small scale model testing because simulating air compressibility is of great importance in accurately estimating the power efficiency of the owc chamber model prototype similarity should be addressed for the scale ratio of the air chamber volume as the square of the length ratio a simple way to satisfy the proposed scale ratio in the wave flume test is to connect the modeled air chamber to a rigid walled air reservoir with an appropriate volume as shown in fig 1 we are doubtful of whether the air compressibility effect could be captured in the small scale experimental apparatus of puddu et al as it had a very limited volume and relatively small air flow velocities ghisu et al also failed to verify that the air compressibility existed in their experimental facility and numerical models how can a physical phenomenon be explained by another unprovable physical process although we make no critical judgement on a specific topic such as the hysteresis effects of the wells turbine papers will not be chosen for review that focus on the cfd model which as previously mentioned lacks the necessary and convincing verification and validation 5 necessity of a real transient simulation although steady state tests in both experimental and numerical studies can provide a fundamental overview of the turbine performance the actual operating state of the turbine under the sinusoidal or irregular air flow conditions must be unsteady even under the forced rotation mode with fixed speeds the mrf model has its natural limits on these aforementioned tasks which cannot be accomplished by employing a simple piston model at the inlet to reveal the actual aerodynamic performance of the owc turbine for further optimization and control it is necessary to establish a numerical model with proper setup and validations to generate an actual flow condition and the simulation environment coupled with the chamber our team has been studying the unsteady and transient aerodynamic performance of an owc axial flow impulse turbine experimentally and numerically a fully passive flow driven model was established based on newton s second law and the sliding mesh sm model as shown in fig 2 liu et al 2018 2019a compared to the mrf model the turbine in this model rotates in an absolute reference frame the rotation of the turbine is fully determined by the torque acting on the rotor which can be integrated from the pressure distribution at each time step as the turbine rotates to a newly upgraded position the flow field and pressure distribution will be updated again for torque calculation the rotation speed variation is fully determined by the incident condition and the interactions between the turbine and the air flow which is not preset and fixed manually according to the user guide of ansys fluent the sliding mesh model will not neglect the unsteady interactions which account for the relative motion of the stator and rotor ansysinc 2011 we completely agree that both verification and validation studies are of immense importance to ensure the reliability and accuracy of numerical simulation our verification work included time step and grid independence studies and the validation work was presented by comparing the numerical and experimental results of the variations of angular velocity load torque and total pressure difference in detail under the same conditions liu et al 2018 2019a the benchmark was conducted sufficiently in advance of the numerical study we admit that our transient turbine model is still in its preliminary stage and not fully developed it is still able to provide additional information compared to traditional steady state studies such as the transient variations of the pressure distribution and flow fields with wake development we explained the mechanism by which the turbine maintains a one way rotation in the sinusoidal profiled air flows in the stable stage under free load conditions which cannot be explained easily by steady state studies liu et al 2018 wake development in the downstream section and the asymmetrical distributions of pressure in a cycle fig 3 were also reported liu et al 2019a the direct simulations of self starting characteristics in this study fig 4 also provide more information and potential for further transient studies especially the time evolving development of that which most interests us including the influence of historical flow fields turbine blade positions and pressure distributions the interactions between the rotor and stator may also be studied all of the aforementioned potential and interesting areas of research could pave the way for further investigations including the transient timely turbine behavior under complicated irregular wave conditions to predict turbine power output wave to wire performance geometry optimization and controlling strategies furthermore although turbine substitution could provide the damping effect to the air chamber complicated nonlinear aerodynamic behaviors and real interactions with the chamber cannot be represented especially in reciprocating air flows our team has commenced the study of chamber turbine coupling using an experimental method liu et al 2019 in this study we installed an impulse turbine directly on a model scale owc system instead of using an orifice as a substitution owing to the complexity of the turbine structure as shown in fig 5 therefore this experimental study was expected to better reflect actual interactions between the chamber and the air turbine at the model scale level fig 6 a direct simulation model of the chamber turbine system is also under development to achieve an actual simulation of the entire owc device without any substitutions 6 conclusion for the reasons given herein the requirement of citing several works by ghisu et al would not be appropriate or acceptable for our review work firstly our literature retrieval process could not accept any studies published after our submission date or indeed any with considerable and inappropriate self duplications under the academic criterion of citing references secondly we are skeptical of the transient model of ghisu et al employing the mrf model to coordinate with urans equations their validation works in our opinion had the disadvantages of monotonous comparison parameters insufficient results analysis and lack of experimental comparisons this does not convincingly ensure the reliability and accuracy of their numerical model furthermore ghisu et al may have misunderstood the concept of chamber turbine coupling and air compressibility effects their cfd model only simulated the steady state problems with the unsteady motions of pistons in addition the hysteretic loops of pressure drop and torque induced by the compressibility of air inside the chamber could not be concluded using their small scale experimental or numerical setup without considering model prototype similarity and air flow velocities

22174,this work is a response to the discussion paper by ghisu t and cambuli f on our recent review paper ciu er al 2019 published in ocean engineering two main reasons are given for the exclusion of parts of their papers from our review first our literature retrieval process was not able to use any published work from after our submission date nor any work with considerable and inappropriate self duplications under the academic criterion of citing references second we are skeptical of ghisu s transient model which employed a multiple reference frame model to coordinate with unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and was unconvincing due to the lack of sufficient validation 1 introduction this work is a response to the discussion paper by ghisu t and cambuli f on our recent review paper cui et al 2019 published in ocean engineering the comments claimed that our review was incomplete because we had overlooked several published papers from their research group and they claimed that these papers gave a new and accurate explanation for the hysteresis of the wells turbine and the dynamic interactions between the chamber and the air turbine their attention is appreciated as is this valuable opportunity provided by the editor in chief to discuss our work in further detail in this reply we clarify the principle of selecting reference literature and the reason we excluded parts of their papers from our review it was also found that ghisu et al may lack sufficient recognition of chamber turbine coupling and what the real transient simulation of air turbines signifies overall our reply is organized point by point to address all comments raised by ghisu et al and to complement our review work 2 principle of citing reference literature reply to the comment this review is incomplete we the authors conducted a review of cfd studies on axial flow self rectifying turbines for owc wave energy conversion through literature retrieval in total 156 reference studies were cited in the review cui et al 2019 the principle was to extensively select high quality literature generally accepted by the community with respect to previous typical research achievements moreover the authors also tried to provide the readers with a scientific overview on this specific topic for the hysteresis work conducted by ghisu et al we have cited their typical paper as proposed in the discussion ref ghisu et al 2015 which was published before we finished and submitted our review to the journal it is curious and captious to force review authors to add papers published after submission of the review itself in the discussion ref ghisu et al 2018 if this were so all reviews would suffer from a process of endless labor and amendment authors must reserve the right to select the papers that meet their own standards in terms of the other three works ghisu urged us to cite in the discussion refs ghisu et al 2016 2017a 2017b considerable and inappropriate self duplications in our opinion could be found especially in the results and discussion sections which we found to be inappropriate to be included in our review in addition ghisu et al should take note of the review conducted by falcão et al 2018 which commented on the hysteresis phenomena caused by stall at the rotor blades when the critical flow rate was exceeded followed by boundary layer reattachment in the receding flow rate no paper by the team of ghisu et al was cited in fact shehata et al have an identical viewpoint on the hysteresis effects that is that they are caused by asymmetry in the boundary layer development on the blade surface and the oscillating motion of the wake the extent of which can be appreciable at low reynolds numbers shehata et al 2016 similarly no comments from ghisu et al on the hysteresis effects were cited it is in our opinion inappropriate to make a simple assertion as to whether academic content is right or wrong this should be left to the judgement of the scientific community in our review we show respect towards each academic contribution and provide a more comprehensive overview to the readership especially on viewpoints that differ from the previous results therefore we still included some work without any inappropriate self duplication problems from ghisu et al 3 supplemental statement on perspectives of transient cfd simulations reply to the same transient cfd studies of the owc turbine coupling were overlooked by the authors it was discussed that in section 5 3 of the review with the development of experimental
