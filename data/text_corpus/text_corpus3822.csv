19110,metabolic division of labor is a key ecological strategy in bacteria to allow concurrent execution of multiple tasks through functional differentiation and metabolite exchange while it is prevalent in nature a lot of novel interactions remain to be further explored for improved wastewater biological treatment here we present a combined experimental and modeling study on the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and thiocyanate from wastewater by using a syntrophic microbial community the syntrophic division of labor was achieved by coupling autotrophic denitrification ad and anaerobic ammonium oxidation an through both cooperative and competitive interactions we demonstrated that the syntrophic community can achieve almost complete removal of all pollutants under certain initial conditions we then perturbed the initial condition by varying the concentration ratio between ammonium to thiocyanate as well as the biomass ratio between ad and an our observations show that adding ammonium negatively impacts the thiocyanate removal efficiency and adding anammox bacteria have opposite effects on the removal efficiency of thiocyanate and ammonium using a mathematical model we simultaneously varied these two initial conditions and identified the parameter regime where our syntrophic ecosystem can be most efficient in removing total nitrogen by highlighting the utility of syntrophic pair of functional bacteria in removing pollutants our study will facilitate the rational design of more complex microbial consortia for the removal of toxic and hazardous compounds from

a major environmental problem that challenges the world and ammonium is the primary source among all nitrogen pollutants gonzalez martinez et al 2016 ma et al 2017a b the current biological approaches for removing ammonium from wastewater include nitrate and nitrite pathways with the latter requiring less energy and chemical reagents zhou et al 2018 compared to the nitrate pathway which oxidizes ammonium to nitrate the nitrite pathway oxidizes ammonium to nitrite and then reduces nitrite to nitrogen gas with organic matter ammonium or reductive sulfur compounds as electron donors the nitrite reduction process can be facilitated by denitrifying bacteria or by anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria chung et al 2014 corsino et al 2016 ge et al 2015 ma et al 2016 compared to denitrifying bacteria anammox bacteria oxidize ammonium by nitrite to produce nitrogen gas and can thus reduce ammonium in addition to nitrite however anammox bacteria has a very slow growth rate with a doubling time 10 14 days at 30 40 c lin and wang 2017 when anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria are co cultured they compete for nitrite as the common substrate and the latter which grows faster tends to drive the former to extinction in the long run studies showed that anammox activity decreased with elevated cod concentrations where anammox bacteria are incapable to compete with heterotrophic denitrifiers when cod n ratios exceed 1 0 chen et al 2016 guven et al 2005 the problem of competitive exclusion mentioned above can be solved by providing thiocyanate as the electron donor for nitrite reduction pan et al 2018a residual of nitrite and the production of ammonium are observed and reported in simultaneous removal of thiocyanate and nitrite using autotrophic

removed through extraction distill flocculation chemical precipitation activated adsorption and anaerobic digestion from wastewater gould et al 2012 in spite of this it can be efficiently degraded aerobic and anoxic through microbial process coupled with denitrification pan et al 2018a it is worth noting that bacteria that carry out denitrification via break down of thiocyanate are autotrophs taking the autotrophic nature of anammox bacteria into account the denitrification anammox coupling implements an entirely autotrophic nitrogen removal system which is considered to be the most efficient and economical approach especially for wastewater with low carbon to nitrogen ratio liang et al 2015 although there have been a few attempts to apply dol in water purification ma et al 2017a b examples with complex interactions that involve both cooperation and competition are still rare in this study we first constructed an active sludge ecosystem by coupling autotrophic bacteria and anammox bacteria in batch culture and demonstrated the feasibility of using this ecosystem to remove nitrogen from thiocyanate containing wastewater to identify the operational conditions for efficient nitrogen removal we further explored the effects of ammonium to thiocyanate ratio and biomass ratio of anammox xan to autotrophic denitrifying xad bacteria on thiocyanate ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiency dynamic transformation of various nitrogen containing compounds during wastewater treatment were also examined when ad are an are cultured alone or co cultured finally we developed a mathematical model and used it to predict the outcomes when ammonium to thiocyanate ratio and bacterial biomass ratio are co varied at the same time this study will advance our basic understanding of dol and microbial syntropy in wastewater treatment while also benefiting the design and application of the autotrophic denitrification anammox coupling process in the treatment of wastewater that contains thiocyanate 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of seed sludge the seed sludge of autotrophic denitrifying biomass was originally obtained from a 5 l anoxic sequencing batch reactor sbr with synthetic wastewater containing thiocyanate and nitrite while the anammox sludge was collected from a laboratory scale 15 l up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor fed with synthetic wastewater containing ammonium and nitrite the nitrogen loading rates of denitrification reactors is 0 5 kg n m3 d 16s rdna analysis reveal that the thiobacillus genus accounts for more than 38 of the denitrifying biomass pan et al 2018a both sludge samples collected from sbr and uasb reactors were washed with phosphate buffer 0 14 g l kh2po4 and 0 75 g l k2hpo4 prior to use kscn nano2 and nh4cl were provided as substrates in experiments and nahco3 was provided as the inorganic carbon source at the concentration of 1 0 g l the synthetic contaminated water also contained 0 55 g l nah2po4 2h2o and 2 11 g l k2hpo4 3h2o as buffers as well as 0 2 ml l trace element the trace element stock solution contains 1 25 g l edta 0 55 g l znso4 7h2o 0 40 g l cocl2 6h2o 1 275 g l mncl2 4h2o

reached about 7 5 0 1 2 2 effects of nh4 n scn n ratio and xan xad ratio on pollutants removal in general these batch tests were carried out using 120 ml serum vial containing 100 ml mixture of synthetic wastewater and sludge under anoxic conditions the vial was sealed with a butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp seal the headspace of the sealed bottle was purged with n2 gas to remove dissolved oxygen the bottles were set on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm at 30 1 cwith 48 h the initial conditions for these experiments are described below 1 the effects of ad 350 mg mlss l an 1400 mg mlss l and their co culture ad 350 mg mlss l and an 1400 mg mlss l on thiocyanate ammonium and nitrogen removal were investigated with initial 25 mg n l thiocyanate and 75 mg n l nitrite 2 the effects of nh4 n scn n ratio 0 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 on thiocyanate ammonium and nitrogen removal were investigated with initial 25 mg n l thiocyanate and 75 mg n l nitrite in the co culture of ad 350 mg mlss l and an 1400 mg mlss l 3 the effects of xan xad ratio 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 on thiocyanate ammonium and nitrogen removal were investigated with initial 25 mg n l thiocyanate 75 mg n l nitrite 75 mg n l ammonium and 350 mg mlss l of ad in the co culture of ad and an experiments on nh4 n scn n and xan xad ratios were perform with a main aim to understand the cooperative and competitive interactions between autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria under nitrite limited condition the production of nitrite from ammonium and or thiocyanate requires energy input understanding the process behaviors under nitrite limited condition is beneficial for an economical implementation of the process the selected concentration for thiocyanate was within the range of wastewater containing thiocyanate huddy et al 2015 li et al 2011 similarly the nitrite concentration of 75 mg n l was within the range of effluent of partial or full nitritation process in industrial wastewaters such as coking wastewater 2 3 transformation of nitrogen containing compounds over time to investigate transformation of compounds containing nitrogen over time in ad an and their co culture batch tests were carried out using 1 l reactor under anoxic conditions and constant temperature 30 c mixing was performed with a magnetic stirrer over the entire period of experiments the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas in order to reduce dissolved oxygen do concentration to a level below 0 30 mg l samples were collected until nitrite and thiocyanate concentrations remain unchanged the initial conditions of these tests are listed in table 1 2 4 analytical methods the liquid samples collected during the experiments were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter nitrate and nitrite were measured using the ics 900 ion chromatograph dionex co usa thiocyanate was measured by the colorimetric method using ferric nitrate kim et al 2011 ammonia and the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were analyzed according to standard methods apha 2005 the ph of solutions was determined with the phs 3c ph meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd china the total

et al 2015 for describing the autotrophic denitrification and anammox in well mixed batch reactors in this model we considered two bacterial groups autotrophic denitrifying bacteria ad and anammox bacteria an which form a microbial community through syntrophic exchange of electron acceptors for simplicity we assume zero dissolved oxygen do level because do was removed with n2 gas the anaerobic endogenous respiration and death of bacteria have been neglected due to short reaction time during batch experiments in our simplified model we described the kinetics of bacteria growth consumption of thiocyanate as well as production and consumption of nitrate nitrite and ammonium since cells use some substrate electrons for energy production and the rest for synthesis of new cell materials the overall reactions describe combine transformations of substrates and cell growth by the appropriate molar stoichiometric ratios the detailed information of kinetic rate expressions stoichiometry and parameter values are described in supplementary file 1 3 results 3 1 feasibility of pollutants removal by syntrophic microbial community the nitrogen loading rates of anammox reactor is 1 2 kg n m3 d 16s rdna analysis reveal that the anammox bacterium candidatus kuenenia accounts for approximately 14 4 of the anammox biomass the major 16s rdna sequences of anammox biomass have been submitted to genbank with the accession numbers srp158089 the pollutant removal by a mixture of denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge was performed in the batch mode the details of experimental design are described in the materials and methods section to examine the effects of the coculture of ad and an on pollutant removal we designed three batch runs that correspond to single cultures of ad and an as well as their co culture for comparison purposes the initial concentrations of 25 0 mg n l thiocyanate and 75 0 mg n l nitrite were added to the mixed activated sludges in all three experiments when an was cultured alone thiocyanate and nitrite remained the same levels as their initial values due to the lack of ammonium the electron donor that sustains anammox metabolism when ad was cultured alone thiocyanate was completely removed but nitrite was only partially converted to nitrogen gas due to a lack in the availability of electron donor thiocyanate for nitrite reduction the total production of ammonium and the residual level of nitrite are 23 6 and 25 0 mg n l respectively using these numbers we then calculated their removal efficiency and found that 66 7 of the nitrite and 51 4 of the total nitrogen are reduced compared to the single culture of ad its co culture with an can simultaneously consume the residual nitrite and the undesired by product ammonium by the anammox bacteria as a result the availability of electron donor thiocyanate for denitrification is no longer limiting and near perfect removal of nitrite and thiocyanate was observed with only minimal production of ammonium 2 0 mg n l consistently the total nitrogen removal efficiency reaches 98 suggesting that the syntrophic two species microbial community performs its function almost perfectly for the specific initial condition of pollutant ratio i e nitrite to thiocyanate 3 1 3 2 the impacts of perturbed initial ammonium to thiocyanate ratio nh4 n scn n on pollutant removal nitrite is the common electron acceptor for both ad and an metabolism under nitrite limitation the ratio between thiocyanate and ammonium nh4 n scn n which are the electron donors of ad and an respectively serves as a controlling factor that tunes the relative competitive ability between the two species on nitrite and will thereby influence the effects of the co culture of ad and an on pollutant removal we consequently explored the effects of nh4 n scn n ratio on thiocyanate and ammonium removal in the co culture after addition of 75 0 mg n l initial nitrite and 25 0 mg n l initial thiocyanate nitrite to thiocyanate 3 1 as well we varied the initial nh4 n scn n ratio in a wide range 0 0 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 by adding ammonium the resulted initial concentrations of ammonium are 0 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 30 0 37 5 50 0 and 75 0 mg n l respectively fig 2a after reaction termination i e steady state nitrite was not detected for all these different ratios fig 2b suggesting that nitrite is the rate limiting substrate in other words initial nitrite of 75 mg n l is inadequate to sustain conversion of all nitrogen in thiocyanate and ammonium to nitrogen gas which has been confirmed by the detection of residual concentrations of thiocyanate 0 0 3 7 4 0 5 3 5 8 8 4 8 6 and 9 3 mg n l and ammonium 2 0 7 9 12 0 14 7 19 4 20 8 32 8 and 55 3 mg n l in the bioreactor although neither thiocyanate nor ammonium was completely removed the absolute removal amounts of both compounds show opposite trends namely the decreasing and increasing amounts of thiocyanate and ammonium removal at higher nh4 n scn n ratio respectively the absolute removal amount of thiocyanate decreased from 25 0 to 15 7 mg n l with increasing nh4 n scn n ratio while that of ammonium increased from 2 0 19 7 mg n l fig 2b the percentage of nitrite removed by the anammox bacterial population can also be influenced by the initial nh4 n scn n ratio as shown in fig 3a and b respectively the contribution of an on the removal of both nitrite 40 5 50 0 51 1 53 0 52 5 58 5 59 2 7 and 62 3 and total nitrogen 48 3 56 5 57 5 58 9 58 6 63 3 63 8 and 66 0 increases with the nh4 n scn n ratio confirming a key role of the ratio that plays in promoting nitrite reduction through the anammox pathway and thereby regulating the degree of competition between ad and an here the total nitrogen was calculated as the sum of scn n nh4 n and no2 n but not no3 n which was not detected before and after reaction although the removal efficiency of total nitrogen decreased from 98 0 to 63 1 fig 3b its absolute removal amount increased from 98 0 to 110 0 mg n l fig 2 consistent with the observed increase of the contribution of an on nitrite removal fig 3a the anammox pathway converts nitrogen from both ammonium and nitrite to the nitrogen gas and thus removes more total nitrogen than the denitrification pathway 3 3 the impacts of perturbed initial biomass ratio between ad and an xan xad on pollutant removal since ad and an play complementary roles in removing thiocyanate and ammonium the relative biomass fraction of ad and an in the co culture can be another influencing factor for the removal of pollutants under nitrite limitation we thus examined the effects of xan xad on thiocyanate ammonium and total nitrogen removal by adding anammox sludge in the 350 mg mlss l denitrifying sludge other initial conditions include 25 0 mg n l scn n 75 0 mg l no2 n and 75 0 mg l nh4 n as shown in fig 4a thiocyanate was completely removed in the range of xan xad less than 2 0 while its removal efficiency was reduced from 100 0 to 43 1 as xan xad increases from 2 0 to 7 0 in contrast both absolute amount and efficiency of ammonium removal showed opposite trends to those of thiocyanate it is interesting to note that the removal efficiency of ammonium is negative for xan xad less than 1 0 and positive otherwise fig 4b this is because the steady state concentration of ammonium is determined by the weighted sum of its production by ad and degradation by an with the weights reflecting xan xad in the absence of anammox sludge i e xan xad 0 0 ammonium was purely produced and its removal efficiency is therefore the most negative 33 3 when the initial biomass concentration between ad and an is equal i e xan xad 1 0 the concentration of anammox sludge is low and the removal efficiency is still negative 7 7 indicating higher rate of ammonium production by ad compared to that of ammonium removal by an for even larger xan xad the ammonium removal efficiency starts to become positive indicating that the anammox bacteria start to dominate the population over the denitrifying bacteria additionally the contributions of anammox bacterial population on nitrite removal 0 33 8 46 3 52 7 62 6 65 5 68 7 and 74 6 increases with xan xad causing enhanced degradation of total nitrogen as well fig 4c 3 4 dynamic transformation of nitrogen containing compounds in ad an and their co culture to explore the dynamic profiles of various nitrogen containing pollutants thiocyanate ammonium nitrite and nitrate under different initial conditions we performed four experiments where ad and an were either cultured alone or co cultured the initial concentrations of the pollutants and bacterial biomass for these experiments are listed in table 1 the variations of no2 n scn n nh4 n and no3 n concentrations over time are given in fig 5 showing qualitative differences in the dynamic transformation of the pollutants across different initial conditions for thiocyanate the complete depletion of thiocyanate was observed when ad was cultured alone fig 5a or co cultured with an in the absence of ammonium fig 5c however only 62 1 of the initial thiocyanate was removed in fig 5d where the same experimental setting as fig 5c was applied with the only exception of adding 75 0 mg n l initial ammonium the residual thiocyanate can be understood as the consequence of competitive inhibition of ad by an when nitrite is the limiting growth substrate when an was cultured alone concentration of thiocyanate remained a constant level about 25 0 mg n l throughout all the time fig 5b for all initial conditions the measured degradation rates of thiocyanate are 47 2 0 0 14 5 and 11 3 mg n g mlss d respectively nitrite was completely removed in three out of four experiments as long as an is present when ad was cultured alone fig 5a the residual concentration of nitrite in the bioreactor is roughly 33 3 of its initial value we further measured the nitrite reduction rate for all experiments and their values are 95 2 81 1 46 8 87 3 mg n g mlss d respectively nitrate was produced when an is co cultured with ad fig 5d or cultured alone fig 5b however their dynamic profiles are qualitatively different from each other in fig 5d nitrate concentration increases initially and then starts to decrease at 12 h the highest accumulation of nitrate is 2 2 mg n l but its final concentration is zero in fig 5b nitrate was continuously produced over time until reaching a plateau 14 7 mg n l ammonium was not initially added in fig 5a and c but in fig 5b and d 75 0 mg n l ammonium were given at the beginning of the experiments the production of ammonium increases over time and reaches a final concentration of 23 6 mg n l when ad was cultured alone fig 5a when anammox sludge was added only minimal production of ammonium was observed and its concentration remains stable at about 2 0 mg n l over time fig 5c by comparing fig 5b and d we found that the time courses of ammonium are qualitatively similar but quantitatively different in terms of the removal efficiency which are 75 3 and 25 9 in fig 5b and d respectively compared to the co culture the removal efficiency of ammonium was higher when an was cultured alone because ad in the co culture produces rather than consumes ammonium 3 5 mathematical model we have constructed a mathematical model to predict the kinetics of bacteria growth thiocyanate consumption and consumption and production of nitrate nitrite and ammonium based on the diagram shown in fig 6a for model validation we have compared our simulation results with all experimental data presented in figs 2 5 supplementary fig 1 showing good agreement between each other with this model we performed computational analysis of the removal efficiency of thiocyanate fig 6b nitrite fig 6c ammonium fig 6d and total nitrogen fig 6e when both initial ammonium to thiocyanate ratio and initial biomass ratio between ad and an were varied we found that the removal efficiency of thiocyanate remains nearly 100 unless both initial ratios take large values fig 6b in contrast the nitrite removal efficiency does not respond to the change of the ammonium to thiocyanate ratio but increases with the biomass ratio fig 6c taken together we numerically confirmed our experimental finding that the requirements for high removal efficiency of thiocyanate and ammonium are opposite to each other thiocyanate degradation was favored by low anammox to denitrifying bacteria biomass ratios while a high value of which was preferable for ammonium removal in addition the ammonium removal efficiency can be both positive or negative depending on the specific values of the two initial ratios finally we obtained the removal efficiency of total nitrogen and found that high removal efficiency can be achieved at joint condition of low ammonium concentration and high biomass ratio 4 discussion the use of microorganisms with diverse functions in activated sludge potentiates complex transformation of compounds and removal of pollutants from wastewaters in this study we designed and constructed an activated sludge process where two main functional bacteria perform tasks of denitrification and anammox respectively the denitrifying bacteria utilizes thiocyanate as an electron donor to reduce nitrite and produce ammonium during denitrification the initial 75 0 mg n l nitrite was reduced to 25 0 mg n l with complete degradation of 25 0 mg n l thiocyanate and production of 23 6 mg n l ammonium in the wastewater figs 1 and 5 a on the other hand ammonium and nitrite are converted into nitrogen gas and nitrate by anammox in the anaerobic condition the stoichiometric ratio of no2 n to nh4 n was found to be 1 32 and 11 2 of initial total nitrogen remains in form of nitrate in the anammox reaction chamber van hulle et al 2010 consistent with these previous observations 14 7 mg n l nitrate was produced in the anammox reaction when the initial total nitrogen included 75 0 mg n l ammonium and 75 0 mg n l nitrite fig 5 b despite of complete removal of thiocyanate and nitrite only 2 mg n l ammonium the end product of denitrification was detected in the co culture of the denitrifying and anammox sludge figs 1 and 5c moreover this value 2 0 mg n l is also significantly lower than the theoretical concentration 4 7 mg n l derived from the stoichiometry of anammox reaction the reason behind it is that ammonium produced from the degradation of thiocyanate can be rapidly oxidized to the nitrogen gas by the anammox bacteria thereby preventing its accumulation over time fig 5c similarly nitrate the end product of anammox was even not detected in the co culture figs 1 and 5c because it is quickly reduced to nitrite by thiocyanate in the denitrifying reaction as is generally known reduction of nitrate to inert nitrogen requires cooperation of nitrate and nitrite reductases and produces nitrite as the intermediate product in this study thiobacillus genus relative abundance 38 was the most abundant genera in the denitrifying sludge after acclimation with nitrite and thiocyanate although acclimated to nitrite it was found that thiobacillus genus uses both nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors to oxidize thiocyanate due to its metabolic versatility and bioenergetic flexibility pan et al 2018b collectively these results confirm the existence of bidirectional metabolic cross feeding interactions between denitrifying and anammox bacteria removal of pollutants and transformation of various compounds revealed the dynamic patterns for competitive and cooperative behavior between ad and an prevalent in nature these relationships are the key drivers that determine the ecological functions of a microbial community in this study ad consumes nitrate and produces ammonium while an consumes ammonium and produces nitrate thereby forming a cooperative interaction that cross feeds each other this ecological trait results in the simultaneous removal of thiocyanate nitrite and ammonium as well as near complete removal of total nitrogen from wastewater figs 1 and 5c consistent with previous literature findings bi et al 2015 it also leads to qualitatively different dynamics in the transformation of nitrogen containing compounds fig 5 it was reported that accumulation of toxic nitrite during ammonium oxidization can be prevented by the cooperation between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidation bacteria nob gujer 2010 similarly ammonium accumulated during denitrification severs as the substrate of anammox bacteria and can thus be rapidly transformed in our study other examples include the cooperation between alga and bacteria that functionally degrade toxic contaminant and production of lipids ryu et al 2014 and cooperation between candidatus competibacter and candidatus accumulibacter clade i that simultaneously removes phosphate and nitrate rubio rincón et al 2017 as nitrite is the common substrate of anammox and denitrifying microorganisms competition appears when nitrite becomes limited the competitive behavior can be examined by monitoring patterns of removal of pollutants and transformation of compounds at steady state and over time removal efficiency of thiocyanate was reduced by adding ammonium fig 2 and its trend was shown to be opposite to that of ammonium by increasing the ratio of anammox to denitrifying biomass fig 4 together with time course measurement of the transformation of nitrogen containing compounds fig 5 we have demonstrated the existence of competitive relationship between anammox and denitrifying microorganism in the co culture many other examples of microbial competition for shared nutrient have been reported in the literature for example kinetic competition between phosphorus release and denitrification was demonstrated under anoxic conditions and in the presence of acetate chuang et al 1996 in addition accumulibacter polyphosphate accumulating organisms have a higher affinity for oxygen and thus gain a competitive advantage over their competitors competibacter glycogen accumulating organisms at low dissolved oxygen levels carvalheira et al 2014 a third example is that growth of anammox bacteria can be significantly suppressed by heterotrophic denitrifiers due to the poorer competitive ability of the former for nitrite tang et al 2010 the estimation of parameter values was performed based on previous studies table s1 where values obtained were used as initial guesses to estimate their values in our system although not all of perimeters were found to follow a consistency the model was showed to have a good agreement with the experimental data which suggested the effectiveness of the model in certain extent in this study we have demonstrated that nitrogen containing wastewater pollutants including thiocyanate ammonium and nitrogen can be efficiently removed through the cooperation between denitrifying and anammox bacteria however their competition occurred when nitrite was limited which resulted in residual of thiocyanate and ammonium therefore the competition should be avoided for complete removal of ammonium and thiocyanate in real application through regulation ratio of electron donors sum of thiocyanate and ammonium to acceptor nitrite in the future application of this work might be presented in two forms fig 7 a for single wastewater containing ammonium and thiocyanate raw wastewater was partially fed into an oxic reactor o1 to achieve complete degradation of thiocyanate and partial or full nitritation subsequently o1 effluent was mixed with the rest part of raw wastewater was fed into a hydrolytic reactor h to achieve the removal of pollutants through coupling of autotrophic denitrification and anammox the toxic thiocyanate may pass by the nitritation process according to previous study thiocyanate with concentrations above 200 mg l seemed to inhibit nitrification but the inhibition effects was mainly due to the increased loading of ammonium produced from its biodegradation kim et al 2008 the ic50 of thiocyanate on partial nitritation pn sludge was 351 mg l and the pn sludge was insensitive to thiocyanate at levels lower than 43 3 mg l guo et al 2017 in the whole the within the concentration range commonly find in coking wastewater thiocyanate does not pose substantial threat to nitritation since partial or full nitritation is beyond the scope of this study the effect of thiocyanate on aob and full nitritation performance might be interesting to investigated in the future b for two waste streams wastewater i and ii containing ammonium and thiocyanate respectively wastewater i was feed into aerobic reactor o1 to achieve partial or full nitritation effluent of o1 reactor nitrite and wastewater ii were feed into h reactor to achieve removal of thiocyanate ammonium nitrite and nitrate using autotrophic denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation finally a small amount of residual pollutant such as ammonium might be further removed in subsequent oxic reactor o2 100 full nitritation was not a prerequisite in o1 reactor for a successful implementation of the process residual ammonium in nitritation process could be removed in subsequent h reactor through anammox using nitrite as an electron acceptor reino et al 2018 produced nitrate in nitritation could be also reduced to n2 with nitrite as intermediate in subsequent h reactor using thiocyanate as an electron donor pan et al 2018b in this study nitrate as a by product of anammox was reduced using thiocyanate as an electron donor therefore residual ammonium and produced nitrate in nitritation o1 reactor could be removed by the co culture of an and ad bacteria h reactor in the real application the relative abundance of the two functional bacterial groups might vary along with the changes in the operation conditions and the thiocyanate ammonium nitrite concentrations in system h reactor but by regulating the feeding patterns complete or nearly complete nitrogen removal is large achievable under various relative abundance ratios of anammox bacteria and autotrophic denitrifier in conclusion regulation of the ratio of electron donor sum of thiocyanate and ammonium to acceptor nitrite is key for complete removal of pollutants in h reactor regardless of application forms the regulation includes step feeding ratio r and nitritation degree the process is a promising alternative for the treatment of effluent from various industries such as coke production gold mining and plastic manufacturing which contain substantial amount of thiocyanate and or ammonium compared to single denitritation or anammox the combination of two technologies autotrophic denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation could remove more nitrogen and prevent the formation of nitrate in the process of purifying thiocyanate containing wastewater 5 conclusion in this study we demonstrated the feasibility of using syntrophic microbial community for wastewater treatment compared to single bacterial culture nearly complete removal of wastewater pollutants 98 was observed in the co culture of autotrophic denitrifying and anammox bacteria when the nitrite to thiocyanate ratio is 3 1 addition of ammonium decreased the removal of thiocyanate in the co culture and the removal efficiency of ammonium and thiocyanate showed opposite trends with the initial biomass ratio between the two species since nitrogen from both sources of ammonium and nitrite can be removed by anammox the higher contribution of anammox on nitrite removal the more total nitrogen was removed by developing a mathematical model from experimental data we further predicted that both low ammonium concentration and high biomass ratio are required for efficient removal of total nitrogen through both experimental analysis and computational modeling

19110,metabolic division of labor is a key ecological strategy in bacteria to allow concurrent execution of multiple tasks through functional differentiation and metabolite exchange while it is prevalent in nature a lot of novel interactions remain to be further explored for improved wastewater biological treatment here we present a combined experimental and modeling study on the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and thiocyanate from wastewater by using a syntrophic microbial community the syntrophic division of labor was achieved by coupling autotrophic denitrification ad and anaerobic ammonium oxidation an through both cooperative and competitive interactions we demonstrated that the syntrophic community can achieve almost complete removal of all pollutants under certain initial conditions we then perturbed the initial condition by varying the concentration ratio between ammonium to thiocyanate as well as the biomass ratio between ad and an our observations show that adding ammonium negatively impacts the thiocyanate removal efficiency and adding anammox bacteria have opposite effects on the removal efficiency of thiocyanate and ammonium using a mathematical model we simultaneously varied these two initial conditions and identified the parameter regime where our syntrophic ecosystem can be most efficient in removing total nitrogen by highlighting the utility of syntrophic pair of functional bacteria in removing pollutants our study will facilitate the rational design of more complex microbial consortia for the removal of toxic and hazardous compounds from

a major environmental problem that challenges the world and ammonium is the primary source among all nitrogen pollutants gonzalez martinez et al 2016 ma et al 2017a b the current biological approaches for removing ammonium from wastewater include nitrate and nitrite pathways with the latter requiring less energy and chemical reagents zhou et al 2018 compared to the nitrate pathway which oxidizes ammonium to nitrate the nitrite pathway oxidizes ammonium to nitrite and then reduces nitrite to nitrogen gas with organic matter ammonium or reductive sulfur compounds as electron donors the nitrite reduction process can be facilitated by denitrifying bacteria or by anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria chung et al 2014 corsino et al 2016 ge et al 2015 ma et al 2016 compared to denitrifying bacteria anammox bacteria oxidize ammonium by nitrite to produce nitrogen gas and can thus reduce ammonium in addition to nitrite however anammox bacteria has a very slow growth rate with a doubling time 10 14 days at 30 40 c lin and wang 2017 when anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria are co cultured they compete for nitrite as the common substrate and the latter which grows faster tends to drive the former to extinction in the long run studies showed that anammox activity decreased with elevated cod concentrations where anammox bacteria are incapable to compete with heterotrophic denitrifiers when cod n ratios exceed 1 0 chen et al 2016 guven et al 2005 the problem of competitive exclusion mentioned above can be solved by providing thiocyanate as the electron donor for nitrite reduction pan et al 2018a residual of nitrite and the production of ammonium are observed and reported in simultaneous removal of thiocyanate and nitrite using autotrophic

aerobic and anoxic through microbial process coupled with denitrification pan et al 2018a it is worth noting that bacteria that carry out denitrification via break down of thiocyanate are autotrophs taking the autotrophic nature of anammox bacteria into account the denitrification anammox coupling implements an entirely autotrophic nitrogen removal system which is considered to be the most efficient and economical approach especially for wastewater with low carbon to nitrogen ratio liang et al 2015 although there have been a few attempts to apply dol in water purification ma et al 2017a b examples with complex interactions that involve both cooperation and competition are still rare in this study we first constructed an active sludge ecosystem by coupling autotrophic bacteria and anammox bacteria in batch culture and demonstrated the feasibility of using this ecosystem to remove nitrogen from thiocyanate containing wastewater to identify the operational conditions for efficient nitrogen removal we further explored the effects of ammonium to thiocyanate ratio and biomass ratio of anammox xan to autotrophic denitrifying xad bacteria on thiocyanate ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiency dynamic transformation of various nitrogen containing compounds during wastewater treatment were also examined when ad are an are cultured alone or co cultured finally we developed a mathematical model and used it to predict the outcomes when ammonium to thiocyanate ratio and bacterial biomass ratio are co varied at the same time this study will advance our basic understanding of dol and microbial syntropy in wastewater treatment while also benefiting the design and application of the autotrophic denitrification anammox coupling process in the treatment of wastewater that contains thiocyanate 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of seed sludge the seed sludge of autotrophic denitrifying biomass was originally obtained from a 5 l anoxic sequencing batch reactor sbr with synthetic wastewater containing thiocyanate and nitrite while the anammox sludge was collected from a laboratory scale 15 l up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor fed with synthetic wastewater containing ammonium and nitrite the nitrogen loading rates of denitrification reactors is 0 5 kg n m3 d 16s rdna analysis reveal that the thiobacillus genus accounts for more than 38 of the denitrifying biomass pan et al 2018a both sludge samples collected from sbr and uasb reactors were washed with phosphate buffer 0 14 g l kh2po4 and 0 75 g l k2hpo4 prior to use kscn nano2 and nh4cl were provided as substrates in experiments and nahco3 was provided as the inorganic carbon source at the concentration of 1 0 g l the synthetic contaminated water also contained 0 55 g l nah2po4 2h2o and 2 11 g l k2hpo4 3h2o as buffers as well as 0 2 ml l trace element the trace element stock solution contains 1 25 g l edta 0 55 g l znso4 7h2o 0 40 g l cocl2 6h2o 1 275 g l mncl2 4h2o

reached about 7 5 0 1 2 2 effects of nh4 n scn n ratio and xan xad ratio on pollutants removal in general these batch tests were carried out using 120 ml serum vial containing 100 ml mixture of synthetic wastewater and sludge under anoxic conditions the vial was sealed with a butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp seal the headspace of the sealed bottle was purged with n2 gas to remove dissolved oxygen the bottles were set on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm at 30 1 cwith 48 h the initial conditions for these experiments are described below 1 the effects of ad 350 mg mlss l an 1400 mg mlss l and their co culture ad 350 mg mlss l and an 1400 mg mlss l on thiocyanate ammonium and nitrogen removal were investigated with initial 25 mg n l thiocyanate and 75 mg n l nitrite 2 the effects of nh4 n scn n ratio 0 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 on thiocyanate ammonium and nitrogen removal were investigated with initial 25 mg n l thiocyanate and 75 mg n l nitrite in the co culture of ad 350 mg mlss l and an 1400 mg mlss l 3 the effects of xan xad ratio 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 on thiocyanate ammonium and nitrogen removal were investigated with initial 25 mg n l thiocyanate 75 mg n l nitrite 75 mg n l ammonium and 350 mg mlss l of ad in the co culture of ad and an experiments on nh4 n scn n and xan xad ratios were perform with a main aim to understand the cooperative and competitive interactions between autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria under nitrite limited condition the production of nitrite from ammonium and or thiocyanate requires energy input understanding the process behaviors under nitrite limited condition is beneficial for an economical implementation of the process the selected concentration for thiocyanate was within the range of wastewater containing thiocyanate huddy et al 2015 li et al 2011 similarly the nitrite concentration of 75 mg n l was within the range of effluent of partial or full nitritation process in industrial wastewaters such as coking wastewater 2 3 transformation of nitrogen containing compounds over time to investigate transformation of compounds containing nitrogen over time in ad an and their co culture batch tests were carried out using 1 l reactor under anoxic conditions and constant temperature 30 c mixing was performed with a magnetic stirrer over the entire period of experiments the reactor was purged with nitrogen gas in order to reduce dissolved oxygen do concentration to a level below 0 30 mg l samples were collected until nitrite and thiocyanate concentrations remain unchanged the initial conditions of these tests are listed in table 1 2 4 analytical methods the liquid samples collected during the experiments were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter nitrate and nitrite were measured using the ics 900 ion chromatograph dionex co usa thiocyanate was measured by the colorimetric method using ferric nitrate kim et al 2011 ammonia and the mixed liquor

et al 2015 for describing the autotrophic denitrification and anammox in well mixed batch reactors in this model we considered two bacterial groups autotrophic denitrifying bacteria ad and anammox bacteria an which form a microbial community through syntrophic exchange of electron acceptors for simplicity we assume zero dissolved oxygen do level because do was removed with n2 gas the anaerobic endogenous respiration and death of bacteria have been neglected due to short reaction time during batch experiments in our simplified model we described the kinetics of bacteria growth consumption of thiocyanate as well as production and consumption of nitrate nitrite and ammonium since cells use some substrate electrons for energy production and the rest for synthesis of new cell materials the overall reactions describe combine transformations of substrates and cell growth by the appropriate molar stoichiometric ratios the detailed information of kinetic rate expressions stoichiometry and parameter values are described in supplementary file 1 3 results 3 1 feasibility of pollutants removal by syntrophic microbial community the nitrogen loading rates of anammox reactor is 1 2 kg n m3 d 16s rdna analysis reveal that the anammox bacterium candidatus kuenenia accounts for approximately 14 4 of the anammox biomass the major 16s rdna sequences of anammox biomass have been submitted to genbank with the accession numbers srp158089 the pollutant removal by a mixture of denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge was performed in the batch mode the details of experimental design are described in the materials and methods section to examine the effects of the coculture of ad and an on pollutant removal we designed three batch runs that correspond to single cultures of ad and an as well as their co culture for comparison purposes the initial concentrations of 25 0 mg n l thiocyanate and 75 0 mg n l nitrite were added to the mixed activated sludges in all three experiments when an was cultured alone thiocyanate and nitrite remained the same levels as their initial values due to the lack of ammonium the electron donor that sustains anammox metabolism when ad was cultured alone thiocyanate was completely removed but nitrite was only partially converted to nitrogen gas due to a lack in the availability of electron donor thiocyanate for nitrite reduction the total production of ammonium and the residual level of nitrite are 23 6 and 25 0 mg n l respectively using these numbers we then calculated their removal efficiency and found that 66 7 of the nitrite and 51 4 of the total nitrogen are reduced compared to the single culture of ad its co culture with an can simultaneously consume the residual nitrite and the undesired by product ammonium by the anammox bacteria as a result the availability of electron donor thiocyanate for denitrification is no longer limiting and near perfect removal of nitrite and thiocyanate was observed with only minimal production of ammonium 2 0 mg n l consistently the total nitrogen removal efficiency reaches 98 suggesting that the syntrophic two species microbial community performs its function almost perfectly for the specific initial condition of pollutant ratio i e nitrite to thiocyanate 3 1 3 2 the impacts of perturbed initial ammonium to thiocyanate ratio nh4 n scn n on pollutant removal nitrite is the common electron acceptor for both ad and an metabolism under nitrite limitation the ratio between thiocyanate and ammonium nh4 n scn n which are the electron donors of ad and an respectively serves as a controlling factor that tunes the relative competitive ability between the two species on nitrite and will thereby influence the effects of the co culture of ad and an on pollutant removal we consequently explored the effects of nh4 n scn n ratio on thiocyanate and ammonium removal in the co culture after addition of 75 0 mg n l initial nitrite and 25 0 mg n l initial thiocyanate nitrite to thiocyanate 3 1 as well we varied the initial nh4 n scn n ratio in a wide range 0 0 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 by adding ammonium the resulted initial concentrations of ammonium are 0 0 15 0 20 0 25 0 30 0 37 5 50 0 and 75 0 mg n l respectively fig 2a after reaction termination i e steady state nitrite was not detected for all these different ratios fig 2b suggesting that nitrite is the rate limiting substrate in other words initial nitrite of 75 mg n l is inadequate to sustain conversion of all nitrogen in thiocyanate and ammonium to nitrogen gas which has been confirmed by the detection of residual concentrations of thiocyanate 0 0 3 7 4 0 5 3 5 8 8 4 8 6 and 9 3 mg n l and ammonium 2 0 7 9 12 0 14 7 19 4 20 8 32 8 and 55 3 mg n l in the bioreactor although neither thiocyanate nor ammonium was completely removed the absolute removal amounts of both compounds show opposite trends namely the decreasing and increasing amounts of thiocyanate and ammonium removal at higher nh4 n scn n ratio respectively the absolute removal amount of thiocyanate decreased from 25 0 to 15 7 mg n l with increasing nh4 n scn n ratio while that of ammonium increased from 2 0 19 7 mg n l fig 2b the percentage of nitrite removed by the anammox bacterial population can also be influenced by the initial nh4 n scn n ratio as shown in fig 3a and b respectively the contribution of an on the removal of both nitrite 40 5 50 0 51 1 53 0 52 5 58 5 59 2 7 and 62 3 and total nitrogen 48 3 56 5 57 5 58 9 58 6 63 3 63 8 and 66 0 increases with the nh4 n scn n ratio confirming a key role of the ratio that plays in promoting nitrite reduction through the anammox pathway and thereby regulating the degree of competition between ad and an here the total nitrogen was calculated as the sum of scn n nh4 n and no2 n but not no3 n which was not detected before and after reaction although the removal efficiency of total nitrogen decreased from 98 0 to 63 1 fig 3b its absolute removal amount increased from 98 0 to 110 0 mg n l fig 2 consistent with the observed increase of the contribution of an on nitrite removal fig 3a the anammox pathway converts nitrogen from both ammonium and nitrite to the nitrogen gas and thus removes more total nitrogen than the denitrification pathway 3 3 the impacts of perturbed initial biomass ratio between ad and an xan xad on pollutant removal since ad and an play complementary roles in removing thiocyanate and ammonium the relative biomass fraction of ad and an in the co culture can be another influencing factor for the removal of pollutants under nitrite limitation we thus examined the effects of xan xad on thiocyanate ammonium and total nitrogen removal by adding anammox sludge in the 350 mg mlss l denitrifying sludge other initial conditions include 25 0 mg n l scn n 75 0 mg l no2 n and 75 0 mg l nh4 n as shown in fig 4a thiocyanate was completely removed in the range of xan xad less than 2 0 while its removal efficiency was reduced from 100 0 to 43 1 as xan xad increases from 2 0 to 7 0 in contrast both absolute amount and efficiency of ammonium removal showed opposite trends to those of thiocyanate it is interesting to note that the removal efficiency of ammonium is negative for xan xad less than 1 0 and positive otherwise fig 4b this is because the steady state concentration of ammonium is determined by the weighted sum of its production by ad and degradation by an with the weights reflecting xan xad in the absence of anammox sludge i e xan xad 0 0 ammonium was purely produced and its removal efficiency is therefore the most negative 33 3 when the initial biomass concentration between ad and an is equal i e xan xad 1 0 the concentration of anammox sludge is low and the removal efficiency is still negative 7 7 indicating higher rate of ammonium production by ad compared to that of ammonium removal by an for even larger xan xad the ammonium removal efficiency starts to become positive indicating that the anammox bacteria start to dominate the population over the denitrifying bacteria additionally the contributions of anammox bacterial population on nitrite removal 0 33 8 46 3 52 7 62 6 65 5 68 7 and 74 6 increases with xan xad causing enhanced degradation of total nitrogen as well fig 4c 3 4 dynamic transformation of nitrogen containing compounds in ad an and their co culture to explore the dynamic profiles of various nitrogen containing pollutants thiocyanate ammonium nitrite and nitrate under different initial conditions we performed four experiments where ad and an were either cultured alone or co cultured the initial concentrations of the pollutants and bacterial biomass for these experiments are listed in table 1 the variations of no2 n scn n nh4 n and no3 n concentrations over time are given in fig 5 showing qualitative differences in the dynamic transformation of the pollutants across different initial conditions for thiocyanate the complete depletion of thiocyanate was observed when ad was cultured alone fig 5a or co cultured with an in the absence of ammonium fig 5c however only 62 1 of the initial thiocyanate was removed in fig 5d where the same experimental setting as fig 5c was applied with the only exception of adding 75 0 mg n l initial ammonium the residual thiocyanate can be understood as the consequence of competitive inhibition of ad by an when nitrite is the limiting growth substrate when an was cultured alone concentration of thiocyanate remained a constant level about 25 0 mg n l throughout all the time fig 5b for all initial conditions the measured degradation rates of thiocyanate are 47 2 0 0 14 5 and 11 3 mg n g mlss d respectively nitrite was completely removed in three out of four experiments as long as an is present when ad was cultured alone fig 5a the residual concentration of nitrite in the bioreactor is roughly 33 3 of its initial value we further measured the nitrite reduction rate for all experiments and their values are 95 2 81 1 46 8 87 3 mg n g mlss d respectively nitrate was produced when an is co cultured with ad fig 5d or cultured alone fig 5b however their dynamic profiles are qualitatively different from each other in fig 5d nitrate concentration increases initially and then starts to decrease at 12 h the highest accumulation of nitrate is 2 2 mg n l but its final concentration is zero in fig 5b nitrate was continuously produced over time until reaching a plateau 14 7 mg n l ammonium was not initially added in fig 5a and c but in fig 5b and d 75 0 mg n l ammonium were given at the beginning of the experiments the production of ammonium increases over time and reaches a final concentration of 23 6 mg n l when ad was cultured alone fig 5a when anammox sludge was added only minimal production of ammonium was observed and its concentration remains stable at about 2 0 mg n l over time fig 5c by comparing fig 5b and d we found that the time courses of ammonium are qualitatively similar but quantitatively different in terms of the removal efficiency which are 75 3 and 25 9 in fig 5b and d respectively compared to the co culture the removal efficiency of ammonium was higher when an was cultured alone because ad in the co culture produces rather than consumes ammonium 3 5 mathematical model we have constructed a mathematical model to predict the kinetics of bacteria growth thiocyanate consumption and consumption and production of nitrate nitrite and ammonium based on the diagram shown in fig 6a for model validation we have compared our simulation results with all experimental data presented in figs 2 5 supplementary fig 1 showing good agreement between each other with this model we performed computational analysis of the removal efficiency of thiocyanate fig 6b nitrite fig 6c ammonium fig 6d and total nitrogen fig 6e when both initial ammonium to thiocyanate ratio and initial biomass ratio between ad and an were varied we found that the removal efficiency of thiocyanate remains nearly 100 unless both initial ratios take large values fig 6b in contrast the nitrite removal efficiency does not respond to the change of the ammonium to thiocyanate ratio but increases with the biomass ratio fig 6c taken together we numerically confirmed our experimental finding that the requirements for high removal efficiency of thiocyanate and ammonium are opposite to each other thiocyanate degradation was favored by low anammox to denitrifying bacteria biomass ratios while a high value of which was preferable for ammonium removal in addition the ammonium removal efficiency can be both positive or negative depending on the specific values of the two initial ratios finally we obtained the removal efficiency of total nitrogen and found that high removal efficiency can be achieved at joint condition of low ammonium concentration and high biomass ratio 4 discussion the use of microorganisms with diverse functions in activated sludge potentiates complex transformation of compounds and removal of pollutants from wastewaters in this study we designed and constructed an activated sludge process where two main functional bacteria perform tasks of denitrification and anammox respectively the denitrifying bacteria utilizes thiocyanate as an electron donor to reduce nitrite and produce ammonium during denitrification the initial 75 0 mg n l nitrite was reduced to 25 0 mg n l with complete degradation of 25 0 mg n l thiocyanate and production of 23 6 mg n l ammonium in the wastewater figs 1 and 5 a on the other hand ammonium and nitrite are converted into nitrogen gas and nitrate by anammox in the anaerobic condition the stoichiometric ratio of no2 n to nh4 n was found to be 1 32 and 11 2 of initial total nitrogen remains in form of nitrate in the anammox reaction chamber van hulle et al 2010 consistent with these previous observations 14 7 mg n l nitrate was produced in the anammox reaction when the initial total nitrogen included 75 0 mg n l ammonium and 75 0 mg n l nitrite fig 5 b despite of complete removal of thiocyanate and nitrite only 2 mg n l ammonium the end product of denitrification was detected in the co culture of the denitrifying and anammox sludge figs 1 and 5c moreover this value 2 0 mg n l is also significantly lower than the theoretical concentration 4 7 mg n l derived from the stoichiometry of anammox reaction the reason behind it is that ammonium produced from the degradation of thiocyanate can be rapidly oxidized to the nitrogen gas by the anammox bacteria thereby preventing its accumulation over time fig 5c similarly nitrate the end product of anammox was even not detected in the co culture figs 1 and 5c because it is quickly reduced to nitrite by thiocyanate in the denitrifying reaction as is generally known reduction of nitrate to inert nitrogen requires cooperation of nitrate and nitrite reductases and produces nitrite as the intermediate product in this study thiobacillus genus relative abundance 38 was the most abundant genera in the denitrifying sludge after acclimation with nitrite and thiocyanate although acclimated to nitrite it was found that thiobacillus genus uses both nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors to oxidize thiocyanate due to its metabolic versatility and bioenergetic flexibility pan et al 2018b collectively these results confirm the existence of bidirectional metabolic cross feeding interactions between denitrifying and anammox bacteria removal of pollutants and transformation of various compounds revealed the dynamic patterns for competitive and cooperative behavior between ad and an prevalent in nature these relationships are the key drivers that determine the ecological functions of a microbial community in this study ad consumes nitrate and produces ammonium while an consumes ammonium and produces nitrate thereby forming a cooperative interaction that cross feeds each other this ecological trait results in the simultaneous removal of thiocyanate nitrite and ammonium as well as near complete removal of total nitrogen from wastewater figs 1 and 5c consistent with previous literature findings bi et al 2015 it also leads to qualitatively different dynamics in the transformation of nitrogen containing compounds fig 5 it was reported that accumulation of toxic nitrite during ammonium oxidization can be prevented by the cooperation between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidation bacteria nob gujer 2010 similarly ammonium accumulated during denitrification severs as the substrate of anammox bacteria and can thus be rapidly transformed in our study other examples include the cooperation between alga and bacteria that functionally degrade toxic contaminant and production of lipids ryu et al 2014 and cooperation between candidatus competibacter and candidatus accumulibacter clade i that simultaneously removes phosphate and nitrate rubio rincón et al 2017 as nitrite is the common substrate of anammox and denitrifying microorganisms competition appears when nitrite becomes limited the competitive behavior can be examined by monitoring patterns of removal of pollutants and transformation of compounds at steady state and over time removal efficiency of thiocyanate was reduced by adding ammonium fig 2 and its trend was shown to be opposite to that of ammonium by increasing the ratio of anammox to denitrifying biomass fig 4 together with time course measurement of the transformation of nitrogen containing compounds fig 5 we have demonstrated the existence of competitive relationship between anammox and denitrifying microorganism in the co culture many other examples of microbial competition for shared nutrient have been reported in the literature for example kinetic competition between phosphorus release and denitrification was demonstrated under anoxic conditions and in the presence of acetate chuang et al 1996 in addition accumulibacter polyphosphate accumulating organisms have a higher affinity for oxygen and thus gain a competitive advantage over their competitors competibacter glycogen accumulating organisms at low dissolved oxygen levels carvalheira et al 2014 a third example is that growth of anammox bacteria can be significantly suppressed by heterotrophic denitrifiers due to the poorer competitive ability of the former for nitrite tang et al 2010 the estimation of parameter values was performed based on previous studies table s1 where values obtained were used as initial guesses to estimate their values in our system although not all of perimeters were found to follow a consistency the model was showed to have a good agreement with the experimental data which suggested the effectiveness of the model in certain extent in this study we have demonstrated that nitrogen containing wastewater pollutants including thiocyanate ammonium and nitrogen can be efficiently removed through the cooperation between denitrifying and anammox bacteria however their competition occurred when nitrite was limited which resulted in residual of thiocyanate and ammonium therefore the competition should be avoided for complete removal of ammonium and thiocyanate in real application through regulation ratio of electron donors sum of thiocyanate and ammonium to acceptor nitrite in the future application of this work might be presented in two forms fig 7 a for single wastewater containing ammonium and thiocyanate raw wastewater was partially fed into an oxic reactor o1 to achieve complete degradation of thiocyanate and partial or full nitritation subsequently o1 effluent was mixed with the rest part of raw wastewater was fed into a hydrolytic reactor h to achieve the removal of pollutants through coupling of autotrophic denitrification and anammox the toxic thiocyanate may pass by the nitritation process according to previous study thiocyanate with concentrations above 200 mg l seemed to inhibit nitrification but the inhibition effects was mainly due to the increased loading of ammonium produced from its biodegradation kim et al 2008 the ic50 of thiocyanate on partial nitritation pn sludge was 351 mg l and the pn sludge was insensitive to thiocyanate at levels lower than 43 3 mg l guo et al 2017 in the whole the within the concentration range commonly find in coking wastewater thiocyanate does not pose substantial threat to nitritation since partial or full nitritation is beyond the scope of this study the effect of thiocyanate on aob and full nitritation performance might be interesting to investigated in the future b for two waste streams wastewater i and ii containing ammonium and thiocyanate respectively wastewater i was feed into aerobic reactor o1 to achieve partial or full nitritation effluent of o1 reactor nitrite and wastewater ii were feed into h reactor to achieve removal of thiocyanate ammonium nitrite and nitrate using autotrophic denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation finally a small amount of residual pollutant such as ammonium might be further removed in subsequent oxic reactor o2 100 full nitritation was not a prerequisite in o1 reactor for a successful implementation of the process residual ammonium in nitritation process could be removed in subsequent h reactor through anammox using nitrite as an electron acceptor reino et al 2018 produced nitrate in nitritation could be also reduced to n2 with nitrite as intermediate in subsequent h reactor using thiocyanate as an electron donor pan et al 2018b in this study nitrate as a by product of anammox was reduced using thiocyanate as an electron donor therefore residual ammonium and produced nitrate in nitritation o1 reactor could be removed by the co culture of an and ad bacteria h reactor in the real application the relative abundance of the two functional bacterial groups might vary along with the changes in the operation conditions and the thiocyanate ammonium nitrite concentrations in system h reactor but by regulating the feeding patterns complete or nearly complete nitrogen removal is large achievable under various relative abundance ratios of anammox bacteria and autotrophic denitrifier in conclusion regulation of the ratio of electron donor sum of thiocyanate and ammonium to acceptor nitrite is key for complete removal of pollutants in h reactor regardless of application forms the regulation includes step feeding ratio r and nitritation degree the process is a promising alternative for the treatment of effluent from various industries such as coke production gold mining and plastic manufacturing which contain substantial amount of thiocyanate and or ammonium compared to single denitritation or anammox the combination of two technologies autotrophic denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation could remove more nitrogen and prevent the formation of nitrate in the process of purifying thiocyanate containing wastewater 5 conclusion in this study we demonstrated the feasibility of using syntrophic microbial community for wastewater treatment compared to single bacterial culture nearly complete removal of wastewater pollutants 98 was observed in the co culture of autotrophic denitrifying and anammox bacteria when the nitrite to thiocyanate ratio is 3 1 addition of ammonium decreased the removal of thiocyanate in the co culture and the removal efficiency of ammonium and thiocyanate showed opposite trends with the initial biomass ratio between the two species since nitrogen from both sources of ammonium and nitrite can be removed by anammox the higher contribution of anammox on nitrite removal the more total nitrogen was removed by developing a mathematical model from experimental data we further predicted that both low ammonium concentration and high biomass ratio are required for efficient removal of total nitrogen through both experimental analysis and computational modeling our work revealed the design principles of utilizing syntrophic microbial community in pollutant degradation and established the link between pollutant removal efficiency and the degree of cooperation

19111,water pollution risks to human health and the environment are emerging as serious concerns in the european union and worldwide with the aim to achieve good ecological and chemical status of all european water bodies the european water framework directive wfd was enacted with the framework bioanalytical techniques have been recognized as an important aspect however there are limitations to the application of bioassays directly for water quality assessment such approaches often fail to identify pollutants of concern since the defined priority and monitored pollutants often fail to explain the observed toxicity in this study we integrated an effect based risk assessment with a zebrafish based investigation strategy to evaluate water sample extracts and fractions collected from the danube four tiered bioassays were implemented namely rna level gene expression assay protein level ethoxyresorufin o deethylase erod assay cell level micronucleus assay and organism level fish embryo test fet the results show that teratogenicity and lethality during embryonic development might be induced by molecular or cellular damages mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr mediated activity estrogenic activity and genotoxic activity with the combination of high throughput fractionation this effect based strategy elucidated the major responsible mixtures of each specific toxic response in particularly the most toxic mixture in faction f4 covering a log kow range from 2 83 to 3 42 was composed by 12 chemicals which were then evaluated as a designed mixture our study applied tiered bioassays with zebrafish to avoid interspecies differences and highlights effect based approaches to address toxic mixtures in water samples this strategy can be applied for large throughput screenings to support the main toxic compounds identification in water quality assessment graphical abstract image 1 keywords tiered bioassays zebrafish large throughput screening toxicity based mixture elucidation 1 introduction water pollution poses risks to human health and environments which is emerging as a serious concern in the european union and worldwide to ensure a high level of protection against risks to or via the aquatic environment the wfd launched a strategy for dealing with aquatic pollution of water bodies ec 2000 environmental quality standards were established for a defined set of priority substances and member states are required to address these priority substances and other specific pollutants in their monitoring programs ec 2000 however numerous environmental risk studies indicate that substance by substance water quality monitoring could not explain the real environmental effects and target chemical analysis alone may lead to risk underestimation that is in great deal due to the fact that aquatic ecosystems are contaminated with complex mixtures of a vast number of chemicals hecker and hollert 2009 these mixtures would likely to induce various combined effects tamura et al 2017 that are typically stronger than the effects caused by the individual compounds additive sometimes synergistic bliss 1939 otitoloju 2002 thus effect based bioassays strategies which account for the toxic effects of mixtures and non target chemical are necessary for water quality assessment ec 2012 to investigate toxic effects of water pollution through biomonitoring programs arrays of in vitro bioassays were used to develop high throughput screening hts of water pollution covering different toxicity endpoints in diverse experimental models di paolo et al 2016a b judson et al 2010 however in vitro assays used for providing chemical toxic data may lead to misinterpretations in high organism level water quality assessment due to differences in sensitivity between test systems uncertainty factor when transferring measured effects between diverse biological levels judson et al 2014 even though the adverse outcome pathway concept provides a logical sequence of causally linked events at different levels of biological organization ankley et al 2010 the methodology focuses mainly on single chemical or similarly acting toxicants andersen et al 1997 cosme et al 2015 escher et al 2017 russom et al 2014 which ignored the mixture combined effects thus there are still deficits regarding the investigation of different level biological responses of complex aquatic mixtures for real impacts evaluation in water quality assessment brack et al 2016 di paolo et al 2016a b zebrafish danio rerio is a widely used model organism in water quality assessment by reasons such as small size easy cultivation high fecundity rapid development external fertilization and transparent embryos braunbeck et al 2005 di paolo et al 2015b lethal and sub lethal assays with embryos and early larval stages are available for comprehensive toxic effect evaluation making use of unobstructed observations of main morphological changes by simply using only low magnification light microscope hill et al 2005 moreover its embryogenesis and respestive genetic basis making use of histochemical markers have been largely studied long et al 1997 puelles et al 2000 spitsbergen and kent 2003 furthermore different methods with zebrafish are available to investigate mechanism specific effects being particularly suited to complement cell based microscale testing for comprehensive and realistic biological effect evaluations hill et al 2005 for instance genotoxicity can be investigated by applying the micronucleus assay to detect dna chromosomal damage in a proliferating cell population regardless of the karyotype bolognesi et al 2006 being in vitro technique to investigate the genotoxicity of chemicals and environmental mixtures di paolo 2016b ahr mediated activity analyzed by means of the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes cytochrome p450 activity allows to detect effects of dioxins and dioxin like compounds in the aquatic environment schiwy et al 2015 the estrogenic activity investigated by the induction of vitellogenin gene vtg1 transcripts enables to analyze endocrine disrupting effects of chemicals and mixtures on the rna level driever et al 1996 reinardy et al 2013 bioassays with zebrafish embryos allow comparably small sample volumes to be simultaneously screened in a single multi well plate or a series of petri dishes on organism level they thus allow large throughput screenings for different toxicity investigation with minimized sample consumption and reduced workload zebrafish up to 120 h post fertilization hpf can be used 2010 63 eu for test under european legislation which greatly simplifies experimental planning and thus speeds up performance of respective studies strähle et al 2012 all these properties place bioassays with zebrafish in an attractive position for aquatic mixture biological effects investigation and aquatic risk assessment di paolo et al 2015b consequently the goal of the current study was to establish an integrative zebrafish testing strategy to investigate molecular cellular and whole organism toxic effects by tiered bioassays for each specific toxic mixture elucidation in water quality assessment the assessment strategy was developed using danube large volume solid phase extraction lvspe samples schulze et al 2017 firstly the fet was applied to identify toxicological hotspots regarding their relevance for environmental toxicity and human health maurici et al 2005 oecd 2012 secondly to reduce the complexity of the environmental mixtures and to elucidate the toxic effect of each water mixtures the most effective hotspot sample was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography hplc fractionation afterwards in order to identify the most potent fraction for each level biological effect four tiered bioassays were conducted namely the rna level gene expression assay the protein level erod assay the cell level micronucleus assay and the organism level fet the most bioactive fractions were then identified on the basis of observed biological effects the compounds composition were identified with log kow range from hplc analysis and further confirmation was done by the toxicity comparison between bioactive fraction and a corresponding artificial mixture the panel of zebrafish based bioassays assembled here is one possible example of a testing strategy towards the implementation of bioanalytical investigation for water quality assessment there have been only a few studies undertaken on interrelations of effects on tiered biological levels for toxicity evaluation and toxicants identification on the assessment of toxic mixtures by fractionation to our knowledge this is the first time such a concept is applied to lvspe samples using zebrafish early live stages 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and extraction sampling was performed across the danube and selected tributaries during the 3rd joint danube survey jds3 between august and september 2013 liška et al 2015 the sampling locations are shown in table s1 and fig s1 a total of 22 water samples were collected and extracted using a lvspe device schulze et al 2017 as detailed in neale et al 2015a aliquots of extracts of each sample were concentrated to dryness via rotary and nitrogen evaporation prior to shipping and then re suspended in acetonitrile or dimethylsulfoxide dmso at last the concentration factors were fixed to 50 000 and 200 000 for the fractionation and acute toxicity test respectively 2 2 reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography rp hplc fractionation fractionation and analysis were performed using a hplc system equipped with the agilent 1200 series agilent waldbronn germany rp hplc was applied to separate standard chemicals and a danube hotspot extract at the concentration factor of 50 000 at 30 c by a c18 column 250 4 mm2 5 μm particle size macherey nagel düren germany the fractionation method was carried out according to the method developed by suzuki et al 2004 with slight modifications xiao et al 2017 briefly 40 μl of each extract was fractionated using the following gradient with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 0 4 0 min 10 acetonitrile in methanol water 80 20 v v 4 0 7 0 min a linear gradient of 10 100 acetonitrile in methanol water 80 20 v v 7 0 50 0 min 100 acetonitrile fractions were collected every 2 min the last one after 4 min in 6 well plates using an automatic fraction collector agilent subsequently fractions were evaporated overnight in a sterile working bench and then directly frozen at 20 c for bioassays in order to determine the log k ow range of each fraction a total of 28 chemicals table s2 with a log k ow range from 2 03 to 6 76 was analyzed using a photodiode array detector dad agilent dad signals from 210 to 360 nm were recorded and used to model the relationship between retention time and log k ow grung et al 2007 2 3 bioanalysis 2 3 1 exposure and acute toxicity assay the fet was conducted to assess developmental toxicity at 24 hpf abnormal phenomena at 48 hpf hatching rate at 96 hpf based on hollert et al 2003 and the oecd 236 guideline oecd 2006 with slight modifications briefly fertilized zebrafish danio rerio embryos were transferred into 6 well plates and static exposure to samples were performed using 0 5 dmso as carrier each exposure test was repeated in three independent experiments in addition to the tested samples each experiment contained a positive control condition 3 4 dichloroaniline at the concentration of 3 7 mg l for developmental toxicity test 2 3 7 8 tetrachlordibenzo p dioxin at the concentration of 15 pg l for erod activity assay 17α ethinylestradiol at the concentration of 1 μg l for estrogenicity assay nitroquinoline oxide at the concentration of 19 μg l for micronucleus assay a process control acetonitrile after 50 min hplc a solvent control 0 5 dmso in the fet each exposure condition contained 40 embryos the raw jds extracts and the lvspe process control were tested in five 1 2 dilution steps at the range of a relative enrichment factor ref from 62 5 to 1000 the ref takes all enrichment and dilution steps into account neale et al 2015a schulze et al 2017 artificial water iso7346 3 1996 was used as exposure medium embryos were inspected using an inverted microscope eclipse ts 100 nikon gmbh germany at the magnification of 40 at 24 hpf 48 hpf and 96 hpf lethal and sub lethal endpoints were scored according to the oecd guideline and din 38415 6 din38415 6 2001 respectively the highest concentration that did not induce any embryo abnormal effect was used for the erod activity and estrogenicity assays 2 3 2 in vivo ahr mediated activity assay with zebrafish larvae the in vivo ahr mediated activity assay was performed according to schiwy et al 2015 with slight modifications briefly 20 hatched larvae were anesthetized with benzocaine 40 g l in ethanol for circa 20 min after 96 h of exposure to the samples or controls then these larvae were transferred to 2 ml reaction tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen all following steps were carried out on ice a volume of 400 μl na2hpo4 buffer was added to each reaction tube then the larvae were homogenized by a dispersing device vdi 12 s12n5s vwr international germany for 10 s at 1450 rpm and centrifuged at 10 000 g under 4 c for 15 min rotina 420r andreas hettich gmbh co kg germany subsequently the supernatant of the homogenate a protein standard and a resorufin standard were transferred into a 96 well plate according to a distinct plate layout 7 ethoxyresorufin and nadph were added to measure resorufin production and thus the ahr mediated activity by means of a microplate reader infinite m 200 tecan group ltd switzerland at 540 nm excitation and 590 nm emission the protein concentration was determined fluorometrically using the fluorescamin method at an excitation of 380 nm and an emission of 460 nm kennedy and jones 1994 in vivo ahr mediated activities were expressed as a product of resorufin in pm per milligram protein per minute 2 3 3 in vivo estrogenicity assessment the in vivo estrogenicity assessment was performed according to reinardy et al 2013 with slight modifications samples were exposed in 6 well plates with 40 larvae in each well for 96 h afterwards the larvae were transferred into 2 ml reaction tubes and placed on ice for circa 10 min for rapid euthanasia excess water was removed the larvae were transferred to 2 ml tubes and samples were stored at 80 c for further analysis isolation purification and quantification of total rna first strand cdna synthesis and quantitative real time pcr were performed according to a previous study reinardy et al 2013 primers were selected by primer blast ncbi the β actin gene ref seq nm 131031 1 was used as the reference housekeeping gene with the use of the following forward and reverse primers 5 acacagccatggatgaggaaatcg and 5 tcactccctgatgtctgggtcgt the vtg1 ref seq nm 0010044897 2 cdna was amplified by use of the forward primer 5 atcagtgatgcacctgcccagattg and the reverse primer 3 acgcaagagctggacaagctgaa the estrogenicity of samples was evaluated by calculating the fold changes in the gene of interest vtg1 compared with β actin through efficiency adjusted 2 δδct gosselin et al 2010 dmso exposed larvae 0 5 dmso were used as the negative control condition for relative quantification 2 3 4 in vitro genotoxicity in zebrafish liver cell line the zebrafish liver zf l cell line was cultured according to the protocols published by ghosh et al 1994 cells were cultured at 26 c in leibovitz s l15 medium with l glutamine sigma aldrich containing 10 fetal bovine serum fbs biochrom germany and 1 v v penicillin streptomycin solution the micronucleus assay was performed according to a recently developed method di paolo 2016b briefly cells were rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline pbs sigma aldrich and suspended with trypsin to avoid cytotoxicity in the assay the highest exposure concentration of samples was defined based on a pretest using the mtt assay a volume of 2 ml of the cell suspension at a density of 5 6 104 cells ml was seeded onto ethanol pre cleaned microscopic glass cover slips in 6 well plates tpp trassadingen switzerland and incubated for 20 h at 26 c subsequently the medium was completely exchanged with the exposure medium containing 0 5 of the investigated fractions and then incubated for 48 h at 26 c subsequently cells were fixed for 10 min in a pbs diluted 1 1 v v mixture of methanol and glacial acetic acid 4 1 v v fixation was repeated for 10 min in the undiluted mixture after air drying the cover slips were mounted onto glass slides using depex serva germany acridine orange was used for staining of the cells after fixation brinkmann et al 2014 a total number of 2000 cells per slide were analyzed under an epifluorescence microscope nikon instruments germany at 100 magnification the scoring criteria are according to iso 21427 a score only cells with intact cellular structure micronuclei shall have b the same staining intensity and c a maximum size of about 30 of the main nucleus furthermore cells had to be d clearly separated from the nucleus results were recorded as per mille of micronucleated cells compared with the total number of counted cells 2 4 statistical analysis the lethal and sub lethal effect rate of fet from three independent experiments was plotted using the software prism 6 0 graphpad software inc usa the half maximal lethality concentrations lc50 were obtained from the two parameter logistic regressions using log concentration agonist vs response with variable slope where the top and bottom of the curve was set to 0 and 100 respectively statistical analyses were performed using sigmaplot 12 0 systat software inc san jose usa one way anova followed by dunnett s test p 0 05 and p 0 01 was used to determine significant differences between samples and respective negative controls 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity to zebrafish embryonic larval stages all 22 extracts of surface water samples from the danube that were analyzed with the fet the results indicated that all 22 extracts were capable of causing mortality to some extent fig 1 while the extract of site jds32 located upstream novi sad in serbia was clearly the most toxic sample with an lc50 value at the ref 110 5 and thus was selected as the hotspot of pollution for further investigation for the tiered investigation of toxic effects of complex environmental mixtures the hotspot extracts was separated using rp hplc into 24 fractions which were then evaluated with the fet six fractions f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 and f7 caused significant increase p 0 05 in the occurrence of abnormal development of zebrafish embryos at 48 hpf between 13 3 and 50 0 in comparison with the solvent control condition 5 0 fig 2 b sub lethal effects of eye deficit rare pigments no blood circulation hemagglutination axial malformation pericardial edema and yolk sac edema as well as coagulation in terms of lethality were frequently detected in these six active fractions during embryonic development fig 3 f4 f6 and f7 inhibited the embryonic hatching at 96 hpf with hatching rates of 53 3 12 6 75 0 5 0 and 80 0 10 0 respectively in comparison to that of solvent controls of 93 3 5 8 p 0 05 fig 2c all these observed biological effects on embryos or early larval stages of zebrafish indicated that chemicals present as components in the environmental mixture of jds32 can pose a risk to fish embry et al 2010 furthermore the fet results can provide insights into the toxic potential to older life stages of fish braunbeck et al 2015 though the analysis of lethal and sublethal morphological endpoints in live and whole organisms in a simple and fast testing system van den bulck et al 2011 the fet provided information of toxic effects on different organs and individual this assay gives a powerful insight into organism level as well as population level risk assessment and can be used as input for planning of further investigations of involved mechanisms of toxicity 3 2 ahr mediated activity the in vivo molecular ahr mediated activity assay showed that five fractions f3 f4 f5 f6 and f8 significantly increased cyp1a enzyme activity in zebrafish larvae with erod activity ranging from 0 059 0 009 to 0 095 0 008 pmol min mg protein fig 2d when compared to the ahr mediated activity of raw jds32 extract neale et al 2015b the effect analyzed with h4g1 1c2 cells was slightly higher than that of the most active fraction f6 in the current study but less than the calculated sum effects of all bioactive fractions a possible reason could be greater sensitivity of zebrafish larva compared to h4g1 1c2 cells this assumption is consistent with ahr pathway studies where early life stages of fish have proven to be significantly sensitive to ahr mediated activity elonen et al 1998 zodrow et al 2004 thus the current in vivo analysis could be a useful tool for detection of mixture ahr mediated activity several studies on zebrafish development reported that the activation of ahr mediated activity can induce pericardial edema hemorrhages craniofacial deformities billiard et al 2006 heart malformations defective cardiovascular system growth inhibition and mortality di paolo et al 2015a xiao et al 2016 similar results also presented in the current study as among six erod active fractions four f3 f4 f5 and f7 increased the occurrence of eye deficit hemagglutination pericardial edema and no blood circulation fig 3 in fact a study of heart malformation with embryonic zebrafish demonstrated that the cardiovascular system is the key and primary target for ahr mediated developmental toxicity antkiewicz et al 2005 thus we suppose that the activation of ahr is a factor that contributes to induction of cardiovascular abnormal phenomena a further effect of an increase in ahr activation may ultimately affect larval development andreasen et al 2002 and growth of adult fish carney et al 2006 xiao et al 2016 which should be evaluated more carefully in future research as it could impair reproduction success pocar et al 2005 therefore it is considered that the protein level ahr investigation with zebrafish larva can improve the translation of molecular mechanism specific toxicity into organism level toxicity towards the development of novel risk assessment technique with fewer animals 3 3 estrogenicity the estrogenic activity detection by means of the vtg1 gene expression assay showed that fraction f4 f5 f9 and f10 produced positive fold changes up to 23 fig 2e an early stage development study has reported that treatment of zebrafish embryos with 17 α ethinylestradiol 0 1 10 μm produced dose response effects on mortality non hatching and a phenotype characteristic of curved tail down kishida et al 2001 in the current study developmental toxicity phenomena such as coagulation reduced pigmentation axial malformation yolk sac edema fig 3 and not hatching at 96 hpf fig 2c appeared in estrogenicity active fractions f4 and f5 even though the knowledge of mechanistic linkages among the vtg1 gene expression and production of fertile eggs are not completely explained vtg protein has already been anchored to initiate er banding event ankley et al 2010 a study on vitellogenesis confirmed that the expression of vtg1 can be changed by aquatic estrogenic contamination and then affect embryonic development during embryogenesis sumpter and jobling 1995 an in vitro study of er target genes reported that estrogens play an essential role in the growth differentiation and homeostasis of a number of target tissues including reproductive tracts both male and female mammary glands bone brain and liver li et al 2013 thus we demonstrate that the applied zebrafish gene level estrogenicity assessment method can contribute to investigate organism level toxicity endpoints with relevance for population level consequences which is of high importance for water quality assessment 3 4 genotoxicity genotoxic activity as another important water quality assessment parameter was investigated by micronucleus assay with zf l cell line in the current study fractions f3 f4 and f5 showed significant micronucleus inductions with the induction values of 12 83 2 37 15 50 2 38 and 21 75 3 20 respectively fig 2f for these three bioactive fractions corresponding toxic effects were also observed in the respective fet fig 2b positive correlation between embryo toxicity and genotoxicity has been observed in the study of wessel et al 2007 furthermore anderson and wild concluded that genotoxicity may have consequences on reproduction through gamete loss due to cell death embryonic mortality and mutations anderson and wild 1994 thus the applied cell level genotoxicity assessment test presents toxic potential of aquatic mixture with zebrafish based in vitro assay assuring that this important mechanism of toxicity is investigated in the same model species as the other applied methods 3 5 fraction related toxicity as can be seen from fig 4 f3 exhibited positive effects in erod assay and micronucleus assay indicating likely contains ahr active and genotoxic chemical mixture f6 gave the highest ahr mediated activity but did not cause any embryonic toxic effect at 24 hpf and 48hpf and only presented reduce hatching effect at 96 hpf these observations suggested that the ahr mediated activity could mainly contribute to the effect of non hatching and f6 may contains rather specifical acting substances for ahr mediated activity similar findings were observed for f9 and f10 which caused fold changes in vtg1 gene expression assay but did not present organism level toxic response in the fet and for f8 which was active in the molecular level assays of ahr mediated activity but inactive regarding developmental toxicity these findings demonstrated the specific contaminations of f9 f10 and f8 regarding to estrogenicity and ahr mediated activity respectively besides environmental biomarker studies demonstrated that molecular bioassays could be used as sensitive biomarkers to indicate the toxic potential of chemicals or environmental mixtures shigenaga and ames 1991 in particular erod has been proposed as sensitive early warning tool to predict the anticipated changes at higher levels of biological organization i e population community or ecosystem cajaraville et al 2000 whyte et al 2008 however the most active fractions f6 and f8 in the erod assay did not induce any estrogenic activity in vtg1 gene expression assay a similar finding was reported in an anti estrogenicity study where ahr agonists caused inhibition of estrogen induced responses smeets et al 1999 moreover the most polar fractions f1 and f2 which induced yolk sac edema and reduced pigmentations did not induce any of the evaluated mechanism specific toxic effect these finding indicated that f1 and f2 did not contain dioxin like chemicals dlcs and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs at concentrations sufficiently highly to induce the corresponding effects as shown in table s3 32 polar chemicals with a log k ow less than 2 23 were detected in raw jds32 sample with concentrations up to 2 046 nm table s3 but none of them is known as dlcs or edcs an in vitro study reported that the polar fraction also promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species decreased membrane potential δψm loss of mitochondrial membrane mass and induction of apoptosis xia et al 2004 thus there are possibly other molecular events involved that we not investigated in the current study 3 6 identification of the most potent mixtures fig 4 depicts that f4 presented positive effects in all mechanism specific endpoints bioassays and embryo developmental bioassay such toxicological profile of fractions demonstrated that the complex environmental sample is capable of causing various biological effects at different levels of biological organization supporting the need for an integrated testing strategy moreover f4 showed activity for the apical endpoints in most of current bioassays fig 2 and was therefore identified as the most potent mixture for the danube in an attempt towards identification of compounds composition of the most potent mixture a total of 28 chemicals with a wide log k ow range 2 03 6 76 table s2 were applied in rp hplc grung et al 2007 by plotting the log k ow of the identified compounds versus fraction number a linear response was obtained fig s2 thomas et al 1999 according to a previous chemical analytical study of jds32 neale et al 2015b table s3 the herbicide atrazine and the pharmaceutical carbamazepine which were found within the f3 log k ow range can increase the frequencies of micronuclei çelik 2006 furthermore the ahr dependent inhibition of cyp1 can be significantly altered by the isoflavone daidzein choi and kim 2008 similarly the f4 log k ow range chemicals triphenylphosphine oxide might influence activation of the ahr mikstacka et al 2008 genistein was found to induce erα expression in maturing mouse ovaries jefferson et al 2002 metolachlor was proven to induce larval abnormalities and dna damage in a population of exposed oysters at environmentally relevant concentrations mai et al 2012 however no chemical with a log k ow more than 5 12 was detected table s3 the previous chemical analysis might not have covered dlcs and edcs that induced positive effects in fractions f6 f8 f9 and f10 this supports the need of bioassays to direct chemical analysis in water quality monitoring 3 7 artificial mixture toxicity confirmation to further confirm that the identified chemicals are the most toxic potent mixture f4 log k ow chemicals were prepared and analyzed with the current investigation strategy on the basis of the chemical linear relationship of log k ow and retention time table s2 fig s2 the log k ow of f4 should range from 2 83 to 3 42 grung et al 2007 xiao et al 2017 our previous chemical analysis study reported that only 12 chemicals within f4 log k ow range were detected in raw jds32 extract i e triphenylphosphine oxide genistein isoproturon diphenyl phosphate lenacil mecoprop metolachlor 2 methylthio benzothiazole clarithromycin terbuthylazine gestoden and oxazepam neale et al 2015b table s3 hence an artificial mixture composed of these 12 chemicals with 250 times concentrated danube surface water was prepared to investigate various biological effects table s3 in fig 5 tiered biological effects were found for the mixture and f4 in the estrogenicity assay the vtg1 gene expression induced by exposure to mixture was slightly higher than that found for f4 the micronuclei frequency and ahr mediated activity of mixture showed no significant differences p 0 05 to that of f4 it indicates that erod activity can be caused by a multitude of substances some of which at rather low concentrations in a given sample louiz et al 2008 petrulis et al 2001 and mixture design may missed some of them the fet showed that the mixture induced mortality abnormal development and non hatching of the zebrafish embryos slightly weaker than that of f4 thus the detected chemicals could successfully explain most of developmental toxic effects this gives strong evidence that the integrative zebrafish investigation strategy developed herein is capable to point towards main components of mixture for toxic effects of water samples confirming 3 8 future needs in integrated bioassay investigation strategies in consideration of the requirement that a minimum of sample amount provides a maximum of output in biological studies only one concentration was tested for each fraction to retrieve meaningful results in each bioassay and three independent replicates were implemented to ensure the accuracy of the findings fraction dilution into different concentrations is required as input parameters to develop concentration response curves for the experimental data qualification in future research in addition further target and non target chemical analysis will be implemented to identify each specific toxic driver in the active fractions 4 conclusions and outlooks the successful application of an integrative zebrafish investigation strategy for aquatic mixture characterization was demonstrated by means of complementary evaluation of mechanism specific toxicity and apical effects in a complex water sample the four tiered zebrafish based bioassays clarified the occurrence of toxic effects at molecular cellular and whole organism of the water sample and respective fractions the characterization of the toxic effects caused by each fraction supported fraction related toxicity the fact that all bioanalyses were implemented in zebrafish as the model organism avoided interspecies differences such as transformation rates in different organisms finally the artificial mixture evaluation confirmed that our investigation strategy is a useful tool to characterize aquatic mixtures and the respective involved toxic mechanisms in surface water the present study can serve as a step towards the implementation of bioanalytical techniques in water quality monitoring the outcomes of the present study contribute to demonstrate the performance and usefulness of integrative biomonitoring strategies for water

19111,water pollution risks to human health and the environment are emerging as serious concerns in the european union and worldwide with the aim to achieve good ecological and chemical status of all european water bodies the european water framework directive wfd was enacted with the framework bioanalytical techniques have been recognized as an important aspect however there are limitations to the application of bioassays directly for water quality assessment such approaches often fail to identify pollutants of concern since the defined priority and monitored pollutants often fail to explain the observed toxicity in this study we integrated an effect based risk assessment with a zebrafish based investigation strategy to evaluate water sample extracts and fractions collected from the danube four tiered bioassays were implemented namely rna level gene expression assay protein level ethoxyresorufin o deethylase erod assay cell level micronucleus assay and organism level fish embryo test fet the results show that teratogenicity and lethality during embryonic development might be induced by molecular or cellular damages mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr mediated activity estrogenic activity and genotoxic activity with the combination of high throughput fractionation this effect based strategy elucidated the major responsible mixtures of each specific toxic response in particularly the most toxic mixture in faction f4 covering a log kow range from 2 83 to 3 42 was composed by 12 chemicals which were then evaluated as a designed mixture our study applied tiered bioassays with zebrafish to avoid interspecies differences and highlights effect based approaches to address toxic mixtures in water samples this strategy can be applied for large throughput screenings to support the main toxic compounds identification in water quality assessment graphical abstract image 1 keywords tiered bioassays zebrafish large throughput screening toxicity based mixture elucidation 1 introduction water pollution poses risks to human health and environments which is emerging as a serious concern in the european union and worldwide to ensure a high level of protection against risks to or via the aquatic environment the wfd launched a strategy for dealing with aquatic pollution of water bodies ec 2000 environmental quality standards were established for a defined set of priority substances and member states are required to address these priority substances and other specific pollutants in their monitoring programs ec 2000 however numerous environmental risk studies indicate that substance by substance water quality monitoring could not explain the real environmental effects and target chemical analysis alone may lead to risk underestimation that is in great deal due to the fact that aquatic ecosystems are contaminated with complex mixtures of a vast number of chemicals hecker and hollert 2009 these mixtures would likely to induce various combined effects tamura et al 2017 that are typically stronger than the effects caused by the individual compounds additive sometimes synergistic bliss 1939 otitoloju 2002 thus effect based bioassays strategies which account for the toxic effects of mixtures and non target chemical are necessary for water quality assessment ec 2012 to investigate toxic effects of water pollution through biomonitoring programs arrays of in vitro bioassays were used to develop high throughput screening hts of water pollution covering different toxicity endpoints in diverse experimental models di paolo et al 2016a b judson et al 2010 however in vitro assays used for providing chemical toxic data may lead to misinterpretations in high organism level water quality assessment due to differences in sensitivity between test systems uncertainty factor when transferring measured effects between diverse biological levels judson et al 2014 even though the adverse outcome pathway concept provides a logical sequence of causally linked events at different levels of biological organization ankley et al 2010 the methodology focuses mainly on single chemical or similarly acting toxicants andersen et al 1997 cosme et al 2015 escher et al 2017 russom et al 2014 which ignored the mixture combined effects thus there are still deficits regarding the investigation of different level biological responses of complex aquatic mixtures for real impacts evaluation in water quality assessment brack et al 2016 di paolo et al 2016a b zebrafish danio rerio is a widely used model organism in water quality assessment by reasons such as small size easy cultivation high fecundity rapid development external fertilization and transparent embryos braunbeck et al 2005 di paolo et al 2015b lethal and sub lethal assays with embryos and early larval stages are available for comprehensive toxic effect evaluation making use of unobstructed observations of main morphological changes by simply using only low magnification light microscope hill et al 2005 moreover its embryogenesis and respestive genetic basis making use of histochemical markers have been largely studied long et al 1997 puelles et al 2000 spitsbergen and kent 2003 furthermore different methods with zebrafish are available to investigate mechanism specific effects being particularly suited to complement cell based microscale testing for comprehensive and realistic biological effect evaluations hill et al 2005 for instance genotoxicity can be investigated by applying the micronucleus assay to detect dna chromosomal damage in a proliferating cell population regardless of the karyotype bolognesi et al 2006 being in vitro technique to investigate the genotoxicity of chemicals and environmental mixtures di paolo 2016b ahr mediated activity analyzed by means of the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes cytochrome p450 activity allows to detect effects of dioxins and dioxin like compounds in the aquatic environment schiwy et al 2015 the estrogenic activity investigated by the induction of vitellogenin gene vtg1 transcripts enables to analyze endocrine disrupting effects of chemicals and mixtures on the rna level driever et al 1996 reinardy et al 2013 bioassays with zebrafish embryos allow comparably small sample volumes to be simultaneously screened in a single multi well plate or a series of petri dishes on organism level they thus allow large throughput screenings for different toxicity investigation with minimized sample consumption and reduced workload zebrafish up to 120 h post fertilization hpf can be used 2010 63 eu for test under european legislation which greatly simplifies experimental planning and thus speeds up performance of respective studies strähle et al 2012 all these properties place bioassays with zebrafish in an attractive position for aquatic mixture biological effects investigation and aquatic risk assessment di paolo et al 2015b consequently the goal of the current study was to establish an integrative zebrafish testing strategy to investigate molecular cellular and whole organism toxic effects by tiered bioassays for each specific toxic mixture elucidation in water quality assessment the assessment strategy was developed using danube large volume solid phase extraction lvspe samples schulze et al 2017 firstly the fet was applied to identify toxicological hotspots regarding their relevance for environmental toxicity and human health maurici et al 2005 oecd 2012 secondly to reduce the complexity of the environmental mixtures and to elucidate the toxic effect of each water mixtures the most effective hotspot sample was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography hplc fractionation afterwards in order to identify the most potent fraction for each level biological effect four tiered bioassays were conducted namely the rna level gene expression assay the protein level erod assay the cell level micronucleus assay and the organism level fet the most bioactive fractions were then identified on the basis of observed biological effects the compounds composition were identified with log kow range from hplc analysis and further confirmation was done by the toxicity comparison between bioactive fraction and a corresponding artificial mixture the panel of zebrafish based bioassays assembled here is one possible example of a testing strategy towards the implementation of bioanalytical investigation for water quality assessment there have been only a few studies undertaken on interrelations of effects on tiered biological levels for toxicity evaluation and toxicants identification on the assessment of toxic mixtures by fractionation to our knowledge this is the first time such a concept is applied to lvspe samples using zebrafish early live stages 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and extraction sampling was performed across the danube and selected tributaries during the 3rd joint danube survey jds3 between august and september 2013 liška et al 2015 the sampling locations are shown in table s1 and fig s1 a total of 22 water samples were collected and extracted using a lvspe device schulze et al 2017 as detailed in neale et al 2015a aliquots of extracts of each sample were concentrated to dryness via rotary and nitrogen evaporation prior to shipping and then re suspended in acetonitrile or dimethylsulfoxide dmso at last the concentration factors were fixed to 50 000 and 200 000 for the fractionation and acute toxicity test respectively 2 2 reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography rp hplc fractionation fractionation and analysis were performed using a hplc system equipped with the agilent 1200 series agilent waldbronn germany rp hplc was applied to separate standard chemicals and a danube hotspot extract at the concentration factor of 50 000 at 30 c by a c18 column 250 4 mm2 5 μm particle size macherey nagel düren germany the fractionation method was carried out according to the method developed by suzuki et al 2004 with slight modifications xiao et al 2017 briefly 40 μl of each extract was fractionated using the following gradient with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 0 4 0 min 10 acetonitrile in methanol water 80 20 v v 4 0 7 0 min a linear gradient of 10 100 acetonitrile in methanol water 80 20 v v 7 0 50 0 min 100 acetonitrile fractions were collected every 2 min the last one after 4 min in 6 well plates using an automatic fraction collector agilent subsequently fractions were evaporated overnight in a sterile working bench and then directly frozen at 20 c for bioassays in order to determine the log k ow range of each fraction a total of 28 chemicals table s2 with a log k ow range from 2 03 to 6 76 was analyzed using a photodiode array detector dad agilent dad signals from 210 to 360 nm were recorded and used to model the relationship between retention time and log k ow grung et al 2007 2 3 bioanalysis 2 3 1 exposure and acute toxicity assay the fet was conducted to assess developmental toxicity at 24 hpf abnormal phenomena at 48 hpf hatching rate at 96 hpf based on hollert et al 2003 and the oecd 236 guideline oecd 2006 with slight modifications briefly fertilized zebrafish danio rerio embryos were transferred into 6 well plates and static exposure to samples were performed using 0 5 dmso as carrier each exposure test was repeated in three independent experiments in addition to the tested samples each experiment contained a positive control condition 3 4 dichloroaniline at the concentration of 3 7 mg l for developmental toxicity test 2 3 7 8 tetrachlordibenzo p dioxin at the concentration of 15 pg l for erod activity assay 17α ethinylestradiol at the concentration of 1 μg l for estrogenicity assay nitroquinoline oxide at the concentration of 19 μg l for micronucleus assay a process control acetonitrile after 50 min hplc a solvent control 0 5 dmso in the fet each exposure condition contained 40 embryos the raw jds extracts and the lvspe process control were tested in five 1 2 dilution steps at the range of a relative enrichment factor ref from 62 5 to 1000 the ref takes all enrichment and dilution steps into account neale et al 2015a schulze et al 2017 artificial water iso7346 3 1996 was used as exposure medium embryos were inspected using an inverted microscope eclipse ts 100 nikon gmbh germany at the magnification of 40 at 24 hpf 48 hpf and 96 hpf lethal and sub lethal endpoints were scored according to the oecd guideline and din 38415 6 din38415 6 2001 respectively the highest concentration that did not induce any embryo abnormal effect was used for the erod activity and estrogenicity assays 2 3 2 in vivo ahr mediated activity assay with zebrafish larvae the in vivo ahr mediated activity assay was performed according to schiwy et al 2015 with slight modifications briefly 20 hatched larvae were anesthetized with benzocaine 40 g l in ethanol for circa 20 min after 96 h of exposure to the samples or controls then these larvae were transferred to 2 ml reaction tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen all following steps were carried out on ice a volume of 400 μl na2hpo4 buffer was added to each reaction tube then the larvae were homogenized by a dispersing device vdi 12 s12n5s vwr international germany for 10 s at 1450 rpm and centrifuged at 10 000 g under 4 c for 15 min rotina 420r andreas hettich gmbh co kg germany subsequently the supernatant of the homogenate a protein standard and a resorufin standard were transferred into a 96 well plate according to a distinct plate layout 7 ethoxyresorufin and nadph were added to measure resorufin production and thus the ahr mediated activity by means of a microplate reader infinite m 200 tecan group ltd switzerland at 540 nm excitation and 590 nm emission the protein concentration was determined fluorometrically using the fluorescamin method at an excitation of 380 nm and an emission of 460 nm kennedy and jones 1994 in vivo ahr mediated activities were expressed as a product of resorufin in pm per milligram protein per minute 2 3 3 in vivo estrogenicity assessment the in vivo estrogenicity assessment was performed according to reinardy et al 2013 with slight modifications samples were exposed in 6 well plates with 40 larvae in each well for 96 h afterwards the larvae were transferred into 2 ml reaction tubes and placed on ice for circa 10 min for rapid euthanasia excess water was removed the larvae were transferred to 2 ml tubes and samples were stored at 80 c for further analysis isolation purification and quantification of total rna first strand cdna synthesis and quantitative real time pcr were performed according to a previous study reinardy et al 2013 primers were selected by primer blast ncbi the β actin gene ref seq nm 131031 1 was used as the reference housekeeping gene with the use of the following forward and reverse primers 5 acacagccatggatgaggaaatcg and 5 tcactccctgatgtctgggtcgt the vtg1 ref seq nm 0010044897 2 cdna was amplified by use of the forward primer 5 atcagtgatgcacctgcccagattg and the reverse primer 3 acgcaagagctggacaagctgaa the estrogenicity of samples was evaluated by calculating the fold changes in the gene of interest vtg1 compared with β actin through efficiency adjusted 2 δδct gosselin et al 2010 dmso exposed larvae 0 5 dmso were used as the negative control condition for relative quantification 2 3 4 in vitro genotoxicity in zebrafish liver cell line the zebrafish liver zf l cell line was cultured according to the protocols published by ghosh et al 1994 cells were cultured at 26 c in leibovitz s l15 medium with l glutamine sigma aldrich containing 10 fetal bovine serum fbs biochrom germany and 1 v v penicillin streptomycin solution the micronucleus assay was performed according to a recently developed method di paolo 2016b briefly cells were rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline pbs sigma aldrich and suspended with trypsin to avoid cytotoxicity in the assay the highest exposure concentration of samples was defined based on a pretest using the mtt assay a volume of 2 ml of the cell suspension at a density of 5 6 104 cells ml was seeded onto ethanol pre cleaned microscopic glass cover slips in 6 well plates tpp trassadingen switzerland and incubated for 20 h at 26 c subsequently the medium was completely exchanged with the exposure medium containing 0 5 of the investigated fractions and then incubated for 48 h at 26 c subsequently cells were fixed for 10 min in a pbs diluted 1 1 v v mixture of methanol and glacial acetic acid 4 1 v v fixation was repeated for 10 min in the undiluted mixture after air drying the cover slips were mounted onto glass slides using depex serva germany acridine orange was used for staining of the cells after fixation brinkmann et al 2014 a total number of 2000 cells per slide were analyzed under an epifluorescence microscope nikon instruments germany at 100 magnification the scoring criteria are according to iso 21427 a score only cells with intact cellular structure micronuclei shall have b the same staining intensity and c a maximum size of about 30 of the main nucleus furthermore cells had to be d clearly separated from the nucleus results were recorded as per mille of micronucleated cells compared with the total number of counted cells 2 4 statistical analysis the lethal and sub lethal effect rate of fet from three independent experiments was plotted using the software prism 6 0 graphpad software inc usa the half maximal lethality concentrations lc50 were obtained from the two parameter logistic regressions using log concentration agonist vs response with variable slope where the top and bottom of the curve was set to 0 and 100 respectively statistical analyses were performed using sigmaplot 12 0 systat software inc san jose usa one way anova followed by dunnett s test p 0 05 and p 0 01 was used to determine significant differences between samples and respective negative controls 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity to zebrafish embryonic larval stages all 22 extracts of surface water samples from the danube that were analyzed with the fet the results indicated that all 22 extracts were capable of causing mortality to some extent fig 1 while the extract of site jds32 located upstream novi sad in serbia was clearly the most toxic sample with an lc50 value at the ref 110 5 and thus was selected as the hotspot of pollution for further investigation for the tiered investigation of toxic effects of complex environmental mixtures the hotspot extracts was separated using rp hplc into 24 fractions which were then evaluated with the fet six fractions f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 and f7 caused significant increase p 0 05 in the occurrence of abnormal development of zebrafish embryos at 48 hpf between 13 3 and 50 0 in comparison with the solvent control condition 5 0 fig 2 b sub lethal effects of eye deficit rare pigments no blood circulation hemagglutination axial malformation pericardial edema and yolk sac edema as well as coagulation in terms of lethality were frequently detected in these six active fractions during embryonic development fig 3 f4 f6 and f7 inhibited the embryonic hatching at 96 hpf with hatching rates of 53 3 12 6 75 0 5 0 and 80 0 10 0 respectively in comparison to that of solvent controls of 93 3 5 8 p 0 05 fig 2c all these observed biological effects on embryos or early larval stages of zebrafish indicated that chemicals present as components in the environmental mixture of jds32 can pose a risk to fish embry et al 2010 furthermore the fet results can provide insights into the toxic potential to older life stages of fish braunbeck et al 2015 though the analysis of lethal and sublethal morphological endpoints in live and whole organisms in a simple and fast testing system van den bulck et al 2011 the fet provided information of toxic effects on different organs and individual this assay gives a powerful insight into organism level as well as population level risk assessment and can be used as input for planning of further investigations of involved mechanisms of toxicity 3 2 ahr mediated activity the in vivo molecular ahr mediated activity assay showed that five fractions f3 f4 f5 f6 and f8 significantly increased cyp1a enzyme activity in zebrafish larvae with erod activity ranging from 0 059 0 009 to 0 095 0 008 pmol min mg protein fig 2d when compared to the ahr mediated activity of raw jds32 extract neale et al 2015b the effect analyzed with h4g1 1c2 cells was slightly higher than that of the most active fraction f6 in the current study but less than the calculated sum effects of all bioactive fractions a possible reason could be greater sensitivity of zebrafish larva compared to h4g1 1c2 cells this assumption is consistent with ahr pathway studies where early life stages of fish have proven to be significantly sensitive to ahr mediated activity elonen et al 1998 zodrow et al 2004 thus the current in vivo analysis could be a useful tool for detection of mixture ahr mediated activity several studies on zebrafish development reported that the activation of ahr mediated activity can induce pericardial edema hemorrhages craniofacial deformities billiard et al 2006 heart malformations defective cardiovascular system growth inhibition and mortality di paolo et al 2015a xiao et al 2016 similar results also presented in the current study as among six erod active fractions four f3 f4 f5 and f7 increased the occurrence of eye deficit hemagglutination pericardial edema and no blood circulation fig 3 in fact a study of heart malformation with embryonic zebrafish demonstrated that the cardiovascular system is the key and primary target for ahr mediated developmental toxicity antkiewicz et al 2005 thus we suppose that the activation of ahr is a factor that contributes to induction of cardiovascular abnormal phenomena a further effect of an increase in ahr activation may ultimately affect larval development andreasen et al 2002 and growth of adult fish carney et al 2006 xiao et al 2016 which should be evaluated more carefully in future research as it could impair reproduction success pocar et al 2005 therefore it is considered that the protein level ahr investigation with zebrafish larva can improve the translation of molecular mechanism specific toxicity into organism level toxicity towards the development of novel risk assessment technique with fewer animals 3 3 estrogenicity the estrogenic activity detection by means of the vtg1 gene expression assay showed that fraction f4 f5 f9 and f10 produced positive fold changes up to 23 fig 2e an early stage development study has reported that treatment of zebrafish embryos with 17 α ethinylestradiol 0 1 10 μm produced dose response effects on mortality non hatching and a phenotype characteristic of curved tail down kishida et al 2001 in the current study developmental toxicity phenomena such as coagulation reduced pigmentation axial malformation yolk sac edema fig 3 and not hatching at 96 hpf fig 2c appeared in estrogenicity active fractions f4 and f5 even though the knowledge of mechanistic linkages among the vtg1 gene expression and production of fertile eggs are not completely explained vtg protein has already been anchored to initiate er banding event ankley et al 2010 a study on vitellogenesis confirmed that the expression of vtg1 can be changed by aquatic estrogenic contamination and then affect embryonic development during embryogenesis sumpter and jobling 1995 an in vitro study of er target genes reported that estrogens play an essential role in the growth differentiation and homeostasis of a number of target tissues including reproductive tracts both male and female mammary glands bone brain and liver li et al 2013 thus we demonstrate that the applied zebrafish gene level estrogenicity assessment method can contribute to investigate organism level toxicity endpoints with relevance for population level consequences which is of high importance for water quality assessment 3 4 genotoxicity genotoxic activity as another important water quality assessment parameter was investigated by micronucleus assay with zf l cell line in the current study fractions f3 f4 and f5 showed significant micronucleus inductions with the induction values of 12 83 2 37 15 50 2 38 and 21 75 3 20 respectively fig 2f for these three bioactive fractions corresponding toxic effects were also observed in the respective fet fig 2b positive correlation between embryo toxicity and genotoxicity has been observed in the study of wessel et al 2007 furthermore anderson and wild concluded that genotoxicity may have consequences on reproduction through gamete loss due to cell death embryonic mortality and mutations anderson and wild 1994 thus the applied cell level genotoxicity assessment test presents toxic potential of aquatic mixture with zebrafish based in vitro assay assuring that this important mechanism of toxicity is investigated in the same model species as the other applied methods 3 5 fraction related toxicity as can be seen from fig 4 f3 exhibited positive effects in erod assay and micronucleus assay indicating likely contains ahr active and genotoxic chemical mixture f6 gave the highest ahr mediated activity but did not cause any embryonic toxic effect at 24 hpf and 48hpf and only presented reduce hatching effect at 96 hpf these observations suggested that the ahr mediated activity could mainly contribute to the effect of non hatching and f6 may contains rather specifical acting substances for ahr mediated activity similar findings were observed for f9 and f10 which caused fold changes in vtg1 gene expression assay but did not present organism level toxic response in the fet and for f8 which was active in the molecular level assays of ahr mediated activity but inactive regarding developmental toxicity these findings demonstrated the specific contaminations of f9 f10 and f8 regarding to estrogenicity and ahr mediated activity respectively besides environmental biomarker studies demonstrated that molecular bioassays could be used as sensitive biomarkers to indicate the toxic potential of chemicals or environmental mixtures shigenaga and ames 1991 in particular erod has been proposed as sensitive early warning tool to predict the anticipated changes at higher levels of biological organization i e population community or ecosystem cajaraville et al 2000 whyte et al 2008 however the most active fractions f6 and f8 in the erod assay did not induce any estrogenic activity in vtg1 gene expression assay a similar finding was reported in an anti estrogenicity study where ahr agonists caused inhibition of estrogen induced responses smeets et al 1999 moreover the most polar fractions f1 and f2 which induced yolk sac edema and reduced pigmentations did not induce any of the evaluated mechanism specific toxic effect these finding indicated that f1 and f2 did not contain dioxin like chemicals dlcs and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs at concentrations sufficiently highly to induce the corresponding effects as shown in table s3 32 polar chemicals with a log k ow less than 2 23 were detected in raw jds32 sample with concentrations up to 2 046 nm table s3 but none of them is known as dlcs or edcs an in vitro study reported that the polar fraction also promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species decreased membrane potential δψm loss of mitochondrial membrane mass and induction of apoptosis xia et al 2004 thus there are possibly other molecular events involved that we not investigated in the current study 3 6 identification of the most potent mixtures fig 4 depicts that f4 presented positive effects in all mechanism specific endpoints bioassays and embryo developmental bioassay such toxicological profile of fractions demonstrated that the complex environmental sample is capable of causing various biological effects at different levels of biological organization supporting the need for an integrated testing strategy moreover f4 showed activity for the apical endpoints in most of current bioassays fig 2 and was therefore identified as the most potent mixture for the danube in an attempt towards identification of compounds composition of the most potent mixture a total of 28 chemicals with a wide log k ow range 2 03 6 76 table s2 were applied in rp hplc grung et al 2007 by plotting the log k ow of the identified compounds versus fraction number a linear response was obtained fig s2 thomas et al 1999 according to a previous chemical analytical study of jds32 neale et al 2015b table s3 the herbicide atrazine and the pharmaceutical carbamazepine which were found within the f3 log k ow range can increase the frequencies of micronuclei çelik 2006 furthermore the ahr dependent inhibition of cyp1 can be significantly altered by the isoflavone daidzein choi and kim 2008 similarly the f4 log k ow range chemicals triphenylphosphine oxide might influence activation of the ahr mikstacka et al 2008 genistein was found to induce erα expression in maturing mouse ovaries jefferson et al 2002 metolachlor was proven to induce larval abnormalities and dna damage in a population of exposed oysters at environmentally relevant concentrations mai et al 2012 however no chemical with a log k ow more than 5 12 was detected table s3 the previous chemical analysis might not have covered dlcs and edcs that induced positive effects in fractions f6 f8 f9 and f10 this supports the need of bioassays to direct chemical analysis in water quality monitoring 3 7 artificial mixture toxicity confirmation to further confirm that the identified chemicals are the most toxic potent mixture f4 log k ow chemicals were prepared and analyzed with the current investigation strategy on the basis of the chemical linear relationship of log k ow and retention time table s2 fig s2 the log k ow of f4 should range from 2 83 to 3 42 grung et al 2007 xiao et al 2017 our previous chemical analysis study reported that only 12 chemicals within f4 log k ow range were detected in raw jds32 extract i e triphenylphosphine oxide genistein isoproturon diphenyl phosphate lenacil mecoprop metolachlor 2 methylthio benzothiazole clarithromycin terbuthylazine gestoden and oxazepam neale et al 2015b table s3 hence an artificial mixture composed of these 12 chemicals with 250 times concentrated danube surface water was prepared to investigate various biological effects table s3 in fig 5 tiered biological effects were found for the mixture and f4 in the estrogenicity assay the vtg1 gene expression induced by exposure to mixture was slightly higher than that found for f4 the micronuclei frequency and ahr mediated activity of mixture showed no significant differences p 0 05 to that of f4 it indicates that erod activity can be caused by a multitude of substances some of which at rather low concentrations in a given sample louiz et al 2008 petrulis et al 2001 and mixture design may missed some of them the fet showed that the mixture induced mortality abnormal development and non hatching of the zebrafish embryos slightly weaker than that of f4 thus the detected chemicals could successfully explain most of developmental toxic effects this gives strong evidence that the integrative zebrafish investigation strategy developed herein is capable to point towards main components of mixture for toxic effects of water samples confirming 3 8 future needs in integrated bioassay investigation strategies in consideration of the requirement that a minimum of sample amount provides a maximum of output in biological studies only one concentration was tested for each fraction to retrieve meaningful results in each bioassay and three independent replicates were implemented to ensure the accuracy of the findings fraction dilution into different concentrations is required as input parameters to develop concentration response curves for the experimental data qualification in future research in addition further target and non target chemical analysis will be implemented to identify each specific toxic driver in the active fractions 4 conclusions and outlooks the successful application of an integrative zebrafish investigation strategy for aquatic mixture characterization was demonstrated by means of complementary evaluation of mechanism specific toxicity and apical effects in a complex water sample the four tiered zebrafish based bioassays clarified the occurrence of toxic effects at molecular cellular and whole organism of the water sample and respective fractions the characterization of the toxic effects caused by each fraction supported fraction related toxicity the fact that all bioanalyses were implemented in zebrafish as the model organism avoided interspecies differences such as transformation rates in different organisms finally the artificial mixture evaluation confirmed that our investigation strategy is a useful tool to characterize aquatic mixtures and the respective involved toxic mechanisms in surface water the present study can serve as a step towards the implementation of bioanalytical techniques in water quality monitoring the outcomes of the present study contribute to demonstrate the performance and usefulness of integrative biomonitoring strategies for water quality assessment these efforts provide the scientific underpinnings and regulatory reference for derivation of environmental quality standards in the context of the eu wfd notes the authors declare

19112,river biofilms play fundamental roles in shaping the architecture of aquatic systems sorption to biofilms was thought to be a crucial mechanism controlling the fate and transport of trace emerging contaminants this study focused on the role of in situ colonized river biofilms in the early fate of phthalate esters paes and bisphenols bps at trace concentrations in a representative urban river paes and bps were readily sorbed to biofilms with uptakes of 38 2 162 5 μg g for paes and 1787 7 4425 6 μg g for bps respectively the total mass and characteristics of the colonized biofilms varied in response to seasons and water qualities the biofilm colonized in the downstream of a wastewater treatment plant exhibited the highest sorption capacity among the tested sites possibly attributed to the higher organic contents of biofilms owing to the elevated availability of nutrients correlation analysis indicates that certain water qualities e g tn and nh3 n and biofilm properties e g organic and polysaccharide fractions could be selected to predict the sorption capacities of river biofilms hydrophobic partitioning into organic matter appears to be the dominant sorption mechanism and biofilm polysaccharides were probably responsible for the adhesion of tested compounds the contaminant partitioning into biofilm and sediment at mass volume ratios typical for small rivers suggests that the biofilm could serve as an important sorbing matrix for the trace organic contaminants as compared to the sediments our work yields new insights into the early uptake and accumulation of trace plasticizers by natural biofilms which is of significance in understanding the subsequent transport of trace organic contaminants in fluvial systems graphical abstract image 1

colonized or collected from urban river named jinchuan river nanjing china being one of the tributary of yangtze river the river has a length of 9317 m with a total catchment area of 23 54 km2 north city wastewater treatment plant wwtp was located near the entrance to yangtze river with a treatment capacity of 370 thousand tons per day and the treated water from the wwtp was discharged into jinchuan river shown in fig s1 artificial devices for biofilm growth were utilized to cultivate biofilm in situ in jinchuan river for evaluating the sorption of target paes and bps table 1 following a

protocols in fig s4 colonized screens were harvested from each site and transferred individually to 250 ml beakers in the laboratory for batch sorption experiments batch experiments were conducted by placing colonized screens or sediment samples 5 g of sediment or base rinsed sediment for each test into 50 ml of buffered solutions 10 3 m nacl 10 3 m nahco3 bulk solutions were prepared by

uhplc ms and gc ms was provided in text s1 and s2 to evaluate the sorption of target compounds on stainless steel screens clean screens were rinsed into 50 ml of buffered solutions containing target compounds 400 μg l for paes and 100 μg l for bps the concentrations of compounds after 1 h of exposure were measured as described above the spike recovery of tested compounds from water biofilm and sediment were provided in table s6 2 3 analytical methods prior to sorption tests colonized stainless steel screens were collected and fluorescent stained with fluorescein 5 isothiocyanate

images of biofilms samples were recorded detailed in text s3 image j software https imagej en softonic com was applied to calculate the gray value of each stained images the relative proportions of stained fractions were calculated with the gray value intensities the results were expressed as mean standard errors by analyzing three clsm images the total adenosine 5 triphosphate atp concentrations and the activities of two representative enzymes involved in the immune processes against environmental shocks i e superoxide dismutase sod and lysozyme lzm in biofilms and sediments were measured using their corresponding assay kits and protocols jiancheng bioengineering institute nanjing china to reveal the bioactivities of samples respectively biolog eco microplates were applied to analyze the microbial diversity shabbir et al 2017 and the microbial activity of samples was determined by average well color development awcd parameters including the shannon diversity index simpson index and mcintosh index were calculated to determine the functional diversity after the batch sorption experiments the stainless steel screens were dried at 105 c for 2 h to determine the total mass per sample followed by ashing at 500 c for 4 h to evaluate the organic matter the fraction of organic matter f om was calculated to evaluate the mass of organic matter per mass of the biofilm or sediment after sorption tests biofilms from three screens were extracted for further analysis each screen was placed in a beaker containing 25 ml of 0 01 m naoh and sonicated for 1 h afterwards 0 01 m hcl at the same volume was added to neutralize the solution followed by filtering with 1 μm glass fiber filter writer 2010 ultraviolet light absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and doc normalized uv254 suva254 were measured for the extracted biofilm samples excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra was applied to characterize the fluorescent compositions of biofilm samples fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to observe the functional groups of biofilms before and after sorption of 1 mg l of target compounds the detailed procedures of eem and ftir analysis were provided in the text s4 2 4 data analysis for the batch sorption experiments the adsorbed amounts were calculated following equation 1 1 q s m total m aqueous m sorbent where q s is the concentration in the sorbent phase μg g m total is the target compound mass added to each experiment μg m aqueous is the target compound mass in the supernatant after 1 h μg and m sorbent is the mass of the sorbent phase g the sorption process was fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic equation 2 q t q e 1 e kt where q t q e and k refer to the adsorbed amount μg g by biofilm at time t the adsorbed amount μg g at equilibrium state and the constant of pseudo first order kinetics 1 min respectively partition constant k d and organic matter normalized partition coefficient k om between sorbent phase and aqueous phase could be used to evaluate the process according to equations 3 k d q s c aq 4 k om 100k d f om where q s and c aq refer to the concentrations of tested compounds in sorbent phase μg kg and in aqueous phase μg l respectively to compare the relative importance of sorption between biofilm and sediment matrices an empirical partitioning model was applied writer et al 2011a the detailed information on the calculation of expected fraction of paes in the matrices of water f aq biofilm f bf and sediment f sed were provided in text s5 all the data in the tests were shown as average values standard deviations with the number of repetitive tests provided a two tailed t test at the 95 significance level was used for comparisons of data p 0 05 using spss 20 0 non parametric spearman correlation analysis was performed using the euclidean distances and hierarchical cluster analysis in the pheatmap package of r 3 4 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical and biological characteristics of colonized biofilms spatial and seasonal variations were observed in the biofilm mass developed on the stainless steel screens table 2 and fig s5 the total mass and the organic matter mass ranged from 14 6 to 70 9 mg dm2 and 5 5 26 5 mg dm2 respectively in november 2017 the f om values at the three sites were in the order of downstream dongguapu upstream the total mass and organic matter content colonized in june 2018 were 2 7 4 7 times higher than those in november 2017 respectively the amount of chlorophyll a was positively related to the values of tn tp and nh3 n in table s1 suggesting the organic compounds synthesis capacity was highly related to nutrient levels the variances in the mass of biofilms could also be explained by the primary productivity reflected by the parameter of chlorophyll a wwtp effluents profoundly affect the hydrology physicochemical and biological characteristics of the receiving water bodies the higher amount of total mass and f om values indicated that rivers receiving the treated water below wwtps are more productive which may be explained by the elevated availability of nutrients and organic fractions downstream writer et al 2011a proia et al 2016 integrated spectral and biological analysis were performed to characterize the colonized biofilms the biofilms downstream the wwtp had the highest suva254 values among the colonized samples table s7 suggesting the highest levels of aromatic organic matters including aromatic contents humic acid lignin etc within biofilm chen et al 2003 2018 the eem spectra fig s6 and the relative proportion of each fluorescent fraction fig s7 indicated that biofilms colonized downstream the wwtp had relative higher intensities of aromatic proteins i and ii consistent with the results in suva254 analysis fig 1 and s8 illustrate the clsm spectra of biofilms taking the biofilms colonized in november 2017 as examples the relative proportions of three stained compounds fig s9 showed differences among sampling sites with proteins occupying the highest proportions in all samples 38 55 in november and 69 80 in june 2018 biolog eco microplates analysis suggested that the metabolic activities of colonized biofilms were significantly higher p 0 01 than sediment collected at the same site in terms of awcd values in figure s10a shabbir et al 2017 the diversity indices were slightly higher for biofilms compared to sediment in fig s10b confirming higher microbial diversity and richness in biofilms fig s10c shows that the atp amounts were significantly higher in biofilms than sediments p 0 01 while no remarkable discrepancies were observed in the activities of representative enzymes i e sod and lzm the biological analysis confirmed the higher metabolic activities of biofilm compared to sediments it has to be mentioned that no obvious difference in biological characteristics was observed among sampling sites the results demonstrate that even though water quality and aquatic environment remarkably affect the total amounts of generated biofilms among sites table 2 their effects on the microbial activities of biofilms were limited 3 2 sorption kinetics and isotherms of paes and bps onto biofilms prior to batch sorption tests the uptake of target compounds onto clean stainless steel screens were measured and the average fractions of the target compounds remaining in the aqueous phase were dmp 0 89 dbp 0 97 dehp 0 99 bpa 0 99 and tbbpa 0 97 suggesting the sorption of target compounds onto stainless steel screens was limited the henry s constant shown in table 1 indicates the tendency of a substance to escape from water into air even though the values for dbp dehp bpa and tbbpa were higher than the critical value of 1 01 10 2 pa m3 mol which suggested that theses compounds might potentially transfer to gas phase net et al 2015 however according to the measurements of remaining compounds in aqueous phase above the volatilization of tested compounds could be neglected the low concentrations of tested compound in river water 0 02 2 12 μg l in table s3 suggested that the potential sorption of the compounds during biofilm colonization could also be neglected the uptake of environmental relevant concentrations of paes at 400 μg l and bps at 100 μg l onto biofilms grown in november 2017 were determined in batch experiments fig 2 shows that the sorption of paes onto biofilms was limited with an uptake amount of 5 35 at 4 h the sorption of bps was more remarkable compared to paes which were almost totally absorbed at the end of run to evaluate the sorption kinetics of the target compounds the concentrations in the initial 1 h were measured and the adsorption capacities were shown in fig s11 the sorption kinetics could be well fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic equation table s8 with r 2 in the range of 0 87 0 99 the q e values for paes and bps ranged from 38 2 to 239 0 μg g and 1787 7 4425 6 μg g respectively in which biofilms cultivated below the wwtp exhibited the highest capacity in adsorbing the target compounds considering the flowing state of effluents or river water the contact time between tested compounds and biofilms in riverbed is limited the quick uptake behaviors of paes and bps suggested that biofilms are important matrix to adsorb retain and amplify the concentrations of plasticizers after discharging into fluvial systems fig 3 shows the adsorbed amounts of contaminants at various initial concentrations at the end of sorption tests the sorption capacities gradually increased as a function of initial concentrations biofilms at downstream showed the highest adsorption capacity among the field sites 1 1 4 9 times higher than those at other sites since the water quality remained relatively stable during the experiments at dongguapu bridge compared to other sites shown in table s1 the biofilms colonized at this site were selected as model biofilms to compare the seasonal difference in sorption behaviors the adsorbed amounts of dbp and bps per gram of biofilm did not show significant difference between biofilm colonized in november 2017 and june 2018 while some variances were observed between the sorption of dbp and dehp onto colonized biofilms from two seasons based on the previous studies hydrophobic partitioning into organic matter largely govern the sorption of dbp and dehp on solid matrices kalmykova et al 2013 gao and wen 2016 thus the higher uptake of paes in these cases might possibly attributed to the difference in organic contents f om 0 37 in november compared to 0 17 in june in the biofilms samples generated at dongguapu bridge during different seasons table 2 existing data indicated that bpa and its congeners exhibited higher tendency for sorption to environmental matrices such as soils and sediments compared to paes fromme et al 2002 the results were in consistent with the sorption capacities of bps and paes by sediments and biofilms in the following discussion according to previous studies organic matter abundance largely governs the sorption behaviors of bpa sun et al 2012 which could help explain the higher sorption capacities onto biofilm samples with relatively high organic contents in this study the covalent bonds formed between bpa and solid matrices might be responsible for the higher sorption capacity liu et al 2013 im and loffler 2016 at neutral ph the ionic properties of bpa pk a pf 9 6 and tbbpa pk a values of 7 5 and 8 5 resulted in the presence of more ionic forms in solution the presence of ionic forms of bpa and tbbpa might favor the interactions between sorption sites on solid surfaces and bisphenols which might help explain the higher sorption capacity of bps compared to paes the partitioning of organic pollutants in biofilms and sediments could be described in terms of solute partitioning in hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases chiou et al 1979 based on the linear sorption isotherms in fig s11 the values of log k d and log k om for paes were calculated among which dehp showed the highest partition constants table s9 it has to be pointed out that almost all the bps were readily sorbed onto biofilms in fig 2 during the sorption tests consequently the c aq values were rather low at the end of sorption tests and it is difficult to predict a linear relationship between q s and c aq for experiments absorbing bps thus the values of log k d and log k om of bps could not be generated by using the experimental results in this test 3 3 sorption behaviors in response to environmental matrices to reveal the potential degradation efficiency of the compounds during sorption the concentrations of target contaminants in both aqueous phase and in the extracted biofilm suspensions were measured using biofilm colonized at dongguapu bridge as models fig 4 shows the fractions of total mass of contaminants sorbed by biofilm and in aqueous phase by biofilms cultivated at dongguapu bridge in june 2018 as examples the total fractions in the aqueous phase and sorbed by biofilm occupied 95 1 88 8 95 7 96 0 and 93 6 respectively for dmp dbp dehp bpa and tbbpa suggesting the fraction degraded by the microorganisms in the biofilm was limited during the 4 h sorption tests the results were in agreement with previous reports suggesting that the half lives of the tested compounds vary from less than one day to 900 h in sediments net et al 2015 im and loffler 2016 our results confirm that the uptake to biofilms is the initial step controlling the distribution and fate of the tested compounds in the aqueous systems writer et al 2011a the variances in sorption capacities between river biofilm and sediments were evaluated the f om of sediments at upstream downstream and at dongguapu were 0 097 0 038 0 126 0 017 and 0 095 0 006 respectively much lower than the values of biofilms table s10 the biofilms were significantly more effective than sediments in sorbing paes and bps from the aqueous phase with the sorption capacities an order and ten orders of magnitude greater than those of the sediments respectively fig 5 the adsorbed amounts did not show significant difference between sediments and base rinsed sediments suggesting that the inorganic fractions contributed to the uptake of contaminants mackintosh et al 2006 writer et al 2011a the downstream biofilm showed the highest sorption capacities per unit mass which was possibly attributed to the highest organic content f om 0 42 among colonized biofilms figs 3 and 5 compared to sediments the higher metabolic activities reflected atp amounts microbial diversity and richness in colonized biofilms fig s10 might be another reason for the enhanced sorption capacity however the biological characteristics did not show significant difference among sampling sites the results provided additional evidence that the distinct sorption behaviors at different sampling sites shown in fig 3 were mainly attributed to the organic contents rather than biological properties among samples since the uptake of bpa and tbbpa onto biofilms are almost complete at equilibrium state and the remaining concentrations c aq are low shown in figs 3 and 4 it is improper to calculate the k d values of bisphenols table s9 summarizes the estimated mass fractions of paes in different environmental matrixes in a small river system biodegradation and photolysis were ignored in this analysis as confirmed in fig 5 although the calculated total amount of paes in the sediments were higher than in the biofilms 0 62 0 75 compared to 0 24 to 0 38 concentrations of these contaminants will be higher in the biofilms due to their lower total mass compared to sediment the results provide evidence that the form of river biofilm could serve as important reservoirs for emerging contaminants 3 4 environmental factors affecting the sorption behaviors relationships of sorption parameters and biofilm properties described above were established to explore the main factors governing the sorption behaviors using the spearman correlation analysis fig 6 among the water quality parameters nh3 n and tn generally showed significant positive correlations with sorption parameters this could be explained by the increased liable nutrient loads to riverbed biofilms which promoted the production of biofilm mass and available functional sites for binding of contaminants onto biofilms flemming 1995 in terms of the internal properties of biofilm f om was positively correlated with most of the sorption parameters suggesting organic contents remarkably governed to the sorption of trace organic pollutants razzaque and grathwohl 2008 wunder et al 2011 wu et al 2018 unlike protein contents which were mostly negatively correlated to sorption parameters the contents of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides showed higher positive correlations the results were in agreement with previous studies which demonstrated that charged or hydrophobic polysaccharides as well as eps glycoconjugates were mainly responsible for the sorption and ion exchange function of biofilms flemming et al 2007 flemming and wingender 2010 previous studies suggest that environmental factors metal content natural organic matter etc and biofilm properties moisture contents and organic fractions could affect the sorption of hydrophobic organic contaminants onto biofilms in biofilm reactor systems wicke et al 2008 wunder et al 2011 the analysis here provided evidence that the sorption capacities of biofilm samples could be predicted considering the surrounding water quality and the internal properties of biofilms for example at higher nutrient levels the generated biofilms were probably more productive and contained higher amounts of sorption sites for contaminants flemming 1995 biofilms with higher organic content and fractions such as smp like fulvic like and polysaccharides might serve as superior reservoirs for trace organic contaminants 3 5 sorption mechanism of paes and bps to biofilms the partitioning of trace organic pollutants is highly related to the f om values the sorption capacity of biofilms is found linearly correlated to the sum of nonpolar aliphatic fractions and aromatic fractions fig 7 a provides the relationship between k ow and sorption to biofilm samples k om in this study as well as for endocrine disrupting compounds and plasticizers sorption other environmental matrices previous studies indicated that non specific hydrophobic partitioning is the primary sorption mechanism for trace organic pollutants including steroidal hormones into the biofilm which were affected by various factors including the dissolved organic matter salinity and the mineral contents xu and li 2008 lu et al 2016 sorption of target compounds was observed in fig 5 to base rinsed sediments providing evidence that the compounds evaluated can interact through other mechanisms than hydrophobic distribution interaction lu et al indicated that paes could interact with minerals through h bonding between co groups and adsorbed h2o lu et al 2016 the difference between the reported values and the data in fig 7a suggested the possibility for other mechanisms in the sorption processes such as the molecular size distribution and the organic matter fractions of biofilms writer et al 2011a gao and wen 2016 compared to soil and sediment organic matter which contained both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions derived from the biodegradation of plant debris river biofilms are primarily comprised of labile low molecular weight domains such as proteins lipids and polysaccharides flemming 1995 the younger biofilm organic matter was observed less aromatic compared to the allochthonous organic matters in soils and sediments which could be another reason explaining the relatively lower k ow values in figrue 7a nguyen et al 2005 to probe the molecular interactions between the target compounds and the biofilms ftir spectra of the biofilms before and after sorption of these compounds is conducted and shown in fig 7b the peaks attributed to the skeletal vibration of cc bonds shifted from 1635 to 1648 cm 1 after adsorption of compounds especially for dehp bpa and tbbpa respectively which confirmed that π π interactions play important roles in the sorption processes between biofilm and tested compounds yang and xing 2010 wang et al 2014 the relative peak intensities at 1118 cm 1 experienced an increase compared to the raw biofilm suggesting that the co band coc and cop bands in polysaccharides were important functional groups interacting with these compounds the results provided further evidence that polysaccharides or eps glycoconjugates were involved in the adhesion and accumulation of tested compounds at a molecular level flemming et al 2007 the peak corresponding to asymmetric no2 stretching at 1538 cm 1 blue shifted to 1545 cm 1 after sorption of dehp bpa and tbbpa suggesting a strengthening of the no bonds which favors the interaction and sorption of these compounds onto biofilms wang et al 2014 4 conclusions river biofilm could facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of trace organic pollutants with an integrated use of field site colonization and experimental analysis the sorption of representative paes and bps onto biofilms generated in natural river systems are systematically investigated based on the results it can be concluded that the total mass and internal characteristics of colonized biofilms show seasonal and spatial variances in response to water quality river biofilms are important sorbates for plasticizers compared to surface sediment bps are more easily sorbed onto biofilms compared to paes possibly due to the ionic nature and formed covalent bonds with biofilms certain water qualities e g tn and nh3 n and biofilm properties e g organic and polysaccharide fractions could potentially predict the sorption capacities of trace organic contaminants by river biofilms hydrophobic partitioning into organic matter is found to play a major role in the sorption process and polysaccharides were observed to be the key fractions responsible for the sorption reactions our work yields vivid insights into the early migration of paes and bps discharged into rivers by biofilms and sediments in addition the integrated macroscopic and microcosmic investigation benefits our understanding in the sorption mechanisms by biofilm matrix future work on the uptake of emerging contaminants onto biofilms in flowing conditions is needed to stimulate the fate of these compounds under hydrodynamic conditions the biodegradation and mineralization studies are also required to determine their long term fate in rivers

19112,river biofilms play fundamental roles in shaping the architecture of aquatic systems sorption to biofilms was thought to be a crucial mechanism controlling the fate and transport of trace emerging contaminants this study focused on the role of in situ colonized river biofilms in the early fate of phthalate esters paes and bisphenols bps at trace concentrations in a representative urban river paes and bps were readily sorbed to biofilms with uptakes of 38 2 162 5 μg g for paes and 1787 7 4425 6 μg g for bps respectively the total mass and characteristics of the colonized biofilms varied in response to seasons and water qualities the biofilm colonized in the downstream of a wastewater treatment plant exhibited the highest sorption capacity among the tested sites possibly attributed to the higher organic contents of biofilms owing to the elevated availability of nutrients correlation analysis indicates that certain water qualities e g tn and nh3 n and biofilm properties e g organic and polysaccharide fractions could be selected to predict the sorption capacities of river biofilms hydrophobic partitioning into organic matter appears to be the dominant sorption mechanism and biofilm polysaccharides were probably responsible for the adhesion of tested compounds the contaminant partitioning into biofilm and sediment at mass volume ratios typical for small rivers suggests that the biofilm could serve as an important sorbing matrix for the trace organic contaminants as compared to the sediments our work yields new insights into the early uptake and accumulation of trace plasticizers by natural biofilms which is of significance in understanding the subsequent transport of trace organic contaminants in fluvial systems graphical abstract image 1

mackintosh et al 2006 the concentrations of paes in rivers and lakes range from 0 54 to 90 4 μg l and could reach several mg l in polluted sites in china and some african countries fromme et al 2002 net et al 2015 the concentrations of representative bps i e bisphenol a bpa and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa in surface waters are relatively lower than paes with highest concentrations of 4 87 and 17 3 μg l im and loffler 2016 liu et al 2016 the growing concerns on plastic and microplastics pollution and plasticizer depletion has been a major issue for researchers and governments which have been attracting global research interests rummel et al 2017 the fate of paes and bps in surface waters is dependent on factors including hydrolysis adsorption bio transformation etc in which sorption by biofilms or sediments is a vital step in the accumulation and degradation fromme et al 2002 net et al 2015 im and loffler 2016 despite experiments have been performed to analyze the accumulation of some trace organic pollutants onto laboratory cultivated biofilms the sorption behaviors of paes and bps onto biofilms generated in natural rivers have not been fully explored and the underlying sorption mechanism at a molecular level needs to be clarified in addition the compositions and characteristics of biofilms cultivated at various pollution levels have hardly been differentiated knowledge gaps also exist on the relationships between biofilm properties water qualities and sorption parameters with scarce studies published so far in the present study dimethyl phthalate dmp dibutyl phthalate dbp di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp bpa and tbbpa were selected since they occupy the most abundant congeners of paes and bps in aqueous systems net et al 2015 im and loffler 2016 river biofilms were colonized in situ on artificial substrata at various sites in a representative urban river to investigate i the sorption kinetics and isotherms of target paes and bps to colonized river biofilms ii the relationships between sorption parameters and the biofilm properties as well as the water qualities iii the sorption mechanisms and iv the capacity of various environmental matrices in controlling the sorption removal of these compounds in surface waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sites and biofilm cultivation experiments were conducted using biofilm and sediments colonized or collected from urban river named jinchuan river nanjing china being one of the tributary of yangtze river the river has a length of 9317 m with a total catchment area of 23 54 km2 north city wastewater treatment plant wwtp was located near the entrance to yangtze river with a treatment capacity of 370 thousand tons per day and the treated water from the wwtp was discharged into jinchuan river shown in fig s1 artificial devices for biofilm growth were utilized to cultivate biofilm in situ in jinchuan river for evaluating the sorption of target paes and bps table 1 following a modified approach reported by writer et al 2011a shown in fig s2 biofilms were colonized on 20 25 mesh stainless steel wire screen with a diameter of 6 cm width of square mesh opening 0 2 mm 304 stainless steel fixed above sediments while below the water surface the screens were rinsed with 15 nitric acid for 24 h sonicated with di water and dried the weight of each screen was measured prior to experiments three sites were selected to colonize biofilms i site a 200 m upstream from north city wwtp effluent discharge ii site b 150 m downstream the discharge and iii site c at dongguapu bridge fig s1 the purposes for choosing these sampling sites were also provided in fig s1 biofilms were colonized for periods of 28 days from november 2017 winter to june 2018 summer to evaluate the effects of seasonal variances on biofilms sediment samples were collected from the top 5 cm of the bed surface at each site a proportion of the sediments was rinsed with 10 mm naoh solution to remove the organic fractions in sediments followed by thoroughly rinsed with di water writer et al 2011a 2011b the ph and dissolved oxygen do concentration at each site were measured in situ using water

organic carbon doc was measured using a liquid toc ii analyzer three replicates were measured for all the parameters tested the sites in the upstream and downstream of the wwtp experienced higher hydrodynamic shear forces than site c table s1 nutrient organic matter and do are the main factors controlling the water quality variability table s2 and fig s3 the background concentrations of dbp dmp dehp bp and tbbpa were determined to be 0 11 0 91 2 12 0 21 and 0 02 μg l respectively in jinchuan river table s3 2 2 sorption experiments sorption experiments were conducted following the protocols in fig s4 colonized screens were harvested from each site and transferred individually to 250 ml beakers in the laboratory for batch sorption experiments batch experiments were conducted by placing colonized screens or sediment samples 5 g of sediment or base rinsed sediment for each test into 50 ml of buffered solutions 10 3 m nacl 10 3 m nahco3 bulk solutions were prepared by dissolving target compounds into acetonitrile at a concentration of 100 mg l and titrated into each beaker to designed concentrations paes from 80 to 800 μg l and bps from 50 to 150 μg l for sorption tests the beakers were placed on a shaking table at a rotating speed of 100 rpm and 5 ml sample was collected at given time intervals the aqueous solutions containing bps were filtered with 0 22 μm pes membrane and sampled to an ultra high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer uhplc ms waters acquity uplc xevo tq for analyzing the concentrations of bpa and tbbpa two ml of the

membrane for gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms tsq quantum xls thermo usa analysis at the end of each experiment several screens were dried for 2 h at 105 c allowed to cool and sonicated in methanol 30 ml for bps tests or hexane acetone 9 1 v v 30 ml for paes tests the extracts were filtered with corresponding filters to analyze the remaining target compounds the detailed information for uhplc ms and gc ms was provided in text s1 and s2 to evaluate the sorption of target compounds on stainless steel screens clean screens were rinsed into 50 ml of buffered solutions containing target compounds 400 μg l for paes and 100 μg l for bps the concentrations of compounds after 1 h of exposure were measured as described above the spike recovery of tested compounds from water biofilm and sediment were provided in table s6 2 3 analytical methods prior to sorption tests colonized stainless steel screens were collected and fluorescent stained with fluorescein 5 isothiocyanate concanavalin a and calcofluor white invitrogen life science usa for protein α d glucopyranose polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides respectively li et al 2015 after staining clsm images of biofilms samples were recorded detailed in text s3 image j software https imagej en softonic com was applied to calculate the gray value of each stained images the relative proportions of stained fractions were calculated with the gray value intensities the results were expressed as mean standard errors by analyzing three clsm images the total adenosine 5 triphosphate atp concentrations and the activities of two representative enzymes involved in the immune processes against environmental shocks i e superoxide dismutase sod and lysozyme lzm in biofilms and sediments were measured using their corresponding assay kits and protocols jiancheng bioengineering institute nanjing china to reveal the bioactivities of samples respectively biolog eco microplates were applied to analyze the microbial diversity shabbir et al 2017 and the microbial activity of samples was determined by average well color development awcd parameters including the shannon diversity index simpson index and mcintosh index were calculated to determine the functional diversity after the batch sorption experiments the stainless steel screens were dried at 105 c for 2 h to determine the total mass per sample followed by ashing at 500 c for 4 h to evaluate the organic matter the fraction of organic matter f om was calculated to evaluate the mass of organic matter per mass of the biofilm or sediment after sorption tests biofilms from three screens were extracted for further analysis each screen was placed in a beaker containing 25 ml of 0 01 m naoh and sonicated for 1 h afterwards 0 01 m hcl at the same volume was added to neutralize the solution followed by filtering with 1 μm glass fiber filter writer 2010 ultraviolet light absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and doc normalized uv254 suva254 were measured for the extracted biofilm samples excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra was applied to characterize the fluorescent compositions of biofilm samples fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to observe the functional groups of biofilms before and after sorption of 1 mg l of target compounds the detailed procedures of eem and ftir analysis were provided in the text s4 2 4 data analysis for the batch sorption experiments the adsorbed amounts were calculated following equation 1 1 q s m total m aqueous m sorbent where q s is the concentration in the sorbent phase μg g m total is the target compound mass added to each experiment μg m aqueous is the target compound mass in the supernatant after 1 h μg and m sorbent is the mass of the sorbent phase g the sorption process was fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic equation 2 q t q e 1 e kt where q t q e and k refer to the adsorbed amount μg g by biofilm at time t the adsorbed amount μg g at equilibrium state and the constant of pseudo first order kinetics 1 min respectively partition constant k d and organic matter normalized partition coefficient k om between sorbent phase and aqueous phase could be used to evaluate the process according to equations 3 k d q s c aq 4 k om 100k d f om where q s and c aq refer to the concentrations of tested compounds in sorbent phase μg kg and in aqueous phase μg l respectively to compare the relative importance of sorption between biofilm and sediment matrices an empirical partitioning model was applied writer et al 2011a the detailed information on the calculation of expected fraction of paes in the matrices of water f aq biofilm f bf and sediment f sed were provided in text s5 all the data in the tests were shown as average values standard deviations with the number of repetitive tests provided a two tailed t test at the 95 significance level was used for comparisons of data p 0 05 using spss 20 0 non parametric spearman correlation analysis was performed using the euclidean distances and hierarchical cluster analysis in the pheatmap package of r 3 4 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical and biological characteristics of colonized biofilms spatial and seasonal variations were observed in the biofilm mass developed on the stainless steel screens table 2 and fig s5 the total mass and the organic matter mass ranged from 14 6 to 70 9 mg dm2 and 5 5 26 5 mg dm2 respectively in november 2017 the f om values at the three sites were in the order of downstream dongguapu upstream the total mass and organic matter content colonized in june 2018 were 2 7 4 7 times higher than those in november 2017 respectively the amount of chlorophyll a was positively related to the values of tn tp and nh3 n in table s1 suggesting the organic compounds synthesis capacity was highly related to nutrient levels the variances in the mass of biofilms could also be explained by the primary productivity reflected by the parameter of chlorophyll a wwtp effluents profoundly affect the hydrology physicochemical and biological characteristics of the receiving water bodies the higher amount of total mass and f om values indicated that rivers receiving the treated water below wwtps are more productive which may be explained by the elevated availability of nutrients and organic fractions downstream writer et al 2011a proia et al 2016 integrated spectral and biological analysis were performed to characterize the colonized biofilms the biofilms downstream the wwtp had the highest suva254 values among the colonized samples table s7 suggesting the highest levels of aromatic organic matters including aromatic contents humic acid lignin etc within biofilm chen et al 2003 2018 the eem spectra fig s6 and the relative proportion of each fluorescent fraction fig s7 indicated that biofilms colonized downstream the wwtp had relative higher intensities of aromatic proteins i and ii consistent with the results in suva254 analysis fig 1 and s8 illustrate the clsm spectra of biofilms taking the biofilms colonized in november 2017 as examples the relative proportions of three stained compounds fig s9 showed differences among sampling sites with proteins occupying the highest proportions in all samples 38 55 in november and 69 80 in june 2018 biolog eco microplates analysis suggested that the metabolic activities of colonized biofilms were significantly higher p 0 01 than sediment collected at the same site in terms of awcd values in figure s10a shabbir et al 2017 the diversity indices were slightly higher for biofilms compared to sediment in fig s10b confirming higher microbial diversity and richness in biofilms fig s10c shows that the atp amounts were significantly higher in biofilms than sediments p 0 01 while no remarkable discrepancies were observed in the activities of representative enzymes i e sod and lzm the biological analysis confirmed the higher metabolic activities of biofilm compared to sediments it has to be mentioned that no obvious difference in biological characteristics was observed among sampling sites the results demonstrate that even though water quality and aquatic environment remarkably affect the total amounts of generated biofilms among sites table 2 their effects on the microbial activities of biofilms were limited 3 2 sorption kinetics and isotherms of paes and bps onto biofilms prior to batch sorption tests the uptake of target compounds onto clean stainless steel screens were measured and the average fractions of the target compounds remaining in the aqueous phase were dmp 0 89 dbp 0 97 dehp 0 99 bpa 0 99 and tbbpa 0 97 suggesting the sorption of target compounds onto stainless steel screens was limited the henry s constant shown in table 1 indicates the tendency of a substance to escape from water into air even though the values for dbp dehp bpa and tbbpa were higher than the critical value of 1 01 10 2 pa m3 mol which suggested that theses compounds might potentially transfer to gas phase net et al 2015 however according to the measurements of remaining compounds in aqueous phase above the volatilization of tested compounds could be neglected the low concentrations of tested compound in river water 0 02 2 12 μg l in table s3 suggested that the potential sorption of the compounds during biofilm colonization could also be neglected the uptake of environmental relevant concentrations of paes at 400 μg l and bps at 100 μg l onto biofilms grown in november 2017 were determined in batch experiments fig 2 shows that the sorption of paes onto biofilms was limited with an uptake amount of 5 35 at 4 h the sorption of bps was more remarkable compared to paes which were almost totally absorbed at the end of run to evaluate the sorption kinetics of the target compounds the concentrations in the initial 1 h were measured and the adsorption capacities were shown in fig s11 the sorption kinetics could be well fitted with the pseudo first order kinetic equation table s8 with r 2 in the range of 0 87 0 99 the q e values for paes and bps ranged from 38 2 to 239 0 μg g and 1787 7 4425 6 μg g respectively in which biofilms cultivated below the wwtp exhibited the highest capacity in adsorbing the target compounds considering the flowing state of effluents or river water the contact time between tested compounds and biofilms in riverbed is limited the quick uptake behaviors of paes and bps suggested that biofilms are important matrix to adsorb retain and amplify the concentrations of plasticizers after discharging into fluvial systems fig 3 shows the adsorbed amounts of contaminants at various initial concentrations at the end of sorption tests the sorption capacities gradually increased as a function of initial concentrations biofilms at downstream showed the highest adsorption capacity among the field sites 1 1 4 9 times higher than those at other sites since the water quality remained relatively stable during the experiments at dongguapu bridge compared to other sites shown in table s1 the biofilms colonized at this site were selected as model biofilms to compare the seasonal difference in sorption behaviors the adsorbed amounts of dbp and bps per gram of biofilm did not show significant difference between biofilm colonized in november 2017 and june 2018 while some variances were observed between the sorption of dbp and dehp onto colonized biofilms from two seasons based on the previous studies hydrophobic partitioning into organic matter largely govern the sorption of dbp and dehp on solid matrices kalmykova et al 2013 gao and wen 2016 thus the higher uptake of paes in these cases might possibly attributed to the difference in organic contents f om 0 37 in november compared to 0 17 in june in the biofilms samples generated at dongguapu bridge during different seasons table 2 existing data indicated that bpa and its congeners exhibited higher tendency for sorption to environmental matrices such as soils and sediments compared to paes fromme et al 2002 the results were in consistent with the sorption capacities of bps and paes by sediments and biofilms in the following discussion according to previous studies organic matter abundance largely governs the sorption behaviors of bpa sun et al 2012 which could help explain the higher sorption capacities onto biofilm samples with relatively high organic contents in this study the covalent bonds formed between bpa and solid matrices might be responsible for the higher sorption capacity liu et al 2013 im and loffler 2016 at neutral ph the ionic properties of bpa pk a pf 9 6 and tbbpa pk a values of 7 5 and 8 5 resulted in the presence of more ionic forms in solution the presence of ionic forms of bpa and tbbpa might favor the interactions between sorption sites on solid surfaces and bisphenols which might help explain the higher sorption capacity of bps compared to paes the partitioning of organic pollutants in biofilms and sediments could be described in terms of solute partitioning in hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases chiou et al 1979 based on the linear sorption isotherms in fig s11 the values of log k d and log k om for paes were calculated among which dehp showed the highest partition constants table s9 it has to be pointed out that almost all the bps were readily sorbed onto biofilms in fig 2 during the sorption tests consequently the c aq values were rather low at the end of sorption tests and it is difficult to predict a linear relationship between q s and c aq for experiments absorbing bps thus the values of log k d and log k om of bps could not be generated by using the experimental results in this test 3 3 sorption behaviors in response to environmental matrices to reveal the potential degradation efficiency of the compounds during sorption the concentrations of target contaminants in both aqueous phase and in the extracted biofilm suspensions were measured using biofilm colonized at dongguapu bridge as models fig 4 shows the fractions of total mass of contaminants sorbed by biofilm and in aqueous phase by biofilms cultivated at dongguapu bridge in june 2018 as examples the total fractions in the aqueous phase and sorbed by biofilm occupied 95 1 88 8 95 7 96 0 and 93 6 respectively for dmp dbp dehp bpa and tbbpa suggesting the fraction degraded by the microorganisms in the biofilm was limited during the 4 h sorption tests the results were in agreement with previous reports suggesting that the half lives of the tested compounds vary from less than one day to 900 h in sediments net et al 2015 im and loffler 2016 our results confirm that the uptake to biofilms is the initial step controlling the distribution and fate of the tested compounds in the aqueous systems writer et al 2011a the variances in sorption capacities between river biofilm and sediments were evaluated the f om of sediments at upstream downstream and at dongguapu were 0 097 0 038 0 126 0 017 and 0 095 0 006 respectively much lower than the values of biofilms table s10 the biofilms were significantly more effective than sediments in sorbing paes and bps from the aqueous phase with the sorption capacities an order and ten orders of magnitude greater than those of the sediments respectively fig 5 the adsorbed amounts did not show significant difference between sediments and base rinsed sediments suggesting that the inorganic fractions contributed to the uptake of contaminants mackintosh et al 2006 writer et al 2011a the downstream biofilm showed the highest sorption capacities per unit mass which was possibly attributed to the highest organic content f om 0 42 among colonized biofilms figs 3 and 5 compared to sediments the higher metabolic activities reflected atp amounts microbial diversity and richness in colonized biofilms fig s10 might be another reason for the enhanced sorption capacity however the biological characteristics did not show significant difference among sampling sites the results provided additional evidence that the distinct sorption behaviors at different sampling sites shown in fig 3 were mainly attributed to the organic contents rather than biological properties among samples since the uptake of bpa and tbbpa onto biofilms are almost complete at equilibrium state and the remaining concentrations c aq are low shown in figs 3 and 4 it is improper to calculate the k d values of bisphenols table s9 summarizes the estimated mass fractions of paes in different environmental matrixes in a small river system biodegradation and photolysis were ignored in this analysis as confirmed in fig 5 although the calculated total amount of paes in the sediments were higher than in the biofilms 0 62 0 75 compared to 0 24 to 0 38 concentrations of these contaminants will be higher in the biofilms due to their lower total mass compared to sediment the results provide evidence that the form of river biofilm could serve as important reservoirs for emerging contaminants 3 4 environmental factors affecting the sorption behaviors relationships of sorption parameters and biofilm properties described above were established to explore the main factors governing the sorption behaviors using the spearman correlation analysis fig 6 among the water quality parameters nh3 n and tn generally showed significant positive correlations with sorption parameters this could be explained by the increased liable nutrient loads to riverbed biofilms which promoted the production of biofilm mass and available functional sites for binding of contaminants onto biofilms flemming 1995 in terms of the internal properties of biofilm f om was positively correlated with most of the sorption parameters suggesting organic contents remarkably governed to the sorption of trace organic pollutants razzaque and grathwohl 2008 wunder et al 2011 wu et al 2018 unlike protein contents which were mostly negatively correlated to sorption parameters the contents of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides showed higher positive correlations the results were in agreement with previous studies which demonstrated that charged or hydrophobic polysaccharides as well as eps glycoconjugates were mainly responsible for the sorption and ion exchange function of biofilms flemming et al 2007 flemming and wingender 2010 previous studies suggest that environmental factors metal content natural organic matter etc and biofilm properties moisture contents and organic fractions could affect the sorption of hydrophobic organic contaminants onto biofilms in biofilm reactor systems wicke et al 2008 wunder et al 2011 the analysis here provided evidence that the sorption capacities of biofilm samples could be predicted considering the surrounding water quality and the internal properties of biofilms for example at higher nutrient levels the generated biofilms were probably more productive and contained higher amounts of sorption sites for contaminants flemming 1995 biofilms with higher organic content and fractions such as smp like fulvic like and polysaccharides might serve as superior reservoirs for trace organic contaminants 3 5 sorption mechanism of paes and bps to biofilms the partitioning of trace organic pollutants is highly related to the f om values the sorption capacity of biofilms is found linearly correlated to the sum of nonpolar aliphatic fractions and aromatic fractions fig 7 a provides the relationship between k ow and sorption to biofilm samples k om in this study as well as for endocrine disrupting compounds and plasticizers sorption other environmental matrices previous studies indicated that non specific hydrophobic partitioning is the primary sorption mechanism for trace organic pollutants including steroidal hormones into the biofilm which were affected by various factors including the dissolved organic matter salinity and the mineral contents xu and li 2008 lu et al 2016 sorption of target compounds was observed in fig 5 to base rinsed sediments providing evidence that the compounds evaluated can interact through other mechanisms than hydrophobic distribution interaction lu et al indicated that paes could interact with minerals through h bonding between co groups and adsorbed h2o lu et al 2016 the difference between the reported values and the data in fig 7a suggested the possibility for other mechanisms in the sorption processes such as the molecular size distribution and the organic matter fractions of biofilms writer et al 2011a gao and wen 2016 compared to soil and sediment organic matter which contained both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions derived from the biodegradation of plant debris river biofilms are primarily comprised of labile low molecular weight domains such as proteins lipids and polysaccharides flemming 1995 the younger biofilm organic matter was observed less aromatic compared to the allochthonous organic matters in soils and sediments which could be another reason explaining the relatively lower k ow values in figrue 7a nguyen et al 2005 to probe the molecular interactions between the target compounds and the biofilms ftir spectra of the biofilms before and after sorption of these compounds is conducted and shown in fig 7b the peaks attributed to the skeletal vibration of cc bonds shifted from 1635 to 1648 cm 1 after adsorption of compounds especially for dehp bpa and tbbpa respectively which confirmed that π π interactions play important roles in the sorption processes between biofilm and tested compounds yang and xing 2010 wang et al 2014 the relative peak intensities at 1118 cm 1 experienced an increase compared to the raw biofilm suggesting that the co band coc and cop bands in polysaccharides were important functional groups interacting with these compounds the results provided further evidence that polysaccharides or eps glycoconjugates were involved in the adhesion and accumulation of tested compounds at a molecular level flemming et al 2007 the peak corresponding to asymmetric no2 stretching at 1538 cm 1 blue shifted to 1545 cm 1 after sorption of dehp bpa and tbbpa suggesting a strengthening of the no bonds which favors the interaction and sorption of these compounds onto biofilms wang et al 2014 4 conclusions river biofilm could facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of trace organic pollutants with an integrated use of field site colonization and experimental analysis the sorption of representative paes and bps onto biofilms generated in natural river systems are systematically investigated based on the results it can be concluded that the total mass and internal characteristics of colonized biofilms show seasonal and spatial variances in response to water quality river biofilms are important sorbates for plasticizers compared to surface sediment bps are more easily sorbed onto biofilms compared to paes possibly due to the ionic nature and formed covalent bonds with biofilms certain water qualities e g tn and nh3 n and biofilm properties e g organic and polysaccharide fractions could potentially predict the sorption capacities of trace organic contaminants by river biofilms hydrophobic partitioning into organic matter is found to play a major role in the sorption process and polysaccharides were observed to be the key fractions responsible for the sorption reactions our work yields vivid insights into the early migration of paes and bps discharged into rivers by biofilms and sediments in addition the integrated macroscopic and microcosmic investigation benefits our understanding in the sorption mechanisms by biofilm matrix future work on the uptake of emerging contaminants onto biofilms in flowing conditions is needed to stimulate the fate of these compounds under hydrodynamic conditions the biodegradation and mineralization studies are also required to determine their long term fate in rivers

19113,suspended growth mixed community phototrophic wastewater treatment systems including high rate algal ponds and photobioreactors have the potential to achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus recovery with effluent nutrient concentrations below the current limit of technology in order to achieve reliable and predictive performance it is necessary to establish a thorough understanding of how design and operational decisions influence the complex community structure governing nutrient recovery in these systems solids residence time srt a critical operational parameter governing growth rate was leveraged as a selective pressure to shape microbial community structure in laboratory scale photobioreactors fed secondary effluent from a local wastewater treatment plant in order to decouple the effects of srt and hydraulic retention time hrt nutrient loading was fixed across all experimental conditions and the effect of changing srt on microbial community structure diversity and stability as well as its impact on nutrient recovery was characterized reactors were operated at distinct srts 5 10 and 15 days with diurnal lighting over long term operation 6 srts and in depth examination of the eukaryotic and bacterial community structure was performed using amplicon based sequencing of the 18s and 16s rrna genes respectively in order to better represent the microalgal community structure this study leveraged improved 18s rrna gene primers that have been shown to provide a more accurate representation of the wastewater process relevant algal community members long term operation resulted in distinct eukaryotic communities across srts independent of the relative abundance of operational taxonomic units otus in the inoculum the longest srt 15 days srt 15 resulted in a more stable algal community along with stable bacterial nitrification while the shortest srt 5 days srt 5 resulted in a less stable more dynamic community although srt was not strongly associated with overall bacterial diversity the eukaryotic community of srt 15 was significantly less diverse and less even than srt 5 with a few dominant otus making up a majority of the eukaryotic community structure in the former overall although longer srts promote stable bacterial nitrification short srts promote higher eukaryotic diversity increased functional stability and better total n removal via biomass assimilation these results indicate that srt may be a key factor in not only controlling microalgal community membership but community diversity and functional stability as well ultimately the efficacy and reliability of nh4 removal may be in tension with tn removal in mixed phototrophic systems given that lower srts may achieve better total n removal via biomass assimilation through increased eukaryotic diversity biomass productivity and functional stability graphical abstract image 1 keywords algae photobioreactor pbr tertiary treatment nutrient recovery ecology high throughput

wastewater xu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the latter of which lacks residual organics and the continuous influx of mixed communities of microorganisms to our knowledge there have been no studies that specifically examine the effect of srt separate from nutrient loading effects on mixed phototrophic communities in suspended growth systems treating secondary effluent limiting our ability to design effective and reliable phototrophic tertiary treatment systems as the field seeks to engineer systems that achieve reliable and predictive behavior there is a critical need to understand how design and operational decisions such as hrt and srt influence the complex phototrophic communities present in suspended growth systems and in turn how these communities affect nutrient and carbon dynamics the full complexity of phototrophic systems which consist of eukaryotic microalgae phototrophic bacteria i e cyanobacteria and chemotrophic bacteria both heterotrophs and autotrophs has only just begun to be explored e g cho et al 2017 mark ibekwe et al 2017 and we have limited understanding of the selective pressures that operating parameters including srt have on community structure and overall system performance studies that have examined algal community ecology in wastewater systems have often relied on microscopy park et al 2011 and have occasionally applied high throughput sequencing techniques e g illumina sequencing cho et al 2017 mark ibekwe et al 2017 which have been otherwise widely utilized in wastewater studies e g purkhold et al 2000 however the use of high throughput sequencing with eukaryotic algal communities and in particular the application of sequencing methods to eukaryotic microalgae in wastewater has lagged far behind that of bacterial and archaeal applications bradley et al 2016 previous studies have mostly been used to identify dominant organisms xu et al 2015 and until recently relied on suboptimal primer sets that represent algal community structure with a large degree of error discussed in detail in bradley et al 2016 the objective of this work was to examine the specific effect of srt isolated from nutrient loading effects on mixed phototrophic community structure and nutrient recovery in suspended growth systems used for tertiary treatment to this end we apply high throughput sequencing techniques using improved eukaryotic primers bradley et al 2016 along with well established bacterial primers to provide clear quantitative evidence regarding community diversity and dynamics as a function of srt three flat panel pbrs were operated at distinct srts 5 10 and 15 days using actual secondary effluent for long term operation 6 srts after reaching steady state all biomass was then mixed and redistributed across reactors and long term operation was repeated to evaluate the strength of srt as a selective pressure in driving community structure and overall system performance in addition to examining the algal and bacterial community membership and abundance we examine the overall nutrient recovery focused on total nitrogen tn and specific nutrient dynamics nh4 no2 no3 po4 3 driven by srt and community structure ultimately integrating an understanding of community structure dynamics in phototrophic systems along with metrics and drivers of process performance is key to enabling the design of systems that reliably recover n and p from a given wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 photobioreactor pbr design and operation long term experimentation was done using flat panel pbrs as described in detail in by gardner dale and colleagues gardner dale et al 2017 briefly 4 l working volume pbrs with a short light path thickness of 25 mm were operated with continuous flow i e as chemostats and subjected to a day night cycle of 14 h light and 10 h dark representative of summer daylight hours in urbana il usa all reactors were lit from one side using red and blue light emitting diodes blaze 12 v led elemental led controlled via a microcontroller arduino uno r3 sparkfun electronics to output a sinusoidal pattern that approximated normal daylight variation červený et al 2009 nedbal et al 2008 with a total peak light intensity blue red of 220 μe m 2 s 1 air sparging was provided at 0 1 lair lreactor min 1 guest et al 2013 to ensure well mixed conditions and ph was controlled below 7 65 approximately 7 50 0 15 using 99 co2 gas with ph controllers and solenoid valves although multiple processes can affect ph e g co2 assimilation will increase ph ammonia assimilation will decrease ph fuggi et al 1981 reactors consistently demonstrated a net increase in ph during daylight hours and thus ph control via co2 addition was adequate all experimentation was performed in a temperature controlled laboratory with ambient air temperature of 20 4 22 7 c and stable reactor temperature conditions at 22 8 0 3 c 2 2 secondary effluent and examination of srt effects reactors were operated at an srt hrt of 5 10 and 15 days consistent with past photobioreactor experiments that achieved reliable performance e g gardner dale et al 2017 and in the range of typical biological treatment processes rittmann and mccarty 2001 tchobanoglous et al 2014 secondary effluent was collected weekly from the local wwtp urbana il usa which predominantly treats municipal wastewater and stored in the dark at 4 c before and during use as photobioreactor influent srt and hrt were not physically separated and thus were the same in order to examine the effect of growth rate governed by srt on system performance the daily nutrient loading was set at a fixed rate across all reactors and srts following the method of mindl and colleagues mindl et al 2005 and gardner dale and colleagues gardner dale et al 2017 by keeping nutrient loading constant differences in community function and structure may be attributed to srt and growth rate rather than nutrient loading effects caused by hrt mindl et al 2005 across all reactors daily nutrient loading was fixed at 15 mg n l 1 d 1 and 4 mg p l 1 d 1 which is equivalent to a typical secondary effluent mccarty et al 2011 assuming an algal system hrt of approximately 1 day the raw secondary effluent contained 10 15 mg n l 1 and 1 3 mg p l 1 tp 1 mg as po4 3 and had bod5 of 2 7 6 9 mg l 1 in order to achieve consistent loading across srts the concentrations of total nitrogen and orthophosphate of the secondary effluent were measured immediately after collection and each srt s medium was amended with nh4cl to 75 150 and 225 mg n l 1 for srts of 5 10 and 15 days respectively and k2hpo4 to 20 40 and 60 mg p l 1 for srts of 5 10 and 15 days respectively to achieve the fixed daily n and p loadings final stock concentrations of n and p were primarily in the form of nh4 and po4 3 97 and approximately 90 98 respectively secondary effluent for each srt was also amended with micronutrients according to a modified tap media with improved trace metals kropat et al 2011 to ensure adequate concentrations table s1 as well as 300 mg l 1 d 1 alkalinity as caco3 to increase buffering capacity 2 3 inoculum and pbr start up period biomass samples for inoculation of long term cultivation experiments were collected locally urbana il usa from four different sources to capture a variety of bacterial and algal communities and to ensure a large diversity of microorganisms were subjected to selective pressures 1 primary and 2 secondary clarifier weirs at a local wwtp urbana il 3 a pilot scale algaewheel system treating swine manure and 4 a eutrophic lake biomass from each location was strained through a 0 6 mm mesh screen to remove macroalgae and then mixed in equal proportions by cell count neglecting biovolume performed via fluorescence light microscopy 200x magnification before being distributed among each of three parallel reactors an initial acclimation period of two weeks was designed to limit the loss of species due to washout while transitioning the inoculum to laboratory conditions pbrs were operated in batch mode under nutrient replete conditions for seven days to increase culture density and to retain species diversity and continuous light intensity was gradually increased from 40 to 100 peak intensity 220 μe m 2 s 1 to allow culture acclimation at the end of day seven the three reactors were mixed together re strained and redistributed back into the three pbrs and srt separation was initiated pbrs were operated for another seven days with srt separation and diurnal light to begin selection for distinct communities all cultures were then mixed together redistributed and long term experimentation was initiated 2 4 long term pbr operation and sampling long term experimentation was performed in two phases in phase 1 reactors were inoculated and run in parallel at different srts 5 10 and 15 days with a fixed nutrient loading section 2 2 each reactor was run for 6 srts until reaching a steady state as defined by a less than 5 change in total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss over three consecutive days after the three reactors achieved steady state biomass from all three reactors were combined strained and mixed in equal proportions by mass tss and then redistributed across three clean reactors and long term experimentation repeated as phase 2 this replicate run of each srt in series i e phase 1 followed by phase 2 was performed to evaluate the strength of srt as a selective pressure and to more deeply examine microbial community divergence and stability across srts all reactors srt 5 10 and 15 days were again operated for 6 srts until steady state was achieved during each phase water quality and biomass samples were taken to determine solids concentrations total and volatile n and p effluent concentrations and community composition microscopy and dna analysis samples were taken more frequently at the start of experimentation to capture system startup dynamics see table s2 for detailed sample schedule samples were taken 1 h prior to the end of the light cycle when algal carbon reserves and nutrient uptake has been shown to be at its peak gardner dale et al 2017 briefly 130 ml aliquots of mixed liquor were removed from each reactor 30 ml of which was used for tss and vss analysis and 100 ml of which was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min 20 ml of the resulting supernatant was filtered through 0 22 μm pvdf filters emd millipore ma usa before freezing at 20 c until analysis and the remaining 80 ml of supernatant was returned to the reactors to minimize the effect of sampling on reactor operation pelleted biomass was stored at 20 c prior to lyophilization and storage with desiccant before elemental analysis 2 5 kinetic assay at the end of phase 1 and phase 2 when steady state had been achieved a portion of the biomass was removed from each reactor to observe the maximum specific uptake rates of n and p in order to gain insight into the intrinsic i e maximum potential uptake rates by the microbial community and differentiate them from the extant rates i e actual rates already seen under steady state conditions grady jr et al 1996 kinetic assays were performed using peak light intensity and nutrient replete conditions consistent with past work guest et al 2013 briefly the biomass was placed in identical reactors i e same photobioreactors as continuous operation with secondary effluent and ph control and spiked with 50 mg n l 1 as nh4cl and 20 mg p l 1 as k2hpo4 to ensure nutrient availability would not limit observed nutrient uptake rates during the kinetic study following nutrient addition reactors were exposed to continuous light and operated in batch mode to determine the maximum specific i e vss normalized uptake rates of n and p as mg nutrient g vss 1 d 1 guest et al 2013 with sampling occurring approximately every 6 h during the first 48 h when rates were at a maximum although internal nutrient stores can reduce the maximum observed rates of n and p uptake bougaran et al 2010 no effort was made to deplete existing reserves prior to batch experimentation in order to expedite the transition from continuous operation to batch uptake measurements reducing time for community structure shift each reactor was monitored for changes in biomass composition and microbial community via microscopy and because maximum specific uptake rates were observed within the first 24 48 h of batch operation changes in community structure were expected to be limited at the time of intrinsic parameter estimation however srt 5 phase 2 data showed significant changes in the community structure at the end of 6 days and these data were excluded 2 6 water quality monitoring and biomass elemental analysis reactor effluent was analyzed for tss vss total nitrogen tn nh4 no3 no2 and po4 3 detailed descriptions and method development can be found in gardner dale et al 2017 briefly tss and vss were measured using standard methods apha 2012 modified to use 0 7 μm glass fiber filters gf f whatman to retain microalgae tn was measured via the total nitrogen persulfate digestion test n tube method hach co usa ammonium via the standard phenate method modified for a microplate apha 2012 anions 1 mg l 1 including nitrate nitrite phosphate sulfate and chloride by ion chromatography ic ics 2000 dionex and low levels 1 mg p l 1 of orthophosphate by the standard ascorbic acid method modified for a microplate apha 2012 lyophilized biomass samples were analyzed for carbon hydrogen nitrogen and phosphorus chnp masselement massalgae 1 by the microanalysis laboratory at the university of illinois at urbana champaign school of chemical sciences using a chns o elemental analyzer perkin elmer 2400 series ii and for phosphorus by icp ms perkin elmer sciex elan drc e 2 7 dna extraction amplification and sequencing individual samples for amplicon based sequencing were taken from all inocula sources after each acclimation period and during long term experimentation phase 1 and phase 2 all samples were processed and sequenced in duplicate approximately 5 mg of biomass was collected and centrifuged before dna extraction via a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedical ca usa and stored at 20 c until amplification individual sample dna was amplified in triplicate via pcr using a kapa hifi hotstart pcr kit kapa biosystems ma usa with primers designed to target the v4 and v8 v9 variable regions of the 18s rrna gene for eukaryotes v4 forward primer reuk454fwd1 5 ccgcascygcggtaattcc 3 reverse primer v4r 5 actttcgttcttgat 3 v8 v9 forward primer v8f 5 ataacaggtctgtgatgccct 3 reverse primer 1510r 5 ccttcygcaggttcacctac 3 with thermocycling conditions and reagent concentrations as described previously bradley et al 2016 these primers were previously shown to have less amplification bias and lower overall error in evaluating microalgal communities of interest to the wastewater field bradley et al 2016 additionally two different primer sets were used to provide complementary information of the eukaryotic community and to identify any differences in community representation due to the selected primers and target amplification region bradley et al 2016 together this approach provides a robust evaluation of the microalgal community structure that allows clear quantitative examination of the effect of srt on eukaryotic diversity and dynamics dna was separately amplified with bacteria specific primers targeting the v1 v3 variable region of the 16s rrna gene according to the midas field guide mcilroy et al 2015 microbial database for activated sludge aalborg university briefly the target region was amplified using the v1 v3 primers v1 forward primer 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 v3 reverse primer 534r 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 with the thermocyling conditions amended for the kapa hifi hotstart pcr kit 95 c for 2 min 25 cycles of 98 c for 20 s 65 c for 30 s and 72 c for 60 s with a final extension at 72 c for 5 min triplicate amplicon libraries per sample were purified using gel electrophoresis followed by cleaning of excised band using qiaquick gel purification kit qiagen before pooling dna concentration of individual amplicon libraries was checked in triplicate using a qubit 2 0 invitrogen before final pooling of individual samples at equimolar proportions in addition to environmental and experimental samples the final 18s rrna pooled library for each the v4 and v8 v9 region contained 2 mock community dna samples consisting of dna from 12 wastewater and environmental algal species in equal amounts as described previously bradley et al 2016 amplicon libraries were sequenced using the illumina miseq illumina with v3 chemistry 2 300 paired end reads at the roy j carver biotechnology center at the university of illinois at urbana champaign all sequencing data can be found online at the ncbi sequencing read archive sra under accession number srp136652 corresponding to bioproject prjna439292 2 8 sequence read processing and analysis raw sequence data was demultiplexed using bcl2fastq v2 17 1 14 conversion software illumina to determine the appropriate quality and read length overlap parameters for processing the 18s rrna gene data an analysis was performed on the included mock community sequences as described in bradley et al 2016 see sm for additional information to determine the quality and length cutoffs that reasonably approximated the theoretical community while retaining the most reads these values were determined to be a phred quality score of q27 and length cutoff of 270 nt for the v4 region and q28 and 185 nt for the v8 v9 region following quality trimming and removal of reads below the length cutoff using sickle all further processing of sequences was performed using mothur v 1 39 5 kozich et al 2013 according to the standard operating procedure miseq sop accessed september 10 2017 at https www mothur org wiki miseq sop unless otherwise specified scripts used can be found online at https dx doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 6051812 briefly following contig formation sequences were trimmed and aligned to the silva v128 database files curated by mothur using the full database and mothur s recreated silva seed for the 18s and 16s rrna gene sequences respectively chimera detection and removal was performed using the vsearch algorithm rognes et al 2016 and all sequences were then classified with the full silva v128 database as reference prior to otu clustering 97 and classification for further examination of specific unknown otus representative otu sequences were obtained using the get oturep command and examined using ncbi s blast altschul 1990 it is worth noting that the most commonly occurring bacterial otu was matched to the cyanobacteria using the classify otus command however upon closer inspection this otu best matched the chloroplast sequence of scenedesmus sp and was removed prior to further analysis from the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequence data alpha diversity metrics observed otus chao1 index inverse simpson index and nonparametric shannon index and beta diversity metrics jaccard and bray curtis dissimilarity were also calculated with subsample 2000 pcoa analysis was performed using bray curtis dissimilarity matrices on subsets of samples of interest in order to examine the relationship between taxonomic richness and functional metrics such as n and p uptake a co occurrence network analysis was run for all sequencing sets and across all reactors and phases but no strong correlations were found between performance metrics and specific otus sm section s5 correlations were found between specific otus or sets of otus but these relationships occurred only between rare taxa and did not provide insight into the experimental system the importance of these relationships is unknown and requires further examination in future work 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial community structure long term operation of mixed community reactors demonstrated that distinct eukaryotic communities assemble across srts fig 1 phase 1 fig s2 phase 2 and that diversity decreased with increasing srt mean relative abundance of otus present at steady state operation did not depend on initial concentration of the otus in the inoculum when examining the top ten otus present in each reactor representing a total of 20 otus across all three reactors it was observed that only nine of the 20 total otus were also prevalent i e contribute to the top 90 of mean relative abundance in the inocula sources additionally the inocula showed high richness and diversity for the community as a whole average across all four sources of inocula sobs 99 25 dnpshannon 2 73 following the start up period in which cultures were acclimated to laboratory conditions and lighting selection of specific communities in response to srt was observed after approximately 20 days rare otus including those that showed limited or no representation in sequencing data from the inocula were present at steady state operation although the effect of influent community members on long term community structural dynamics in microbial processes needs additional study the otus seen at steady state here related more closely with the initial inoculum after acclimation fig 1 w2 than to those otus present in influent media secondary effluent see also figs s3 s6 and the presence of influent microbial species on steady state community structure appears to be minimal this underscores the importance of selective environments conditions within the reactor which favor a particular species or function out of many rittmann and mccarty 2001 which have in general been leveraged in algal systems mooij et al 2013 excluding events such as species die off and invasion initial inoculum concentrations and the general proportion of species present at the start should not influence the presence and abundance of species at steady state this is especially evident when comparing cyanobacterial otus in which the most prevalent cyanobacterial otu otu3 pseudanabaena sp fig 1 is found in appreciable concentrations in all three reactors over time mean relative abundance of total bacterial diversity on average 14 4 12 9 and 6 4 respectively despite only being found in the inocula at less than 0 07 of the total mean relative read abundance in 16s rrna gene data sequencing data fig 1 along with microscopy sm fig s10 show that srt 5 operating at the fastest growth rate was dominated by filamentous eukaryotes and cyanobacteria such as pseudanabaena sp on the other hand srt 15 was dominated by unicellular and colonial green algae such as chlamydomonas sp and acutodesmus sp respectively for full taxonomy of both phase 1 and phase 2 for eukaryotes v4 and v8 v9 variable region and bacteria v1 v3 variable region see sm fig s7 through fig s9 srt 10 operating between the two displayed a mixture of filamentous and unicellular algae and cyanobacteria biomass was deep green in color and the majority of observed cells had green pigmentation this along with sequencing data in which cyanobacteria often represented a significant fraction of 16s rrna gene sequences confirmed that the microbial community was dominated by phototrophic organisms small unicellular algae such as those seen in srt 15 often exhibit fast growth rates and more competitive nutrient utilization than larger cells jakob o nalley maria stockenreiter 2014 shurin et al 2014 and typically dominate conventional microalgal systems e g hrap systems de godos et al 2014 park et al 2011 however filamentous microalgae and cyanobacteria such as those seen in srt 5 have been shown to maintain a strong dominance under wash out pressure due to their high settleability hu et al 2017 here filamentous eukaryotes and cyanobacteria are selected at low srt due to a combination of fast growth rates high settling efficiency and attached growth tendencies genera present in all reactors are among those commonly found in phototrophic wastewater treatment processes mark ibekwe et al 2017 park et al 2011 roberts et al 2013 and are likely to be found across locations and climates that utilize phototrophic microorganisms for treatment srt also resulted in distinct differences in algal community richness and abundance with a short srt resulting in a more dynamic and diverse community while a longer srt promotes otu dominance and community structural stability although some dominant eukaryotic otus e g otu 1 were shared between all reactors there is a clear variation in diversity i e community membership and abundance across srts with srt 5 demonstrating high diversity both in terms of species richness and abundance and srt 15 being dominated by only a few otus in total for eukaryotes 28 otus contribute to the top 90 of mean relative read abundance for srt 5 compared to 12 otus for srt 10 and 4 otus for srt 15 cyanobacterial abundance is also concentrated in a few otus for all srts fig 1 cyanobacteria with the top otus contributing 16 7 16 3 and 9 02 of total bacterial mean relative abundance across the three reactors four alpha diversity metrics were calculated richness based metrics observed otus sobs and the chao1 estimator rchao and structure based metrics which account for both species richness and evenness nonparametric shannon index dnpshannon and inverse simpson index dinvsimpson across metrics results confirm increasing srt resulted in a reduction of eukaryotic community diversity srt 5 has 2x the richness sobs 105 and diversity dnpshannon 2 98 of that present at higher srts srt 10 sobs 40 dnpshannon 1 46 srt 15 sobs 46 dnpshannon 1 65 this trend was not observed in the bacterial communities with bacterial richness and diversity remaining nearly the same across all three reactors sobs 279 278 and 269 dnpshannon 4 41 4 47 and 4 50 across reactors 5 10 and 15 respectively in all reactors bacterial richness was 2 7x higher than that of eukaryotic richness a trend that became stronger with increasing srt because bacterial richness stayed relatively constant while eukaryotic richness decreased with increasing srt the question of srt effect on microbial diversity has been a matter of debate although rarely addressed in the literature chen et al 2017 akarsubasi et al hypothesized that increasing srt would lead to increased bacterial diversity akarsubasi et al 2009 which might be expected due to niche differentiation and longer srts that favor organisms which utilize scarce resources i e k strategists vuono et al 2015 although experimentation showed only weak support for this with diversity remaining nearly the same across srts an observation also seen in another study bagchi et al 2015 in contrast saikaly et al explicitly measured the effect of srt on the bacterial diversity of activated sludge systems and found that short srts were associated with higher diversity saikaly et al 2005 this effect has also been seen in other wastewater treatment processes which have shown lower microbial diversity in processes which use longer srts over shorter ones e g hu et al 2012 silva et al 2010 overall the data presented here demonstrate a consistent and reproducible relationship between srt and diversity for the eukaryotic algal community with diversity decreasing with increasing srt a finding that is consistent with previous studies that have examined bacterial diversity only hu et al 2012 saikaly et al 2005 silva et al 2010 in contrast there was no change in diversity across srt for the bacterial communities in this study the presence of bacteria that are central to wastewater treatment such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were also found over long term operation and increased over time and with increasing srt all otus belonging to the aob were identified as being in the genus nitrosomonas while otus belonging to the nob were identified as nitrospira fig 1 nitrifying bacteria it is worth noting that although all nob present in the system belonged to the genus nitrospira not all nitrospira are nob and this genus represents nob and comammox cmx daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 the highest concentration of nitrosomonas sp 2 1 occurred in srt 15 during the last srt of operation although srt 10 also had a consistent presence of nitrosomonas sp average 0 36 nitrospira sp were slightly less abundant reaching peak totals between 0 19 and 0 62 of the total bacterial diversity nitrosomonas sp was present within the range commonly seen in wastewater treatment 0 01 9 3 kim et al 2011 layton et al 2005 and nitrospira were at concentrations similar to those seen by kim and colleagues in a full scale activated sludge process 0 16 kim et al 2011 somewhat surprisingly nitrobacter sp was not detected despite being commonly found in wastewater treatment siripong and rittmann 2007 however nitrospira are more frequently the dominant nob in activated sludge systems burrell et al 1999 juretschko et al 1998 siripong and rittmann 2007 although only detected in one inoculum source secondary effluent 0 11 and not detected during the first 30 days of long term experimentation nitrospira increased in concentration over time and resulted in mean relative abundances of 0 20 0 62 and 0 19 across the three srts the presence of nitrifying organisms at longer srts is not surprising with aob and nob being slow growers and with wastewater processes that utilize these organisms usually operating at 10 day srts tchobanoglous et al 2014 3 2 community dynamics beta diversity measurements including the membership based presence absence jaccard djaccard and structure based bray curtis dbraycurtis dissimilarity show community membership and structure of each microbial community changes through time and that these differences are less prominent at higher srts pcoa plots of phase 1 fig 2 a top and phase 2 fig 2a bottom demonstrate that all communities shifted away from the initial starting community inocula mixture t 0 and toward a steady state community fig 2a circled data points in phase 1 srt 5 was the most dissimilar to the initial inoculum dbraycurtis 0 93 0 01 srt 15 remained the most similar dbraycurtis 0 46 0 07 and srt 10 was in between dbraycurtis 0 66 0 07 however after mixing all biomass in equal proportions by mass for the replicate run section 2 4 srt 15 remained stable and stayed within a dissimilarity of 0 30 0 01 while srt 5 and srt 10 communities again diverged from the initial mixed community and reached a new steady state community that diverged more substantially from the initial community dbraycurtis 0 48 0 02 and dbraycurtis 0 65 0 03 respectively in all cases during phase 2 divergence from the initial community may have been somewhat muted due to loss of diversity over long term experimentation and all communities showed less divergence during phase 2 than during phase 1 this may be attributed to selective environments and competition over longer time scales that reduced diversity at the community level i e inter species diversity and at the species level i e intra species and trait diversity nonetheless these results show the highest stability for srt 15 which after establishing itself during phase 1 changes little during phase 2 even after mixing with the other dominant species present in srt 5 and srt 10 furthermore srt 5 and 10 have markedly different steady state communities between phase 1 and phase 2 dbraycurtis 0 87 0 00 and dbraycurtis 0 48 0 01 compared to srt 15 dbraycurtis 0 16 0 01 to normalize the results to a common stage of operation i e number of srts we also examined the dissimilarity with inocula after six srts of operation for each reactor fig 3 c after which communities were operating at steady state the dissimilarities at this time point reflect the same relationships seen over the length of the full experiment and when comparing as time series days these results demonstrate that longer srts result in more stable communities while shorter srts result in less stable or conversely more dynamic communities unstable environments such as those seen in srt 5 or those that undergo perturbation events are more likely to contain fast growing organisms that have high resource utilization i e r strategists pianka 1970 furthermore vuono and colleagues were able to show srt may be leveraged to impose an r k selection on organisms in wastewater treatment short srts selected for fast growing r strategists while longer srts selected for organisms that efficiently utilized scarce resources i e k strategists vuono et al 2015 however community stability and functional stability appear to be decoupled and communities with unpredictable structural dynamics may reach a dynamic equilibrium characterized by stable function and dynamic community structure kaewpipat and grady 2002 kooi et al 1997 furthermore given that short srts have increased microalgal diversity these communities are likely to be more functionally redundant and thus more resistant to perturbations resulting in more reliable treatment in contrast long srts although containing a more stable community have less diversity and may be more prone to disruption i e loss of system performance 3 3 community function and performance nutrient recovery via biomass assimilation was highest at low srts with increasing srt leading to more stable nitrification but increased variability in tn removal and higher effluent nutrient concentrations tn and po4 3 overall srt 15 had higher concentrations of tn sm fig s11 than srt 5 in both phase 1 and phase 2 largely due to the accumulation of no3 srt 5 consistently maintained higher steady state tn removal across phases average 92 5 fig 3a whereas srt 10 and srt 15 showed more variable performance with tn removal ranging from 79 to 95 for srt 10 average 84 figs 3b and 69 88 for srt 15 average 70 fig 3c at steady state i e despite stable biomass concentrations in terms of phosphorus removal trends were less distinct with average removals in phases 1 and 2 of 48 6 and 77 7 srt 5 73 1 and 72 5 srt 10 and 64 7 and 78 0 srt 15 respectively fig s13 although a co occurrence network analysis sm section s5 found no strong correlations between specific otus and nutrient removal these results support the conclusion that longer srts result in a more stable community structure whereas short srts have more dynamic communities with increased functional stability related to tn removal but not orthophosphate removal although microalgae prefer nh4 as a n source because it is already reduced to the form used for cellular metabolism oxidation state of 3 most microalgal species can also assimilate no2 and no3 richmond 2004 kinetic studies performed after each mixed community had reached steady state demonstrated that the removal of n by microalgae and bacteria followed the anticipated preferential succession e g fig 4 with nh4 being removed first followed by no2 oxidation state of 3 and then no3 oxidation state of 5 see fig 4 and s11 for all kinetic data while some ammonium was assimilated by microalgae oxidation of ammonium and nitrite by bacteria occurred in parallel and there was an initial increase in no2 and no3 in the reactor once nh4 was completely removed however no2 was removed via assimilation and oxidation when no2 reached low levels 4 5 0 3 mg n l 1 no3 became the primary n source for the algae the amount of nh4 that was oxidized to no3 as seen in the initial increase of no3 indicates that the primary mechanism of nh4 removal was due to nitrification while the primary removal of no3 was due to algal biomass assimilation the uptake of nutrients can be modeled separately from growth droop 1968 which is an approach that has been adopted in recent wastewater relevant algal process models lee et al 2015 the form of nitrogen assimilated also influences ph fuggi et al 1981 and the reducing equivalents needed for assimilation fuggi et al 1981 guest et al 2013 sanz luque et al 2013 which underscores the need to independently model the fate of each nitrogen specie including perhaps reduced nitrogen no3 and no2 as well as interactions among multiple limiting nutrients bougaran et al 2010 the maximum observed net removal rates of each n species fig 4b for nh4 no2 and no3 reached 43 4 7 8 13 8 1 3 and 14 0 0 8 mg n g vss 1 d 1 after phase 1 experimentation although additional research is required to better characterize the intrinsic kinetic capabilities of mixed microalgal cultures relevant to wastewater taking into account nutrient reserves community structure shifts over time etc these data suggest similar rates of n removal may be achievable regardless of n speciation these findings highlight the potential that algal bacterial communities may have for reliable nutrient recovery from wastewaters across a range of n fractionation given that p and n uptake are linked through biomass uptake to grow and establish internal nutrient reserves the ratio of n p removal can be examined to better understand how design decisions and community structure influence effluent orthophosphate concentrations gardner dale et al 2017 geider and roche 2002 n p ratio of an individual species has been previously shown to linearly decrease with increasing srt as cell structural requirements change with growth rate gardner dale et al 2017 this relationship is known as the growth rate hypothesis sterner and elser 2002 at the same time n p ratio also varies across individual species and the overall n p ratio in mixed communities may not change linearly with growth rate as community structure may be distinct across srts n p ratios across srt were not consistently monotonic fig s15 but variability in n p ratio between experiments did change with srt srt 5 demonstrated the largest difference between phase 1 6 6 0 3 g n g p 1 and phase 2 4 9 0 2 g n g p 1 average steady state n p mass ratios fig s14 in sm while srt 15 achieved a more consistent n p ratio 5 9 0 4 for phase 1 5 7 0 3 for phase 2 likely due to its more stable community structure the higher richness and diversity of srt 5 however may allow for a plasticity in n p uptake that is able to respond to changes in n and p loading resulting from fluctuating influent concentrations as well as internal nutrient cycling e g via cell death in natural systems there has been emerging consensus that diversity promotes system productivity and functional stability cardinale et al 2006 ptacnik et al 2008 shurin et al 2014 and ptacnik and colleagues in particular showed in a large scale sampling study that diversity drives functional stability among phytoplankton communities by fostering resource use efficiency consistent with this observation but in our engineered system srt 5 demonstrated more stable ecological function i e nutrient recovery across phases despite having very different communities during each phase dbraycurtis 0 87 0 00 furthermore if subjected to perturbation events such as the introduction of invasive predators or toxic shocks it is reasonable to expect low diversity communities like those seen in srt 15 to be particularly vulnerable to collapse while the diversity of srt 5 could afford a robustness and resiliency that is more likely to dampen performance impacts and support more rapid recovery this hypothesis warrants testing through future research given that performance reliability will be critical to full scale adoption of intensive algal processes overall there is a tradeoff between the type of n removal across srt longer srts promote stable bacterial nitrification and the removal of nh4 while shorter srts promote biomass growth and the assimilation of n in all forms by microalgae to achieve lower effluent n given that srt also has an influence on microalgal community membership and abundance low srt may be leveraged as a process control to select for increased biomass growth rates and increased eukaryotic diversity which may promote functional stability and achieve more effective and reliable total nutrient removal via biomass assimilation this short srt strategy represents a paradigm shift in our approach to removing n via bacterial nitrification denitrification which leverages slow growing bacteria i e aob nob and cmx and archaea ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa dimitri kits et al 2017 tchobanoglous et al 2014 ultimately the use of srt an intuitive parameter that wrrf operators have successfully employed in conventional biological treatment processes may provide algal technologies with an accessible way to shape community structure and function and to obtain reliable and predictable nutrient recovery from wastewaters 4 conclusions the specific effect of srt i e growth rate effects on mixed phototrophic community structure and nutrient recovery was examined in suspended growth systems used to treat secondary effluent improved high throughput sequencing techniques were used to examine both algal and bacterial community structure diversity and dynamics over long term experimentation it was found that srt influenced community composition significantly creating a gradient of microbial composition across srts as expected a short srt 5 days selected for dynamic fast growing communities while a longer srt 15 days allowed for the proliferation of slow growers and stable nitrification however eukaryotic community diversity was also significantly affected by srt and diversity community richness and evenness decreased with increasing srt this resulted in stable communities at high srts that reliably removed nh4 but experienced more variable overall nutrient uptake and higher levels of effluent tn conversely dynamic less stable algal communities present at low srt were highly diverse and maintained consistent overall tn removal across different community structures and dominant organisms in practice these results demonstrate that utilities seeking to leverage algal systems for nutrient removal via biomass assimilation may want to consider short srts that allow for greater biomass assimilation and functional resiliency as the field seeks to design and implement microalgal processes at full scale the control of srt independent of hrt may be an important selective pressure to help maintain community structure and overall system performance declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

19113,suspended growth mixed community phototrophic wastewater treatment systems including high rate algal ponds and photobioreactors have the potential to achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus recovery with effluent nutrient concentrations below the current limit of technology in order to achieve reliable and predictive performance it is necessary to establish a thorough understanding of how design and operational decisions influence the complex community structure governing nutrient recovery in these systems solids residence time srt a critical operational parameter governing growth rate was leveraged as a selective pressure to shape microbial community structure in laboratory scale photobioreactors fed secondary effluent from a local wastewater treatment plant in order to decouple the effects of srt and hydraulic retention time hrt nutrient loading was fixed across all experimental conditions and the effect of changing srt on microbial community structure diversity and stability as well as its impact on nutrient recovery was characterized reactors were operated at distinct srts 5 10 and 15 days with diurnal lighting over long term operation 6 srts and in depth examination of the eukaryotic and bacterial community structure was performed using amplicon based sequencing of the 18s and 16s rrna genes respectively in order to better represent the microalgal community structure this study leveraged improved 18s rrna gene primers that have been shown to provide a more accurate representation of the wastewater process relevant algal community members long term operation resulted in distinct eukaryotic communities across srts independent of the relative abundance of operational taxonomic units otus in the inoculum the longest srt 15 days srt 15 resulted in a more stable algal community along with stable bacterial nitrification while the shortest srt 5 days srt 5 resulted in a less stable more dynamic community although srt was not strongly associated with overall bacterial diversity the eukaryotic community of srt 15 was significantly less diverse and less even than srt 5 with a few dominant otus making up a majority of the eukaryotic community structure in the former overall although longer srts promote stable bacterial nitrification short srts promote higher eukaryotic diversity increased functional stability and better total n removal via biomass assimilation these results indicate that srt may be a key factor in not only controlling microalgal community membership but community diversity and functional stability as well ultimately the efficacy and reliability of nh4 removal may be in tension with tn removal in mixed phototrophic systems given that lower srts may achieve better total n removal via biomass assimilation through increased eukaryotic diversity biomass productivity and functional stability graphical abstract image 1 keywords algae photobioreactor pbr tertiary treatment nutrient recovery ecology high throughput

3 mg n l 1 and 0 10 0 15 mg p l 1 for sensitive waterways boelee et al 2014 the cost of meeting these limits poses a serious challenge to wastewater utilities which are already facing aging infrastructure and financial pressures to maintain and improve existing services asce 2017 in response to these challenges there is unprecedented interest in transforming traditional wastewater treatment plants into integrated resource recovery facilities that recover nutrients and energy rather than consuming them guest et al 2009 mihelcic et al 2017 sturm 2016 verstraete et al 2009 to this end microalgal systems are being pursued as a promising technology that may enable simultaneous wastewater treatment and feedstock production by assimilating nutrients during growth including organic

studies of suspended growth systems have begun to investigate the fundamental drivers of phototrophic treatment processes with recent works examining the effect of environmental and operational parameters such as co2 sutherland et al 2015 mixing intensity sutherland et al 2014 and biomass recycling park et al 2011 on system performance i e bod and or n and p removal in particular one of the most commonly studied operational parameters has been hydraulic retention time hrt anbalagan et al 2016 takabe et al 2016 suspended systems such as hraps most often operate with no separation between hrt and solids residence time srt thus hrt is a key operational parameter that controls nutrient loading sludge age biomass productivity and biochemical composition among other characteristics studies have examined the effect of hrt on nutrient removal anbalagan et al 2016 cromar and fallowfield 1997 biochemical composition e g lipid content woertz et al 2009 and algal community ecology yang et al 2018 but it can be difficult to discern causal effects or to examine underlying trends in these systems because nutrient loading and growth rate are changed simultaneously a few studies have examined the effect of srt on nutrient removal and community ecology in suspended systems but these have been limited to experiments dominated by seed pure cultures xu et al 2015 or run using synthetic wastewater xu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the latter of which lacks residual organics and the continuous influx of mixed communities of microorganisms to our knowledge there have been no studies that specifically examine the effect of srt separate from nutrient loading effects on mixed phototrophic communities in suspended growth systems treating secondary effluent limiting our ability to design effective and reliable phototrophic tertiary treatment systems as the field seeks to engineer systems that achieve reliable and predictive behavior there is a critical need to understand how design and operational decisions such as hrt and srt influence the complex phototrophic communities present in suspended growth systems and in turn how these communities affect nutrient and carbon dynamics the full complexity of phototrophic systems which consist of eukaryotic microalgae phototrophic bacteria i e cyanobacteria and chemotrophic bacteria both heterotrophs and autotrophs has only just begun to be explored e g cho et al 2017 mark ibekwe et al 2017 and we have limited understanding of the selective pressures that operating parameters including srt have on community structure and overall system performance studies that have examined algal community ecology in wastewater systems have often relied on microscopy park et al 2011 and have occasionally applied high throughput sequencing techniques e g illumina sequencing cho et al 2017 mark ibekwe et al 2017 which have been otherwise widely utilized in wastewater studies e g purkhold et al 2000 however the use of high throughput sequencing with eukaryotic algal communities and in particular the application of sequencing methods to eukaryotic microalgae in wastewater has lagged far behind that of bacterial and archaeal applications bradley et al 2016 previous studies have mostly been used to identify dominant organisms xu et al 2015 and until recently relied on suboptimal primer sets that represent algal community structure with a large degree of error discussed in detail in bradley et al 2016 the objective of this work was to examine the specific effect of srt isolated from nutrient loading effects on mixed phototrophic community structure and nutrient recovery in suspended growth systems used for tertiary treatment to this end we apply high throughput sequencing techniques using improved eukaryotic primers bradley et al 2016 along with well established bacterial primers to provide clear quantitative evidence regarding community diversity and dynamics as a function of srt three flat panel pbrs were operated at distinct srts 5 10 and 15 days using actual secondary effluent for long term operation 6 srts after reaching steady state all biomass was then mixed and redistributed across reactors and long term operation was repeated to evaluate the strength of srt as a selective pressure in driving community structure and overall system performance in addition to examining the algal and bacterial community membership and abundance we examine the overall nutrient recovery focused on total nitrogen tn and specific nutrient dynamics nh4 no2 no3 po4 3 driven by srt and community structure ultimately integrating an understanding of community structure dynamics in phototrophic systems along with metrics and drivers of process performance is key to enabling the design of systems that reliably recover n and p from a given wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 photobioreactor pbr design and operation long term experimentation was done using flat panel pbrs as described in detail in by gardner dale and colleagues gardner dale et al 2017 briefly 4 l working volume pbrs with a short light path thickness of 25 mm were operated with continuous flow i e as chemostats and subjected to a day night cycle of 14 h light and 10 h dark representative of summer daylight hours in urbana il usa all reactors were lit from one side using red and blue light emitting diodes blaze 12 v led elemental led controlled via a microcontroller arduino uno r3 sparkfun electronics to output a sinusoidal pattern that approximated normal daylight variation červený et al 2009 nedbal et al 2008 with a total peak light intensity blue red of 220 μe m 2 s 1 air sparging was provided at 0 1 lair lreactor min 1 guest et al 2013 to ensure well mixed conditions and ph was controlled below 7 65 approximately 7 50 0 15 using 99 co2 gas with ph controllers and solenoid valves although multiple processes can affect ph e g co2 assimilation will increase ph ammonia assimilation will decrease ph fuggi et al 1981 reactors consistently demonstrated a net increase in ph during daylight hours and thus ph control via co2 addition was adequate all experimentation was performed in a temperature controlled laboratory with ambient air temperature of 20 4 22 7 c and stable reactor temperature conditions at 22 8 0 3 c 2 2 secondary effluent and examination of srt effects reactors were operated at an srt hrt of 5 10 and 15 days consistent with past photobioreactor experiments that achieved reliable performance e g gardner dale et al 2017 and in the range of typical biological treatment processes rittmann and mccarty 2001 tchobanoglous et al 2014 secondary effluent was collected weekly from the local wwtp urbana il usa which predominantly treats municipal wastewater and stored in the dark at 4 c before and during use as photobioreactor influent srt and hrt were not physically separated and thus were the same in order to examine the effect of growth rate governed by srt on system performance the daily nutrient loading was set at a fixed rate across all reactors and srts following the method of mindl and colleagues mindl et al 2005 and gardner dale and colleagues gardner dale et al 2017 by keeping nutrient loading constant differences in community function and structure may be attributed to srt and growth rate rather than nutrient loading effects caused by hrt mindl et al 2005 across all reactors daily nutrient loading was fixed at 15 mg n l 1 d 1 and 4 mg p l 1 d 1 which is equivalent to a typical secondary effluent mccarty et al 2011 assuming an algal system hrt of approximately 1 day the raw secondary effluent contained 10 15 mg n l 1 and 1 3 mg p l 1 tp 1 mg as po4 3 and had bod5 of 2 7 6 9 mg l 1 in order to achieve consistent loading across srts the concentrations of total nitrogen and orthophosphate of the secondary effluent were measured immediately after collection and each srt s medium was amended with nh4cl to 75 150 and 225 mg n l 1 for srts of 5 10 and 15 days respectively and k2hpo4 to 20 40 and 60 mg p l 1 for srts of 5 10 and 15 days respectively to achieve the fixed daily n and p loadings final stock concentrations of n and p were primarily in the form of nh4 and po4 3 97 and approximately 90 98 respectively secondary effluent for each srt was also amended with micronutrients according to a modified tap media with improved trace metals kropat et al 2011 to ensure adequate concentrations table s1 as well as 300 mg l 1 d 1 alkalinity as caco3 to increase buffering capacity 2 3 inoculum and pbr start up period biomass samples for inoculation of long term cultivation experiments were collected locally urbana il usa from four different sources to capture a variety of bacterial and algal communities and to ensure a large diversity of microorganisms were subjected to selective pressures 1 primary and 2 secondary clarifier weirs at a local wwtp urbana il 3 a pilot scale algaewheel system treating swine manure and 4 a eutrophic lake biomass from each location was strained through a 0 6 mm mesh screen to remove macroalgae and then mixed in equal proportions by cell count neglecting biovolume performed via fluorescence light microscopy 200x magnification before being distributed among each of three parallel reactors an initial acclimation period of two weeks was designed to limit the loss of species due to washout while transitioning the inoculum to laboratory conditions pbrs were operated in batch mode under nutrient replete conditions for seven days to increase culture density and to retain species diversity and continuous light intensity was gradually increased from 40 to 100 peak intensity 220 μe m 2 s 1 to allow culture acclimation at the end of day seven the three reactors were mixed together re strained and redistributed back into the three pbrs and srt separation was initiated pbrs were operated for another seven days with srt separation and diurnal light to begin selection for distinct communities all cultures were then mixed together redistributed and long term experimentation was initiated 2 4 long term pbr operation and sampling long term experimentation was performed in two phases in phase 1 reactors were inoculated and run in parallel at different srts 5 10 and 15 days with a fixed nutrient loading section 2 2 each reactor was run for 6 srts until reaching a steady state as defined by a less than 5 change in total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss over three consecutive days after the three reactors achieved steady state biomass from all three reactors were combined strained and mixed in equal proportions by mass tss and then redistributed across three clean reactors and long term experimentation repeated as phase 2 this replicate run of each srt in series i e phase 1 followed by phase 2 was performed to evaluate the strength of srt as a selective pressure and to more deeply examine microbial community divergence and stability across srts all reactors srt 5 10 and 15 days were again operated for 6 srts until steady state was achieved during each phase water quality and biomass samples were taken to determine solids concentrations total and volatile n and p effluent concentrations and community composition microscopy and dna analysis samples were taken more frequently at the start of experimentation to capture system startup dynamics see table s2 for detailed sample schedule samples were taken 1 h prior to the end of the light cycle when algal carbon reserves and nutrient uptake has been shown to be at its peak gardner dale et al 2017 briefly 130 ml aliquots of mixed liquor were removed from each reactor 30 ml of which was used for tss and vss analysis and 100 ml of which was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min 20 ml of the resulting supernatant was filtered through 0 22 μm pvdf filters emd millipore ma usa before freezing at 20 c until analysis and the remaining 80 ml of supernatant was returned to the reactors to minimize the effect of sampling on reactor operation pelleted biomass was stored at 20 c prior to lyophilization and storage with desiccant before elemental analysis 2 5 kinetic assay at the end of phase 1 and phase 2 when steady state had been achieved a portion of the biomass was removed from each reactor to observe the maximum specific uptake rates of n and p in order to gain insight into the intrinsic i e maximum potential uptake rates by the microbial community and differentiate them from the extant rates i e actual rates already seen under steady state conditions grady jr et al 1996 kinetic assays were performed using peak light intensity and nutrient replete conditions consistent with past work guest et al 2013 briefly the biomass was placed in identical reactors i e same photobioreactors as continuous operation with secondary effluent and ph control and spiked with 50 mg n l 1 as nh4cl and 20 mg p l 1 as k2hpo4 to ensure nutrient availability would not limit observed nutrient uptake rates during the kinetic study following nutrient addition reactors were exposed to continuous light and operated in batch mode to determine the maximum specific i e vss normalized uptake rates of n and p as mg nutrient g vss 1 d 1 guest et al 2013 with sampling occurring approximately every 6 h during the first 48 h when rates were at a maximum although internal nutrient stores can reduce the maximum observed rates of n and p uptake bougaran et al 2010 no effort was made to deplete existing reserves prior to batch experimentation in order to expedite the transition from continuous operation to batch uptake measurements reducing time for community structure shift each reactor was monitored for changes in biomass composition and microbial community via microscopy and because maximum specific uptake rates were observed within the first 24 48 h of batch operation changes in community structure were expected to be limited at the time of intrinsic parameter estimation however srt 5 phase 2 data showed significant changes in the community structure at the end of 6 days and these data were excluded 2 6 water quality monitoring

elemental analyzer perkin elmer 2400 series ii and for phosphorus by icp ms perkin elmer sciex elan drc e 2 7 dna extraction amplification and sequencing individual samples for amplicon based sequencing were taken from all inocula sources after each acclimation period and during long term experimentation phase 1 and phase 2 all samples were processed and sequenced in duplicate approximately 5 mg of biomass was collected and centrifuged before dna extraction via a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedical ca usa and stored at 20 c until amplification individual sample dna was

thermocycling conditions and reagent concentrations as described previously bradley et al 2016 these primers were previously shown to have less amplification bias and lower overall error in evaluating microalgal communities of interest to the wastewater field bradley et al 2016 additionally two different primer sets were used to provide complementary information of the eukaryotic community and to identify any differences in community representation due to the selected primers and target amplification region bradley et al 2016 together this approach provides a robust evaluation of the microalgal community structure that allows clear quantitative examination of the effect of srt on eukaryotic diversity and dynamics dna was separately amplified with bacteria specific primers targeting the v1 v3 variable region of the 16s rrna gene according to the midas field guide mcilroy et al 2015 microbial database for activated sludge aalborg university briefly the target region was

followed by cleaning of excised band using qiaquick gel purification kit qiagen before pooling dna concentration of individual amplicon libraries was checked in triplicate using a qubit 2 0 invitrogen before final pooling of individual samples at equimolar proportions in addition to environmental and experimental samples the final 18s rrna pooled library for each the v4 and v8 v9 region contained 2 mock community dna samples consisting of dna from 12 wastewater and environmental algal species in equal amounts as described previously bradley et al 2016 amplicon libraries were sequenced using the illumina miseq illumina with v3 chemistry 2 300 paired end reads at the roy j carver biotechnology center at the university of illinois at urbana champaign all sequencing data can be found online at the ncbi sequencing read archive sra under accession number srp136652 corresponding to bioproject prjna439292 2 8 sequence read processing and analysis raw sequence data was demultiplexed using bcl2fastq v2 17 1 14 conversion software illumina to determine the appropriate quality and read length overlap parameters for processing the 18s rrna gene data an analysis was performed on the included mock community sequences as described in bradley et al 2016 see sm for additional information to determine the quality and length cutoffs that reasonably approximated the theoretical community while retaining the most reads these values were determined to be a phred quality score of q27 and length cutoff of 270 nt for the v4 region and q28 and 185 nt for the v8 v9 region following quality trimming and removal of reads below the length cutoff using sickle all further processing of sequences was performed using mothur v 1 39 5 kozich et al 2013 according to the standard operating procedure miseq sop accessed september 10 2017 at https www mothur org wiki miseq sop unless otherwise specified scripts used can be found online at https dx doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 6051812 briefly following contig formation sequences were trimmed and aligned to the silva v128 database files curated by mothur using the full database and mothur s recreated silva seed for the 18s and 16s rrna gene sequences respectively chimera detection and removal was performed using the vsearch algorithm rognes et al 2016 and all sequences were then classified with the full silva v128 database as reference prior to otu clustering 97 and classification for further examination of specific unknown otus representative otu sequences were obtained using the get oturep command and examined using ncbi s blast altschul 1990 it is worth noting that the most commonly occurring bacterial otu was matched to the cyanobacteria using the classify otus command however upon closer inspection this otu best matched the chloroplast sequence of scenedesmus sp and was removed prior to further analysis from the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequence data alpha diversity metrics observed otus chao1 index inverse simpson index and nonparametric shannon index and beta diversity metrics jaccard and bray curtis dissimilarity were also calculated with subsample 2000 pcoa analysis was performed using bray curtis dissimilarity matrices on subsets of samples of interest in order to examine the relationship between taxonomic richness and functional metrics such as n and p uptake a co occurrence network analysis was run for all sequencing sets and across all reactors and phases but no strong correlations were found between performance metrics and specific otus sm section s5 correlations were found between specific otus or sets of otus but these relationships occurred only between rare taxa and did not provide insight into the experimental system the importance of these relationships is unknown and requires further examination in future work 3 results and discussion 3 1 microbial community structure long term operation of mixed community reactors demonstrated that distinct eukaryotic communities assemble across srts fig 1 phase 1 fig s2 phase 2 and that diversity decreased with increasing srt mean relative abundance of otus present at steady state operation did not depend on initial concentration of the otus in the inoculum when examining the top ten otus present in each reactor representing a total of 20 otus across all three reactors it was observed that only nine of the 20 total otus were also prevalent i e contribute to the top 90 of mean relative abundance in the inocula sources additionally the inocula showed high richness and diversity for the community as a whole average across all four sources of inocula sobs 99 25 dnpshannon 2 73 following the start up period in which cultures were acclimated to laboratory conditions and lighting selection of specific communities in response to srt was observed after approximately 20 days rare otus including those that showed limited or no representation in sequencing data from the inocula were present at steady state operation although the effect of influent community members on long term community structural dynamics in microbial processes needs additional study the otus seen at steady state here related more closely with the initial inoculum after acclimation fig 1 w2 than to those otus present in influent media secondary effluent see also figs s3 s6 and the presence of influent microbial species on steady state community structure appears to be minimal this underscores the importance of selective environments conditions within the reactor which favor a particular species or function out of many rittmann and mccarty 2001 which have in general been leveraged in algal systems mooij et al 2013 excluding events such as species die off and invasion initial inoculum concentrations and the general proportion of species present at the start should not influence the presence and abundance of species at steady state this is especially evident when comparing cyanobacterial otus in which the most prevalent cyanobacterial otu otu3 pseudanabaena sp fig 1 is found in appreciable concentrations in all three reactors over time mean relative abundance of total bacterial diversity on average 14 4 12 9 and 6 4 respectively despite only being found in the inocula at less than 0 07 of the total mean relative read abundance in 16s rrna gene data sequencing data fig 1 along with microscopy sm fig s10 show that srt 5 operating at the fastest growth rate was dominated by filamentous eukaryotes and cyanobacteria such as pseudanabaena sp on the other hand srt 15 was dominated by unicellular and colonial green algae such as chlamydomonas sp and acutodesmus sp respectively for full taxonomy of both phase 1 and phase 2 for eukaryotes v4 and v8 v9 variable region and bacteria v1 v3 variable region see sm fig s7 through fig s9 srt 10 operating between the two displayed a mixture of filamentous and unicellular algae and cyanobacteria biomass was deep green in color and the majority of observed cells had green pigmentation this along with sequencing data in which cyanobacteria often represented a significant fraction of 16s rrna gene sequences confirmed that the microbial community was dominated by phototrophic organisms small unicellular algae such as those seen in srt 15 often exhibit fast growth rates and more competitive nutrient utilization than larger cells jakob o nalley maria stockenreiter 2014 shurin et al 2014 and typically dominate conventional microalgal systems e g hrap systems de godos et al 2014 park et al 2011 however filamentous microalgae and cyanobacteria such as those seen in srt 5 have been shown to maintain a strong dominance under wash out pressure due to their high settleability hu et al 2017 here filamentous eukaryotes and cyanobacteria are selected at low srt due to a combination of fast growth rates high settling efficiency and attached growth tendencies genera present in all reactors are among those commonly found in phototrophic wastewater treatment processes mark ibekwe et al 2017 park et al 2011 roberts et al 2013 and are likely to be found across locations and climates that utilize phototrophic microorganisms for treatment srt also resulted in distinct differences in algal community richness and abundance with a short srt resulting in a more dynamic and diverse community while a longer srt promotes otu dominance and community structural stability although some dominant eukaryotic otus e g otu 1 were shared between all reactors there is a clear variation in diversity i e community membership and abundance across srts with srt 5 demonstrating high diversity both in terms of species richness and abundance and srt 15 being dominated by only a few otus in total for eukaryotes 28 otus contribute to the top 90 of mean relative read abundance for srt 5 compared to 12 otus for srt 10 and 4 otus for srt 15 cyanobacterial abundance is also concentrated in a few otus for all srts fig 1 cyanobacteria with the top otus contributing 16 7 16 3 and 9 02 of total bacterial mean relative abundance across the three reactors four alpha diversity metrics were calculated richness based metrics observed otus sobs and the chao1 estimator rchao and structure based metrics which account for both species richness and evenness nonparametric shannon index dnpshannon and inverse simpson index dinvsimpson across metrics results confirm increasing srt resulted in a reduction of eukaryotic community diversity srt 5 has 2x the richness sobs 105 and diversity dnpshannon 2 98 of that present at higher srts srt 10 sobs 40 dnpshannon 1 46 srt 15 sobs 46 dnpshannon 1 65 this trend was not observed in the bacterial communities with bacterial richness and diversity remaining nearly the same across all three reactors sobs 279 278 and 269 dnpshannon 4 41 4 47 and 4 50 across reactors 5 10 and 15 respectively in all reactors bacterial richness was 2 7x higher than that of eukaryotic richness a trend that became stronger with increasing srt because bacterial richness stayed relatively constant while eukaryotic richness decreased with increasing srt the question of srt effect on microbial diversity has been a matter of debate although rarely addressed in the literature chen et al 2017 akarsubasi et al hypothesized that increasing srt would lead to increased bacterial diversity akarsubasi et al 2009 which might be expected due to niche differentiation and longer srts that favor organisms which utilize scarce resources i e k strategists vuono et al 2015 although experimentation showed only weak support for this with diversity remaining nearly the same across srts an observation also seen in another study bagchi et al 2015 in contrast saikaly et al explicitly measured the effect of srt on the bacterial diversity of activated sludge systems and found that short srts were associated with higher diversity saikaly et al 2005 this effect has also been seen in other wastewater treatment processes which have shown lower microbial diversity in processes which use longer srts over shorter ones e g hu et al 2012 silva et al 2010 overall the data presented here demonstrate a consistent and reproducible relationship between srt and diversity for the eukaryotic algal community with diversity decreasing with increasing srt a finding that is consistent with previous studies that have examined bacterial diversity only hu et al 2012 saikaly et al 2005 silva et al 2010 in contrast there was no change in diversity across srt for the bacterial communities in this study the presence of bacteria that are central to wastewater treatment such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were also found over long term operation and increased over time and with increasing srt all otus belonging to the aob were identified as being in the genus nitrosomonas while otus belonging to the nob were identified as nitrospira fig 1 nitrifying bacteria it is worth noting that although all nob present in the system belonged to the genus nitrospira not all nitrospira are nob and this genus represents nob and comammox cmx daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 the highest concentration of nitrosomonas sp 2 1 occurred in srt 15 during the last srt of operation although srt 10 also had a consistent presence of nitrosomonas sp average 0 36 nitrospira sp were slightly less abundant reaching peak totals between 0 19 and 0 62 of the total bacterial diversity nitrosomonas sp was present within the range commonly seen in wastewater treatment 0 01 9 3 kim et al 2011 layton et al 2005 and nitrospira were at concentrations similar to those seen by kim and colleagues in a full scale activated sludge process 0 16 kim et al 2011 somewhat surprisingly nitrobacter sp was not detected despite being commonly found in wastewater treatment siripong and rittmann 2007 however nitrospira are more frequently the dominant nob in activated sludge systems burrell et al 1999 juretschko et al 1998 siripong and rittmann 2007 although only detected in one inoculum source secondary effluent 0 11 and not detected during the first 30 days of long term experimentation nitrospira increased in concentration over time and resulted in mean relative abundances of 0 20 0 62 and 0 19 across the three srts the presence of nitrifying organisms at longer srts is not surprising with aob and nob being slow growers and with wastewater processes that utilize these organisms usually operating at 10 day srts tchobanoglous et al 2014 3 2 community dynamics beta diversity measurements including the membership based presence absence jaccard djaccard and structure based bray curtis dbraycurtis dissimilarity show community membership and structure of each microbial community changes through time and that these differences are less prominent at higher srts pcoa plots of phase 1 fig 2 a top and phase 2 fig 2a bottom demonstrate that all communities shifted away from the initial starting community inocula mixture t 0 and toward a steady state community fig 2a circled data points in phase 1 srt 5 was the most dissimilar to the initial inoculum dbraycurtis 0 93 0 01 srt 15 remained the most similar dbraycurtis 0 46 0 07 and srt 10 was in between dbraycurtis 0 66 0 07 however after mixing all biomass in equal proportions by mass for the replicate run section 2 4 srt 15 remained stable and stayed within a dissimilarity of 0 30 0 01 while srt 5 and srt 10 communities again diverged from the initial mixed community and reached a new steady state community that diverged more substantially from the initial community dbraycurtis 0 48 0 02 and dbraycurtis 0 65 0 03 respectively in all cases during phase 2 divergence from the initial community may have been somewhat muted due to loss of diversity over long term experimentation and all communities showed less divergence during phase 2 than during phase 1 this may be attributed to selective environments and competition over longer time scales that reduced diversity at the community level i e inter species diversity and at the species level i e intra species and trait diversity nonetheless these results show the highest stability for srt 15 which after establishing itself during phase 1 changes little during phase 2 even after mixing with the other dominant species present in srt 5 and srt 10 furthermore srt 5 and 10 have markedly different steady state communities between phase 1 and phase 2 dbraycurtis 0 87 0 00 and dbraycurtis 0 48 0 01 compared to srt 15 dbraycurtis 0 16 0 01 to normalize the results to a common stage of operation i e number of srts we also examined the dissimilarity with inocula after six srts of operation for each reactor fig 3 c after which communities were operating at steady state the dissimilarities at this time point reflect the same relationships seen over the length of the full experiment and when comparing as time series days these results demonstrate that longer srts result in more stable communities while shorter srts result in less stable or conversely more dynamic communities unstable environments such as those seen in srt 5 or those that undergo perturbation events are more likely to contain fast growing organisms that have high resource utilization i e r strategists pianka 1970 furthermore vuono and colleagues were able to show srt may be leveraged to impose an r k selection on organisms in wastewater treatment short srts selected for fast growing r strategists while longer srts selected for organisms that efficiently utilized scarce resources i e k strategists vuono et al 2015 however community stability and functional stability appear to be decoupled and communities with unpredictable structural dynamics may reach a dynamic equilibrium characterized by stable function and dynamic community structure kaewpipat and grady 2002 kooi et al 1997 furthermore given that short srts have increased microalgal diversity these communities are likely to be more functionally redundant and thus more resistant to perturbations resulting in more reliable treatment in contrast long srts although containing a more stable community have less diversity and may be more prone to disruption i e loss of system performance 3 3 community function and performance nutrient recovery via biomass assimilation was highest at low srts with increasing srt leading to more stable nitrification but increased variability in tn removal and higher effluent nutrient concentrations tn and po4 3 overall srt 15 had higher concentrations of tn sm fig s11 than srt 5 in both phase 1 and phase 2 largely due to the accumulation of no3 srt 5 consistently maintained higher steady state tn removal across phases average 92 5 fig 3a whereas srt 10 and srt 15 showed more variable performance with tn removal ranging from 79 to 95 for srt 10 average 84 figs 3b and 69 88 for srt 15 average 70 fig 3c at steady state i e despite stable biomass concentrations in terms of phosphorus removal trends were less distinct with average removals in phases 1 and 2 of 48 6 and 77 7 srt 5 73 1 and 72 5 srt 10 and 64 7 and 78 0 srt 15 respectively fig s13 although a co occurrence network analysis sm section s5 found no strong correlations between specific otus and nutrient removal these results support the conclusion that longer srts result in a more stable community structure whereas short srts have more dynamic communities with increased functional stability related to tn removal but not orthophosphate removal although microalgae prefer nh4 as a n source because it is already reduced to the form used for cellular metabolism oxidation state of 3 most microalgal species can also assimilate no2 and no3 richmond 2004 kinetic studies performed after each mixed community had reached steady state demonstrated that the removal of n by microalgae and bacteria followed the anticipated preferential succession e g fig 4 with nh4 being removed first followed by no2 oxidation state of 3 and then no3 oxidation state of 5 see fig 4 and s11 for all kinetic data while some ammonium was assimilated by microalgae oxidation of ammonium and nitrite by bacteria occurred in parallel and there was an initial increase in no2 and no3 in the reactor once nh4 was completely removed however no2 was removed via assimilation and oxidation when no2 reached low levels 4 5 0 3 mg n l 1 no3 became the primary n source for the algae the amount of nh4 that was oxidized to no3 as seen in the initial increase of no3 indicates that the primary mechanism of nh4 removal was due to nitrification while the primary removal of no3 was due to algal biomass assimilation the uptake of nutrients can be modeled separately from growth droop 1968 which is an approach that has been adopted in recent wastewater relevant algal process models lee et al 2015 the form of nitrogen assimilated also influences ph fuggi et al 1981 and the reducing equivalents needed for assimilation fuggi et al 1981 guest et al 2013 sanz luque et al 2013 which underscores the need to independently model the fate of each nitrogen specie including perhaps reduced nitrogen no3 and no2 as well as interactions among multiple limiting nutrients bougaran et al 2010 the maximum observed net removal rates of each n species fig 4b for nh4 no2 and no3 reached 43 4 7 8 13 8 1 3 and 14 0 0 8 mg n g vss 1 d 1 after phase 1 experimentation although additional research is required to better characterize the intrinsic kinetic capabilities of mixed microalgal cultures relevant to wastewater taking into account nutrient reserves community structure shifts over time etc these data suggest similar rates of n removal may be achievable regardless of n speciation these findings highlight the potential that algal bacterial communities may have for reliable nutrient recovery from wastewaters across a range of n fractionation given that p and n uptake are linked through biomass uptake to grow and establish internal nutrient reserves the ratio of n p removal can be examined to better understand how design decisions and community structure influence effluent orthophosphate concentrations gardner dale et al 2017 geider and roche 2002 n p ratio of an individual species has been previously shown to linearly decrease with increasing srt as cell structural requirements change with growth rate gardner dale et al 2017 this relationship is known as the growth rate hypothesis sterner and elser 2002 at the same time n p ratio also varies across individual species and the overall n p ratio in mixed communities may not change linearly with growth rate as community structure may be distinct across srts n p ratios across srt were not consistently monotonic fig s15 but variability in n p ratio between experiments did change with srt srt 5 demonstrated the largest difference between phase 1 6 6 0 3 g n g p 1 and phase 2 4 9 0 2 g n g p 1 average steady state n p mass ratios fig s14 in sm while srt 15 achieved a more consistent n p ratio 5 9 0 4 for phase 1 5 7 0 3 for phase 2 likely due to its more stable community structure the higher richness and diversity of srt 5 however may allow for a plasticity in n p uptake that is able to respond to changes in n and p loading resulting from fluctuating influent concentrations as well as internal nutrient cycling e g via cell death in natural systems there has been emerging consensus that diversity promotes system productivity and functional stability cardinale et al 2006 ptacnik et al 2008 shurin et al 2014 and ptacnik and colleagues in particular showed in a large scale sampling study that diversity drives functional stability among phytoplankton communities by fostering resource use efficiency consistent with this observation but in our engineered system srt 5 demonstrated more stable ecological function i e nutrient recovery across phases despite having very different communities during each phase dbraycurtis 0 87 0 00 furthermore if subjected to perturbation events such as the introduction of invasive predators or toxic shocks it is reasonable to expect low diversity communities like those seen in srt 15 to be particularly vulnerable to collapse while the diversity of srt 5 could afford a robustness and resiliency that is more likely to dampen performance impacts and support more rapid recovery this hypothesis warrants testing through future research given that performance reliability will be critical to full scale adoption of intensive algal processes overall there is a tradeoff between the type of n removal across srt longer srts promote stable bacterial nitrification and the removal of nh4 while shorter srts promote biomass growth and the assimilation of n in all forms by microalgae to achieve lower effluent n given that srt also has an influence on microalgal community membership and abundance low srt may be leveraged as a process control to select for increased biomass growth rates and increased eukaryotic diversity which may promote functional stability and achieve more effective and reliable total nutrient removal via biomass assimilation this short srt strategy represents a paradigm shift in our approach to removing n via bacterial nitrification denitrification which leverages slow growing bacteria i e aob nob and cmx and archaea ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa dimitri kits et al 2017 tchobanoglous et al 2014 ultimately the use of srt an intuitive parameter that wrrf operators have successfully employed in conventional biological treatment processes may provide algal technologies with an accessible way to shape community structure and function and to obtain reliable and predictable nutrient recovery from wastewaters 4 conclusions the specific effect of srt i e growth rate effects on mixed phototrophic community structure and nutrient recovery was examined in suspended growth systems used to treat secondary effluent improved high throughput sequencing techniques were used to examine both algal and bacterial community structure diversity and dynamics over long term experimentation it was found that srt influenced community composition significantly creating a gradient of microbial composition across srts as expected a short srt 5 days selected for dynamic fast growing communities while a longer srt 15 days allowed for the proliferation of slow growers and stable nitrification however eukaryotic community diversity was also significantly affected by srt and diversity community richness and evenness decreased with increasing srt this resulted in stable communities at high srts that reliably removed nh4 but experienced more variable overall nutrient uptake and higher levels of effluent tn conversely dynamic less stable algal communities present at low srt were highly diverse and maintained consistent overall tn removal across different community structures and dominant organisms in practice these results demonstrate that utilities seeking to leverage algal systems for nutrient removal via biomass assimilation may want to consider short srts that allow for greater biomass assimilation and functional resiliency as the field seeks to design and implement microalgal processes at full scale the control of srt independent of hrt may be an important selective pressure to help maintain community structure and overall system performance declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

19114,deterioration modelling has been a bottlenecking step towards risk informed asset management of municipal water distribution networks to close the gap we proposed a two time scale tts point process model on a pipe level for modelling and prediction of water main breaks this paper presents the characterization statistical parameter estimation probabilistic features and application of the model combining poisson and renewal models into one the proposed tts process is characterized by a conditional intensity function of two time variables one in a pipe clock for overall pipe aging and the other in a repair clock for local renewal as a result different aging patterns including the complicated bathtub type behaviour can be modelled a novel statistical method that combines data augmentation and markov chain monte carlo was developed for model estimation to deal with partially missing event histories a case study using real life data collected from a regional municipality in canada was presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model the modelling process ranging from model estimation verification validation and updating to application in asset management was thoroughly demonstrated this study also demonstrated that one must use the full distributions of the parameters to obtain an unbiased prediction of mean number of water main breaks the proposed model was also compared with the poisson process model in terms of break intensity survival probability mean cumulative number of breaks and mean annual number of breaks the implications of the different results to asset management were carefully discussed as well last the ability of the proposed model to capture the maintenance effectiveness of pipe repair was proven this work represents a solid advancement towards holistic assessment of the aging risk of a municipal water distribution network keywords bathtub curve water main breaks poisson processes renewal processes missing event history data augmentation markov chain monte carlo infrastructure asset management 1 introduction deterioration or degradation is the raison d être of infrastructure asset management the deterioration trend of an asset is often difficult to predict due to its large inherent variability and our lack of solid understanding of the underlying degradation mechanisms which are often entangled with physical chemical biological and other processes for this reason deterioration modelling has been one of the bottlenecking analytical components in risk informed infrastructure asset management yuan 2017 this is more so for municipal water distribution systems than many other infrastructure systems such as sanitary and stormwater sewers and road pavements largely because of the difference in condition data availability municipal water distribution systems are buried and operated in a fully pressurized mode inspection and condition assessment can be performed only during outage periods with a significant amount of preparation in contrast although also buried sewer systems are often operated in open channels and thus are more accessible for inspection and condition assessment using e g cctv roads and electrical transmission and distribution networks are even more exposed to condition assessment despite the widely available technologies for water pipes refer to liu and kleiner 2014 and rizzo 2010 for reviews of the state of the art and practice non intrusive methods are still expensive as a result most of the water pipe condition assessments are performed for forensic investigation purposes or for finalizing repair solutions after ironically the pipe has been determined for repair therefore deterioration modelling of municipal water distribution systems still largely relies on historical pipe break records even though many people understand that ideally deterioration in structural integrity hydraulic capacity and impacts on water quality should be modelled holistically this is witnessed by a large body of literature on degradation modelling of water mains including several excellent reviews such as clair and sinha 2012 kleiner and rajani 2001 liu et al 2012 nishiyama and filion 2013 rajani and kleiner 2001 scheidegger et al 2015 most of the studies in the literature consider only the pipe break events whereas the modelling and prediction of intermittent states such as cracking and small leakage are rarely discussed due to the scarcity of data the present study is also concentrated on the stochastic modelling of the water main breaks in a municipal water distribution system model selection is an important step of deterioration modelling among many factors in model selection data availability i e the amount types and completeness of data that are available for stochastic modelling is an important consideration striking the balance between a rich model structure and possibility of model estimation is the art part of deterioration modelling yuan 2017 many sophisticated models may predict deterioration with very high accuracy however due to data availability those models cannot be calibrated verified and validated on the other hand a major responsibility for researchers is to keep exploring the best model that currently available data can support it is under this research philosophy that this study was motivated different statistical modelling approaches have been developed for prediction of occurrence of water main breaks along time for example regression approaches kleiner and rajani 1999 extended yule process model le gat 2014 and time homogeneous or non homogeneous poisson point processes constantine and darroch 1993 constantine et al 1996 economou et al 2012 kleiner and rajani 2010 røstum 2000 watson et al 2004 among them the poisson process is the most widely used model a strong assumption underlying this model is that the occurrence rate also referred to as intensity of an event depends only upon the piping age and is totally independent of breaking history the wide use of the poisson process model can be mainly attributed to an inconvenient fact in event history availability a full historical record of all break events since pipe installation is often unavailable because most of the municipal water systems in developed economies were gradually built up since many decades if not centuries ago while the break events were not systematically documented until the 1990 s or even later the lack of a full break history has complicated the deterioration modelling in a very profound way to avoid this technical difficulty the history independent poisson process modelling approach seems to be a natural fit another popular point process model is the renewal process which is equivalent to a lifetime distribution model although lifetime distribution models e g weibull distribution are useful for pipe replacement planning and piping deterioration can be characterized by the intensity function the as good as new assumption underlying the model may not be justified by empirical data to enrich the modeling capacity several delayed renewal models or their variants were proposed a delayed renewal process is very similar to a renewal process except the period to the first event has a probability distribution different than that of the subsequent inter events durations for example mailhot et al 2000 and pelletier et al 2003 proposed a delayed renewal model where the duration to the first break and as a variant the second break as well is described as a weibull distributed random variable while the rest is modelled by an exponential distribution under the delayed renewal model assumption the issue of missing early event history also known as left truncation in this context can be addressed analytically by deriving the expression of the expected likelihood function scheidegger et al 2013 expanded the model to further consider the survival selection bias due to the fact that replaced pipes had been removed from the piping inventory despite this the delayed renewal model does not characterize the interaction between the overall aging of the pipe and continual local repairs of the pipe after breaks or induced by other preventive replacement activities it is in this interaction between overall pipe aging and local repairs that we wish to push the frontier of water main break modelling in this study in this regard scheidegger et al 2015 criticized that all published models include simplifications assuming a failure rate that replicates only parts of the conceptual bathtub type authors add failure rate le gat 2014 attempted to model the dependence between future break event and break history in a subtler way under a counting process framework the extended yule process proposed by him has a conditional intensity function that is related to the accumulative number of breaks which made the model more conducive to the modeling of the break events in an aggregated manner rather than at a pipe segment level since the number of events follows a negative binomial distribution the model can easily deal with missing early history yet still the extended yule process model does not explicitly consider the competing failure potentials in global and local scales to explicitly characterize the interaction of competing failure potentials researchers in biostatistics and reparable system reliability literature have developed two point process models lawless and thiagarajah 1996 lindqvist et al 2003 both models are a mixture of poisson and renewal processes and characterized by a conditional intensity function in terms of age and duration since the occurrence of the last event the model proposed by lawless and thiagarajah which we refer to as two time scale tts point process model is a multiplicative model in the sense that the two failure potentials represented by the overall pipe aging in terms of age and local repair in terms of duration since the occurrence of the last break are multiplicative in contrast the model proposed and studied extensively by lindqvist which is referred to as time trend renewal ttr model in literature is basically a time accelerated renewal process model while a full comparison of the ttr and tts models may be a topic worth researching in future we propose to use the tts point process model for the modeling of water main breaks the purpose of this paper is to study the parameter estimation and probabilistic features of the tts model and demonstrate its application to the modelling of a real life water distribution system the parameter estimation for the proposed tts model turns out to be a nontrivial task when some of the early event histories are missing it involves the simulation of the full break history path and also the measure of the probability of the entire missing history therefore in this paper we also developed a likelihood based approach which is an integration of a data augmentation da technique and a markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique for parameter estimation involving partially missing break histories the rest of the paper is structured as follows the next section introduces the model characterization and the probabilistic properties the technical details of the da mcmc based model estimation approach are presented in section 3 the proposed model and method are then demonstrated in section 4 by a case study using real life water main breaks data from a municipality the results are compared with a non homogeneous poisson process model model validation significance to asset management decision making and limitations are also carefully discussed the paper is concluded in section 5 followed by references 2 the proposed tts point process model a point process as illustrated in fig 1 is a mathematical construct that models the repetitive occurrences of a certain random event for which the timing and number of occurrences of the events are of the main modelling interests in this regard a point process is also called a counting process poisson process and renewal process are the most well known point process models if at each time of occurrence the event is further characterized by more complex attributes such as the event type magnitude and impacts then a marked point process is obtained since we are mainly interested in predicting the timing and number of water main breaks an ordinary point process model on individual pipe level is deemed sufficient 2 1 model characterization conditional intensity function an ordinary point process can be characterized in several ways cook and lawless 2007 however a frequently used characterization is through a conditional intensity function partly because of its direct link to the likelihood function that is so important in statistical analyses for a point or counting process n t where n t is a right continuous function of time that increments by 1 at each event time and n 0 0 almost surely the conditional intensity function λ t h t is defined as cox and isham 1980 1 λ t h t lim δ t 0 1 δ t pr n t t δ t 1 h t where h t represents the history of the n t up to but not including time t and n t t δ t is the number of occurrences within the time interval t t δ t where δ t 0 it is often assumed that the probability of concurrent events in a very short period is negligible i e pr n t t δ t 2 h t o δ t with this assumption and the conditional intensity function the point process in continuous time is fully characterized details of the general theory of point processes can be found in cox and isham 1980 jacobsen 2006 cook and lawless 2007 and daley and vere jones 2007 note that the history h t here is a loose term that embraces all historical information of the point process up to and right before time t in practice only very specific historical information is used suppose for example that the conditional intensity function depends on time t only then the point process is history independent and reduces to a nonhomogeneous poisson process if one considers to use the duration since the occurrence of the last event w as the only relevant historical information then the conditional probability of the next event occurrence depends upon how long the no event or quiet period has lasted once a new event occurs the waiting time is renewed this is exactly a renewal process for another example one may consider to use the durations of the past two successive inter occurrence periods as the historical information and parameterize them into the specific conditional intensity function clearly the more history is considered the more difficult the model specification and estimation will become when more complex histories are used to characterize models the corresponding statistical analyses will demand much more historical data which may not be necessarily available in practice therefore striking the balance between the richness of model structure and the feasibility and ease of model estimation is the art part of deterioration modelling we propose in this study a very simple conditional intensity function λ t h t λ t w t l t l where t l represents the time instant of the last break event before t in other words we take the duration since the last event occurrence w t t l to represent the history h t by contrast le gat 2014 uses the number of events up to time t to represent the event history for brevity the conditional intensity is written as λ t w in addition the conditional intensity function is further formulated as a power function or an exponential function as it is typically done cook and lawless 2007 in this study the following power function is used 2 λ t w α t β w γ for t 0 in eq 2 α β and γ are the model parameters to be estimated by using the observed break event data clearly α must be a positive real number whereas β and γ can be any real numbers while α controls the overall magnitude of break frequency the signs of β and γ collectively dictate the increasing or decreasing trend of the failure potential before we further examine the failure trend in section 2 2 two simple and important facts are worth mentioning here first of all the model is a specific formulation of the general model developed by lawless and thiagarajah 1996 it contains the poisson process and the renewal process as its special cases when γ 0 the model becomes a regular poisson process when β 0 it is a renewal process or equivalently a lifetime distribution model in this case the conditional intensity function λ t h t λ w α w γ reduces to the intensity function of a weibull distributed lifetime model with scale parameter α and shape parameter γ 1 if β γ 0 the model reduces to a homogeneous poisson process note that the homogeneous poisson process is also a renewal process because the inter occurrence durations or asset lifetimes are independent and all follow an exponential distribution with mean 1 α the capacity of a model encapsulating other deterioration models as its special cases should not be undervalued as reviewed in section 1 most of the stochastic modelling strategies for water main breaks in literature and in practice start with either a poisson process assumption or a lifetime distribution assumption subsequent statistical inferences are often taken to check if the poisson process is homogeneous or a particular lifetime distribution can be further reduced to its special case e g from a weibull distribution to an exponential distribution but it does not allow to cross check the validity outside the model class the proposed model is a super class of deterioration models starting with a much weaker assumption one can let the data decide whether the deterioration is a poisson renewal or tts process this modelling approach can avoid unnecessary model uncertainty imposed by presumptions claeskens and hjort 2008 second the proposed model can be readily expanded to quantify the effects of physical environmental and operational parameters of a water main pipe and the whole network on its failure potential whenever data permit one or all of the three model parameters α β γ can be parameterized into a function of explanatory variables such as pipe length diameter shape material buried depth soil type surface loading and so on as summarized in fcm and nrc 2003 a general form of the heavily parameterized intensity function is expressed as 3 λ t w α x t β x w γ x where α α 0 α 1 α k β β 0 β 1 β k and γ γ 0 γ 1 γ k are vectors of constants and x 1 x 1 x k t is the vector of influential explanatory variables which can also be time dependent again if statistical inferences suggest all α i β i and γ i i 1 k be zero then the explanatory variables can be neglected 2 2 investigation of the conditional intensity function to study the probabilistic properties of the proposed model a good perspective is through the lens of the conditional intensity function at a given time t l of the last break event because in this case the conditional intensity function is also interpreted as the conditional hazard rate function of the inter events duration that is 4 λ w t l t l α t l w β w γ based on eq 4 the behaviour of the intensity function of the first failure time where t l 0 is completely determined by β γ for β γ greater than equal to or less than zero the corresponding intensity function will be monotonically increasing constant and decreasing with w respectively for t l 0 the behaviour of the intensity function depends on the signs of β γ and γ which creates nine different cases as summarized in table 1 for illustration purposes example values of 0 1 0 and 0 1 are used for β γ and 0 2 0 and 0 2 for γ plots of λ versus w for a given t l 5 years are shown in fig 2 it is very interesting that the intensity function is not always monotonic in particular in case 3 where β 0 3 and γ 0 2 the intensity exhibits an interesting bathtub phenomenon the intensity decreases and then increases the bathtub shaped intensity is widely cited in engineering reliability and demography literature and proved by empirical data in water main deterioration modelling the bathtub trend has also been discussed recently by e g kleiner and rajani 2001 scheidegger et al 2015 however many efforts have been made but very little success achieved in the parameterization and modelling of the bathtub curve it is surprising that the proposed model simple as it is can elegantly capture the bathtub behaviour this finding may have far reaching significance for reliability and demography studies as well another non monotonic intensity is shown in case 7 where β 0 3 and γ 0 2 the intensity increases at first and then decreases for both cases 3 and 7 there exists a stationary point w 0 γ t l β γ at which λ w 0 the two non monotonic cases clearly reveal that there are two competing forces in the pipe that control the overall failure potential until the next event one is the overall failure trend expressed by the t β term that governs the overall pipe aging while the other is the local trend expressed by the w γ term that represents the failure potential of the new local repairs relative to the overall pipe aging when these two forces are applied in different directions non monotonicity presents in the intensity otherwise a monotonic intensity function appears as shown in cases 1 2 and 4 for increasing intensities and in cases 6 8 and 9 for decreasing intensities case 5 stands for a homogeneous poisson process which means that the pipe deteriorates at a constant rate i e λ is a constant note that for all nine cases the asymptotic failure trend is dictated by the sign of β γ 3 the modelling procedure 3 1 likelihood functions 3 1 1 likelihood function for complete historical observations given a full asset inventory of a water distribution network and a full record of the complete event history since pipe installation then the model parameters can be easily estimated using e g maximum likelihood method bayesian method etc we let θ denote the vector of all model parameters in eq 2 for a given water main pipe k suppose that the entire break records from the installation or last replacement to the current time t k are all made available as 0 t k 0 t k 1 t k 2 t k n k t k where n k represents the number of breaks for pipe k suppose also that the pipe is associated with a covariate vector denoted by x k and thus the conditional intensity function is written as λ t w θ x k or for brevity λ k t w then the likelihood function for the k th pipe can be established by invoking the product integrals refer to kalbfleisch and prentice 2011 for details as cook and lawless 2007 5 l k θ i 1 n k 1 λ k δ k i t k i w k i e x p 0 w k i λ k t k i 1 u u d u where δ k i 1 for i 1 n k and 0 for i n k 1 and w k i t k i t k i 1 note that t k n k 1 does not represent a break time but rather the end of the observation window i e t k n k 1 t k should a single pipe have an enough number of break records one would be able to estimate α β and γ by maximizing l k θ the reality is however that each pipe involves only maximum a few breaks over a fairly long observation time window mainly due to the relative long design life of water mains as a consequence break events data from a whole municipal water main network are often pooled to perform the statistical estimation and inference simple brutal force pooling can be problematic as it often demands an assumption that the pipes are homogeneous and yet fail statistically independent this assumption may be too strong to be true in real world to make it more realistic one can associate the failure intensity function with the covariates as discussed in the preceding section in so doing the total log likelihood function for a network comprising of m pipes is then expressed as 6 log l θ k 1 m log l k θ k 1 m i 1 n k 1 log λ k δ k i t k i w k i 0 w k i λ k t k i 1 u u d u when historical observations are complete and available the values of α β and γ in eq 6 can be readily determined using maximum likelihood method lawless and thiagarajah 1996 provided a thorough discussion of the statistical inferences of this model using the likelihood theory according to their study inference procedures based on large sample properties of maximum likelihood appeared reasonably satisfactory when the number of event records in single asset item is greater than 20 while for shorter series of events an investigation of ways to accuracy would be useful the partially missing event histories further perplex the data issue 3 1 2 likelihood function for partial missing historical observations in reality often encountered is the missing of some history records due to the fact that historical pipe breaks were not well documented until a formal record keeping system was established the missing history profoundly complicates the evaluation of the likelihood function and thus the parameter estimation because the likelihood function must be averaged over the unobserved event history prior to the observation window to illustrate let the entire break event history from the beginning to the current time be decomposed as h t h m h o where h m and h o denote the missing and the observed histories respectively as shown in fig 1 due to the unavailability of h m the individual likelihood function in eq 5 has to be revised as 7 l k θ h o l k θ h m h o dpr h m h o θ where l k θ h m h o is the likelihood given a complete history and evaluated by eq 5 and pr h m h o θ represents the probability measure of the missing history conditional on the observed history and model parameters since the conditional distribution of the missing history cannot be expressed analytically the likelihood function must be evaluated numerically one may argue that h m is not necessary should the conditional distribution of t l be given however to determine the distribution of t l given on h o and θ is completely equivalent to the determination of the distribution of the entire missing history h m under the same condition and thus computationally the entire missing history needs to be simulated in this case two procedures are often used the expected maximization em approach and the data augmentation approach using monte carlo simulation the em algorithm is a general technique for finding maximum likelihood estimates for parametric models when the data are not fully observed however one of the major drawbacks of the em algorithm is its slow convergence particularly when data are heavily missing in addition the complex dependence structure between the observed and missing histories makes the expectation step of the em algorithm a challenging task for these reasons a markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation method incorporated with a data augmentation da technique is developed for statistical inference of the proposed model for brevity the proposed method is abbreviated as mcmc da algorithm 3 2 the mcmc da based inference procedure under the renewal or delayed renewal process model the expected likelihood function can be relatively easy to obtain as shown in mailhot et al 2000 for the extended yule process model le gat 2014 managed to use the technique of product integrals a common technique for counting processes to derive the expected likelihood unfortunately those techniques do not work for the tts model numerical method has to be resorted we proposed a simulation method based on markov chain monte carlo and data augmentation for the statistical analyses the developed mcmc da algorithm is essentially an integrative combination of two parts the data augmentation part that fills in the missing event history by simulating the point process with given model parameters θ and observed histories h o and the mcmc simulation part that generates sample model parameters with a complete event history that comprises the simulated missing event history and the observed history i e h t h m h o it should be pointed out that this algorithm can be used in both bayesian and purely likelihood based frameworks as the two differ only in the use of prior information for the parameters alternatively one may also consider the likelihood based framework which is a non informative bayesian inference approach in which the prior distributions of θ are non informative however this study is confined to the likelihood based procedure and we leave the use of prior information for future investigation 3 2 1 data augmentation the da step is to simulate the missing event history of a given pipe segment conditioned on θ and h o to do this one can simply generate random variates for the sojourn times w 1 w 2 c f fig 1 until the cumulative sum of the sojourn times exceeds t 0 which is the start of the observation time window since any of the sojourn times can be treated as a regular failure time if one knows its hazard rate function the random generation of the sojourn time becomes a very easy task luckily the connection between the hazard rate function h w θ and the conditional break intensity function λ t h t θ is straightforward for the first sojourn time w 1 since it equals t 1 the conditional intensity function is also the hazard rate function of w 1 and expressed as h w θ α w β γ which is exactly the hazard rate function of a weibull distribution for the other sojourn times w i i 2 first take t l j 1 i 1 w j where w j are the random realizations of w j for j 1 i 1 then the hazard rate function for w i is expressed as h w t l θ α t l w β w γ using the relationship between the survival function and the hazard rate function of a failure time one can generate a random variate for w i the survival probability can be computed as 8 s w θ exp 0 w h u d u for t l 0 w can be solved analytically whereas for t l 0 the integral equation has to be solved numerically the generation of sojourn times continues until the next failure event falls in the observation time window putting the simulated random break events in sequence one obtains a random realization of the h m before the observation window and thus the complete history of a pipe segment to account for the influence of the observed history h o on the generation of the missing history h m another layer of metropolis hasting acceptance rejection operation must be imposed the key idea of the mh algorithm is simple suppose there is already a missing event history denoted by h m e that is considered to be generated from the a true conditional distribution pr h m h o θ then the candidate missing history generated from the method described above denoted by h m c is accepted with a probability that is expressed as r min 1 pr h m c h 0 θ pr h m e h 0 θ the markov chain theory has proved gamerman and lopes 2006 that starting from any initial point of the missing event history the random samples generated by the m h algorithm will converge to a stationary distribution that in our case is the true conditional distribution of the missing event history pr h m h o θ even though it cannot be explicitly expressed the acceptance rejection criterion is philosophically the same as used in a regular mcmc procedure for bayesian parameter estimation the details of the da algorithm are described in the next section this process is repeated for all water main segments of the network in each da step 3 2 2 mcmc procedure after the da step each water main segment now has a complete event history which is used to calculate the likelihood shown in eq 5 the complete history after being stationary only represents one possible realization of the full history up to the end of observation time window hence the calculated likelihood should also be understood as a random likelihood of which the mean value is represented by eq 7 suppose a water main network comprising of m independent pipes whose deterioration and break histories can be modelled using eq 4 then the steps to estimate the model parameters are as follow 1 assume initial values for the model parameters as θ θ 0 and no events before the observed time window for all pipes denote the initial break history as h j t h j 0 t for pipe j 2 compute the likelihood l j 0 for pipe j using eq 5 based on h j t and θ 3 reconstruct a missing break history h m j given θ by generating breaks before the observed time window for pipe j using the simulation technique introduced in section 3 2 1 4 substitute the reconstructed complete break history h j 1 t h m j h o j for pipe j into eq 5 and compute the likelihood l j 1 given θ 5 compute the ratio r min 1 l j 0 l j 1 and compare r to a value c where c is randomly sampled from an uniform distribution between 0 and 1 6 take h j t h j 0 t for pipe j if c r otherwise take h j t h j 1 t 7 repeat steps 2 to 6 for all the m pipes 8 use the traditional mcmc algorithm to generate a new set of model parameters for the k t h iteration denote the parameter as θ θ k 9 repeat steps 2 to 8 until the random series of θ become stationary those random series are considered as burn ins and discarded continue the simulation by repeating steps 2 to 8 for another sufficient number of iterations and finally 10 use the stationary series of the randomly generated θ to estimate the full distributions the above procedure is the proposed mcmc da simulation procedure similar mcmc da algorithms used in other applications can be found in e g yuan et al 2009 and yuan 2012 interested readers are referred to gamerman and lopes 2006 gelman et al 2014 little and rubin 2014 for related topics in our study the algorithm was implemented in matlab 3 3 after model estimation once model parameters are obtained hypothesis testing for β 0 and or γ 0 can be carried out to determine whether the tts model must be adopted or its special cases i e poisson model γ 0 or renewal model β 0 are adequate to modelling the events with the selected model one can then predict the conditional intensity survival probability and future breaks for individual pipes by summing all predictions on pipe level one then obtains the prediction for the entire water distribution network which can be verified and validated using observed breaks monte carlo simulation is used for the prediction of the number of future events with those quantities predicted model verification and validation can be done details of these are discussed in the case study 4 case study 4 1 water main break data a large number of inventory and condition data for operational water mains in a relatively young regional municipality in canada were collected of the inventory data the available key attribute information includes pipe installation date pipe material pipe diameter pipe shape and pipe length while environmental and geotechnical information such as backfill bedding type surface type etc is not available or incomplete the condition data are pipe service ages since installation and pipe break histories the most common pipe materials in the region are ductile iron and concrete for demonstration purpose this case study only considers the ductile iron di pipes in addition the survival selection bias issue is not applicable to this specific case study because no pipes have been decommissioned and deleted from the database for cases where replaced pipe data are absent the survival selection bias issue can be tackled using the approach proposed by scheidegger et al 2013 there are in total 261 di pipes as shown in fig 3 the oldest pipe was installed in 1967 while the newest was in 2013 about 85 of the pipes were installed before january 1st 1998 until when the municipality started to formally document the break events and pipe repair or replacement events records of pipe breaks and pipe repair or replacement histories prior to 1998 are not available it is thus unknown whether or not a pipe has ever broken before this time therefore likelihood formulation given in eq 7 accounting for missing history must be used for estimation of the model parameters the pipes are all in circular shapes as shown in fig 4 the diameters range widely from 75 mm to 600 mm with 400 mm being the most typical one the pipe lengths are typically less than 600 m with the shortest of about 10 m and the longest of about 1327 m and the median of about 50 m the total pipe length is about 36 km there are in total 23 water main break records occurring in 14 pipes within the observation time window from january 1st 1998 to march 1st 2015 the breaks are mainly attributed to the pipe aging effects due to aging corrosion initial defects etc the aging related failures are often considered to be dependent upon several factors such as pipe material pipe diameter pipe length pressure zone surface type and the type of surrounding soils key information of the 23 water main break events is summarized in table 2 the rest of the pipe segments observed no breaks during the time window 4 2 the two model alternatives attributes of a pipe are expected to have influences on its deterioration trend the attributes should be formulated into the intensity function on the other hand as more attributes are considered more break data are needed for parameter estimation in this case study based on the availability of the data we consider two pipe attributes i e length and diameter by formulating them into the conditional intensity function as 9 λ j t w t l t l α l j l o κ l d j d o κ d t β w γ where l j and d j are the length and diameter of the j th water main pipe respectively which can be directly taken from the collected inventory database l o and d o are typical length and diameter used to normalize l j and d j respectively when more break data are available the effects of other asset attributes can be included and statistically tested however this possibility is not explored in this study for benchmark comparison a nonhomogeneous poisson process model with the following intensity function is also used to fit the same break data 10 λ j t α l j l o κ l d j d o κ d t β obviously eq 10 is a special case of eq 9 with γ 0 the above parameterization of λ is robust for two counts first this technique allows the merging of break event data from different pipe segments into a homogeneous data sample which is the basis of subsequent statistical analysis second it also allows the modelling and prediction of the evolving water network as new pipes are installed and idled pipes are decommissioned 4 3 results the section demonstrates the estimation verification validation and updating of the proposed tts model for model verification and validation purpose the collected break data are divided into a model estimation data group and a model validation data group specifically the data within the time window from january 1 1998 to december 31 2011 are used for model estimation whereas the data from january 1 2012 to march 1 2015 are used for model validation 4 3 1 model estimation the normalization factors l o and d o in eqs 9 and 10 are taken at about the median values of the pipe lengths and the typical pipe diameters respectively i e l o 50 m and d o 400 mm it should be pointed out that the selection of l o and d o values will not influence the estimated values of κ l κ d β and γ the estimation of the parameters is conducted by using the mcmc da algorithm with 105 iterations after discarding the first 2 104 iterations as burn in the remaining 8 104 iterations are used to obtain the full distributions of the parameters the modes means coefficients of variation cov and p values are summarized in table 3 a where the modes are determined based on the kernel density plots which are shown in fig 5 a e for the tts model an immediate impression from table 3a and fig 5 is that the full distributions of the model parameters α and β for the tts and poisson models are skewed as their modes deviate significantly from their means this can be explained by the severe missing histories in the observed data while the distributions of the rest are more symmetric as their means and modes are much more comparable for the tts model the p values for both β and γ are less than 0 05 indicating the two parameters cannot be taken as zero at a level of significance of 0 05 the values of both γ and β γ regardless of using the means or the modes are negative suggesting a monotonic decreasing conditional intensity trend i e case 9 in table 1 as the estimated α κ l κ d β and γ are random variables the conditional intensity is also a random variable fig 6 compares the three intensities obtained by using the modes means and the full distributions of the parameters for an imaginary pipe with length l j 200 m diameter d j 600 m m and the last break t l 20 years for the last method only the mean conditional intensity is used for the comparison it is found that using the parameter means gives the largest intensity whereas using the modes gives the smallest the difference is about one order of magnitude the mean conditional intensity lies between but more comparable to that by the means interestingly the mean of the conditional intensity follows a bath tub curve against w this means the mean conditional intensity function of the duration from a given break event to the next break exhibits a bathtub curve that is after a pipe break at t l the mean conditional intensity decreases with w at first and then increases although the turning point may be way after the next break for the poisson process model the estimated means and modes of β are positive suggesting monotonic increasing conditional intensity trends which are opposite to those by the tts model both the values of κ l and κ d are positive for the two models that being said the longer and the larger the pipe the higher intensity for that pipe to break given all other conditions the same the means and modes of κ l are 0 4231 and 0 4578 for the tts model and 0 4623 and 0 5465 for the poisson model respectively these values appear to be in the same range reported by le gat 2014 and le gat and eisenbeis 2000 in addition the κ d values are found several times larger than the κ l which is also consistent to the results by le gat 2014 and le gat and eisenbeis 2000 an indication of this is that the pipe deterioration intensity would be more sensitive to pipe diameter than pipe length 4 3 2 model verification and validation for verification purpose the two models are used to compute the cumulative number of pipe breaks from january 1st 1998 to december 31st 2011 for the entire water main system this raises an important question that needs to be answered given the estimates of the parameters θ α κ l κ d β γ how should the break of a pipe be correctly predicted i e using the modes the means or the full distributions of θ this question can be answered by assessing the difference among the three methods fig 7 shows the comparisons of predicted mean cumulative numbers of water main breaks against observations the predictions and the 95 prediction intervals were made based on simulations of pipe breaks against time using the simulation technique introduced earlier in section 3 for both models the number of pipe breaks is under predicted using the modes of θ but over predicted using the means the mean curves of predictions using full distributions of θ are in good agreement with the observations moreover for most of the time the observations fall within the 95 prediction intervals based on fig 7 it is concluded that the full distributions of the parameters θ must be adopted for failure analyses if the estimation of θ is based upon limited data particularly when it involves partially missing history mathematically this conclusion is easily explained by jassen s inequality or simply the function of means is not the mean of functions the predicted curves of the means and the 95 prediction intervals using the full distributions of θ are very close for the two models both models seem to be able to capture the deterioration trend of the system under examination hence both models are plausibly verified to validate the models the same predictions are extended to march 1st 2015 the end of the total observation time window of the database note that the prediction here is also based on full distributions of θ and the actual network change as shown in fig 8 both models seem to be in good agreement with the observations therefore both models seem to be plausibly validated as well the predictions in fig 8 are further extended for a longer range till january 1st 2042 since the system configuration after march 1st 2015 is unknown the following assumptions are made for forecasting 1 the size of the water main network is unchanged within the 30 years i e no new pipes installed or old pipes decommissioned 2 pipes are rehabilitated or maintained after breaks rather than replaced with new ones and 3 same rehabilitation or maintenance techniques are used fig 8 shows that for this case study the prediction of breaks by the tts model is always less than that by the poisson model the differences in predictions of the two models become larger with increasing time e g about 5 11 and 17 breaks in 10 20 and 30 years respectively to explain this comparison of predictions using the two models on individual pipe level should be performed since the predicted number of water main breaks for the entire network is the sum of those for individual pipes this comparison will be presented later 4 3 3 model updating deterioration modelling is a dynamic process as more data are available the additional data should be fed into the model for updating purpose the updating could be on the model structure or the model parameters or both this study limits the updating to the model parameters for completeness of the modelling procedure the same likelihood based numerical approach is used to re estimate the model parameters using all observation data from january 1 1998 to march 1 2015 the parameter estimation outcomes are summarized in table 3b the updated parameters will be used for further analyses 4 4 discussions 4 4 1 implications to decision makings in asset management there are two types of decisions to be made in infrastructure asset management the first type is the overall budgeting and the second is the prioritization among the asset inventory in an evidence based management framework answers to the second decision problems are part of the inputs for the solution of the first one detailed decision making in asset management is beyond the scope of the paper more details can be found in many references e g grigg 2012 here we focus on comparing the outputs from the two models the conditional intensity function and survival probability are important inputs for age based preventive replacement strategies fig 8 suggests that the actual predictions of the number of breaks of the entire network from the two models are significantly different in this section comparisons of predictions by the two models are carried out on the pipe level we take a real pipe from the database for further investigation i e pipe 8 in table 2 the pipe was installed on september 1 1978 with 279 7 m in length and 600 mm in diameter the last break of the pipe was on march 21 2009 after that no breaks were reported until the end of the observation window march 1 2015 in other words the last break time is t l 30 56 and the sojourn time since t l has been w 5 94 fig 9 shows a 50 year prediction of intensity λ and survival probability s after the end of the observation window here survival probability is the probability that a pipe does not break within a time period from the last break event to the current time the break intensity of the pipe would be judged to increase from about 0 02 to about 0 03 if using the poisson model as w increases up to 50 years however it would be judged to decrease from about 0 03 to about 0 015 if using the tts model the predicted survival probability s is only slightly higher using the poisson model than that using the tts model for about the first 10 years after march 1 2015 then the poisson s drops below the tts s and the difference increases as w increases for example the poisson model predicts that the survival probability of the pipe would drop to s 50 in about 30 years from march 1 2015 whereas the tts model predicts that this time span would be about 41 years such a large difference in the predicted intensity and survival probability may cause a totally different preventive replacement strategy for that pipe hence selection of an appropriate model for pipe deterioration analysis is an important step towards the success of asset management of water main systems for budget planning the mean annual number of breaks is one of the key inputs as shown in fig 10 as the water mains deteriorate the mean annual number of breaks predicted by the tts point process model fluctuates with an overall increasing trend while that by the poisson process model increases steadily and smoothly this significant difference in the predicted mean annual number of breaks will clearly affect the overall budgeting for the management of the whole water network the mean annual number of breaks shown in fig 10 is the sum of mean annual number of breaks for each pipe hence the fluctuation is not unexpected fig 11 shows the mean annual number of breaks predicted by the tts point process model for an individual pipe with respect to different t l cases if there is no break history for a pipe since its installation i e t l 0 then the predicted mean annual number of breaks would increase monotonically with time however if a pipe was broken before i e t l 0 the variation of its mean annual number of breaks with time would be non monotonic i e first decrease largely right after t l but increase again after a certain time duration 4 4 2 effects of warranty programs by examining table 2 we found that within the observation time window pipe 2 broke on february 02 1999 and broke again shortly on march 03 1999 the time interval between these two breaks was about one month there was another pipe i e pipe 8 broke twice with an inter arrival time span less than 2 years an issue arises whether the two break events should be included in the modelling one possible justification for the exclusion comes from the use of warranty in water main repairs when a repair is done it is often expected that the same water main will not break again within some reasonably short period to ensure this municipalities usually imposes a warranty clause in the repair contract to ensure best practice is used for the work whether the specific municipality that provides the break data has used a warranty program or not is not the main interest of the case study what interests us is that the closely breaking data provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of the warranty should such a warranty have been exercised suppose the municipality requires the repair contractor to have a 1 or 2 year warranty for any repairs then the effectiveness of the warranties can be investigated under a 1 year warranty program the break on march 03 1999 for pipe 2 should be removed from modelling whereas under the 2 year warranty program both breaks i e march 03 1999 for pipe 2 and march 21 2009 for pipe 8 should be excluded the model estimation results for the tts model for these two imaginary scenarios are summarized in table 4 the estimated full distributions of the parameters are then used to conduct a 30 year forecast of the cumulative numbers of water main breaks the predicted mean cumulative number of breaks are shown in fig 12 as expected the 2 year warranty program gives the least predicted mean cumulative number of breaks while the no warranty case gives the highest the difference increases with time and is about 2 breaks by the end of 30 years this analysis has also indirectly demonstrated that the maintenance effectiveness of pipe repair can be captured by the proposed tts point process model 4 4 3 limitations and future improvements due to data availability the case study presented in the present paper considers only the pipe length and diameter in the modelling as more data being available many other explanatory variables such as pipe material pipe shape soil type surface type watershed flow rate etc can be formulated into the models this would greatly strengthen the capability of the models to reproduce the deterioration trend of an individual pipe as well as the corresponding failure predictions which would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the infrastructure management to achieve these a large number of break event data are required this can be fulfilled if different municipalities agree to cooperate and pool their data to develop a national or international infrastructure database this will then demand more advanced bayesian updating and model averaging techniques to make disparate database work together claeskens and hjort 2008 as for the enhancement of the tts point process model per se this paper has shown how fixed effects are considered by reparameterization of the conditional intensity function theoretically speaking random effects or frailty models can be introduced by randomizing some or all of the parameters to model unobserved individual heterogeneity e g lindqvist 2006 the practical barrier for this modelling potential is again the availability of event histories in other areas such as biostatistics and complex technological systems where more reliable failure event data are available these modelling strategies may be applied last in addition to the issue of partial missing break histories future studies should integrate other issues such as survival selection bias e g scheidegger et al 2011 scheidegger et al 2013 to advance the stochastic modelling of water main breaks 5 conclusions to predict water main breaks in a municipal water distribution network we have proposed a two time scale tts point process model to characterize both the overall pipe aging effect and local repair effect the conditional intensity function was formulated in a simple power form of two time variables including the time duration since installation of the pipe and the elapse time since the last break the proposed tts model is versatile in capturing both monotonic and non monotonic deterioration trends with time in real life systems including the famous bathtub curve a markov chain monte carlo data augmentation mcmc da algorithm for model estimation is developed for cases where the observed event histories involve significant missing records in the early lives of the water mains a case study using real life water main break events history was performed to demonstrate the application of the developed model through a thorough process of model estimation verification validation and updating for comparison purposes a nonhomogeneous poisson point process model was also developed using the same data the case study demonstrated that when model parameters are estimated using partially missing event history data the entire parameter distributions must be adopted for the prediction of water main breaks the traditional approach of plugging the modes i e the maximum likelihood estimate or the means into the prediction would lead to either under prediction or over prediction of the mean number of breaks predictions using the proposed model and the poisson model are significantly different not only for both unconditional mean cumulative and mean annual numbers of breaks on the entire water main system level but also for conditional intensities and survival probabilities on the individual pipe level as a result budget planning and asset prioritization in risk informed infrastructure asset management based on the two models would be significantly different in addition the tts model was used to investigate the maintenance effectiveness of pipe repair declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

model combining poisson and renewal models into one the proposed tts process is characterized by a conditional intensity function of two time variables one in a pipe clock for overall pipe aging and the other in a repair clock for local renewal as a result different aging patterns including the complicated bathtub type behaviour can be modelled a novel statistical method that combines data augmentation and markov chain monte carlo was developed for model estimation to deal with partially missing event histories a case study using real life data collected from a regional municipality in canada was presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model the modelling process ranging from model estimation verification validation and updating to application in asset management was thoroughly demonstrated this study also demonstrated that one must use the full distributions of the parameters to obtain an unbiased prediction of mean number of water main breaks the proposed model was also compared with the poisson process model in terms of break intensity survival probability mean cumulative number of breaks and mean annual number of breaks the implications of the different results to asset management were carefully discussed as well last the ability of the proposed model to capture the maintenance effectiveness of pipe repair was proven this work represents a solid advancement towards holistic assessment of the aging risk of a municipal water distribution network keywords bathtub curve water main breaks poisson processes renewal processes missing event history data augmentation markov chain monte carlo infrastructure asset management 1 introduction deterioration or degradation is the raison d être of infrastructure asset management the deterioration trend of an asset is often difficult to predict due to its large inherent variability and our lack of solid understanding of the underlying degradation mechanisms which are often entangled with physical chemical biological and other processes for this reason deterioration modelling has been one of the bottlenecking analytical components in risk informed infrastructure asset management yuan 2017 this is more so for municipal water distribution systems than many other infrastructure systems such as sanitary and stormwater sewers and road pavements largely because of the difference in condition data availability municipal water distribution systems are buried and operated in a fully pressurized mode inspection and condition assessment can be performed only during outage periods with a significant amount of preparation in contrast although also buried sewer systems are often operated in open channels and thus are more accessible for inspection and condition assessment using e g cctv roads and electrical transmission and distribution networks are even more exposed to condition assessment despite the widely available technologies for water pipes refer to liu and kleiner 2014 and rizzo 2010 for reviews of the state of the art and practice non intrusive methods are still expensive as a result most of the water pipe condition assessments are performed for forensic investigation purposes or for finalizing repair solutions after ironically the pipe has been determined for repair therefore deterioration modelling of municipal water distribution systems still largely relies on historical pipe break records even though many people understand that ideally deterioration in structural integrity hydraulic capacity and impacts on water quality should be modelled holistically this is witnessed by a large body of literature on degradation modelling of water mains including several excellent reviews such as clair and sinha 2012 kleiner and rajani 2001 liu et al 2012 nishiyama and filion 2013 rajani and kleiner 2001 scheidegger et al 2015 most of the studies in the literature consider only the pipe break events whereas the modelling and prediction of intermittent states such as cracking and small leakage are rarely discussed due to the scarcity of data the present study is also concentrated on the stochastic modelling of the water main breaks in a municipal water distribution system model selection is an important step of deterioration modelling among many factors in model selection data availability i e the amount types and completeness of data that are available for stochastic modelling is an important consideration striking the balance between a rich model structure and possibility of model estimation is the art part of deterioration modelling yuan 2017 many sophisticated models may predict deterioration with very high accuracy however due to data availability those models cannot be calibrated verified and validated on the other hand a major responsibility for researchers is to keep exploring the best model that currently available data can support it is under this research philosophy that this study was motivated different statistical modelling approaches have been developed for prediction of occurrence of water main breaks along time for example regression approaches kleiner and rajani 1999 extended yule process model le gat 2014 and time homogeneous or non homogeneous poisson point processes constantine and darroch 1993 constantine et al 1996 economou et al 2012 kleiner and rajani 2010 røstum 2000 watson et al 2004 among them the poisson process is the most widely used model a strong assumption underlying this model is that the occurrence rate also referred to as intensity of an event depends only upon the piping age and is totally independent of breaking history the wide use of the poisson process model can be mainly attributed to an inconvenient fact in event history availability a full historical record of all break events since pipe installation is often unavailable because most of the municipal water systems in developed economies were gradually built up since many decades if not centuries ago while the break events were not systematically documented until the 1990 s or even later the lack of a full break history has complicated the deterioration modelling in a very profound way to avoid this technical difficulty the history independent poisson process modelling approach seems to be a natural fit another popular point process model is the renewal process which is equivalent to a lifetime distribution model although lifetime distribution models e g weibull distribution are useful for pipe replacement planning and piping deterioration can be characterized by the intensity function the as good as new assumption underlying the model may not be justified by empirical data to enrich the modeling capacity several delayed renewal models or their variants were proposed a delayed renewal process is very similar to a renewal process except the period to the first event has a probability distribution different than that of the subsequent inter events durations for example mailhot et al 2000 and pelletier et al 2003 proposed a delayed renewal model where the duration to the first break and as a variant the second break as well is described as a weibull distributed random variable while the rest is modelled by an exponential distribution under the delayed renewal model assumption the issue of missing early event history also known as left truncation in this context can be addressed analytically by deriving the expression of the expected likelihood function scheidegger et al 2013 expanded the model to further consider the survival selection bias due to the fact that replaced pipes had been removed from the piping inventory despite this the delayed renewal model does not characterize the interaction between the overall aging of the pipe and continual local repairs of the pipe after breaks or induced by other preventive replacement activities it is in this interaction between overall pipe aging and local repairs that we wish to push the frontier of water main break modelling in this study in this regard scheidegger et al 2015 criticized that all published models include simplifications assuming a failure rate that replicates only parts of the conceptual bathtub type authors add failure rate le gat 2014 attempted to model the dependence between future break event and break history in a subtler way under a counting process framework the extended yule process proposed by him has a conditional intensity function that is related to the accumulative number of breaks which made the model more conducive to the modeling of the break events in an aggregated manner rather than at a pipe segment level since the number of events follows a negative binomial distribution the model can easily deal with missing early history yet still the extended yule process model does not explicitly consider the competing failure potentials in global and local scales to explicitly characterize the interaction of competing failure potentials researchers in biostatistics and reparable system reliability literature have developed two point process models lawless and thiagarajah 1996 lindqvist et al 2003 both models are a mixture of poisson and renewal processes and characterized by a conditional intensity function in terms of age and duration since the occurrence of the last event the model proposed by lawless and thiagarajah which we refer to as two time scale tts point process model is a multiplicative model in the sense that the two failure potentials represented by the overall pipe aging in terms of age and local repair in terms of duration since the occurrence of the last break are multiplicative in contrast the model proposed and studied extensively by lindqvist which is referred to as time trend renewal ttr model in literature is basically a time accelerated renewal process model while a full comparison of the ttr and tts models may be a topic worth researching in future we propose to use the tts point process model for the modeling of water main breaks the purpose of this paper is to study the parameter estimation and probabilistic features of the tts model and demonstrate its application to the modelling of a real life water distribution system the parameter estimation for the proposed tts model turns out to be a nontrivial task when some of the early event histories are missing it involves the simulation of the full break history path and also the measure of the probability of the entire missing history therefore in this paper we also developed a likelihood based approach which is an integration of a data augmentation da technique and a markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique for parameter estimation involving partially missing break histories the rest of the paper is structured as follows the next section introduces the model characterization and the probabilistic properties the technical details of the da mcmc based model estimation approach are presented in section 3 the proposed model and method are then demonstrated in section 4 by a case study using real life water main breaks data from a municipality the results are compared with a non homogeneous poisson process model model validation significance to asset management decision making and limitations are also carefully discussed the paper is concluded in section 5 followed by references 2 the proposed tts point process model a point process as illustrated in fig 1 is a mathematical construct that models the repetitive occurrences of a certain random event for which the timing and number of occurrences of the events are of the main modelling interests in this regard a point process is also called a counting process poisson process and renewal process are the most well known point process models if at each time of occurrence the event is further characterized by more complex attributes such as the event type magnitude and impacts then a marked point process is obtained since we are mainly interested in predicting the timing and number of water main breaks an ordinary point process model on individual pipe level is deemed sufficient 2 1 model characterization conditional intensity function an ordinary point process can be characterized in several ways cook and lawless 2007 however a frequently used characterization is through a conditional intensity function partly because of its direct link to the likelihood function that is so important in statistical analyses for a point or counting process n t where n t is a right continuous function of time that increments by 1 at each event time and n 0 0 almost surely the conditional intensity function λ t h t is defined as cox and isham 1980 1 λ t h t lim δ t 0 1 δ t pr n t t δ t 1 h t where h t represents the history of the n t up to but not including time t and n t t δ t is the number of occurrences within the time interval t t δ t where δ t 0 it is often assumed that the probability of concurrent events in a very short period is negligible i e pr n t t δ t 2 h t o δ t with this assumption and the conditional intensity function the point process in continuous time is fully characterized details of the general theory of point processes can be found in cox and isham 1980 jacobsen 2006 cook and lawless 2007 and daley and vere jones 2007 note that the history h t here is a loose term that embraces all historical information of the point process up to and right before time t in practice only very specific historical information is used suppose for example that the conditional intensity function depends on time t only then the point process is history independent and reduces to a nonhomogeneous poisson process if one considers to use the duration since the occurrence of the last event w as the only relevant historical information then the conditional probability of the next event occurrence depends upon how long the no event or quiet period has lasted once a new event occurs the waiting time is renewed this is exactly a renewal process for another example one may consider to use the durations of the past two successive inter occurrence periods as the historical information and parameterize them into the specific conditional intensity function clearly the more history is considered the more difficult the model specification and estimation will become when more complex histories are used to characterize models the corresponding statistical analyses will demand much more historical data which may not be necessarily available in practice therefore striking the balance between the richness of model structure and the feasibility and ease of model estimation is the art part of deterioration modelling we propose in this study a very simple conditional intensity function λ t h t λ t w t l t l where t l represents the time instant of the last break event before t in other words we take the duration since the last event occurrence w t t l to represent the history h t by contrast le gat 2014 uses the number of events up to time t to represent the event history for brevity the conditional intensity is written as λ t w in addition the conditional intensity function is further formulated as a power function or an exponential function as it is typically done cook and lawless 2007 in this study the following power function is used 2 λ t w α t β w γ for t 0 in eq 2 α β and γ are the model parameters to be estimated by using the observed break event data clearly α must be a positive real number whereas β and γ can be any real numbers while α controls the overall magnitude of break frequency the signs of β and γ collectively dictate the increasing or decreasing trend of the failure potential before we further examine the failure trend in section 2 2 two simple and important facts are worth mentioning here first of all the model is a specific formulation of the general model developed by lawless and thiagarajah 1996 it contains the poisson process and the renewal process as its special cases when γ 0 the model becomes a regular poisson process when β 0 it is a renewal process or equivalently a lifetime distribution model in this case the conditional intensity function λ t h t λ w α w γ reduces to the intensity function of a weibull distributed lifetime model with scale parameter α and shape parameter γ 1 if β γ 0 the model reduces to a homogeneous poisson process note that the homogeneous poisson process is also a renewal process because the inter occurrence durations or asset lifetimes are independent and all follow an exponential distribution with mean 1 α the capacity of a model encapsulating other deterioration models as its special cases should not be undervalued as reviewed in section 1 most of the stochastic modelling strategies for water main breaks in literature and in practice start with either a poisson process assumption or a lifetime distribution assumption subsequent statistical inferences are often taken to check if the poisson process is homogeneous or a particular lifetime distribution can be further reduced to its special case e g from a weibull distribution to an exponential distribution but it does not allow to cross check the validity outside the model class the proposed model is a super class of deterioration models starting with a much weaker assumption one can let the data decide whether the deterioration is a poisson renewal or tts process this modelling approach can avoid unnecessary model uncertainty imposed by presumptions claeskens and hjort 2008 second the proposed model can be readily expanded to quantify the effects of physical environmental and operational parameters of a water main pipe and the whole network on its failure potential whenever data permit one or all of the three model parameters α β γ can be parameterized into a function of explanatory variables such as pipe length diameter shape material buried depth soil type surface loading and so on as summarized in fcm and nrc 2003 a general form of the heavily parameterized intensity function is expressed as 3 λ t w α x t β x w γ x where α α 0 α 1 α k β β 0 β 1 β k and γ γ 0 γ 1 γ k are vectors of constants and x 1 x 1 x k t is the vector of influential explanatory variables which can also be time dependent again if statistical inferences suggest all α i β i and γ i i 1 k be zero then the explanatory variables can be neglected 2 2 investigation of the conditional intensity function to study the probabilistic properties of the proposed model a good perspective is through the lens of the conditional intensity function at a given time t l of the last break event because in this case the conditional intensity function is also interpreted as the conditional hazard rate function of the inter events duration that is 4 λ w t l t l α t l w β w γ based on eq 4 the behaviour of the intensity function of the first failure time where t l 0 is completely determined by β γ for β γ greater than equal to or less than zero the corresponding intensity function will be monotonically increasing constant and decreasing with w respectively for t l 0 the behaviour of the intensity function depends on the signs of β γ and γ which creates nine different cases as summarized in table 1 for illustration purposes example values of 0 1 0 and 0 1 are used for β γ and 0 2 0 and 0 2 for γ plots of λ versus w for a given t l 5 years are shown in fig 2 it is very interesting that the intensity function is not always monotonic in particular in case 3 where β 0 3 and γ 0 2 the intensity exhibits an interesting bathtub phenomenon the intensity decreases and then increases the bathtub shaped intensity is widely cited in engineering reliability and demography literature and proved by empirical data in water main deterioration modelling the bathtub trend has also been discussed recently by e g kleiner and rajani 2001 scheidegger et al 2015 however many efforts have been made but very little success achieved in the parameterization and modelling of the bathtub curve it is surprising that the proposed model simple as it is can elegantly capture the bathtub behaviour this finding may have far reaching significance for reliability and demography studies as well another non monotonic intensity is shown in case 7 where β 0 3 and γ 0 2 the intensity increases at first and then decreases for both cases 3 and 7 there exists a stationary point w 0 γ t l β γ at which λ w 0 the two non monotonic cases clearly reveal that there are two competing forces in the pipe that control the overall failure potential until the next event one is the overall failure trend expressed by the t β term that governs the overall pipe aging while the other is the local trend expressed by the w γ term that represents the failure potential of the new local repairs relative to the overall pipe aging when these two forces are applied in different directions non monotonicity presents in the intensity otherwise a monotonic intensity function appears as shown in cases 1 2 and 4 for increasing intensities and in cases 6 8 and 9 for decreasing intensities case 5 stands for a homogeneous poisson process which means that the pipe deteriorates at a constant rate i e λ is a constant note that for all nine cases the asymptotic failure trend is dictated by the sign of β γ 3 the modelling procedure 3 1 likelihood functions 3 1 1 likelihood function for complete historical observations given a full asset inventory of a water distribution network and a full record of the complete event history since pipe installation then the model parameters can be easily estimated using e g maximum likelihood method bayesian method etc we let θ denote the vector of all model parameters in eq 2 for a given water main pipe k suppose that the entire break records from the installation or last replacement to the current time t k are all made available as 0 t k 0 t k 1 t k 2 t k n k t k where n k represents the number of breaks for pipe k suppose also that the pipe is associated with a covariate vector denoted by x k and thus the conditional intensity function is written as λ t w θ x k or for brevity λ k t w then the likelihood function for the k th pipe can be established by invoking the product integrals refer to kalbfleisch and prentice 2011 for details as cook and lawless 2007 5 l k θ i 1 n k 1 λ k δ k i t k i w k i e x p 0 w k i λ k t k i 1 u u d u where δ k i 1 for i 1 n k and 0 for i n k 1 and w k i t k i t k i 1 note that t k n k 1 does not represent a break time but rather the end of the observation window i e t k n k 1 t k should a single pipe have an enough number of break records one would be able to estimate α β and γ by maximizing l k θ the reality is however that each pipe involves only maximum a few breaks over a fairly long observation time window mainly due to the relative long design life of water mains as a consequence break events data from a whole municipal water main network are often pooled to perform the statistical estimation and inference simple brutal force pooling can be problematic as it often demands an assumption that the pipes are homogeneous and yet fail statistically independent this assumption may be too strong to be true in real world to make it more realistic one can associate the failure intensity function with the covariates as discussed in the preceding section in so doing the total log likelihood function for a network comprising of m pipes is then expressed as 6 log l θ k 1 m log l k θ k 1 m i 1 n k 1 log λ k δ k i t k i w k i 0 w k i λ k t k i 1 u u d u when historical observations are complete and available the values of α β and γ in eq 6 can be readily determined using maximum likelihood method lawless and thiagarajah 1996 provided a thorough discussion of the statistical inferences of this model using the likelihood theory according to their study inference procedures based on large sample properties of maximum likelihood appeared reasonably satisfactory when the number of event records in single asset item is greater than 20 while for shorter series of events an investigation of ways to accuracy would be useful the partially missing event histories further perplex the data issue 3 1 2 likelihood function for partial missing historical observations in reality often encountered is the missing of some history records due to the fact that historical pipe breaks were not well documented until a formal record keeping system was established the missing history profoundly complicates the evaluation of the likelihood function and thus the parameter estimation because the likelihood function must be averaged over the unobserved event history prior to the observation window to illustrate let the entire break event history from the beginning to the current time be decomposed as h t h m h o where h m and h o denote the missing and the observed histories respectively as shown in fig 1 due to the unavailability of h m the individual likelihood function in eq 5 has to be revised as 7 l k θ h o l k θ h m h o dpr h m h o θ where l k θ h m h o is the likelihood given a complete history and evaluated by eq 5 and pr h m h o θ represents the probability measure of the missing history conditional on the observed history and model parameters since the conditional distribution of the missing history cannot be expressed analytically the likelihood function must be evaluated numerically one may argue that h m is not necessary should the conditional distribution of t l be given however to determine the distribution of t l given on h o and θ is completely equivalent to the determination of the distribution of the entire missing history h m under the same condition and thus computationally the entire missing history needs to be simulated in this case two procedures are often used the expected maximization em approach and the data augmentation approach using monte carlo simulation the em algorithm is a general technique for finding maximum likelihood estimates for parametric models when the data are not fully observed however one of the major drawbacks of the em algorithm is its slow convergence particularly when data are heavily missing in addition the complex dependence structure between the observed and missing histories makes the expectation step of the em algorithm a challenging task for these reasons a markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation method incorporated with a data augmentation da technique is developed for statistical inference of the proposed model for brevity the proposed method is abbreviated as mcmc da algorithm 3 2 the mcmc da based inference procedure under the renewal or delayed renewal process model the expected likelihood function can be relatively easy to obtain as shown in mailhot et al 2000 for the extended yule process model le gat 2014 managed to use the technique of product integrals a common technique for counting processes to derive the expected likelihood unfortunately those techniques do not work for the tts model numerical method has to be resorted we proposed a simulation method based on markov chain monte carlo and data augmentation for the statistical analyses the developed mcmc da algorithm is essentially an integrative combination of two parts the data augmentation part that fills in the missing event history by simulating the point process with given model parameters θ and observed histories h o and the mcmc simulation part that generates sample model parameters with a complete event history that comprises the simulated missing event history and the observed history i e h t h m h o it should be pointed out that this algorithm can be used in both bayesian and purely likelihood based frameworks as the two differ only in the use of prior information for the parameters alternatively one may also consider the likelihood based framework which is a non informative bayesian inference approach in which the prior distributions of θ are non informative however this study is confined to the likelihood based procedure and we leave the use of prior information for future investigation 3 2 1 data augmentation the da step is to simulate the missing event history of a given pipe segment conditioned on θ and h o to do this one can simply generate random variates for the sojourn times w 1 w 2 c f fig 1 until the cumulative sum of the sojourn times exceeds t 0 which is the start of the observation time window since any of the sojourn times can be treated as a regular failure time if one knows its hazard rate function the random generation of the sojourn time becomes a very easy task luckily the connection between the hazard rate function h w θ and the conditional break intensity function λ t h t θ is straightforward for the first sojourn time w 1 since it equals t 1 the conditional intensity function is also the hazard rate function of w 1 and expressed as h w θ α w β γ which is exactly the hazard rate function of a weibull distribution for the other sojourn times w i i 2 first take t l j 1 i 1 w j where w j are the random realizations of w j for j 1 i 1 then the hazard rate function for w i is expressed as h w t l θ α t l w β w γ using the relationship between the survival function and the hazard rate function of a failure time one can generate a random variate for w i the survival probability can be computed as 8 s w θ exp 0 w h u d u for t l 0 w can be solved analytically whereas for t l 0 the integral equation has to be solved numerically the generation of sojourn times continues until the next failure event falls in the observation time window putting the simulated random break events in sequence one obtains a random realization of the h m before the observation window and thus the complete history of a pipe segment to account for the influence of the observed history h o on the generation of the missing history h m another layer of metropolis hasting acceptance rejection operation must be imposed the key idea of the mh algorithm is simple suppose there is already a missing event history denoted by h m e that is considered to be generated from the a true conditional distribution pr h m h o θ then the candidate missing history generated from the method described above denoted by h m c is accepted with a probability that is expressed as r min 1 pr h m c h 0 θ pr h m e h 0 θ the markov chain theory has proved gamerman and lopes 2006 that starting from any initial point of the missing event history the random samples generated by the m h algorithm will converge to a stationary distribution that in our case is the true conditional distribution of the missing event history pr h m h o θ even though it cannot be explicitly expressed the acceptance rejection criterion is philosophically the same as used in a regular mcmc procedure for bayesian parameter estimation the details of the da algorithm are described in the next section this process is repeated for all water main segments of the network in each da step 3 2 2 mcmc procedure after the da step each water main segment now has a complete event history which is used to calculate the likelihood shown in eq 5 the complete history after being stationary only represents one possible realization of the full history up to the end of observation time window hence the calculated likelihood should also be understood as a random likelihood of which the mean value is represented by eq 7 suppose a water main network comprising of m independent pipes whose deterioration and break histories can be modelled using eq 4 then the steps to estimate the model parameters are as follow 1 assume initial values for the model parameters as θ θ 0 and no events before the observed time window for all pipes denote the initial break history as h j t h j 0 t for pipe j 2 compute the likelihood l j 0 for pipe j using eq 5 based on h j t and θ 3 reconstruct a missing break history h m j given θ by generating breaks before the observed time window for pipe j using the simulation technique introduced in section 3 2 1 4 substitute the reconstructed complete break history h j 1 t h m j h o j for pipe j into eq 5 and compute the likelihood l j 1 given θ 5 compute the ratio r min 1 l j 0 l j 1 and compare r to a value c where c is randomly sampled from an uniform distribution between 0 and 1 6 take h j t h j 0 t for pipe j if c r otherwise take h j t h j 1 t 7 repeat steps 2 to 6 for all the m pipes 8 use the traditional mcmc algorithm to generate a new set of model parameters for the k t h iteration denote the parameter as θ θ k 9 repeat steps 2 to 8 until the random series of θ become stationary those random series are considered as burn ins and discarded continue the simulation by repeating steps 2 to 8 for another sufficient number of iterations and finally 10 use the stationary series of the randomly generated θ to estimate the full distributions the above procedure is the proposed mcmc da simulation procedure similar mcmc da algorithms used in other applications can be found in e g yuan et al 2009 and yuan 2012 interested readers are referred to gamerman and lopes 2006 gelman et al 2014 little and rubin 2014 for related topics in our study the algorithm was implemented in matlab 3 3 after model estimation once model parameters are obtained hypothesis testing for β 0 and or γ 0 can be carried out to determine whether the tts model must be adopted or its special cases i e poisson model γ 0 or renewal model β 0 are adequate to modelling the events with the selected model one can then predict the conditional intensity survival probability and future breaks for individual pipes by summing all predictions on pipe level one then obtains the prediction for the entire water distribution network which can be verified and validated using observed breaks monte carlo simulation is used for the prediction of the number of future events with those quantities predicted model verification and validation can be done details of these are discussed in the case study 4 case study 4 1 water main break data a large number of inventory and condition data for operational water mains in a relatively young regional municipality in canada were collected of the inventory data the available key attribute information includes pipe installation date pipe material pipe diameter pipe shape and pipe length while environmental and geotechnical information such as backfill bedding type surface type etc is not available or incomplete the condition data are pipe service ages since installation and pipe break histories the most common pipe materials in the region are ductile iron and concrete for demonstration purpose this case study only considers the ductile iron di pipes in addition the survival selection bias issue is not applicable to this specific case study because no pipes have been decommissioned and deleted from the database for cases where replaced pipe data are absent the survival selection bias issue can be tackled using the approach proposed by scheidegger et al 2013 there are in total 261 di pipes as shown in fig 3 the oldest pipe was installed in 1967 while the newest was in 2013 about 85 of the pipes were installed before january 1st 1998 until when the municipality started to formally document the break events and pipe repair or replacement events records of pipe breaks and pipe repair or replacement histories prior to 1998 are not available it is thus unknown whether or not a pipe has ever broken before this time therefore likelihood formulation given in eq 7 accounting for missing history must be used for estimation of the model parameters the pipes are all in circular shapes as shown in fig 4 the diameters range widely from 75 mm to 600 mm with 400 mm being the most typical one the pipe lengths are typically less than 600 m with the shortest of about 10 m and the longest of about 1327 m and the median of about 50 m the total pipe length is about 36 km there are in total 23 water main break records occurring in 14 pipes within the observation time window from january 1st 1998 to march 1st 2015 the breaks are mainly attributed to the pipe aging effects due to aging corrosion initial defects etc the aging related failures are often considered to be dependent upon several factors such as pipe material pipe diameter pipe length pressure zone surface type and the type of surrounding soils key information of the 23 water main break events is summarized in table 2 the rest of the pipe segments observed no breaks during the time window 4 2 the two model alternatives attributes of a pipe are expected to have influences on its deterioration trend the attributes should be formulated into the intensity function on the other hand as more attributes are considered more break data are needed for parameter estimation in this case study based on the availability of the data we consider two pipe attributes i e length and diameter by formulating them into the conditional intensity function as 9 λ j t w t l t l α l j l o κ l d j d o κ d t β w γ where l j and d j are the length and diameter of the j th water main pipe respectively which can be directly taken from the collected inventory database l o and d o are typical length and diameter used to normalize l j and d j respectively when more break data are available the effects of other asset attributes can be included and statistically tested however this possibility is not explored in this study for benchmark comparison a nonhomogeneous poisson process model with the following intensity function is also used to fit the same break data 10 λ j t α l j l o κ l d j d o κ d t β obviously eq 10 is a special case of eq 9 with γ 0 the above parameterization of λ is robust for two counts first this technique allows the merging of break event data from different pipe segments into a homogeneous data sample which is the basis of subsequent statistical analysis second it also allows the modelling and prediction of the evolving water network as new pipes are installed and idled pipes are decommissioned 4 3 results the section demonstrates the estimation verification validation and updating of the proposed tts model for model verification and validation purpose the collected break data are divided into a model estimation data group and a model validation data group specifically the data within the time window from january 1 1998 to december 31 2011 are used for model estimation whereas the data from january 1 2012 to march 1 2015 are used for model validation 4 3 1 model estimation the normalization factors l o and d o in eqs 9 and 10 are taken at about the median values of the pipe lengths and the typical pipe diameters respectively i e l o 50 m and d o 400 mm it should be pointed out that the selection of l o and d o values will not influence the estimated values of κ l κ d β and γ the estimation of the parameters is conducted by using the mcmc da algorithm with 105 iterations after discarding the first 2 104 iterations as burn in the remaining 8 104 iterations are used to obtain the full distributions of the parameters the modes means coefficients of variation cov and p values are summarized in table 3 a where the modes are determined based on the kernel density plots which are shown in fig 5 a e for the tts model an immediate impression from table 3a and fig 5 is that the full distributions of the model parameters α and β for the tts and poisson models are skewed as their modes deviate significantly from their means this can be explained by the severe missing histories in the observed data while the distributions of the rest are more symmetric as their means and modes are much more comparable for the tts model the p values for both β and γ are less than 0 05 indicating the two parameters cannot be taken as zero at a level of significance of 0 05 the values of both γ and β γ regardless of using the means or the modes are negative suggesting a monotonic decreasing conditional intensity trend i e case 9 in table 1 as the estimated α κ l κ d β and γ are random variables the conditional intensity is also a random variable fig 6 compares the three intensities obtained by using the modes means and the full distributions of the parameters for an imaginary pipe with length l j 200 m diameter d j 600 m m and the last break t l 20 years for the last method only the mean conditional intensity is used for the comparison it is found that using the parameter means gives the largest intensity whereas using the modes gives the smallest the difference is about one order of magnitude the mean conditional intensity lies between but more comparable to that by the means interestingly the mean of the conditional intensity follows a bath tub curve against w this means the mean conditional intensity function of the duration from a given break event to the next break exhibits a bathtub curve that is after a pipe break at t l the mean conditional intensity decreases with w at first and then increases although the turning point may be way after the next break for the poisson process model the estimated means and modes of β are positive suggesting monotonic increasing conditional intensity trends which are opposite to those by the tts model both the values of κ l and κ d are positive for the two models that being said the longer and the larger the pipe the higher intensity for that pipe to break given all other conditions the same the means and modes of κ l are 0 4231 and 0 4578 for the tts model and 0 4623 and 0 5465 for the poisson model respectively these values appear to be in the same range reported by le gat 2014 and le gat and eisenbeis 2000 in addition the κ d values are found several times larger than the κ l which is also consistent to the results by le gat 2014 and le gat and eisenbeis 2000 an indication of this is that the pipe deterioration intensity would be more sensitive to pipe diameter than pipe length 4 3 2 model verification and validation for verification purpose the two models are used to compute the cumulative number of pipe breaks from january 1st 1998 to december 31st 2011 for the entire water main system this raises an important question that needs to be answered given the estimates of the parameters θ α κ l κ d β γ how should the break of a pipe be correctly predicted i e using the modes the means or the full distributions of θ this question can be answered by assessing the difference among the three methods fig 7 shows the comparisons of predicted mean cumulative numbers of water main breaks against observations the predictions and the 95 prediction intervals were made based on simulations of pipe breaks against time using the simulation technique introduced earlier in section 3 for both models the number of pipe breaks is under predicted using the modes of θ but over predicted using the means the mean curves of predictions using full distributions of θ are in good agreement with the observations moreover for most of the time the observations fall within the 95 prediction intervals based on fig 7 it is concluded that the full distributions of the parameters θ must be adopted for failure analyses if the estimation of θ is based upon limited data particularly when it involves partially missing history mathematically this conclusion is easily explained by jassen s inequality or simply the function of means is not the mean of functions the predicted curves of the means and the 95 prediction intervals using the full distributions of θ are very close for the two models both models seem to be able to capture the deterioration trend of the system under examination hence both models are plausibly verified to validate the models the same predictions are extended to march 1st 2015 the end of the total observation time window of the database note that the prediction here is also based on full distributions of θ and the actual network change as shown in fig 8 both models seem to be in good agreement with the observations therefore both models seem to be plausibly validated as well the predictions in fig 8 are further extended for a longer range till january 1st 2042 since the system configuration after march 1st 2015 is unknown the following assumptions are made for forecasting 1 the size of the water main network is unchanged within the 30 years i e no new pipes installed or old pipes decommissioned 2 pipes are rehabilitated or maintained after breaks rather than replaced with new ones and 3 same rehabilitation or maintenance techniques are used fig 8 shows that for this case study the prediction of breaks by the tts model is always less than that by the poisson model the differences in predictions of the two models become larger with increasing time e g about 5 11 and 17 breaks in 10 20 and 30 years respectively to explain this comparison of predictions using the two models on individual pipe level should be performed since the predicted number of water main breaks for the entire network is the sum of those for individual pipes this comparison will be presented later 4 3 3 model updating deterioration modelling is a dynamic process as more data are available the additional data should be fed into the model for updating purpose the updating could be on the model structure or the model parameters or both this study limits the updating to the model parameters for completeness of the modelling procedure the same likelihood based numerical approach is used to re estimate the model parameters using all observation data from january 1 1998 to march 1 2015 the parameter estimation outcomes are summarized in table 3b the updated parameters will be used for further analyses 4 4 discussions 4 4 1 implications to decision makings in asset management there are two types of decisions to be made in infrastructure asset management the first type is the overall budgeting and the second is the prioritization among the asset inventory in an evidence based management framework answers to the second decision problems are part of the inputs for the solution of the first one detailed decision making in asset management is beyond the scope of the paper more details can be found in many references e g grigg 2012 here we focus on comparing the outputs from the two models the conditional intensity function and survival probability are important inputs for age based preventive replacement strategies fig 8 suggests that the actual predictions of the number of breaks of the entire network from the two models are significantly different in this section comparisons of predictions by the two models are carried out on the pipe level we take a real pipe from the database for further investigation i e pipe 8 in table 2 the pipe was installed on september 1 1978 with 279 7 m in length and 600 mm in diameter the last break of the pipe was on march 21 2009 after that no breaks were reported until the end of the observation window march 1 2015 in other words the last break time is t l 30 56 and the sojourn time since t l has been w 5 94 fig 9 shows a 50 year prediction of intensity λ and survival probability s after the end of the observation window here survival probability is the probability that a pipe does not break within a time period from the last break event to the current time the break intensity of the pipe would be judged to increase from about 0 02 to about 0 03 if using the poisson model as w increases up to 50 years however it would be judged to decrease from about 0 03 to about 0 015 if using the tts model the predicted survival probability s is only slightly higher using the poisson model than that using the tts model for about the first 10 years after march 1 2015 then the poisson s drops below the tts s and the difference increases as w increases for example the poisson model predicts that the survival probability of the pipe would drop to s 50 in about 30 years from march 1 2015 whereas the tts model predicts that this time span would be about 41 years such a large difference in the predicted intensity and survival probability may cause a totally different preventive replacement strategy for that pipe hence selection of an appropriate model for pipe deterioration analysis is an important step towards the success of asset management of water main systems for budget planning the mean annual number of breaks is one of the key inputs as shown in fig 10 as the water mains deteriorate the mean annual number of breaks predicted by the tts point process model fluctuates with an overall increasing trend while that by the poisson process model increases steadily and smoothly this significant difference in the predicted mean annual number of breaks will clearly affect the overall budgeting for the management of the whole water network the mean annual number of breaks shown in fig 10 is the sum of mean annual number of breaks for each pipe hence the fluctuation is not unexpected fig 11 shows the mean annual number of breaks predicted by the tts point process model for an individual pipe with respect to different t l cases if there is no break history for a pipe since its installation i e t l 0 then the predicted mean annual number of breaks would increase monotonically with time however if a pipe was broken before i e t l 0 the variation of its mean annual number of breaks with time would be non monotonic i e first decrease largely right after t l but increase again after a certain time duration 4 4 2 effects of warranty programs by examining table 2 we found that within the observation time window pipe 2 broke on february 02 1999 and broke again shortly on march 03 1999 the time interval between these two breaks was about one month there was another pipe i e pipe 8 broke twice with an inter arrival time span less than 2 years an issue arises whether the two break events should be included in the modelling one possible justification for the exclusion comes from the use of warranty in water main repairs when a repair is done it is often expected that the same water main will not break again within some reasonably short period to ensure this municipalities usually imposes a warranty clause in the repair contract to ensure best practice is used for the work whether the specific municipality that provides the break data has used a warranty program or not is not the main interest of the case study what interests us is that the closely breaking data provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of the warranty should such a warranty have been exercised suppose the municipality requires the repair contractor to have a 1 or 2 year warranty for any repairs then the effectiveness of the warranties can be investigated under a 1 year warranty program the break on march 03 1999 for pipe 2 should be removed from modelling whereas under the 2 year warranty program both breaks i e march 03 1999 for pipe 2 and march 21 2009 for pipe 8 should be excluded the model estimation results for the tts model for these two imaginary scenarios are summarized in table 4 the estimated full distributions of the parameters are then used to conduct a 30 year forecast of the cumulative numbers of water main breaks the predicted mean cumulative number of breaks are shown in fig 12 as expected the 2 year warranty program gives the least predicted mean cumulative number of breaks while the no warranty case gives the highest the difference increases with time and is about 2 breaks by the end of 30 years this analysis has also indirectly demonstrated that the maintenance effectiveness of pipe repair can be captured by the proposed tts point process model 4 4 3 limitations and future improvements due to data availability the case study presented in the present paper considers only the pipe length and diameter in the modelling as more data being available many other explanatory variables such as pipe material pipe shape soil type surface type watershed flow rate etc can be formulated into the models this would greatly strengthen the capability of the models to reproduce the deterioration trend of an individual pipe as well as the corresponding failure predictions which would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the infrastructure management to achieve these a large number of break event data are required this can be fulfilled if different municipalities agree to cooperate and pool their data to develop a national or international infrastructure database this will then demand more advanced bayesian updating and model averaging techniques to make disparate database work together claeskens and hjort 2008 as for the enhancement of the tts point process model per se this paper has shown how fixed effects are considered by reparameterization of the conditional intensity function theoretically speaking random effects or frailty models can be introduced by randomizing some or all of the parameters to model unobserved individual heterogeneity e g lindqvist 2006 the practical barrier for this modelling potential is again the availability of event histories in other areas such as biostatistics and complex technological systems where more reliable failure event data are available these modelling strategies may be applied last in addition to the issue of partial missing break histories future studies should integrate other issues such as survival selection bias e g scheidegger et al 2011 scheidegger et al 2013 to advance the stochastic modelling of water main breaks 5 conclusions to predict water main breaks in a municipal water distribution network we have proposed a two time scale tts point process model to characterize both the overall pipe aging effect and local repair effect the conditional intensity function was formulated in a simple power form of two time variables including the time duration since installation of the pipe and the elapse time since the last break the proposed tts model is versatile in capturing both monotonic and non monotonic deterioration trends with time in real life systems including the famous bathtub curve a markov chain monte carlo data augmentation mcmc da algorithm for model estimation is developed for cases where the observed event histories involve significant missing records in the early lives of the water mains a case study using real life water main break events history was performed to demonstrate the application of the developed model through a thorough process of model estimation verification validation and updating for comparison purposes a nonhomogeneous poisson point process model was also developed using the same data the case study demonstrated that when model parameters are estimated using partially missing event history data the entire parameter distributions must be adopted for the prediction of water main breaks the traditional approach of plugging the modes i e the maximum likelihood estimate or the means into the prediction would lead to either under prediction or over prediction of the mean number of breaks predictions using the proposed model and the poisson model are significantly different not only for both unconditional mean cumulative and mean annual numbers of breaks on the entire water main system level but also for conditional intensities and survival probabilities on the individual pipe level as a result budget planning and asset prioritization in risk informed infrastructure asset management based on the two models would be significantly different in addition the tts model was used to investigate the maintenance effectiveness of pipe repair declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
