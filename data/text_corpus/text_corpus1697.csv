8485,study area the coastal sedimentary basin including the zou and ouémé rivers in benin study focus river discharge loss is known to occur on the zou and ouémé rivers in southern benin since a couple of decades ago the reason behind this discharge reduction remained so far unclear in this study we focus on creating a 3d numerical model of the system and on evaluating the sensitivity of leakage between the rivers and aquifers to various parameters new hydrological insights for the region results show that leakages along the zou river and ouémé stream are tiny i e 3 of the discharge losses this implies that the observed water loss from the zou and ouémé rivers is not likely caused by the leakage infiltration along these rivers into the subsurface the streambed conductance is found to be among the factors that impact less the computed leakages in the study area this study has ranked the different hydraulic and storage properties in their order of importance with respect to the computation of river leakages along the concerned rivers the determined rank of importance of the hydraulic and storage properties can guide river leakage modelling exercises in similar regions elsewhere keywords benin discharge loss flow modelling groundwater recharge ouémé river leakage 1 introduction in southern benin surface water is hardly exploited for drinking purposes rather for the majority of the population groundwater is the main source of water supply though surface waters are not exploited le barbe et al 1993 reported losses in water discharge along the zou river and ouémé stream figs 1 and 2 which are located in southern benin le barbe et al 1993 indicated that upstream discharges on the zou river at atcherigbe gauging station see fig 2 are higher than the discharges downstream dome s gauging station meaning that there is a loss of water between these two gauging stations atchérigbé and dome gauging stations in relatively high rainy years e g 2003 2007 the discharge loss is well pronounced the same remark is valid along the ouémé stream le barbe et al 1993 between savè and ahlan gauging stations see fig 1 for the gauging stations location the cause of this discharge loss is so far unclear and the main motivation of this research is to share light regarding the causes of this water losses from the zou river and ouémé stream surface groundwater interactions mainly river leakage to the subsurface caused discharge reduction in several hydrological systems winter et al 1998 lackey et al 2015 sophocleous 2002 also groundwater depletion due to abstractions or reduction of recharge by climate or land use changes could cause discharge loss in this case study we hypothesize that river leakage in the sedimentary basin is the major cause since surface water is hardly exploited for both drinking and agriculture so the first research question is how do river leakages compare to the water loss from these rivers to answer this question we aim at quantifying the river leakages along these rivers using a 3d numerical flow model however the computation of river leakages requires the estimation of the streambed conductance hatch et al 2010 lackey et al 2015 which is a parameter that is generally not known accurately in natural hydrological systems the streambed conductance varies in space along the rivers streams because streambed sediments are highly heterogeneous chen 2000 2004 detailed characterization of streambed sediments at regional scales are not affordable as they are costly very time consuming and few tools are available for such tasks woessner 2000 in addition to the streambed conductance other properties hydraulic and storage properties of the adjacent aquifers or aquitards may be influencing the computed river leakages but what is unclear is how does each of these properties affect the computed leakages so a second question is which of these different properties control predominantly the computed river leakages many models in the literature investigated the estimation of river leakage in hydrological systems but much less is known about the factors that control the leakage estimates in regional hydrogeological systems in this study we first set up a 3d numerical model for the study area to quantify the river leakages along the zou river and the ouémé stream second we compared the computed leakages along these rivers to the water losses from these rivers conceptual water budget finally we used the developed numerical model to access the impact of the different properties streambed conductance hydraulic and storage properties on the computed river leakages this helped to determine which properties control predominantly the computed river leakages and to rank the hydraulic and storage properties in their order of importance with the river leakages computation the 3d groundwater numerical flow model presented in this study is the first developed for the study area and provides insight regarding river leakages estimates that can be used in similar regions elsewhere the next section section 2 of this paper introduces the study area and its characteristics section 3 presents the methodology adopted to answer the research questions the results and discussion are presented in section 4 2 study area 2 1 location climate and surface hydrology the study area fig 1 is part of the coastal sedimentary basin of southern benin it extends from latitudes 06 45 n and 7 40 n and longitudes 1 55 e and 2 50 e and covers approximately 4600 km2 the altitude varies between 1 and 271 m above sea level it includes in its northern parts three plateaus which are from west to east the abomey zagnanado and kétou plateaus these plateaus are separated from each other by the valleys of zou river and ouémé stream respectively a regional east west belt known as the lama depression affaton et al 1985 amajor 1991 is found in its southern part and constitutes the southern limits of the abomey and kétou plateaus fig 1 finally the study area also includes the northern parts of the allada palteau and the sakete plateau fig 1 the climate of the study area is characterized by two rainy seasons and two dry seasons the main rainy season extends from mid march to mid august and the short rainy season extends from mid september to november the short dry season and the main dry season extend respectively from mid august to mid september and from december to mid march the mean rainfall is about 1200 mm year achidi et al 2012 houndagba 2015 the relative humidity vary from 65 to 90 and the temperature is between 19 and 38 c the surface water network of the study area include one main stream the ouémé stream fig 1 the ouémé is the biggest stream in benin and flows into the sea at a distance of about 120 km from the south of the study area the zou river is the main tributary of the ouémé and joins up the ouémé at about 10 km north of bonou township fig 1 the water level water depth in the zou river and ouémé stream vary from 0 3 m to 7 m fig 3 levels of about 0 3 m corresponds to the base flow conditions while during extreme flooding periods the levels can rise up to 7 m the surface water network of the study area also include three main lakes azili sele and hlan see fig 1 which are in connection with the rivers especially in the rainy seasons there exist also several brooks the blue lines in fig 1 other than the zou river and the ouémé stream in the study area which are either temporal or permanent 2 2 water budget on the zou river and ouémé stream the water budget on the zou river and ouémé stream was first established by le barbe et al 1993 who demonstrated that there is a water loss along these rivers according to these authors this water loss could be caused by leakage from these rivers into the subsurface in the sedimentary basin or could be caused by connection of these rivers to nearby lakes mainly azili and sele in details the water budget for these rivers in the sedimentary basin is presented in table 1 for few years q in 1 q in 2 and q out are respectively the river inflow to the study area through the zou river the inflow to the study area through the ouémé stream and the outflow from the study area through both rivers see fig 4 the gap between the inflows and the outflow is referred to as water loss in table 1 from the available data this water loss varies in time between 1 5 106 and 8 2 106 m3 d 2 3 geology and hydrogeology geologically the study area consists of sedimentary deposits that overlay the precambrian crystalline rocks granite quartzite and gneiss these deposits have a monoclinal structure and their thickness generally increases towards the southeast slansky 1962 houessou 1974 irb 1987 they consist of detrital formations sand gravel and clay sandstone marls and limestones a total of eight stratigraphic units table 2 were identified in the whole coastal sedimentary basin and extend from the upper cretaceous mainly the turonian coniacian unit i to the quaternary unit viii four units among these stratigraphic units are aquifers in the study area the turonian coniacian aquifer unit i the lower paleocene aquifer unit iib the continental terminal aquifer units v to vii and the quaternary aquifer unit viii separated from each other by clay and marls layers bouzid 1971 the most important aquifer in terms of extent and thickness is the turonian coniacian t c aquifer that consists predominantly of sand and some gravel this aquifer outcrops in the north and becomes deeper towards the south where it is confined by clay and marl materials these clay and marl materials outcrop in the lama depression gomez 1979 and limit infiltration from rainfall in this depression houndagba 2015 the depth and the thickness of the turonian coniacian aquifer vary across the area in the northern region northern abomey plateau zagnanado plateau and northern kétou plateau hand dug wells up to 70 m depth extend into this main aquifer in the south it is impossible to exploit the t c aquifer through hand dug wells due to the overlaying thick clay materials and due to the artesian condition that prevails for this aquifer in the south hence only deep boreholes that exploit the t c aquifer are found in the south the lower palaeocene aquifer is discontinuous and enclosed within the clay and marl materials form the maastrichtian and the upper palaeocene deposits the continental terminal aquifer is the upper aquifer and exists in the allada and sakete plateaus the quaternary aquifer consists of alluvial deposits coarse and fine sands that alternate with silt and clay materials these deposits are mainly found near rivers and streams in the ouémé valley fig 1 however their thickness along rivers in the north is negligible their thickness increases gradually from north to south boukari 2002 the turonian coniacian aquifer is the one of main interest in this study 3 method to quantify the river leakages along the zou river and the ouémé stream and to access which parameters mostly affect the estimates of river leakages we applied a methodology that includes the stratigraphic model construction the definition of the model flow domain and boundary conditions the model domain discretization the implementation of hydraulic properties recharge estimation and implementation the steady state model calibration and the implementation of the transient flow model details regarding each of these steps is provided in the following paragraphs 3 1 stratigraphic model construction to develop a stratigraphic model of the system which is close as possible to the field set up we considered the existing geological and geophysical data geological data include geological maps and drilling logs that were obtained from slansky 1962 mmeh 2001 and from several hydrogeological consulting reports some of the drilling logs extends to the bedrock and others are partial boreholes we considered all the drilling logs that reach the bedrock to allow construction of a complete 3d stratigraphic model in addition we considered partial drilling logs that reach the deepest aquifer i e the t c aquifer however for these partial drilling logs we derived the depths to the bedrock from the bedrock altitude map designed by pougnet 1955 and aicard 1959 based on the geophysics investigations gravimetric and seismic soundings they conducted across the region the spatial distribution of the drilling logs used for the stratigraphic model is shown on fig 1 we grouped several adjacent layers similar to clay and marl materials into one main layer representing the clay and marl materials also adjacent layers similar to sand material were grouped into one main sand layer table 2 provides details regarding the layers that are grouped together as a result the sedimentary geologic subsurface is simplified into three distinct stratigraphic layers which are from the bottom to the top a layer representing the turonian coniacian aquifer a layer combining the intermediate clay and marls strata and a layer combining the top quaternary alluvial sediments and the sediments from the continental terminal aquifer boukari and alassane 2007 the intermediate clay and marls strata were combined into one stratigraphic model layer because they are nearly impermeable and behave as an aquitard the alluvial sediments in the ouémé valley and the sediment from the continental terminal aquifer were combined into one stratigraphic model layer since they are of similar geological facies maliki 1993 we used the groundwater modeling systems software gms to construct the stratigraphic model fig 5 we applied the horizon method suggested by lemon and jones 2003 due to its simplicity and efficiency in building the stratigraphic model directly from boreholes data and additional cross sections data we applied the nearest neighbour approach owen et al 1996 tam et al 2014 in gms to interpolate the contact between the stratigraphic model layers the top elevation of the stratigraphic model is the land surface topography created from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm elevation data eros 2002 at 90 m resolution the resulting 3d stratigraphic model is shown on fig 5 and cross sections throughout the stratigraphic model are shown on fig 6 the impermeable bedrock crystalline rocks below the sediment deposits is excluded in this stratigraphic model since it plays no role in terms of groundwater flow 3 2 model flow domain and boundary conditions 3 2 1 flow domain the model flow domain is about 3400 km2 fig 1 and is defined based on the geologic and groundwater divides existing in both the t c aquifer and the top aquifer in detail the boundaries limits are as follow the northern limit it corresponds to the sediment bedrock contact some complex shapes of the sediment in the northern zagnanado plateau fig 1 were not included in the model domain as they are of insignificant thickness 1 5 m and discharge their groundwater through springs as such they are of no significance in terms of regional flow and were not included in the model flow domain the western and eastern limits these limits correspond to the identified groundwater divides in the t c aquifer see fig 7 the south west and south east limits purple lines in fig 1 these limits are positioned along the groundwater divides of the top aquifer boukari 1998 alassane 2004 at these limits different boundary conditions are required for the different layers the top aquifer the adjacent impervious clay and marl materials and the t c aquifer the south central limit the green line in fig 1 this limit is set to cross the quaternary aquifer in the ouémé valley fig 1 also at this limit different types of boundary conditions are required for the quaternary aquifer the impervious clay and marl layer and the deep t c aquifer 3 2 2 boundary conditions with respect to the explanations in the previous section a no flow type of boundary condition is imposed for all layers at the northern western and eastern limits as suggested by kresic 2006 different types of boundary conditions were applied along the southern model limit since at that limit two main aquifers the t c aquifer and the top aquifer and one separating aquitard impermeable layer mainly clay and marl materials are to be treated differently for the top aquifer the south western and south eastern limits corresponds to its groundwater divide hence a no flow type of boundary condition is applied regarding the south central limit and for the quaternary aquifer in the ouémé valley an average value of head fluctuation dirichlet type of boundary condition in this aquifer was implemented for the separating aquitard impervious layer mainly clay and marl materials a no flow type of boundary condition is applied based on the knowledge that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of this material is low 10 4 m d and hence nearly no flow occurs horizontally in this layer for the t c aquifer we considered that prescribing a constant head artesian head at this limit will imply that the artesian heads could never go below the prescribed head value which will obviously not be realistic at a transient flow regime also measuring in the field the fluxes q in fig 8 through this limit of the t c aquifer is not really feasible and temporal variations of these fluxes cannot be practically conceived accurately for these reasons a cauchy type of boundary conditions appears to be more realistic because it avoids that inexact prescribed heads and fluxes at this limit influence the model solutions the different types of boundary conditions at the model limits are summarized in table 3 the model layers introduced in table 3 are explained in the next section 3 3 model discretization we used a finite difference scheme within modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 for the model discretization horizontally square cells size of 300 300 m are implemented and resulted in 283 rows 312 column and a total of 185 194 active cells see fig a2 for the 3d grid model a dimension of 300 m is chosen as lower values will cause lengthy model execution time while higher values coarser model grids could lead to larger errors in the head and flux simulations wildemeersch et al 2014 suggest that for catchments of few hundred square kilometers an element size of the order of 500 m is the best compromise for obtaining good model performance with tractable execution times without significantly increasing prediction uncertainty the option boundary matching within gms jones et al 2002 was used to represent as close as possible the boundaries of the stratigraphic model in the 3 d grid vertically five 05 model layers were defined in details the t c aquifer is subdivided into 3 model layers the clay and marl materials are considered as one model layer and the top aquifer is also considered as one model layer fig a2 the t c aquifer was subdivided into three 03 model layers to account for vertical heterogeneity in the t c aquifer and to allow accurate placement of well screens when required kresic 2006 all the cells within the model boundaries are active cells and were used for simulations 3 4 hydraulic properties 3 4 1 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity for the turonian coniacian aquifer was estimated in previous studies bouzid 1971 igip 1984 burgeap brgm 1994 turkpak international scet tunisie 1991 and at different locations based on pumping tests conducted throughout the study area clay and marl materials in the study areas are characterized by hydraulic conductivity values of about 10 4m d benson and trast 1995 yalo et al 2014 the hydraulic conductivities of the top aquifer are documented in le barbe et al 1993 and boukari 2002 the hydraulic conductivity values of the different stratigraphic layers are summarized in table 4 and considered during the implementation and calibration of the numerical model 3 4 2 conductance parameters the conductance is an expression of the ease with which water flows through a resistance layer e g river bed sediments when using a conceptual model approach in gms the manner in which the conductance term should be computed and entered depends on whether the feature object is a polygon lake for example arc river for example or point spring for example for lakes rivers streams and brooks we defined a conductance based on the average thickness and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the bed sediments of these hydrologic features for rivers streams and brooks we defined a conductance per unit length c o n d u l in eq 1 and for lakes we defined a conductance per unit area c o n d u a in eq 2 depending on the lengths of the river arcs that intersect the grid cells a corresponding accurate conductance value for the concerned grid cell is calculated by multiplying the value of the conductance per unit length by the length of the river arcs similarly the area of the cell covered by the lake polygon is multiplied by the value of the conductance per unit area to obtain the equivalent conductance value for the cells covered by the lake 1 c o n d u l k v b w 2 c o n d u a k v b where k v b and w are respectively the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the bed sediment the thickness of the bed sediment and the width of the river the obtained average k v values from few field measurements thickness of the bed sediments width of the rivers stream brooks as well as the calculated conductances c o n d u l and c o n d u a are summarized in table 5 and were applied in the numerical model 3 5 recharge estimation predominant recharge areas infiltration zones in the model domain were defined based on the surface geological map developed by the istito research breda irb 1987 and lithological information from drilling logs the recharge areas fig 9 are outcropping regions northern of the turonian coniacian aquifer see fig 1 for the top aquifer the whole alluvial plain along the rivers represent a recharge area in regions where clay materials outcrop recharge is hindered and a dense drainage network is found caused by surficial discharge of precipitation in contrast in the recharge areas the drainage networks are absent or less dense in total there are four predominant recharge areas three in the northern regions for the turonian coniacian aquifer and one mainly along the zou river and the ouémé stream for the top aquifer in each of these four recharge areas there is one rainfall station and data from each of these stations allows recharge estimation for the respective recharge areas estimating the recharge rate accurately is crucial but remains complex and difficult in view of different parameters that influence infiltration dieng 2017 in this study we estimated daily groundwater recharge r by first using the penman method penman 1949 1950 to calculate the evapotranspiration then we applied the water budget equation eq 3 the principle of this equation is that it considers that water is held in store as soil moisture δ s in eq 3 which can be increased by rainfall p in eq 3 and depleted by the actual evapotranspiration e a in eq 3 when the soil field capacity δ s is attained excess rainfall is routed to surficial runoff r o f f and to groundwater as recharge so the groundwater recharge could be estimated if data of both the soil field capacity and the runoff are available the actual evapotranspiration is calculated using the weather data available in each of the recharge area for details regarding the actual evapotranspiration calculation the reader is referred to allen et al 1989 and allen et al 1994b 3 p r o f f e a r δ s r p r o f f δ s e a the reliability of the estimated recharge was judged by comparing the groundwater recharge results e g table 6 to both the rainfall and the groundwater level fluctuations observed in the same areas e g fig 10 the location of the piezometers is indicated in fig 9 according to the water table fluctuation method delin et al 2007 higher water level rise reflect higher amounts of groundwater recharge in contrast lower water level rise reflect of lower amounts of groundwater recharge for example from fig 10 it is clear that low recharge occurred in 2015 at zagnanado compared to the other years e g year 2010 since the groundwater level rise is insignificant 0 2 m in 2015 accordingly we would expect the estimated recharge to be low in 2015 the estimated recharge are well in line with this expectation since the estimated recharge is low for the 2015 table 6 in contrast higher recharge is obtained in 2010 table 6 as expected from fig 10 since in 2010 a high groundwater level rise 1 m occurred based on the above comparative groundwater table fluctuation and recharge analysis the estimated groundwater recharge is judged acceptable and were used as input for the numerical model the recharge calculated for the other recharge areas bohicon kétou and bonou are summarized in annex 3 data of soil moisture at field capacity and runoff data required for the recharge calculation in the study area were taken respectively from previous studies azontonde 1991 schuol et al 2008 biao 2017 3 6 groundwater abstractions and discharge according to slansky 1962 there were already since 1950s few hand dug wells in the study area however groundwater abstractions from these few hand dug wells were negligible since they were only for domestic use in addition to this insignificant groundwater abstractions groundwater also discharges through natural springs in the unconfined part of the turonian coniacian aquifer during the period 1986 1987 the first artesian wells were installed in the turonian aquifer since then numerous artesian wells have been installed and constitute continuous and important sources of groundwater discharge of the turonian coniacian aquifer 3 7 surface water recharge groundwater abstractions and discharge implementation the brooks the zou river and the ouémé stream were implemented using the riv package mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 in modflow to simulate the flux into or out of the river through the bed sediment the general head boundary ghb package was used to represent the three existing lakes in the study area the estimated recharge was implemented using the recharge rch package springs were implemented in the model using the drain drn package three drains were also implemented around kétou in layer 05 to account for existing faults that drain the t c aquifer and cause this aquifer to be dry in this sector this is justified as most existing boreholes in this sector are screened in the bedrock and are of low productivity 3 8 steady state model calibration the model computed head both in the turonian coniacian aquifer and the top aquifer was calibrated to the predevelopment period 1986 1987 conditions which corresponds to the period when the first artesian wells started to be installed in the area of study this predevelopment period was considered for the steady state calibration in attempt to limit probable pumping effects on the simulated head and fluxes hand dug wells were not implemented in the steady state model as abstractions from them were insignificant few boreholes that existed in the area were also disregarded for the steady state model for the same reason the fitted parameters are mainly the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the different stratigraphic layers because these are the less known parameters in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution the recharge though estimated based on field data was also adjusted sensitivity analysis prior to the model calibration indicated that the horizontal hydraulic conductivities and the recharge were the most sensitive parameters to the model computed heads and fluxes hence these two parameters are good candidates to be adjusted hill 1998 the vertical anisotropy van of the hydraulic conductivity was insensitive to the model outputs and was therefore not adjusted during calibration in this study the bed sediment conductances were not adjusted during calibration however the sensitivity of the bed sediment conductances to the computed heads and fluxes was analysed and discussed in the results section of this paper the manual trial and error calibration approach was adopted to allow that different zones of hydraulic properties spatial zonation of the hydraulic properties are defined based on geologic field knowledge and prior information zonation of hydraulic properties is required as hydraulic properties vary in space carrera et al 2005 also the manual calibration approach helps to develop practical understanding of the aquifer behaviour with regard to the physical hydrologic and geologic features that exist in the modeled system the model is calibrated based on the available groundwater head data which were measured in boreholes during installation in 1986 1987 for both the kh horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the recharge we began calibration by defining simple and few sub regions according to the existing hydrologic and geologic features and then we increased slowly the complexity in the sub regions by applying the principle of parsimony yeh and yoon 1981 carrera and neuman 1986 hill 1986 madigan and raftery 1994 hill and tiedeman 2007 the zonal recharge and hydraulic conductivity polygons that lead to a successful calibrated model are shown respectively in figs 11 and 12 the associated values of recharge and hydraulic conductivities are summarized respectively in table 7 and in table 8 the obtained hydraulic conductivities values during calibration for the t c aquifer the clay material and the top aquifer are within the range of values reported by bouzid 1971 igip 1984 burgeap brgm 1994 and turkpak international scet tunisie 1991 the model calibration was judged acceptable when the misfit between the observed and the computed heads was less than 10 m the calibration target doherty 2002 of 10 m meters was defined based on the standard deviation 8 5 m between the srtm dem data and the data at topographic control points from the field in addition to the deviation between the dem and the topographic control points there are different other sources of imprecision that should not be overlooked these are discretization error measurement error regarding the heads and wells screens elevations and interpolations inaccuracy during the stratigraphic model construction also the recharge calculated and implemented in the model is an average value year 1987 of table 6 and table a1 as well as the observed heads since the observed heads are not related to a specific month season so this could be an additional substantial source of misfit between the computed and observed heads in that sense arriving to a perfect calibrated model highly parametrized that attempt too close fits with the observed heads is not required voss 2011 wildemeersch 2012 suggested that when simulating general variation of piezometric heads the adequate objective function to consider for the measurement of the goodness of fit between the observed and the computed heads is the rmse root mean square error see eq 4 the obtained r2 is 0 97 and the rmse is equal to 5 83 m for the turonian coniacian aquifer for the top aquifer the r2 and rmse are respectively 0 6 and 4 54 m also the residuals are in both cases randomly distributed around the 1 1 line fig 13 a and b which is an indication that the model is less likely to systematically underestimate or overestimate the heads 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n h c h o 2 h c a n d h o a r e r e

calibration the transient model was implemented in an attempt to capture the seasonal behaviour behaviour in time of the river leakages in this study the simulation time from january 1988 to october 2011 was chosen because data of rivers levels are available for this period see fig 14 the levels at dome s station fig 14a and at ahlan s station fig 14c were respectively implemented for the reach of the zou river and for the reach of the ouémé stream which is located prior to the junction between the zou river and the ouémé stream the levels at bonou s station fig 14b were implemented for the reach of the ouémé stream which is located after the junction the data of the brooks levels are scarce and vary between 0 and 1 m hence an average value of 0 5 m is set for the brooks also data of the lakes levels are scarce and average values for lake levels were implemented i e 14 m 9 m and 6 m respectively for lake azili lake sele and lake hlan the stress periods were set to be equal to one calendar month with time steps equal to one only one time step per stress period a duration of one month as stress period was judged small enough to capture the seasonal leakage behaviour because the different dry and rainy seasons last for more than one month this resulted in a total of 285 stress periods monthly average river levels recharge and abstraction rates were set for each stress period the storage coefficients implemented for each stratigraphic layer see table 9 was derived from previous studies and the literature bouzid 1971 lohman 1972 the transient model was run with the heads from the calibrated steady state model being the initial heads and was calibrated manually by try and error the transient computed heads were close to the available observed heads at three locations after the first model run except that the computed heads display higher dynamic variability compared to the observed heads fig 15 a in that sense only the storage coefficients were adjusted during calibration and the optimal calibrated values of storage coefficients are summarized in table 9 after calibration the computed heads became much more closer to the observed heads figs 15b and 16 as explained earlier section 3 8 there are different sources of imprecisions in the input data that may affect the misfit between the observed and computed heads so attempting to match the transient computed heads too closely to the transient observed heads is not realistic since the transient computed heads respond to estimated monthly recharge events voss 2011 the calibrated transient model is in good agreement with the known groundwater flow patterns in the study area see figs 16 and 17 the calibrated transient model served to quantify the dynamic river leakages and to access the impact of the conductance hydraulic and storage properties on the quantified river leakages based on the governing groundwater flow equation eq 5 and on the equation for the cauchy boundary condition used to simulate river leakages eq 6 the parameters to assess are the hydraulic conductivities of the three stratigraphic layers ktc kal kclay the storage coefficients specific yield or specific storage i e sy or ss of the same layers and the streambed conductance the vertical hydraulic anisotropy being ten 10 and one 1 respectively for the two aquifers and the clay layer table 7 implies that when varying the horizontal conductivities the vertical conductivities are also varied accordingly based on the knowledge that hydraulic and storage properties in porous medium are often log normally distributed gomez hernandez and gorelick 1989 these properties were varied within the range of one third 1 3 to three 3 times the base values the base values of hydraulic and storage properties were multiplied by 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 and 3 leading to five model run per parameter and per stratigraphic layer to account for possible variation in rivers width and streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity the base values of the streambed conductance were varied within two order of magnitude i e from 0 1 c o n d 0 to 10 c o n d 0 c o n d 0 being the stream bed conductance values from the base model with this the impact that each of these properties has on the computed river leakages was assessed 5 k x 2 h x 2 k y 2 h y 2 k z 2 h z 2 s h t g 6 q c o n d δ h where k h s q c o n d and δ h are respectively the hydraulic conductivities the groundwater head the storage coefficients the leakage the stream bed conductance and head difference between the river and the adjacent aquifer g stands for sources and sinks terms including leakage the next section presents the results and discussion regarding the computed flow budget the computed river leakages as well as the impact that each of the different properties has on the computed leakages for the rest of this paper the term base model and base value will respectively refer to the calibrated transient model and the optimal parameters values from the calibrated transient model 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow budget water budgets zone budgets were calculated for three adjacent sub zones named zone0 zone1 and zone2 of the modeled area zone0 zone1 and zone2 stand respectively for the top aquifer the aquitard clay and the t c aquifer fig 18 b d it should be underlined that a relatively negligible groundwater 0 8 105 m3 d from the t c aquifer zone2 flows upward to the clay and marl layer zone1 see fig 18c and part of it 0 3 105 m3 d see fig 18b continues upward to the top aquifer zone0 this finding is consistent with the conceptual understanding of the modeled system since the t c aquifer is known to be artesian in the southern modeled domain dray et al 1989 achidi et al 2012 kpegli et al 2018 the stationary flow budget fig 18a includes two major inputs direct groundwater recharge from precipitation and rivers infiltration and four major outputs outflows through the southern limit for the top aquifer springs and faults outflows river exfiltration and outflows through the southern limit for t c aquifer combined with lakes exfiltration the total recharge is estimated to be 106 m3 d fig 18a which is shared between the t c aquifer 6 105 m3 d see fig 18d and the top aquifer 4 105 m3 d see fig 18b recharge to the t c aquifer thus represent 60 of the total groundwater recharge of the whole system the total river infiltration downward leakage is 2 4 105 m3 d and more than 83 of this total river infiltration recharge the t c aquifer fig 18a and d the remaining 17 0 3 105 m3 d contributes to the top aquifer recharge therefore rivers contribute to subsurface recharge in terms of outflows from the flow domain river exfiltration upward river leakage represents the most important budget component 6 6 105 m3 d followed by the drains 3 8 105 m3 d representing springs and faults outflows the outflows through the southern limit of the t c aquifer combined with lakes exfiltration 1 8 105 m3 d termed as head dep bounds on fig 18 and the outflows through the southern limit of the top aquifer 0 33 105 m3 d termed as constant head river exfiltration from the t c aquifer appears to be higher 3 6 105 m3 d than the one from the top aquifer 2 8 105 m3 d for the t c aquifer 2 1 105 m3 d gets recharged from the rivers but 3 6 105 m3 d exfiltrate to the surface water in addition river exfiltration upward river leakage is more than 1 4 time greater than river infiltration downward river leakage for both aquifers meaning that rivers remain overall gaining in the flow domain fig 18 this means that for the stationary condition rivers are not predominantly recharging the aquifers however the dynamic of the river leakages especially along the zou river and the ouémé stream needs to be examined to cross check this finding the dynamic behaviour of the leakages along the zou river and ouémé stream is presented in the next section 4 2 dynamic of the computed leakages along the zou river and ouémé stream with regard to the issue of river water loss along the zou and the ouémé stream in the study area le barbe et al 1993 the seasonal river leakage along these rivers was quantified fig 19 along the zou river and the ouémé stream it appears that the leakage is upward groundwater flowing to the river i e gaining stream condition between november and april yearly fig 19 conversely the leakage is mainly downward in periods of june to october of each year november to march and june to october are known to include respectively dry and rainy seasons in the study area meaning that seasonality of the river leakage correlates well with the seasons in the study area the monthly leakage fluxes are comprised between 8 105 and 106 m3 d for the simulated period at the yearly basis it appears that in some years e g 1992 1999 see fig 20 a the upward leakage fluxes are greater compared to the downward leakage fluxes in some other years e g 1988 1991 the upward leakage fluxes are rather less than the downward leakage fluxes this is an indication that along the concerned sections of the zou river and the ouémé stream the direction of the absolute river leakage is not unique throughout the years for the simulation period the differences between the yearly upward and downward leakages are comprised between the 105 and 2 105 m3 d fig 20b compared with the rivers conceptual water budget along the zou river and the ouémé stream see table 1 the differences between the yearly upward and downward leakages fig 20b represent small amounts i e 0 75 0 96 0 35 3 3 and 1 66 of the water losses in 2002 2003 2004 2008 and 2010 respectively for example from the conceptual water budget 6 106 m3 d represents the water loss in the year 2003 however the absolute leakage fluxes are 5 8 104 m3 d i e an absolute infiltration of 0 96 of the water losses the leakages along the zou and ouémé in the study area appear not to be high enough to justify the water losses given the base values from the base model uncertainties in flow parameters hence uncertainties in model results remain so far an issue to consider in hydrological modelling studies delhomme 1979 du et al 2018 ghouili et al 2017 zammouri and ribeiro 2017 in the next section we vary each of the parameters within their possible ranges to assess how these parameters impact the computed river leakages 4 3 impact of the different parameters on the computed leakage 4 3 1 impact of the streambed conductance the streambed conductance was varied within two order of magnitude as indicated in section 3 9 fig 21 shows that throughout the years the absolute upward downward leakage is similar whether the conductance is equal to five times or ten times the base conductance in details only a change of 2 3 i e 0 039 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d and 2 6 i e 0 044 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d occurred when the base conductance is multiplied by five and ten respectively see fig 21 year 2009 this is an indication that a further increase of the conductance will have little influence on the computed leakage conversely when dividing the base conductance by five or ten the absolute leakage is relatively more affected 4 and 8 i e 0 064 105 m3 d and 0 14 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d and could be reversed from upward to downward for negligible absolute leakage fluxes fluxes close to zero e g years 1993 1996 in fig 21 this suggests that the conductance in areas where the bed sediments are locally more resistant could be of relative importance regarding the absolute river leakage fluxes 4 3 2 impact of hydraulic conductivities a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial material kal resulted in an increase of the absolute upward leakage but in a reduction of the absolute downward leakage conversely when the kal is increased the absolute upward leakage is reduced while the downward leakage is increased for example dividing the kal by three only impacted the absolute leakage by 8 i e a change of 0 14 105 m3 d over 1 7 105 m3 d see for example fig 22 a year 2009 it can be inferred that in relatively low kal materials where the range of kal uncertainties is likely to be small kal would have less impact on the computed leakage meaning that detailed characterization in low conductive material would not be necessary however in highly conductive kal materials where the range of kal uncertainty is likely large the impact of kal on absolute leakage would be considerable e g 0 75 105 m3 d over 1 6 105 m3 d meaning 44 change in leakage when multiplying kal by three in 2009 see fig 22a this means that the impact of multiplying the kal by only three is by far greater than when the streambed conductance is multiplied by ten this suggests that compared to the streambed conductance the kal has a greater impact on the computed leakage fig 22b shows that a reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the clay material kclay caused an increase in the absolute upward leakage in details multiplying the kclay by three resulted in a change of 24 of the absolute leakage i e 0 4 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d 2009 which is less compared to the change 44 caused by a multiplication by three of the alluvial conductivity this suggests that the hydraulic conductivity of the clay material has less effect on the computed leakage compared to the conductivity of the alluvial material fig 22c shows that multiplying the hydraulic conductivity of the confined part of the t c aquifer by three has impacted the computed upward leakage only by 12 e i 0 2 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d in 2009 fig 22c a change of 12 is small compared to the impact related to both the alluvial and the clay hydraulic conductivities which are respectively 44 and 24 this illustrates that the hydraulic conductivity of the confined part of the t c aquifer has less influence on the computed leakage than to the alluvial and clay materials regarding the unconfined part of the t c aquifer the impact on leakage of multiplying the base hydraulic conductivities by three is 45 i e 0 76 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d year 2009 see fig 22d this impact appears to be similar to the case of the alluvial aquifer 44 and greater than those of the confined t c aquifer and the clay layer so in terms of hydraulic conductivity of the different materials it appears that the hydraulic conductivities in the alluvial and the unconfined part of the t c aquifer affect the most the computed leakage followed by the clay conductivity the conductivity of the confined part of the t c aquifer appears to be less important than the conductivity of the clay material it is worth noting that the streambed conductance is so far the less influencing factor regarding the computed leakage 4 3 3 impact of storage coefficients the impact of the storage coefficient of the different geological materials is summarized in fig 23 as shown in fig 23a increasing three times the storage coefficient in the confined part of the t c aquifer or dividing it by three has almost no influence on the computed leakage in details the change in the computed leakage is 0 18 i e a variation of 0 003 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d when the base value is multiplied by three regarding the unconfined alluvial material fig 23b variations in the storage coefficient sy caused limited impact on the computed leakage 5 when the base value is divided or multiplied three also the impact of the storage coefficient sy in the unconfined part of the t c aquifer fig 23c on the leakage is limited 5 when dividing the storage coefficient by three in 2009 12 and 15 i e respectively 0 2 105 m3 d and 0 2 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d represent the changes that occurred in the computed leakage when the base value of the storage coefficient of the clay material is multiplied respectively by one third and three fig 23d year 2009 12 and 15 are relatively high changes compared to the related changes in the alluvial the confined and the unconfined parts of the t c aquifer this suggests that the storage coefficient in the clay layer has a relatively higher impact on the leakages compared to the others it is worth noting that the clay storage coefficient has a greater impact on the leakage compared to the streambed conductance results presented in this section illustrate that with regard to the quantification of river leakages in the studied system the most influencing factors are the hydraulic conductivities in the alluvial and in the unconfined part of the t c aquifers which caused 45 changes in computed leakages then comes the clay s hydraulic conductivity the storage coefficient of the clay and the hydraulic conductivity of the confined part of the t c aquifer which affect the leakage by 12 the storage coefficient of the alluvial material the streambed conductance and the storage coefficient of the unconfined part of the t c aquifer only affect the leakage by 5 the storage coefficient in the confined part of the t c aquifer is the least important factor that affect the leakage it should be emphasized that the streambed conductance is among the least dominant factors when computing the river leakage this finding leads to the conclusion that efforts to measure with high precision streambed conductances with respect to quantifying river leakages are not beneficial this finding is consistent with leake et al 2008 who found that the differences in colorado river depletion calculated with the original riverbed conductance values and with values that are three orders of magnitude lower are relatively minor based on the different parameters ranges applied in this study the highest possible leakage values during the simulation period are 2 105 m3 d absolute downward leakage and 2 105 m3 d absolute upward leakage these values are by far low compared to the water losses from the zou river and the ouémé stream table 1 in details for example in year 2003 the water losses are 60 105 m3 d while the highest possible simulated leakage is 2 105 m3 d which represents only 3 of the water losses in relatively high rainy years with higher groundwater recharge e g year 2008 2010 see fig 22 the leakage is absolutely upward meaning that in these years leakage along the zou river and the ouémé stream have not contributed to the water losses though the water losses are still important in these years 30 105 m3 d see table 1 this finding leads to the conclusion that the observed water loss in the zou and ouémé rivers see table 1 and fig 2 is not likely to be due to their leakage infiltration into the subsurface flow domain 5 conclusion the aim of this study was to quantify river leakage along the zou river and the ouémé stream in attempt to understand the role leakages from these rivers play with regard to their water losses to quantify the leakage we set up a 3d numerical flow model which is based on observations and available data and is close as possible to the field setting the model served to quantify possible ranges of the leakages along the zou river and the ouémé stream given reasonable ranges of the streambed conductance and of the hydraulic and storage properties then the computed leakages were compared with the water losses from the conceptual water budget on the concerned rivers the results show that river leakages along the zou river and the ouémé stream are tiny and represent at most 3 of the water losses this finding leads to the conclusion that the observed water loss in the zou and ouémé rivers is not likely caused by their leakage infiltration into the subsurface flow domain a limitation is that the model in this research does not test the interconnectedness of surface water flows as such further research is required to explore other plausible causes such as river lake marshland interconnections which is beyond the scope of the present research this study strengthens that the streambed conductance is among the properties that has minor influence on the river computed leakages the most dominant factors are the hydraulic conductivities in the alluvial and in the unconfined part of the turonian coniacian aquifer followed by storage coefficient in the clay material this study has allowed to rank the hydraulic and storage properties in their order of importance with regard to the estimation of river leakages the study hence

8485,study area the coastal sedimentary basin including the zou and ouémé rivers in benin study focus river discharge loss is known to occur on the zou and ouémé rivers in southern benin since a couple of decades ago the reason behind this discharge reduction remained so far unclear in this study we focus on creating a 3d numerical model of the system and on evaluating the sensitivity of leakage between the rivers and aquifers to various parameters new hydrological insights for the region results show that leakages along the zou river and ouémé stream are tiny i e 3 of the discharge losses this implies that the observed water loss from the zou and ouémé rivers is not likely caused by the leakage infiltration along these rivers into the subsurface the streambed conductance is found to be among the factors that impact less the computed leakages in the study area this study has ranked the different hydraulic and storage properties in their order of importance with respect to the computation of river leakages along the concerned rivers the determined rank of importance of the hydraulic and storage properties can guide river leakage modelling exercises in similar regions elsewhere keywords benin discharge loss flow modelling groundwater recharge ouémé river leakage 1 introduction in southern benin surface water is hardly exploited for drinking purposes rather for the majority of the population groundwater is the main source of water supply though surface waters are not exploited le barbe et al 1993 reported losses in water discharge along the zou river and ouémé stream figs 1 and 2 which are located in southern benin le barbe et al 1993 indicated that upstream discharges on the zou river at atcherigbe gauging station see fig 2 are higher than the discharges downstream dome s gauging station meaning that there is a loss of water between these two gauging stations atchérigbé and dome gauging stations in relatively high rainy years e g 2003 2007 the discharge loss is well pronounced the same remark is valid along the ouémé stream le barbe et al 1993 between savè and ahlan gauging stations see fig 1 for the gauging stations location the cause of this discharge loss is so far unclear and the main motivation of this research is to share light regarding the causes of this water losses from the zou river and ouémé stream surface groundwater interactions mainly river leakage to the subsurface caused discharge reduction in several hydrological systems winter et al 1998 lackey et al 2015 sophocleous 2002 also groundwater depletion due to abstractions or reduction of recharge by climate or land use changes could cause discharge loss in this case study we hypothesize that river leakage in the sedimentary basin is the major cause since surface water is hardly exploited for both drinking and agriculture so the first research question is how do river leakages compare to the water loss from these rivers to answer this question we aim at quantifying the river leakages along these rivers using a 3d numerical flow model however the computation of river leakages requires the estimation of the streambed conductance hatch et al 2010 lackey et al 2015 which is a parameter that is generally not known accurately in natural hydrological systems the streambed conductance varies in space along the rivers streams because streambed sediments are highly heterogeneous chen 2000 2004 detailed characterization of streambed sediments at regional scales are not affordable as they are costly very time consuming and few tools are available for such tasks woessner 2000 in addition to the streambed conductance other properties hydraulic and storage properties of the adjacent aquifers or aquitards may be influencing the computed river leakages but what is unclear is how does each of these properties affect the computed leakages so a second question is which of these different properties control predominantly the computed river leakages many models in the literature investigated the estimation of river leakage in hydrological systems but much less is known about the factors that control the leakage estimates in regional hydrogeological systems in this study we first set up a 3d numerical model for the study area to quantify the river leakages along the zou river and the ouémé stream second we compared the computed leakages along these rivers to the water losses from these rivers conceptual water budget finally we used the developed numerical model to access the impact of the different properties streambed conductance hydraulic and storage properties on the computed river leakages this helped to determine which properties control predominantly the computed river leakages and to rank the hydraulic and storage properties in their order of importance with the river leakages computation the 3d groundwater numerical flow model presented in this study is the first developed for the study area and provides insight regarding river leakages estimates that can be used in similar regions elsewhere the next section section 2 of this paper introduces the study area and its characteristics section 3 presents the methodology adopted to answer the research questions the results and discussion are presented in section 4 2 study area 2 1 location climate and surface hydrology the study area fig 1 is part of the coastal sedimentary basin of southern benin it extends from latitudes 06 45 n and 7 40 n and longitudes 1 55 e and 2 50 e and covers approximately 4600 km2 the altitude varies between 1 and 271 m above sea level it includes in its northern parts three plateaus which are from west to east the abomey zagnanado and kétou plateaus these plateaus are separated from each other by the valleys of zou river and ouémé stream respectively a regional east west belt known as the lama depression affaton et al 1985 amajor 1991 is found in its southern part and constitutes the southern limits of the abomey and kétou plateaus fig 1 finally the study area also includes the northern parts of the allada palteau and the sakete plateau fig 1 the climate of the study area is characterized by two rainy seasons and two dry seasons the main rainy season extends from mid march to mid august and the short rainy season extends from mid september to november the short dry season and the main dry season extend respectively from mid august to mid september and from december to mid march the mean rainfall is about 1200 mm year achidi et al 2012 houndagba 2015 the relative humidity vary from 65 to 90 and the temperature is between 19 and 38 c the surface water network of the study area include one main stream the ouémé stream fig 1 the ouémé is the biggest stream in benin and flows into the sea at a distance of about 120 km from the south of the study area the zou river is the main tributary of the ouémé and joins up the ouémé at about 10 km north of bonou township fig 1 the water level water depth in the zou river and ouémé stream vary from 0 3 m to 7 m fig 3 levels of about 0 3 m corresponds to the base flow conditions while during extreme flooding periods the levels can rise up to 7 m the surface water network of the study area also include three main lakes azili sele and hlan see fig 1 which are in connection with the rivers especially in the rainy seasons there exist also several brooks the blue lines in fig 1 other than the zou river and the ouémé stream in the study area which are either temporal or permanent 2 2 water budget on the zou river and ouémé stream the water budget on the zou river and ouémé stream was first established by le barbe et al 1993 who demonstrated that there is a water loss along these rivers according to these authors this water loss could be caused by leakage from these rivers into the subsurface in the sedimentary basin or could be caused by connection of these rivers to nearby lakes mainly azili and sele in details the water budget for these rivers in the sedimentary basin is presented in table 1 for few years q in 1 q in 2 and q out are respectively the river inflow to the study area through the zou river the inflow to the study area through the ouémé stream and the outflow from the study area through both rivers see fig 4 the gap between the inflows and the outflow is referred to as water loss in table 1 from the available data this water loss varies in time between 1 5 106 and 8 2 106 m3 d 2 3 geology and hydrogeology geologically the study area consists of sedimentary deposits that overlay the precambrian crystalline rocks granite quartzite and gneiss these deposits have a monoclinal structure and their thickness generally increases towards the southeast slansky 1962 houessou 1974 irb 1987 they consist of detrital formations sand gravel and clay sandstone marls and limestones a total of eight stratigraphic units table 2 were identified in the whole coastal sedimentary basin and extend from the upper cretaceous mainly the turonian coniacian unit i to the quaternary unit viii four units among these stratigraphic units are aquifers in the study area the turonian coniacian aquifer unit i the lower paleocene aquifer unit iib the continental terminal aquifer units v to vii and the quaternary aquifer unit viii separated from each other by clay and marls layers bouzid 1971 the most important aquifer in terms of extent and thickness is the turonian coniacian t c aquifer that consists predominantly of sand and some gravel this aquifer outcrops in the north and becomes deeper towards the south where it is confined by clay and marl materials these clay and marl materials outcrop in the lama depression gomez 1979 and limit infiltration from rainfall in this depression houndagba 2015 the depth and the thickness of the turonian coniacian aquifer vary across the area in the northern region northern abomey plateau zagnanado plateau and northern kétou plateau hand dug wells up to 70 m depth extend into this main aquifer in the south it is impossible to exploit the t c aquifer through hand dug wells due to the overlaying thick clay materials and due to the artesian condition that prevails for this aquifer in the south hence only deep boreholes that exploit the t c aquifer are found in the south the lower palaeocene aquifer is discontinuous and enclosed within the clay and marl materials form the maastrichtian and the upper palaeocene deposits the continental terminal aquifer is the upper aquifer and exists in the allada and sakete plateaus the quaternary aquifer consists of alluvial deposits coarse and fine sands that alternate with silt and clay materials these deposits are mainly found near rivers and streams in the ouémé valley fig 1 however their thickness along rivers in the north is negligible their thickness increases gradually from north to south boukari 2002 the turonian coniacian aquifer is the one of main interest in this study 3 method to quantify the river leakages along the zou river and the ouémé stream and to access which parameters mostly affect the estimates of river leakages we applied a methodology that includes the stratigraphic model construction the definition of the model flow domain and boundary conditions the model domain discretization the implementation of hydraulic properties recharge estimation and implementation the steady state model calibration and the implementation of the transient flow model details regarding each of these steps is provided in the following paragraphs 3 1 stratigraphic model construction to develop a stratigraphic model of the system which is close as possible to the field set up we considered the existing geological and geophysical data geological data include geological maps and drilling logs that were obtained from slansky 1962 mmeh 2001 and from several hydrogeological consulting reports some of the drilling logs extends to the bedrock and others are partial boreholes we considered all the drilling logs that reach the bedrock to allow construction of a complete 3d stratigraphic model in addition we considered partial drilling logs that reach the deepest aquifer i e the t c aquifer however for these partial drilling logs we derived the depths to the bedrock from the bedrock altitude map designed by pougnet 1955 and aicard 1959 based on the geophysics investigations gravimetric and seismic soundings they conducted across the region the spatial distribution of the drilling logs used for the stratigraphic model is shown on fig 1 we grouped several adjacent layers similar to clay and marl materials into one main layer representing the clay and marl materials also adjacent layers similar to sand material were grouped into one main sand layer table 2 provides details regarding the layers that are grouped together as a result the sedimentary geologic subsurface is simplified into three distinct stratigraphic layers which are from the bottom to the top a layer representing the turonian coniacian aquifer a layer combining the intermediate clay and marls strata and a layer combining the top quaternary alluvial sediments and the sediments from the continental terminal aquifer boukari and alassane 2007 the intermediate clay and marls strata were combined into one stratigraphic model layer because they are nearly impermeable and behave as an aquitard the alluvial sediments in the ouémé valley and the sediment from the continental terminal aquifer were combined into one stratigraphic model layer since they are of similar geological facies maliki 1993 we used the groundwater modeling systems software gms to construct the stratigraphic model fig 5 we applied the horizon method suggested by lemon and jones 2003 due to its simplicity and efficiency in building the stratigraphic model directly from boreholes data and additional cross sections data we applied the nearest neighbour approach owen et al 1996 tam et al 2014 in gms to interpolate the contact between the stratigraphic model layers the top elevation of the stratigraphic model is the land surface topography created from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm elevation data eros 2002 at 90 m resolution the resulting 3d stratigraphic model is shown on fig 5 and cross sections throughout the stratigraphic model are shown on fig 6 the impermeable bedrock crystalline rocks below the sediment deposits is excluded in this stratigraphic model since it plays no role in terms of groundwater flow 3 2 model flow domain and boundary conditions 3 2 1 flow domain the model flow domain is about 3400 km2 fig 1 and is defined based on the geologic and groundwater divides existing in both the t c aquifer and the top aquifer in detail the boundaries limits are as follow the northern limit it corresponds to the sediment bedrock contact some complex shapes of the sediment in the northern zagnanado plateau fig 1 were not included in the model domain as they are of insignificant thickness 1 5 m and discharge their groundwater through springs as such they are of no significance in terms of regional flow and were not included in the model flow domain the western and eastern limits these limits correspond to the identified groundwater divides in the t c aquifer see fig 7 the south west and south east limits purple lines in fig 1 these limits are positioned along the groundwater divides of the top aquifer boukari 1998 alassane 2004 at these limits different boundary conditions are required for the different layers the top aquifer the adjacent impervious clay and marl materials and the t c aquifer the south central limit the green line in fig 1 this limit is set to cross the quaternary aquifer in the ouémé valley fig 1 also at this limit different types of boundary conditions are required for the quaternary aquifer the impervious clay and marl layer and the deep t c aquifer 3 2 2 boundary conditions with respect to the explanations in the previous section a no flow type of boundary condition is imposed for all layers at the northern western and eastern limits as suggested by kresic 2006 different types of boundary conditions were applied along the southern model limit since at that limit two main aquifers the t c aquifer and the top aquifer and one separating aquitard impermeable layer mainly clay and marl materials are to be treated differently for the top aquifer the south western and south eastern limits corresponds to its groundwater divide hence a no flow type of boundary condition is applied regarding the south central limit and for the quaternary aquifer in the ouémé valley an average value of head fluctuation dirichlet type of boundary condition in this aquifer was implemented for the separating aquitard impervious layer mainly clay and marl materials a no flow type of boundary condition is applied based on the knowledge that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of this material is low 10 4 m d and hence nearly no flow occurs horizontally in this layer for the t c aquifer we considered that prescribing a constant head artesian head at this limit will imply that the artesian heads could never go below the prescribed head value which will obviously not be realistic at a transient flow regime also measuring in the field the fluxes q in fig 8 through this limit of the t c aquifer is not really feasible and temporal variations of these fluxes cannot be practically conceived accurately for these reasons a cauchy type of boundary conditions appears to be more realistic because it avoids that inexact prescribed heads and fluxes at this limit influence the model solutions the different types of boundary conditions at the model limits are summarized in table 3 the model layers introduced in table 3 are explained in the next section 3 3 model discretization we used a finite difference scheme within modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 for the model discretization horizontally square cells size of 300 300 m are implemented and resulted in 283 rows 312 column and a total of 185 194 active cells see fig a2 for the 3d grid model a dimension of 300 m is chosen as lower values will cause lengthy model execution time while higher values coarser model grids could lead to larger errors in the head and flux simulations wildemeersch et al 2014 suggest that for catchments of few hundred square kilometers an element size of the order of 500 m is the best compromise for obtaining good model performance with tractable execution times without significantly increasing prediction uncertainty the option boundary matching within gms jones et al 2002 was used to represent as close as possible the boundaries of the stratigraphic model in the 3 d grid vertically five 05 model layers were defined in details the t c aquifer is subdivided into 3 model layers the clay and marl materials are considered as one model layer and the top aquifer is also considered as one model layer fig a2 the t c aquifer was subdivided into three 03 model layers to account for vertical heterogeneity in the t c aquifer and to allow accurate placement of well screens when required kresic 2006 all the cells within the model boundaries are active cells and were used for simulations 3 4 hydraulic properties 3 4 1 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity for the turonian coniacian aquifer was estimated in previous studies bouzid 1971 igip 1984 burgeap brgm 1994 turkpak international scet tunisie 1991 and at different locations based on pumping tests conducted throughout the study area clay and marl materials in the study areas are characterized by hydraulic conductivity values of about 10 4m d benson and trast 1995 yalo et al 2014 the hydraulic conductivities of the top aquifer are documented in le barbe et al 1993 and boukari 2002 the hydraulic conductivity values of the different stratigraphic layers are summarized in table 4 and considered during the implementation and calibration of the numerical model 3 4 2 conductance parameters the conductance is an expression of the ease with which water flows through a resistance layer e g river bed sediments when using a conceptual model approach in gms the manner in which the conductance term should be computed and entered depends on whether the feature object is a polygon lake for example arc river for example or point spring for example for lakes rivers streams and brooks we defined a conductance based on the average thickness and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the bed sediments of these hydrologic features for rivers streams and brooks we defined a conductance per unit length c o n d u l in eq 1 and for lakes we defined a conductance per unit area c o n d u a in eq 2 depending on the lengths of the river arcs that intersect the grid cells a corresponding accurate conductance value for the concerned grid cell is calculated by multiplying the value of the conductance per unit length by the length of the river arcs similarly the area of the cell covered by the lake polygon is multiplied by the value of the conductance per unit area to obtain the equivalent conductance value for the cells covered by the lake 1 c o n d u l k v b w 2 c o n d u a k v b where k v b and w are respectively the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the bed sediment the thickness of the bed sediment and the width of the river the obtained average k v values from few field measurements thickness of the bed sediments width of the rivers stream brooks as well as the calculated conductances c o n d u l and c o n d u a are summarized in table 5 and were applied in the numerical model 3 5 recharge estimation predominant recharge areas infiltration zones in the model domain were defined based on the surface geological map developed by the istito research breda irb 1987 and lithological information from drilling logs the recharge areas fig 9 are outcropping regions northern of the turonian coniacian aquifer see fig 1 for the top aquifer the whole alluvial plain along the rivers represent a recharge area in regions where clay materials outcrop recharge is hindered and a dense drainage network is found caused by surficial discharge of precipitation in contrast in the recharge areas the drainage networks are absent or less dense in total there are four predominant recharge areas three in the northern regions for the turonian coniacian aquifer and one mainly along the zou river and the ouémé stream for the top aquifer in each of these four recharge areas there is one rainfall station and data from each of these stations allows recharge estimation for the respective recharge areas estimating the recharge rate accurately is crucial but remains complex and difficult in view of different parameters that influence infiltration dieng 2017 in this study we estimated daily groundwater recharge r by first using the penman method penman 1949 1950 to calculate the evapotranspiration then we applied the water budget equation eq 3 the principle of this equation is that it considers that water is held in store as soil moisture δ s in eq 3 which can be increased by rainfall p in eq 3 and depleted by the actual evapotranspiration e a in eq 3 when the soil field capacity δ s is attained excess rainfall is routed to surficial runoff r o f f and to groundwater as recharge so the groundwater recharge could be estimated if data of both the soil field capacity and the runoff are available the actual evapotranspiration is calculated using the weather data available in each of the recharge area for details regarding the actual evapotranspiration calculation the reader is referred to allen et al 1989 and allen et al 1994b 3 p r o f f e a r δ s r p r o f f δ s e a the reliability of the estimated recharge was judged by comparing the groundwater recharge results e g table 6 to both the rainfall and the groundwater level fluctuations observed in the same areas e g fig 10 the location of the piezometers is indicated in fig 9 according to the water table fluctuation method delin et al 2007 higher water level rise reflect higher amounts of groundwater recharge in contrast lower water level rise reflect of lower amounts of groundwater recharge for example from fig 10 it is clear that low recharge occurred in 2015 at zagnanado compared to the other years e g year 2010 since the groundwater level rise is insignificant 0 2 m in 2015 accordingly we would expect the estimated recharge to be low in 2015 the estimated recharge are well in line with this expectation since the estimated recharge is low for the 2015 table 6 in contrast higher recharge is obtained in 2010 table 6 as expected from fig 10 since in 2010 a high groundwater level rise 1 m occurred based on the above comparative groundwater table fluctuation and recharge analysis the estimated groundwater recharge is judged acceptable and were used as input for the numerical model the recharge calculated for the other recharge areas bohicon kétou and bonou are summarized in annex 3 data of soil moisture at field capacity and runoff data required for the recharge calculation in the study area were taken respectively from previous studies azontonde 1991 schuol et al 2008 biao 2017 3 6 groundwater abstractions and discharge according to slansky 1962 there were already since 1950s few hand dug wells in the study area however groundwater abstractions from these few hand dug wells were negligible since they were only for domestic use in addition to this insignificant groundwater abstractions groundwater also discharges through natural springs in the unconfined part of the turonian coniacian aquifer during the period 1986 1987 the first artesian wells were installed in the turonian aquifer since then numerous artesian wells have been installed and constitute continuous and important sources of groundwater discharge of the turonian coniacian aquifer 3 7 surface water recharge groundwater abstractions and discharge implementation the brooks the zou river and the ouémé stream were implemented using the riv package mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 in modflow to simulate the flux into or out of the river through the bed sediment the general head boundary ghb package was used to represent the three existing lakes in the study area the estimated recharge was implemented using the recharge rch package springs were implemented in the model using the drain drn package three drains were also implemented around kétou in layer 05 to account for existing faults that drain the t c aquifer and cause this aquifer to be dry in this sector this is justified as most existing boreholes in this sector are screened in the bedrock and are of low productivity 3 8 steady state model calibration the model computed head both in the turonian coniacian aquifer and the top aquifer was calibrated to the predevelopment period 1986 1987 conditions which corresponds to the period when the first artesian wells started to be installed in the area of study this predevelopment period was considered for the steady state calibration in attempt to limit probable pumping effects on the simulated head and fluxes hand dug wells were not implemented in the steady state model as abstractions from them were insignificant few boreholes that existed in the area were also disregarded for the steady state model for the same reason the fitted parameters are mainly the horizontal hydraulic conductivities of the different stratigraphic layers because these are the less known parameters in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution the recharge though estimated based on field data was also adjusted sensitivity analysis prior to the model calibration indicated that the horizontal hydraulic conductivities and the recharge were the most sensitive parameters to the model computed heads and fluxes hence these two parameters are good candidates to be adjusted hill 1998 the vertical anisotropy van of the hydraulic conductivity was insensitive to the model outputs and was therefore not adjusted during calibration in this study the bed sediment conductances were not adjusted during calibration however the sensitivity of the bed sediment conductances to the computed heads and fluxes was analysed and discussed in the results section of this paper the manual trial and error calibration approach was adopted to allow that different zones of hydraulic properties spatial zonation of the hydraulic properties are defined based on geologic field knowledge and prior information zonation of hydraulic properties is required as hydraulic properties vary in space carrera et al 2005 also the manual calibration approach helps to develop practical understanding of the aquifer behaviour with regard to the physical hydrologic and geologic features that exist in the modeled system the model is calibrated based on the available groundwater head data which were measured in boreholes during installation in 1986 1987 for both the kh horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the recharge we began calibration by defining simple and few sub regions according to the existing hydrologic and geologic features and then we increased slowly the complexity in the sub regions by applying the principle of parsimony yeh and yoon 1981 carrera and neuman 1986 hill 1986 madigan and raftery 1994 hill and tiedeman 2007 the zonal recharge and hydraulic conductivity polygons that lead to a successful calibrated model are shown respectively in figs 11 and 12 the associated values of recharge and hydraulic conductivities are summarized respectively in table 7 and in table 8 the obtained hydraulic conductivities values during calibration for the t c aquifer the clay material and the top aquifer are within the range of values reported by bouzid 1971 igip 1984 burgeap brgm 1994 and turkpak international scet tunisie 1991 the model calibration was judged acceptable when the misfit between the observed and the computed heads was less than 10 m the calibration target doherty 2002 of 10 m meters was defined based on the standard deviation 8 5 m between the srtm dem data and the data at topographic control points from the field in addition to the deviation between the dem and the topographic control points there are different other sources of imprecision that should not be overlooked these are discretization error measurement error regarding the heads and wells screens elevations and interpolations inaccuracy during the stratigraphic model construction also the recharge calculated and implemented in the model is an average value year 1987 of table 6 and table a1 as well as the observed heads since the observed heads are not related to a specific month season so this could be an additional substantial source of misfit between the computed and observed heads in that sense arriving to a perfect calibrated model highly parametrized that attempt too close fits with the observed heads is not required voss 2011 wildemeersch 2012 suggested that when simulating general variation of piezometric heads the adequate objective function to consider for the measurement of the goodness of fit between the observed and the computed heads is the rmse root mean square error see eq 4 the obtained r2 is 0 97 and the rmse is equal to 5 83 m for the turonian coniacian aquifer for the top aquifer the r2 and rmse are respectively 0 6 and 4 54 m also the residuals are in both cases randomly distributed around the 1 1 line fig 13 a and b which is an indication that the model is less likely to systematically underestimate or overestimate the heads 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n h c h o 2 h c a n d h o a r e r e

calibration the transient model was implemented in an attempt to capture the seasonal behaviour behaviour in time of the river leakages in this study the simulation time from january 1988 to october 2011 was chosen because data of rivers levels are available for this period see fig 14 the levels at dome s station fig 14a and at ahlan s station fig 14c were respectively implemented for the reach of the zou river and for the reach of the ouémé stream which is located prior to the junction between the zou river and the ouémé stream the levels at bonou s station fig 14b were implemented for the reach of the ouémé stream which is located after the junction the data of the brooks levels are scarce and vary between 0 and 1 m hence an average value of 0 5 m is set for the brooks also data of the lakes levels are scarce and average values for lake levels were implemented i e 14 m 9 m and 6 m respectively for lake azili lake sele and lake hlan the stress periods were set to be equal to one calendar month with time steps equal to one only one time step per stress period a duration of one month as stress period was judged small enough to capture the seasonal leakage behaviour because the different dry and rainy seasons last for more than one month this resulted in a total of 285 stress periods monthly average river levels recharge and abstraction rates were set for each stress period the storage coefficients implemented for each stratigraphic layer see table 9 was derived from previous studies and the literature bouzid 1971 lohman 1972 the transient model was run with the heads from the calibrated steady state model being the initial heads and was calibrated manually by try and error the transient computed heads were close to the available observed heads at three locations after the first model run except that the computed heads display higher dynamic variability compared to the observed heads fig 15 a in that sense only the storage coefficients were adjusted during calibration and the optimal calibrated values of storage coefficients are summarized in table 9 after calibration the computed heads became much more closer to the observed heads figs 15b and 16 as explained earlier section 3 8 there are different sources of imprecisions in the input data that may affect the misfit between the observed and computed heads so attempting to match the transient computed heads too closely to the transient observed heads is not realistic since the transient computed heads respond to estimated monthly recharge events voss 2011 the calibrated transient model is in good agreement with the known groundwater flow patterns in the study area see figs 16 and 17 the calibrated transient model served to quantify the dynamic river leakages and to access the impact of the conductance hydraulic and storage properties on the quantified river leakages based on the governing groundwater flow equation eq 5 and on the equation for the cauchy boundary condition used to simulate river leakages eq 6 the parameters to assess are the hydraulic conductivities of the three stratigraphic layers ktc kal kclay the storage coefficients specific yield or specific storage i e sy or ss of the same layers and the streambed conductance the vertical hydraulic anisotropy being ten 10 and one 1 respectively for the two aquifers and the clay layer table 7 implies that when varying the horizontal conductivities the vertical conductivities are also varied accordingly based on the knowledge that hydraulic and storage properties in porous medium are often log normally distributed gomez hernandez and gorelick 1989 these properties were varied within the range of one third 1 3 to three 3 times the base values the base values of hydraulic and storage properties were multiplied by 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 and 3 leading to five model run per parameter and per stratigraphic layer to account for possible variation in rivers width and streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity the base values of the streambed conductance were varied within two order of magnitude i e from 0 1 c o n d 0 to 10 c o n d 0 c o n d 0 being the stream bed conductance values from the base model with this the impact that each of these properties has on the computed river leakages was assessed 5 k x 2 h x 2 k y 2 h y 2 k z 2 h z 2 s h t g 6 q c o n d δ h where k h s q c o n d and δ h are

different properties has on the computed leakages for the rest of this paper the term base model and base value will respectively refer to the calibrated transient model and the optimal parameters values from the calibrated transient model 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow budget water budgets zone budgets were calculated for three adjacent sub zones named zone0 zone1 and zone2 of the modeled area zone0 zone1 and zone2 stand respectively for the top aquifer the aquitard clay and the t c aquifer fig 18 b d it should be underlined that a relatively negligible groundwater 0 8 105 m3 d from the t c aquifer zone2 flows upward to the clay and marl layer zone1 see fig 18c and part of it 0 3 105 m3 d see fig 18b continues upward to the top aquifer zone0 this finding is consistent with the conceptual understanding of the modeled system since the t c aquifer is known to be artesian in the southern modeled domain dray et al 1989 achidi et al 2012 kpegli et al 2018 the stationary flow budget fig 18a includes two major inputs direct groundwater recharge from precipitation and rivers infiltration and four major outputs outflows through the southern limit for the top aquifer springs and faults outflows river exfiltration and outflows through the southern limit for t c aquifer combined with lakes exfiltration the total recharge is estimated to be 106 m3 d fig 18a which is shared between the t c aquifer 6 105 m3 d see fig 18d and the top aquifer 4 105 m3 d see fig 18b recharge to the t c aquifer thus represent 60 of the total groundwater recharge of the whole system the total river infiltration downward leakage is 2 4 105 m3 d and more than 83 of this total river infiltration recharge the t c aquifer fig 18a and d the remaining 17 0 3 105 m3 d contributes to the top aquifer recharge therefore rivers contribute to subsurface recharge in terms of outflows from the flow domain river exfiltration upward river leakage represents the most important budget component 6 6 105 m3 d followed by the drains 3 8 105 m3 d representing springs and faults outflows the outflows through the southern limit of the t c aquifer combined with lakes exfiltration 1 8 105 m3 d termed as head dep bounds on fig 18 and the outflows through the southern limit of the top aquifer 0 33 105 m3 d termed as constant head river exfiltration from the t c aquifer appears to be higher 3 6 105 m3 d than the one from the top aquifer 2 8 105 m3 d for the t c aquifer 2 1 105 m3 d gets recharged from the rivers but 3 6 105 m3 d exfiltrate to the surface water in addition river exfiltration upward river leakage is more than 1 4 time greater than river infiltration downward river leakage for both aquifers meaning that rivers remain overall gaining in the flow domain fig 18 this means that for the stationary condition rivers are not predominantly recharging the aquifers however the dynamic of the river leakages especially along the zou river and the ouémé stream needs to be examined to cross check this finding the dynamic behaviour of the leakages along the zou river and ouémé stream is presented in the next section 4 2 dynamic of the computed leakages along the zou river and ouémé stream with regard to the issue of river water loss along the zou and the ouémé stream in the study area le barbe et al 1993 the seasonal river leakage along these rivers was quantified fig 19 along the zou river and the ouémé stream it appears that the leakage is upward groundwater flowing to the river i e gaining stream condition between november and april yearly fig 19 conversely the leakage is mainly downward in periods of june to october of each year november to march and june to october are known to include respectively dry and rainy seasons in the study area meaning that seasonality of the river leakage correlates well with the seasons in the study area the monthly leakage fluxes are comprised between 8 105 and 106 m3 d for the simulated period at the yearly basis it appears that in some years e g 1992 1999 see fig 20 a the upward leakage fluxes are greater compared to the downward leakage fluxes in some other years e g 1988 1991 the upward leakage fluxes are rather less than the downward leakage fluxes this is an indication that along the concerned sections of the zou river and the ouémé stream the direction of the absolute river leakage is not unique throughout the years for the simulation period the differences between the yearly upward and downward leakages are comprised between the 105 and 2 105 m3 d fig 20b compared with the rivers conceptual water budget along the zou river and the ouémé stream see table 1 the differences between the yearly upward and downward leakages fig 20b represent small amounts i e 0 75 0 96 0 35 3 3 and 1 66 of the water losses in 2002 2003 2004 2008 and 2010 respectively for example from the conceptual water budget 6 106 m3 d represents the water loss in the year 2003 however the absolute leakage fluxes are 5 8 104 m3 d i e an absolute infiltration of 0 96 of the water losses the leakages along the zou and ouémé in the study area appear not to be high enough to justify the water losses given the base values from the base model uncertainties in flow parameters hence uncertainties in model results remain so far an issue to consider in hydrological modelling studies delhomme 1979 du et al 2018 ghouili et al 2017 zammouri and ribeiro 2017 in the next section we vary each of the parameters within their possible ranges to assess how these parameters impact the computed river leakages 4 3 impact of the different parameters on the computed leakage 4 3 1 impact of the streambed conductance the streambed conductance was varied within two order of magnitude as indicated in section 3 9 fig 21 shows that throughout the years the absolute upward downward leakage is similar whether the conductance is equal to five times or ten times the base conductance in details only a change of 2 3 i e 0 039 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d and 2 6 i e 0 044 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d occurred when the base conductance is multiplied by five and ten respectively see fig 21 year 2009 this is an indication that a further increase of the conductance will have little influence on the computed leakage conversely when dividing the base conductance by five or ten the absolute leakage is relatively more affected 4 and 8 i e 0 064 105 m3 d and 0 14 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d and could be reversed from upward to downward for negligible absolute leakage fluxes fluxes close to zero e g years 1993 1996 in fig 21 this suggests that the conductance in areas where the bed sediments are locally more resistant could be of relative importance regarding the absolute river leakage fluxes 4 3 2 impact of hydraulic conductivities a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial material kal resulted in an increase of the absolute upward leakage but in a reduction of the absolute downward leakage conversely when the kal is increased the absolute upward leakage is reduced while the downward leakage is increased for example dividing the kal by three only impacted the absolute leakage by 8 i e a change of 0 14 105 m3 d over 1 7 105 m3 d see for example fig 22 a year 2009 it can be inferred that in relatively low kal materials where the range of kal uncertainties is likely to be small kal would have less impact on the computed leakage meaning that detailed characterization in low conductive material would not be necessary however in highly conductive kal materials where the range of kal uncertainty is likely large the impact of kal on absolute leakage would be considerable e g 0 75 105 m3 d over 1 6 105 m3 d meaning 44 change in leakage when multiplying kal by three in 2009 see fig 22a this means that the impact of multiplying the kal by only three is by far greater than when the streambed conductance is multiplied by ten this suggests that compared to the streambed conductance the kal has a greater impact on the computed leakage fig 22b shows that a reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the clay material kclay caused an increase in the absolute upward leakage in details multiplying the kclay by three resulted in a change of 24 of the absolute leakage i e 0 4 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d 2009 which is less compared to the change 44 caused by a multiplication by three of the alluvial conductivity this suggests that the hydraulic conductivity of the clay material has less effect on the computed leakage compared to the conductivity of the alluvial material fig 22c shows that multiplying the hydraulic conductivity of the confined part of the t c aquifer by three has impacted the computed upward leakage only by 12 e i 0 2 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d in 2009 fig 22c a change of 12 is small compared to the impact related to both the alluvial and the clay hydraulic conductivities which are respectively 44 and 24 this illustrates that the hydraulic conductivity of the confined part of the t c aquifer has less influence on the computed leakage than to the alluvial and clay materials regarding the unconfined part of the t c aquifer the impact on leakage of multiplying the base hydraulic conductivities by three is 45 i e 0 76 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d year 2009 see fig 22d this impact appears to be similar to the case of the alluvial aquifer 44 and greater than those of the confined t c aquifer and the clay layer so in terms of hydraulic conductivity of the different materials it appears that the hydraulic conductivities in the alluvial and the unconfined part of the t c aquifer affect the most the computed leakage followed by the clay conductivity the conductivity of the confined part of the t c aquifer appears to be less important than the conductivity of the clay material it is worth noting that the streambed conductance is so far the less influencing factor regarding the computed leakage 4 3 3 impact of storage coefficients the impact of the storage coefficient of the different geological materials is summarized in fig 23 as shown in fig 23a increasing three times the storage coefficient in the confined part of the t c aquifer or dividing it by three has almost no influence on the computed leakage in details the change in the computed leakage is 0 18 i e a variation of 0 003 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d when the base value is multiplied by three regarding the unconfined alluvial material fig 23b variations in the storage coefficient sy caused limited impact on the computed leakage 5 when the base value is divided or multiplied three also the impact of the storage coefficient sy in the unconfined part of the t c aquifer fig 23c on the leakage is limited 5 when dividing the storage coefficient by three in 2009 12 and 15 i e respectively 0 2 105 m3 d and 0 2 105 m3 d over 1 67 105 m3 d represent the changes that occurred in the computed leakage when the base value of the storage coefficient of the clay material is multiplied respectively by one third and three fig 23d year 2009 12 and 15 are relatively high changes compared to the related changes in the alluvial the confined and the unconfined parts of the t c aquifer this suggests that the storage coefficient in the clay layer has a relatively higher impact on the leakages compared to the others it is worth noting that the clay storage coefficient has a greater impact on the leakage compared to the streambed conductance results presented in this section illustrate that with regard to the quantification of river leakages in the studied system the most influencing factors are the hydraulic conductivities in the alluvial and in the unconfined part of the t c aquifers which caused 45 changes in computed leakages then comes the clay s hydraulic conductivity the storage coefficient of the clay and the hydraulic conductivity of the confined part of the t c aquifer which affect the leakage by 12 the storage coefficient of the alluvial material the streambed conductance and the storage coefficient of the unconfined part of the t c aquifer only affect the leakage by 5 the storage coefficient in the confined part of the t c aquifer is the least important factor that affect the leakage it should be emphasized that the streambed conductance is among the least dominant factors when computing the river leakage this finding leads to the conclusion that efforts to measure with high precision streambed conductances with respect to quantifying river leakages are not beneficial this finding is consistent with leake et al 2008 who found that the differences in colorado river depletion calculated with the original riverbed conductance values and with values that are three orders of magnitude lower are relatively minor based on the different parameters ranges applied in this study the highest possible leakage values during the simulation period are 2 105 m3 d absolute downward leakage and 2 105 m3 d absolute upward leakage these values are by far low compared to the water losses from the zou river and the ouémé stream table 1 in details for example in year 2003 the water losses are 60 105 m3 d while the highest possible simulated leakage is 2 105 m3 d which represents only 3 of the water losses in relatively high rainy years with higher groundwater recharge e g year 2008 2010 see fig 22 the leakage is absolutely upward meaning that in these years leakage along the zou river and the ouémé stream have not contributed to the water losses though the water losses are still important in these years 30 105 m3 d see table 1 this finding leads to the conclusion that the observed water loss in the zou and ouémé rivers see table 1 and fig 2 is not likely to be due to their leakage infiltration into the subsurface flow domain 5 conclusion the aim of this study was to quantify river leakage along the zou river and the ouémé stream in attempt to understand the role leakages from these rivers play with regard to their water losses to quantify the leakage we set up a 3d numerical flow model which is based on observations and available data and is close as possible to the field setting the model served to quantify possible ranges of the leakages along the zou river and the ouémé stream given reasonable ranges of the streambed conductance and of the hydraulic and storage properties then the computed leakages were compared with the water losses from the conceptual water budget on the concerned rivers the results show that river leakages along the zou river and the ouémé stream are tiny and represent at most 3 of the water losses this finding leads to the conclusion that the observed water loss in the zou and ouémé rivers is not likely caused by their leakage infiltration into the subsurface flow domain a limitation is that the model in this research does not test the interconnectedness of surface water flows as such further research is required to explore other plausible causes such as river lake marshland interconnections which is beyond the scope of the present research this study strengthens that the streambed conductance is among the properties that has minor influence on the river computed leakages the most dominant factors are the hydraulic conductivities in the alluvial and in the unconfined part of the turonian coniacian aquifer followed by storage coefficient in the clay material this study has allowed to rank the hydraulic and storage properties in their order of importance with regard to the estimation of river leakages the study hence

8486,study region santa ynez river basin santa barbara county california study focus lake cachuma a reservoir on the santa ynez river provides water for over 280 000 residents and agricultural lands of santa barbara county california this area experiences high inter annual precipitation variability which we hypothesize is driven by the presence or absence of a few large precipitation events each year we use daily precipitation observations from 1965 to 2017 to identify extreme precipitation events defined as those exceeding the 90th percentile we examine the role of these events their associated synoptic patterns and the el niño southern oscillation enso in driving inter annual precipitation variability in this basin new hydrological insights for the region on average a wet year features three or more extreme events a normal year 1 2 events and a dry year 0 1 events we identify four distinct synoptic scale weather patterns associated with extreme events and find that 74 of events are associated with atmospheric rivers el niño years tend to have a greater number of extreme events though this relationship is not dependable the reliance on just a few extreme precipitation events and diversity among these events highlights the challenges of seasonal prediction and resource management in this area this novel approach to defining variability on a watershed scale can

between a wet dry or average year is often just a few storms e g burns 2017 as was the case in 2017 however the magnitude of this dependence has not been quantified at a local scale we analyze station

la niña additionally they show that over the period 1931 1995 12 of 21 el niño winters produced above normal 5 days of 90th percentile precipitation while only three of nine la niña winters did the same we investigate precipitation variability in the santa ynez river basin using a unique approach of parsing daily precipitation observations into extreme precipitation events rather than using wet days alone this definition is more representative of colloquially defined storms which relate more directly to local hazard and water management preparations and also agree well with a hydrologic approach of looking at the impact of wet periods rather than individual days e g sbcpwd 2017 with the storm events generated we answer these questions for the santa ynez river basin 1 what is a meaningful way to define normal above normal and below normal wet season precipitation totals 2 what frequency and magnitude of precipitation events best represents inter annual precipitation variability 3 what synoptic patterns are favorable for large storm events and what is the role of atmospheric rivers 4 does enso modify the frequency of extreme precipitation events in a way that offers predictive capabilities the results of this analysis provide quantitative knowledge that can be used by local agencies to communicate regional precipitation variability and impacts to their stakeholders these materials provide a broad understanding of regional drought mechanisms and risk give insight to the challenges of seasonal prediction and augment water managers abilities to understand and plan for impactful events additionally the novel investigation of regional precipitation variability may inspire new insights in ecological geological and hydrologic studies in santa barbara county and serve as a baseline for evaluating change in the future 2 methods 2 1 precipitation data we focus on precipitation during the wet season which we define as october through may period of record daily precipitation data were acquired from long record 50 years stations in santa barbara county public works department s sbcpwd automated local evaluation in real time alert network of automated tipping bucket gauges 1 1 can be accessed online at http www countyofsb org pwd dailyrainfall sbc these data have been quality controlled by sbcpwd and observation time is stated as 0800 local standard time lst throughout the period of record for precipitation days or periods where a particular gauge is not reporting sbcpwd fills the station s record with data from another station of the network of similar elevation and situation within the terrain these stations are not displayed in figure 11 sbcpwd data only reports dates on which precipitation occurred thus it cannot be determined if missing dates are present we make the assumption that the record is complete we also acquired period of record daily precipitation data for long record 50 years stations in the global historical climatology network daily ghcn d menne et al 2012 through sc acis http scacis rcc acis org fig 1 these data have been quality controlled by the national centers for environmental information observation time ranges across the period of record for each station but is generally 800 or 900 lst while the records for the ghcn d stations are fairly complete some missing dates or periods were present to build more complete precipitation events and season totals and in keeping with the approach used by sbcpwd we fill missing data with a nearby station of similar elevation filled data represented the following fraction of non zero precipitation days 0 7 at cachuma 11 at gibralt2ar 21 at los prietos and 3 75 at santa barbara after the filling process only wet seasons with 80 194 of 243 days of complete observations at the ghcn d stations are utilized in subsequent analysis 2 2 identifying precipitation events precipitation events are defined as one or more consecutive days with daily totals 2 54 mm 0 1 in when applicable events are additionally inclusive of days immediately preceding or following the event that have daily totals 2 54 mm marine stratus occurs frequently in santa barbara county dorman and winant 2000 and fog drip can result in measurable precipitation which may amount to as much as 2 54 mm as we are interested in dynamically driven events we set the minimum event threshold and within event threshold at 2 54 mm to avoid investigating periods of very light precipitation and to avoid bridging independent precipitation events the hydrologic definition of precipitation event used here references the space and time distribution of rainfall over a given region ams 2017b this definition agrees with the colloquially defined concept of a storm in the region and informs non meteorological interests such as geology hydrology and ecology the only notable caveat to this methodology occurred during an active storm period in late january 1969 during the event lower elevation stations observed a 1 day break in rainfall while higher elevation stations at jameson and san marcos did not this merged what appear to be two independent storms at those higher elevation stations resulting in a very long 9 day event with an outlying precipitation total 2 3 developing a basin index to describe characteristics of the santa ynez basin collectively rather than by individual station a basin index was created from six stations in the basin cachuma gibraltar los prietos jameson san marcos pass and figueroa fig 1 the index is calculated as a mean across the six stations at a seasonal timescale for each variable explored in this analysis season precipitation total season extreme event total contribution of extreme and non extreme precipitation events this approach is similar to that used in several multi station indices in california e g northern sierra 8 station index http cdec water ca gov snow rain html used by the california department of water resources to support management decisions due to differences in observation time and precipitation event timing across the stations it was not feasible to create the index at the daily time scale the resulting basin index record spans 1965 2017 the year 2006 is missing as cachuma and los prietos did not report sufficient data 2 4 extreme precipitation event definition to determine what magnitude of precipitation event has the best relationship with wet season total precipitation we calculated a variety of percentile values at each station from all precipitation events identified in section 2 2 we focused on values above the 80th percentile as previous work on extreme precipitation and variability used 90th percentile precipitation days cayan et al 1999 and 95th percentile precipitation days dettinger 2016 we calculated the non parametric spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the precipitation contribution from events exceeding each percentile and total wet season precipitation for the basin index precipitation events exceeding the 90th percentile exhibited the strongest relationship with wet season total precipitation ρ 0 88 fig 3 b thus we select this threshold for subsequent analyses of variability precipitation events meeting or exceeding the 90th percentile are hereafter referred to as extreme events in contrast precipitation from non 90th percentile events has a weaker relationship with total wet season precipitation ρ 0 6 fig 3a both correlation coefficients were significant at the 99th percentile confidence interval according to a monte carlo simulation with 10 000 randomized rankings 2 5 lake cachuma storage data lake cachuma monthly storage data were obtained from sbcpwd for the period 1955 2017 we selected june 1 of each year as representative of storage associated with a particular wet season average june 1 storage was calculated by taking the mean of all june 1 observations and departures from that value were calculated for each year june 1 departures from average storage were very similar to those for march 1 april 1 and may 1 all displayed similar patterns of inter annual variability many factors can affect lake storage such as water use downstream releases and state water project deliveries so this is not an accurate representation of storage due to precipitation only however this measure provides useful information on the effects of precipitation variability on lake storage and assists in defining wet and dry years 2 6 defining wet and dry years wet season precipitation totals in the santa ynez basin are highly variable from year to year positively skewed and feature outliers fig 2 to explore differences in the frequency of extreme precipitation events between normal wetter than normal and drier than normal years it is necessary to define these terms in a way that is sensitive to this distribution the national centers for environmental information s 30 year climate normals currently 1981 2010 arguez et al 2012 are a common definition of typical weather conditions with precipitation values exceeding the 30 year normal considered wetter than normal and amounts falling below drier than normal however departures from normal may not be the most telling measure of atypical climate conditions in an environment such as the santa ynez basin which features strong interannual variability as well as multi decadal climate influences e g the pacific decadal oscillation deflorio et al 2013 where a range of normal precipitation may be more appropriate with abnormal values lying outside this range faiers 1988 1989 null 1990 here a median and quartile approach to defining wet dry and normal years faiers 1988 is most consistent with observed impacts of precipitation variability in santa barbara county e g yates 1993 county of santa barbara 1998 us drought monitor 2018 in this approach wet seasons dry seasons occupy the upper lower quartile and normal seasons have totals within the interquartile range 2 7 comparison with atmospheric river catalog extreme events were compared to the rutz et al 2014 atmospheric river ar catalogue which is based on nasa s modern era retrospective analysis merra rienecker et al 2011 merra has a spatial resolution of 0 5 x 0 625 and a temporal resolution of 3 h covering the period 1980 2017 the catalog requires an ar to have integrated water vapor transport ivt a measure combining moisture and wind speed through a vertical column of the atmosphere exceeding 250 kg m 1 s 1 and a length exceeding 2000 km rutz et al 2014 the merra grid point used to diagnose ar conditions in this analysis is shown in fig 1 moist southerly low level flow is often observed during atmospheric river storms in this area e g oakley et al 2017 the selected grid point lies near the crest of the santa ynez mountains south of cachuma and is representative of conditions slightly upstream in the atmospheric sense of the santa ynez basin 2 8 evaluating storm characteristics with atmospheric reanalysis data to evaluate synoptic large scale characteristics of extreme events we utilize the merra reanalysis product rienecker et al 2011 the moderate spatial and temporal resolution is sufficient for revealing synoptic features of interest such as jet placement and moisture transport this is also complementary to the use of a merra based ar catalog atmospheric conditions are evaluated during the merra timestep with the highest ivt value on the wettest day of an extreme event at the cachuma station as the basin index is comprised of seasonal averages of event precipitation and characteristics it does not contain discrete storm events for which such a comparison can be made the investigated variables include geopotential heights and winds at several levels integrated water vapor iwv total water vapor in the atmospheric column and ivt as the precipitation data generally has an observation time of 8 00 9 00 lst 16 17 utc merra timestamps from 15 utc of the previous day to 15 utc of the observation day are considered 2 9 comparison of storm events with enso phase we utilize oceanic niño index oni data for 1950 2017 from the noaa climate prediction center a season is considered to be el niño or la niña when the threshold of 0 5 oni is met for a minimum of five overlapping seasons climate prediction center 2017 each season is also ascribed as weak moderate 0 5 to 1 5 c anomaly or strong 1 5 c anomaly based meeting or exceeding the threshold for three consecutive overlapping three month periods as performed by null 2018 the count of 90th percentile storms for each season is then assigned to the corresponding season in the enso data 3 results and discussion 3 1 variability associated with extreme 90th percentile events the precipitation contribution from extreme events has a strong relationship with season total precipitation ρ 0 88 fig 3b while the relationship with non extreme events and total precipitation is much weaker ρ 0 6 fig 3a these results are similar to dettinger 2016 who finds the wettest 5 of wet days have a relationship of approximately r2 0 8 to 0 9 with total water year precipitation in coastal southern california for the basin index the mean seasonal contribution from non extreme events is 343 mm with a standard deviation of 124 mm for extreme events the mean contribution is 305 mm with a standard deviation of 300 mm and there are on average 1 3 extreme events per year the mean of season precipitation totals is 648 mm with a standard deviation of 360 mm though the mean precipitation contribution of non extreme events is slightly higher the variance among extreme events is much greater and more representative of the considerable variance observed in season precipitation totals partitioning the contributions of precipitation from extreme 90th percentile events and all other precipitation demonstrates the variance driven by the extreme events fig 4 while non 90th percentile precipitation fig 4 blue bars show minimal change from year to year the extreme event contribution fig 4 orange bars shows high inter annual variability examining the 5 year running mean fig 4 bottom helps to further illustrate the role of extreme events in precipitation variability non 90th percentile blue line precipitation stays relatively constant while the orange line representing extreme precipitation contribution oscillates around it the black line showing total precipitation most closely follows the variability in the orange line these results are comparable to dettinger 2016 who observed a similar pattern in an analysis of the top 5 of wettest days in the sacramento and san joaquin river basins of northern and central california 3 2 contribution of 90th percentile storms to wet and dry years using a median quartile approach yields 14 wet 14 dry and 23 normal seasons for the basin index in the oct may 1965 2017 period fig 5 the years distinguished as wet and dry agree well with the impacts on water resources and human activities e g yates 1993 county of santa barbara 1998 united states drought monitor 2018 persistent rather than individual dry years have the greatest impact on cachuma storage for example 2007 stands out as the individual driest year and produces a dip in storage but the largest storage drops occur during the persistent dry periods of 1987 1991 and 2012 2016 fig 5 on average for the basin index there were 3 3 extreme events in a wet year 1 3 in a normal year and 0 5 in a dry year fig 5 bottom panel experiencing a given number of extreme events does not ensure a wet dry or normal year for example 1975 recorded three extreme events but its precipitation total only falls in the normal category however the basin index does not observe any wet years without at least one extreme event nor does it experience any dry years with more than one extreme event the chance of having a wet dry normal season based on number of extreme events occurring in the basin index is calculated by dividing the count of seasons within each extreme event frequency category e g one two three 90th percentile events in a season by the total number of seasons in each precipitation category wet normal dry table 1 as the number of 90th percentile storms in a particular season may be fractional for the basin index values are rounded to the nearest integer by this measure a basin average of approximately four or more 90th percentile events guarantees a wet season if three extreme events occur there is roughly a 50 50 chance of a wet or normal season and no chance of a dry outcome for two events there is a 44 chance of a wet year and 56 chance of a normal year for a single 90th percentile event there is no chance of achieving a wet year a 27 chance of a normal year and a 73 chance of a dry year in summary achieving a certain number of extreme events generally does not ensure a season total places in a certain category wet dry or normal though it does influence the likelihood of each category 3 3 frequency of 90th percentile storms and the el niño southern oscillation enso enso is known to moderate storm activity on the us west coast e g jong et al 2016 and references therein the presence of el niño conditions increase the probability of above average precipitation in southern california and strong el niño conditions shift the probability towards well above average precipitation jong et al 2016 hoell et al 2016 however there are additional influences beyond the strength of el niño conditions that influence seasonal precipitation totals in southern california such as the location of maximum sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the equatorial pacific ocean jong et al 2018 sst patterns across the equatorial pacific siler et al 2017 and the evolution of sst anomalies and their modulation of atmospheric wave trains paek et al 2017 this was the case in 2015 2016 which had strong el niño conditions on par with those of 1997 1998 but failed to produce above normal precipitation in southern california paek et al 2017 siler et al 2017 jong et al 2018 using the oceanic niño index oni we examine the role of enso as a predictor for frequency of the 90th percentile extreme precipitation events evaluated in this analysis as well as enso relationship to wet and dry years in the basin index the sample size available is relatively small though we observe that el niño years typically experience a greater number of extreme events ranging from an average of 1 6 during weak episodes to an average of 2 5 during strong episodes fig 6 a during la niña events the average extreme event count is less ranging from 1 2 events in weak episodes to 1 4 events among strong episodes neutral years were very similar to la niña years observing an average of 1 3 extreme events these results are similar to previous work that demonstrates a greater frequency of 90th percentile precipitation days in southern california during el niño years using the southern oscillation index to categorize enso phase cayan et al 1999 on average el niño years exhibit higher october may precipitation totals than la niña or neutral events for the basin index fig 6b table 2 a much larger fraction of total el niño events fall in the wet category 47 than la niña 18 or neutral 13 years table 2 however 26 of el niño years were dry among them two strong el niño events 1986 87 and 2015 16 while a particular enso phase may tilt the odds in favor of a higher or lower frequency of extreme events and precipitation total it is possible for seasons in all enso phases to observe multiple extreme precipitation events and experience a wet year or 1 extreme event and a dry year on the basis of this historical data analysis enso phase is suggestive though not predictive of how many extreme events will occur and season precipitation total in a warming climate there is uncertainty about how the existing teleconnection patterns will persist or change collins et al 2010 further complicating the use of enso as a predictor for this area 3 4 association between atmospheric rivers and 90th percentile storms ars are often associated with california s largest storms and floods ralph and dettinger 2012 whether or not a storm is associated with an atmospheric river may improve forecasting ability and situational awareness as ivt has been shown to have better predictability than precipitation forecasts for a longer lead time lavers et al 2016 we observe the greatest frequency of extreme events in the january march period fig 7 and significantly fewer in other months in all months ars make up the majority of extreme events however in october march and april we see a larger fraction of non ar extreme events in the spring and autumn seasons the frequency of closed and cutoff low pressure systems areas of closed counter clockwise circulation at mid to upper levels in the atmosphere that are partially or completely detached from the mean westerly jet stream see fig 8 e h tends to peak and may account for this distinction oakley and redmond 2014 in autumn remnants of tropical storms occasionally move through the area and can potentially produce heavy rainfall corbosiero et al 2009 of the 58 storms over the 1980 2017 period for the basin index 43 74 are categorized as ars the forecast or presence of ar conditions provides some indication of the potential for extreme precipitation events in this area however only a small fraction 43 or approximately 10 of the 412 events meeting ar criteria and persisting a minimum of 12 h at the relevant merra grid point fig 1 produced 90th percentile precipitation events while several synoptic features have been shown to control the persistence of ars which in turn influences storm total precipitation payne and magnusdottir 2016 features at finer scales may also help to explain why most ars do not produce 90th percentile precipitation events and some non ar events do previous studies have found strong low level winds orthogonal to terrain and the position of the upper level jet to play a key role in significant southern california storms tarleton and kluck 1994 haynes 2001 oakley et al 2017 and orographic precipitation in general lin et al 2001 stability and blocking also influence precipitation distribution and totals in this region hughes et al 2009 convective bands are also known to occur in this area e g griffith et al 2005 which can produce short duration high intensity rainfall and may not be related to atmospheric river conditions 3 5 synoptic features associated with 90th percentile storms composites of the 53 90th percentile events fig 8a c at the cachuma precipitation gauge reveal several common characteristics first a strong upper level jet positioned such that its left or curved exit an area favorable for upward vertical motions was present in the vicinity of santa barbara county fig 8a second the composite revealed a plume of subtropical moisture into southern california exceeding the common ar criteria of 20 mm iwv and 250 kg m 1 s 1 ivt fig 8b third the composite revealed strong 18 ms 1 on average low level southerly winds impacting santa barbara county fig 8c these conditions are consistent with those found in other analyses on impactful storms in southern california tarleton and kluck 1994 haynes 2001 oakley et al 2017 and are also noted by lin 2001 as being among common characteristics for heavy orographic mountain forced precipitation while the composites are broadly instructive of general storm characteristics they smooth out common synoptic patterns seen among individual events to highlight this variability we separate the events into four categories based on their synoptic patterns using a qualitative classification similar to haynes 2001 individual events are placed into the following categories based on the shape location and orientation of synoptic features class 1 closed low in the vicinity of the us west coast with 500 hpa center north of 37 5 n approximately san francisco bay fig 8d f class 2 closed low in the vicinity of the us west coast with 500 hpa center south of 37 5 n fig 8g i class 3 straight upper level 300 hpa jet across northeastern pacific south of approximately 35 n fig 8j l class 4 open wave trough at 500 hpa in the vicinity of the us west coast fig 8m o variations certainly exist across the individual events placed in each class though grouping them as such provides additional insights beyond the all event composite a closed low off the west coast was a common feature with class 1 and class 2 accounting for 53 of events in agreement with haynes 2001 the high curvature of closed low features is favorable for southerly winds and moisture transport into the region the position of the 500 hpa low is only slightly different between class 1 and class 2 but there is a notable distinction in the moisture source region for class 1 fig 8e the main corridor of moisture transport is between approximately 130 135 w in class 2 fig 8h the main source region is shifted further east to roughly 118 120 w for class 3 fig 8k the straight jet case moisture transport occurred over a broad area from 120 140 w across composite members the position of the upper level jet exit just offshore of southern california is favorable for strong low level southerly flow oriented toward santa barbara county as part of the low level circulation in the jet exit region fig 8l in the open wave case class 4 fig 8n over half of the composite members featured long range moisture transport from the vicinity of hawai i or points east however several of the cases featured very little moisture transport diminishing the signal such that there is not a consistent plume across the region in the composite class 4 exhibited more variability across composite members than the other categories but generally featured a somewhat sharp upper level trough off the west coast fig 8m favorable for low level southerly flow fig 8o while all four synoptic setups shown produced 90th percentile precipitation events each configuration and each individual storm has characteristics that may influence the balance of whether the precipitation received will be more hazardous falling quickly over a short period of time or beneficial occurring over a longer duration for example the cold upper level cores of closed and cutoff low pressure systems in class 1 and class 2 can destabilize the atmosphere resulting in intense convective precipitation abatzoglou 2016 closed lows have also been associated with strong winds and tornados in the nearby los angeles area hales 1985 future research can explore in greater detail the role of synoptic and mesoscale features in the balance of creating hazardous and beneficial precipitation 4 conclusions motivated by the large rise in drought stricken lake cachuma following two large storms in january and february 2017 we quantify a common notion e g burns 2017 that whether the santa ynez river basin experiences a wet normal or dry year hinges upon the presence or absence of a few extreme events we pose a definition of precipitation event and observe that the contribution from 90th percentile events has a strong relationship with inter annual precipitation variability figs 3 and 4 using a quartile approach to define wet dry and normal october may seasons the santa ynez basin on average observes 3 3 90th percentile events in wet years 1 3 in normal years and 0 5 in dry years fig 5 attaining four or more 90th percentile events guarantees a wet year while observing no 90th percentile events guarantees it will not be a wet year for other storm counts the outcomes are mixed table 1 for the period 1980 2017 for which reanalysis data were available 74 of 90th percentile events are associated with atmospheric rivers fig 7 which may provide insight to extreme event forecasting el niño years tend to have greater numbers of 90th percentile events with 2 2 events on average as compared to 1 3 during la niña and neutral years fig 6 however there is considerable variability in storm count among years and enso phase composites of synoptic large scale atmospheric conditions reveal several common features 1 an upper level jet displaced to the south with exit region over the area of interest 2 strong low level southerly winds 3 moisture transport reaching or exceeding atmospheric river thresholds we recognize four distinct synoptic patterns generating these conditions fig 8 images and information from this study can be used in communication strategies by various agencies such as water purveyors and the national weather service understanding how a wet or dry year hinges on a couple of precipitation events can serve as a motivator for people to conserve water and support awareness of drought risks additionally our results highlight seasonal precipitation forecast challenges in this region seasonal to sub seasonal forecasts are based on statistical and dynamical models goddard et al 2001 as seasonal rainfall totals are strongly dependent on a few large storms fig 5 if forecast models do not correctly resolve the strength or occurrence of even one storm it can greatly affect their skill for this region the results of this work support understanding of precipitation variability across a variety of disciplines paleoclimatological geological and ecological research with a dependence on precipitation variability is commonplace along the south coast for example records of sediment flux into the santa barbara channel in the modern era e g inman and jenkins 1999 warrick and milliman 2003 as well as historic sediment records from the santa barbara basin e g hendy et al 2015 are used to evaluate climate variability and frequency of large rainfall runoff events fire occurrence in southern california is tied to prior year rainfall e g westerling et al 2004 and burned area vegetation recovery is strongly controlled by inter annual rainfall patterns e g keeley et al 2005 our results provide further insights for these types of studies by highlighting the frequency of extreme precipitation events over time and their relationship to wet and dry years and enso as well as noting prominent synoptic patterns and their variations climate model predictions suggests increasing aridity and drought frequency in california in the future driven primarily by increasing temperatures and evaporative demand cook et al 2015 a movement towards fewer more intense precipitation events polade et al 2014 dettinger 2016 is also anticipated and our results can serve as a baseline for evaluating future change work stemming from this study will evaluate how observed storm frequency patterns persist or change at the basin scale using downscaled climate model output at a resolution pertinent to the basin scale additionally we can explore changes in the prevalence of various synoptic patterns producing 90th percentile events in climate model output this basin

8486,study region santa ynez river basin santa barbara county california study focus lake cachuma a reservoir on the santa ynez river provides water for over 280 000 residents and agricultural lands of santa barbara county california this area experiences high inter annual precipitation variability which we hypothesize is driven by the presence or absence of a few large precipitation events each year we use daily precipitation observations from 1965 to 2017 to identify extreme precipitation events defined as those exceeding the 90th percentile we examine the role of these events their associated synoptic patterns and the el niño southern oscillation enso in driving inter annual precipitation variability in this basin new hydrological insights for the region on average a wet year features three or more extreme events a normal year 1 2 events and a dry year 0 1 events we identify four distinct synoptic scale weather patterns associated with extreme events and find that 74 of events are associated with atmospheric rivers el niño years tend to have a greater number of extreme events though this relationship is not dependable the reliance on just a few extreme precipitation events and diversity among these events highlights the challenges of seasonal prediction and resource management in this area this novel approach to defining variability on a watershed scale can support ecological geological and hydrological studies as well as regional water resource management keywords lake cachuma southern california precipitation extremes precipitation variability drought water resources 1 introduction lake cachuma a reservoir on the santa ynez river in santa barbara county california gained local and national attention in early 2017 e g serna 2017 following a multi year drought in early january 2017 cachuma storage stood at 8 of capacity and 12 of historical average california department of water resources 2017 nearly shutting off agricultural deliveries and prompting water agencies to utilize other resources in their portfolios e g purchasing water from other agencies two atmospheric river storms featuring narrow corridors of high water vapor transport from the tropics ams 2017a in late january and mid february 2017 provided some relief for the area these events raised the lake level to nearly 50 of capacity by late february without these two large storms those who depend on cachuma for water resources would have been facing dire circumstances individuals with water resource and hydrologic interests in the area often note that the difference between a wet dry or average year is often just a few storms e g burns 2017 as was the case in 2017 however the magnitude of this dependence has not been quantified at a local scale we analyze station data from within the santa ynez river basin to document precipitation variability due to large storms and investigate the associated synoptic meteorological conditions the santa ynez river drains a 2322 km2 area nestled in the transverse ranges of southern california fig 1 the river basin is bounded to the south by the santa ynez mountains 300 1400 m in elevation and to the north by the san rafael mountains 600 2000 m in elevation from westto east the basin increases in elevation from sea level at its terminus near lompoc ca to over 1200 m at its headwaters cachuma is the largest of

precipitation in the santa ynez mountains conil and hall 2006 climatologically precipitation tends to increase with elevation on the southern side of this range hughes et al 2009 this region also commonly experiences short duration high intensity convective precipitation events within the larger scale disturbances oakley et al 2018 several studies have addressed precipitation variability in

precipitation events in the country occur in the transverse ranges ralph and dettinger 2012 additionally the seven wettest days of each year account for more than 80 of the variations in total precipitation in southern california dettinger 2016 total precipitation tends to be higher in southern california during the el niño phase of the el niño southern oscillation enso e g wise 2010 harris and carvalho 2018 while we are not aware of an analysis specific to our study area cayan et al 1999 demonstrate that 90th percentile precipitation days at san diego are more likely during el niño than la niña additionally they show that over the period 1931 1995 12 of 21 el niño winters produced above normal 5 days of 90th percentile precipitation while only three of nine la niña winters did the same we investigate precipitation variability in the santa ynez river basin using a unique approach of parsing daily precipitation observations into extreme precipitation events rather than using wet days alone this definition is more representative of colloquially defined storms which relate more directly to local hazard and water management preparations and also agree well with a hydrologic approach of looking at the impact of wet periods rather than individual days e g sbcpwd 2017 with the storm events generated we answer these questions for the santa ynez river basin 1 what is a meaningful way to define normal above normal and below normal wet season precipitation totals 2 what frequency and magnitude of precipitation events best represents inter annual precipitation variability 3 what synoptic patterns are favorable for large storm events and what is the role of atmospheric rivers 4 does enso modify the frequency of extreme precipitation events in a way that offers predictive capabilities the results of this analysis provide quantitative knowledge that can be used by local agencies to communicate regional precipitation variability and impacts to their stakeholders these materials provide a broad understanding of regional drought mechanisms and risk give insight to the challenges of seasonal prediction and augment water managers abilities to understand and plan for impactful events additionally the novel investigation of regional precipitation variability may inspire new insights in ecological geological and hydrologic studies in santa barbara county and serve as a baseline for evaluating change in the future 2 methods 2 1 precipitation data we focus on precipitation during the wet season which we define as october through may period of record daily precipitation data were acquired from long record 50 years stations in santa barbara county public works department s sbcpwd automated local evaluation in real time alert network of automated tipping bucket gauges 1 1 can be accessed online at http www countyofsb org pwd dailyrainfall sbc these data have been quality controlled by sbcpwd and observation time is stated as 0800 local standard time lst throughout the period of record for precipitation days or periods where a particular gauge is not reporting sbcpwd fills the station s record with data from another station of the network of similar elevation and situation within the terrain these stations are not displayed in figure 11 sbcpwd data only reports dates on which precipitation occurred thus it cannot be determined if missing dates are present we make the assumption that the record is complete we also acquired period of record daily precipitation data for long record 50 years stations in the global historical climatology network daily ghcn d menne et al 2012 through sc acis http scacis rcc acis org fig 1 these data have been quality controlled by the national centers for environmental information observation time ranges across the period of record for each station but is generally 800 or 900 lst while the records for the ghcn d stations are fairly complete some missing dates or periods were present to build more complete precipitation events and season totals and in keeping with the approach used by sbcpwd we fill missing data with a nearby station of similar elevation filled data represented the following fraction of non zero precipitation days 0 7 at cachuma 11 at gibralt2ar 21 at los prietos and 3 75 at santa barbara after the filling process only wet seasons with 80 194 of 243 days of complete observations at the ghcn d stations are utilized in subsequent analysis 2 2 identifying precipitation events precipitation events are defined as one or more consecutive days with daily totals 2 54 mm 0 1 in when applicable events are additionally inclusive of days immediately preceding or following the event that have daily totals 2 54 mm marine stratus occurs frequently in santa barbara county dorman and winant 2000 and fog drip can result in measurable precipitation which may amount to as much as 2 54 mm as we are interested in dynamically driven events we set the minimum event threshold and within event threshold at 2 54 mm to avoid investigating periods of very light precipitation and to avoid bridging independent precipitation events the hydrologic definition of precipitation event used here references the space and time distribution of rainfall over a given region ams 2017b this definition agrees with the colloquially defined concept of a storm in the region and informs non meteorological interests such as geology hydrology and ecology the only notable caveat to this methodology occurred during an active storm period in late january 1969 during the event lower elevation stations observed a 1 day break in rainfall while higher elevation stations at jameson and san marcos did not this merged what appear to be two independent storms at those higher elevation stations resulting in a very long 9 day event with an outlying precipitation total 2 3 developing a basin index to describe characteristics of the santa ynez basin collectively rather than by individual station a basin index was created from six stations in the basin cachuma gibraltar los prietos jameson san marcos pass and figueroa fig 1 the index is calculated as a mean across the six stations at a seasonal timescale for each variable explored in this analysis season precipitation total season extreme event total contribution of extreme and non extreme precipitation events this approach is similar to that used in several multi station indices in california e g northern sierra 8 station index http cdec water ca gov snow rain html used by the california department of water resources to support management decisions due to differences in observation time and precipitation event timing across the stations it was not feasible to create the index at the daily time scale the resulting basin index record spans 1965 2017 the year 2006 is missing as cachuma and los prietos did not report sufficient data 2 4 extreme precipitation event definition to determine what magnitude of precipitation event has the best relationship with wet season total precipitation we calculated a variety of percentile values at each station from all precipitation events identified in section 2 2 we focused on values above the 80th percentile as previous work on extreme precipitation and variability used 90th percentile precipitation days cayan et al 1999 and 95th percentile precipitation days dettinger 2016 we calculated the non parametric spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the precipitation contribution from events exceeding each percentile and total wet season precipitation for the basin index precipitation events exceeding the 90th percentile exhibited the strongest relationship with wet season total precipitation ρ 0 88 fig 3 b thus we select this threshold for subsequent analyses of variability precipitation events meeting or exceeding the 90th percentile are hereafter referred to as extreme events in contrast precipitation from non 90th percentile events has a weaker relationship with total wet season precipitation ρ 0 6 fig 3a both correlation coefficients were significant at the 99th percentile confidence interval according to a monte carlo simulation with 10 000 randomized rankings 2 5 lake cachuma storage data lake cachuma monthly storage data were obtained from sbcpwd for the period 1955 2017 we selected june 1 of each year as representative of storage associated with a particular wet season average june 1 storage was calculated by taking the mean of all june 1 observations and departures from that value were calculated for each year june 1 departures from average storage were very similar to those for march 1 april 1 and may 1 all displayed similar patterns of inter annual variability many factors can affect lake storage such as water use downstream releases and state water project deliveries so this is not an accurate representation of storage due to precipitation only however this measure provides useful information on the effects of precipitation variability on lake storage and assists in defining wet and dry years 2 6 defining wet and dry years wet season precipitation totals in the santa ynez basin are highly variable from year to year positively skewed and feature outliers fig 2 to explore differences in the frequency of extreme precipitation events between normal wetter than normal and drier than normal years it is necessary to define these terms in a way that is sensitive to this distribution the national centers for environmental information s 30 year climate normals currently 1981 2010 arguez et al 2012 are a common definition of typical weather conditions with precipitation values exceeding the 30 year normal considered wetter than normal and amounts falling below drier than normal however departures from normal may not be the most telling measure of atypical climate conditions in an environment such as the santa ynez basin which features strong interannual variability as well as multi decadal climate influences e g the pacific decadal oscillation deflorio et al 2013 where a range of normal precipitation may be more appropriate with abnormal values lying outside this range faiers 1988 1989 null 1990 here a median and quartile approach to defining wet dry and normal years faiers 1988 is most consistent with observed impacts of precipitation variability in santa barbara county e g yates 1993 county of santa barbara 1998 us drought monitor 2018 in this approach wet seasons dry seasons occupy the upper lower quartile and normal seasons have totals within the interquartile range 2 7 comparison with atmospheric river catalog extreme events were compared to the rutz et al 2014 atmospheric river ar catalogue which is based on nasa s modern era retrospective analysis merra rienecker et al 2011 merra has a spatial resolution of 0 5 x 0 625 and a temporal resolution of 3 h covering the period 1980 2017 the catalog requires an ar to have integrated water vapor transport ivt a measure combining moisture and wind speed through a vertical column of the atmosphere exceeding 250 kg m 1 s 1 and a length exceeding 2000 km rutz et al 2014 the merra grid point used to diagnose ar conditions in this analysis is shown in fig 1 moist southerly low level flow is often observed during atmospheric river storms in this area e g oakley et al 2017 the selected grid point lies near the crest of the santa ynez mountains south of cachuma and is representative of conditions slightly upstream in the atmospheric sense of the santa ynez basin 2 8 evaluating storm characteristics with atmospheric reanalysis data to evaluate synoptic large scale characteristics of extreme events we utilize the merra reanalysis product rienecker et al 2011 the moderate spatial and temporal resolution is sufficient for revealing synoptic features of interest such as jet placement and moisture transport this is also complementary to the use of a merra based ar catalog atmospheric conditions are evaluated during the merra timestep with the highest ivt value on the wettest day of an extreme event at the cachuma station as the basin index is comprised of seasonal averages of event precipitation and characteristics it does not contain discrete storm events for which such a comparison can be made the investigated variables include geopotential heights and winds at several levels integrated water vapor iwv total water vapor in the atmospheric column and ivt as the precipitation data generally has an observation time of 8 00 9 00 lst 16 17 utc merra timestamps from 15 utc of the previous day to 15 utc of the observation day are considered 2 9 comparison of storm events with enso phase we utilize oceanic niño index oni data for 1950 2017 from the noaa climate prediction center a season is considered to be el niño or la niña when the threshold of 0 5 oni is met for a minimum of five overlapping seasons climate prediction center 2017 each season is also ascribed as weak moderate 0 5 to 1 5 c anomaly or strong 1 5 c anomaly based meeting or exceeding the threshold for three consecutive overlapping three month periods as performed by null 2018 the count of 90th percentile storms for each season is then assigned to the corresponding season in the enso data 3 results and discussion 3 1 variability associated with extreme 90th percentile events the precipitation contribution from extreme events has a strong relationship with season total precipitation ρ 0 88 fig 3b while the relationship with non extreme events and total precipitation is much weaker ρ 0 6 fig 3a these results are similar to dettinger 2016 who finds the wettest 5 of wet days have a relationship of approximately r2 0 8 to 0 9 with total water year precipitation in coastal southern california for the basin index the mean seasonal contribution from non extreme events is 343 mm with a standard deviation of 124 mm for extreme events the mean contribution is 305 mm with a standard deviation of 300 mm and there are on average 1 3 extreme events per year the mean of season precipitation totals is 648 mm with a standard deviation of 360 mm though the mean precipitation contribution of non extreme events is slightly higher the variance among extreme events is much greater and more representative of the considerable variance observed in season precipitation totals partitioning the contributions of precipitation from extreme 90th percentile events and all other precipitation demonstrates the variance driven by the extreme events fig 4 while non 90th percentile precipitation fig 4 blue bars show minimal change from year to year the extreme event contribution fig 4 orange bars shows high inter annual variability examining the 5 year running mean fig 4 bottom helps to further illustrate the role of extreme events in precipitation variability non 90th percentile blue line precipitation stays relatively constant while the orange line representing extreme precipitation contribution oscillates around it the black line showing total precipitation most closely follows the variability in the orange line these results are comparable to dettinger 2016 who observed a similar pattern in an analysis of the top 5 of wettest days in the sacramento and san joaquin river basins of northern and central california 3 2 contribution of 90th percentile storms to wet and dry years using a median quartile approach yields 14 wet 14 dry and 23 normal seasons for the basin index in the oct may 1965 2017 period fig 5 the years distinguished as wet and dry agree well with the impacts on water resources and human activities e g yates 1993 county of santa barbara 1998 united states drought monitor 2018 persistent rather than individual dry years have the greatest impact on cachuma storage for example 2007 stands out as the individual driest year and produces a dip in storage but the largest storage drops occur during the persistent dry periods of 1987 1991 and 2012 2016 fig 5 on average for the basin index there were 3 3 extreme events in a wet year 1 3 in a normal year and 0 5 in a dry year fig 5 bottom panel experiencing a given number of extreme events does not ensure a wet dry or normal year for example 1975 recorded three extreme events but its precipitation total only falls in the normal category however the basin index does not observe any wet years without at least one extreme event nor does it experience any dry years with more than one extreme event the chance of having a wet dry normal season based on number of extreme events occurring in the basin index is calculated by dividing the count of seasons within each extreme event frequency category e g one two three 90th percentile events in a season by the total number of seasons in each precipitation category wet normal dry table 1 as the number of 90th percentile storms in a particular season may be fractional for the basin index values are rounded to the nearest integer by this measure a basin average of approximately four or more 90th percentile events guarantees a wet season if three extreme events occur there is roughly a 50 50 chance of a wet or normal season and no chance of a dry outcome for two events there is a 44 chance of a wet year and 56 chance of a normal year for a single 90th percentile event there is no chance of achieving a wet year a 27 chance of a normal year and a 73 chance of a dry year in summary achieving a certain number of extreme events generally does not ensure a season total places in a certain category wet dry or normal though it does influence the likelihood of each category 3 3 frequency of 90th percentile storms and the el niño southern oscillation enso enso is known to moderate storm activity on the us west coast e g jong et al 2016 and references therein the presence of el niño conditions increase the probability of above average precipitation in southern california and strong el niño conditions shift the probability towards well above average precipitation jong et al 2016 hoell et al 2016 however there are additional influences beyond the strength of el niño conditions that influence seasonal precipitation totals in southern california such as the location of maximum sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the equatorial pacific ocean jong et al 2018 sst patterns across the equatorial pacific siler et al 2017 and the evolution of sst anomalies and their modulation of atmospheric wave trains paek et al 2017 this was the case in 2015 2016 which had strong el niño conditions on par with those of 1997 1998 but failed to produce above normal precipitation in southern california paek et al 2017 siler et al 2017 jong et al 2018 using the oceanic niño index oni we examine the role of enso as a predictor for frequency of the 90th percentile extreme precipitation events evaluated in this analysis as well as enso relationship to wet and dry years in the basin index the sample size available is relatively small though we observe that el niño years typically experience a greater number of extreme events ranging from an average of 1 6 during weak episodes to an average of 2 5 during strong episodes fig 6 a during la niña events the average extreme event count is less ranging from 1 2 events in weak episodes to 1 4 events among strong episodes neutral years were very similar to la niña years observing an average of 1 3 extreme events these results are similar to previous work that demonstrates a greater frequency of 90th percentile precipitation days in southern california during el niño years using the southern oscillation index to categorize enso phase cayan et al 1999 on average el niño years exhibit higher october may precipitation totals than la niña or neutral events for the basin index fig 6b table 2 a much larger fraction of total el niño events fall in the wet category 47 than la niña 18 or neutral 13 years table 2 however 26 of el niño years were dry among them two strong el niño events 1986 87 and 2015 16 while a particular enso phase may tilt the odds in favor of a higher or lower frequency of extreme events and precipitation total it is possible for seasons in all enso phases to observe multiple extreme precipitation events and experience a wet year or 1 extreme event and a dry year on the basis of this historical data analysis enso phase is suggestive though not predictive of how many extreme events will occur and season precipitation total in a warming climate there is uncertainty about how the existing teleconnection patterns will persist or change collins et al 2010 further complicating the use of enso as a predictor for this area 3 4 association between atmospheric rivers and 90th percentile storms ars are often associated with california s largest storms and floods ralph and dettinger 2012 whether or not a storm is associated with an atmospheric river may improve forecasting ability and situational awareness as ivt has been shown to have better predictability than precipitation forecasts for a longer lead time lavers et al 2016 we observe the greatest frequency of extreme events in the january march period fig 7 and significantly fewer in other months in all months ars make up the majority of extreme events however in october march and april we see a larger fraction of non ar extreme events in the spring and autumn seasons the frequency of closed and cutoff low pressure systems areas of closed counter clockwise circulation at mid to upper levels in the atmosphere that are partially or completely detached from the mean westerly jet stream see fig 8 e h tends to peak and may account for this distinction oakley and redmond 2014 in autumn remnants of tropical storms occasionally move through the area and can potentially produce heavy rainfall corbosiero et al 2009 of the 58 storms over the 1980 2017 period for the basin index 43 74 are categorized as ars the forecast or presence of ar conditions provides some indication of the potential for extreme precipitation events in this area however only a small fraction 43 or approximately 10 of the 412 events meeting ar criteria and persisting a minimum of 12 h at the relevant merra grid point fig 1 produced 90th percentile precipitation events while several synoptic features have been shown to control the persistence of ars which in turn influences storm total precipitation payne and magnusdottir 2016 features at finer scales may also help to explain why most ars do not produce 90th percentile precipitation events and some non ar events do previous studies have found strong low level winds orthogonal to terrain and the position of the upper level jet to play a key role in significant southern california storms tarleton and kluck 1994 haynes 2001 oakley et al 2017 and orographic precipitation in general lin et al 2001 stability and blocking also influence precipitation distribution and totals in this region hughes et al 2009 convective bands are also known to occur in this area e g griffith et al 2005 which can produce short duration high intensity rainfall and may not be related to atmospheric river conditions 3 5 synoptic features associated with 90th percentile storms composites of the 53 90th percentile events fig 8a c at the cachuma precipitation gauge reveal several common characteristics first a strong upper level jet positioned such that its left or curved exit an area favorable for upward vertical motions was present in the vicinity of santa barbara county fig 8a second the composite revealed a plume of subtropical moisture into southern california exceeding the common ar criteria of 20 mm iwv and 250 kg m 1 s 1 ivt fig 8b third the composite revealed strong 18 ms 1 on average low level southerly winds impacting santa barbara county fig 8c these conditions are consistent with those found in other analyses on impactful storms in southern california tarleton and kluck 1994 haynes 2001 oakley et al 2017 and are also noted by lin 2001 as being among common characteristics for heavy orographic mountain forced precipitation while the composites are broadly instructive of general storm characteristics they smooth out common synoptic patterns seen among individual events to highlight this variability we separate the events into four categories based on their synoptic patterns using a qualitative classification similar to haynes 2001 individual events are placed into the following categories based on the shape location and orientation of synoptic features class 1 closed low in the vicinity of the us west coast with 500 hpa center north of 37 5 n approximately san francisco bay fig 8d f class 2 closed low in the vicinity of the us west coast with 500 hpa center south of 37 5 n fig 8g i class 3 straight upper level 300 hpa jet across northeastern pacific south of approximately 35 n fig 8j l class 4 open wave trough at 500 hpa in the vicinity of the us west coast fig 8m o variations certainly exist across the individual events placed in each class though grouping them as such provides additional insights beyond the all event composite a closed low off the west coast was a common feature with class 1 and class 2 accounting for 53 of events in agreement with haynes 2001 the high curvature of closed low features is favorable for southerly winds and moisture transport into the region the position of the 500 hpa low is only slightly different between class 1 and class 2 but there is a notable distinction in the moisture source region for class 1 fig 8e the main corridor of moisture transport is between approximately 130 135 w in class 2 fig 8h the main source region is shifted further east to roughly 118 120 w for class 3 fig 8k the straight jet case moisture transport occurred over a broad area from 120 140 w across composite members the position of the upper level jet exit just offshore of southern california is favorable for strong low level southerly flow oriented toward santa barbara county as part of the low level circulation in the jet exit region fig 8l in the open wave case class 4 fig 8n over half of the composite members featured long range moisture transport from the vicinity of hawai i or points east however several of the cases featured very little moisture transport diminishing the signal such that there is not a consistent plume across the region in the composite class 4 exhibited more variability across composite members than the other categories but generally featured a somewhat sharp upper level trough off the west coast fig 8m favorable for low level southerly flow fig 8o while all four synoptic setups shown produced 90th percentile precipitation events each configuration and each individual storm has characteristics that may influence the balance of whether the precipitation received will be more hazardous falling quickly over a short period of time or beneficial occurring over a longer duration for example the cold upper level cores of closed and cutoff low pressure systems in class 1 and class 2 can destabilize the atmosphere resulting in intense convective precipitation abatzoglou 2016 closed lows have also been associated with strong winds and tornados in the nearby los angeles area hales 1985 future research can explore in greater detail the role of synoptic and mesoscale features in the balance of creating hazardous and beneficial precipitation 4 conclusions motivated by the large rise in drought stricken lake cachuma following two large storms in january and february 2017 we quantify a common notion e g burns 2017 that whether the santa ynez river basin experiences a wet normal or dry year hinges upon the presence or absence of a few extreme events we pose a definition of precipitation event and observe that the contribution from 90th percentile events has a strong relationship with inter annual precipitation variability figs 3 and 4 using a quartile approach to define wet dry and normal october may seasons the santa ynez basin on average observes 3 3 90th percentile events in wet years 1 3 in normal years and 0 5 in dry years fig 5 attaining four or more 90th percentile events guarantees a wet year while observing no 90th percentile events guarantees it will not be a wet year for other storm counts the outcomes are mixed table 1 for the period 1980 2017 for which reanalysis data were available 74 of 90th percentile events are associated with atmospheric rivers fig 7 which may provide insight to extreme event forecasting el niño years tend to have greater numbers of 90th percentile events with 2 2 events on average as compared to 1 3 during la niña and neutral years fig 6 however there is considerable variability in storm count among years and enso phase composites of synoptic large scale atmospheric conditions reveal several common features 1 an upper level jet displaced to the south with exit region over the area of interest 2 strong low level southerly winds 3 moisture transport reaching or exceeding atmospheric river thresholds we recognize four distinct synoptic patterns generating these conditions fig 8 images and information from this study can be used in communication strategies by various agencies such as water purveyors and the national weather service understanding how a wet or dry year hinges on a couple of precipitation events can serve as a motivator for people to conserve water and support awareness of drought risks additionally our results highlight seasonal precipitation forecast challenges in this region seasonal to sub seasonal forecasts are based on statistical and dynamical models goddard et al 2001 as seasonal rainfall totals are strongly dependent on a few large storms fig 5 if forecast models do not correctly resolve the strength or occurrence of even one storm it can greatly affect their skill for this region the results of this work support understanding of precipitation variability across a variety of disciplines paleoclimatological geological and ecological research with a dependence on precipitation variability is commonplace along the south coast for example records of sediment flux into the santa barbara channel in the modern era e g inman and jenkins 1999 warrick and milliman 2003 as well as historic sediment records from the santa barbara basin e g hendy et al 2015 are used to evaluate climate variability and frequency of large rainfall runoff events fire occurrence in southern california is tied to prior year rainfall e g westerling et al 2004 and burned area vegetation recovery is strongly controlled by inter annual rainfall patterns e g keeley et al 2005 our results provide further insights for these types of studies by highlighting the frequency of extreme precipitation events over time and their relationship to wet and dry years and enso as well as noting prominent synoptic patterns and their variations climate model predictions suggests increasing aridity and drought frequency in california in the future driven primarily by increasing temperatures and evaporative demand cook et al 2015 a movement towards fewer more intense precipitation events polade et al 2014 dettinger 2016 is also anticipated and our results can serve as a baseline for evaluating future change work stemming from this study will evaluate how observed storm frequency patterns persist or change at the basin scale using downscaled climate model output at a resolution pertinent to the basin scale additionally we can explore changes in the prevalence of various synoptic patterns producing 90th percentile events in climate model output this basin

groot letaba river that flows through kruger national park into the olifants river forming part of the transboundary limpopo basin the upper reaches of the molototsi catchment are hilly with populated valleys and forested slopes approximately 70 km2 of these upper reaches lie upstream of the modjadji dam which was constructed in 1997 with a capacity of 8 4 mm3 to supply potable water to the groot letaba municipal area dwaf 2010 downstream of the dam are flat sparsely populated plains supporting a mopane veld vegetation scrub and bushland population centres and agriculture becoming sparser in the drier east away from the mountains a pipeline is under construction to supply potable water from the nandoni dam in a catchment to the north to the sparse villages ringwood 2016 these villages have no sewage systems and may represent a significant source of groundwater pollution mopani 2017a the catchment is ungauged with the exception of an 18 month period during dam construction though data are available from dws recording modjadji dam releases dam releases are via a spillway when the reservoir exceeds full capacity and have occurred in nine of the 21 years from 1997 to 2018 no release has occurred since april 2014 to june 2018 agriculture in south africa is dominated by a corporate industrial structure with large scale commercial agriculture producing over 90 of marketed food greenberg 2013 recent agricultural policies focus on the importance of subsistence agriculture recognising its contribution to food security and poverty alleviation baiphethi and jacobs 2009 within mopani district only 6 7 of land is designated as arable of which 43 is under irrigation mopani 2017b the most important crops in terms of monetary value are citrus and subtropical fruits e g mango and banana with several irrigation schemes in the region utilising water supplied by dams on the letaba river there are no such large irrigation schemes within the molototsi catchment rather the farms are small and largely non mechanised physical measurement of a sample of 142 farms within the catchment using google earth reveals a median size of 4 8 ha and a 10th to 90th percentile range of 0 9 17 7 ha most of these farms are run by cooperatives with permission to farm communal lands governed under the traditional leadership and governance framework act 6 2005 discussions with local farmers revealed that most of these cooperative farms irrigate crops with water obtained from boreholes drilled by dws however riparian farms often utilise water from sand rivers even if they have a borehole sand river abstraction points include simple hand dug pits open brick lined wells fig 2 and buried metal tanks furrow and drip irrigation systems dominate using diesel pumps use of electric submersible pumps is rare due to a general lack of rural electrification crops cultivated for local market in addition to domestic subsistence use include okra courgettes tomatoes maize chili peppers amaranthus and fruits such as mango and watermelon the climate of this region of southern africa is categorised as hot semi arid according to the köppen geiger climate classification system peel et al 2007 the region experiences a single rainfall season during the summer months of november to march that is characterised by high interannual variability and occasional torrential rainfall potential evapotranspiration greatly exceeds precipitation droughts are regular phenomena often coinciding with el niño southern oscillation enso periods lindesay 1988 cook et al 2004 reason et al 2005 severe droughts in the past in limpopo have resulted in crop failure and economic loss trambauer et al 2014 limpopo suffered a period of reduced rainfall from around 2012 culminating in the major drought in 2016 maponya and mpandeli 2016 sunday times 2016 this is affirmed by dws rainfall and dam status data the regional air circulation is governed by high pressure cells located across the northern part of botswana and south africa that interact with low pressure cells from the antarctic besides warm air masses generated from the southern indian ocean abiye 2016 a distinct rainfall gradient is observed between the catchment headwaters in the west and the lowveld to the east in the west a dws rain gauge at modjadji dam measured mean annual rainfall for 1998 2017 of 1219 mm no formal rain gauges are sited in the east of the catchment though a farmer monitored rain gauge close to the study site recorded a mean annual rainfall from 2006 to 2017 of 430 mm the geology of study site is described by holland 2011 and witthüser et al 2011 archaean crystalline basement rocks dominate the regional geology fig 3 these being some of the oldest rocks on earth with ages up to 3600 ma kramers et al 2007 the hydrogeologically significant ventersdorp related mafic dykes represented as structural lines in fig 3 were intruded around 2700 ma ago ernst 2014 the ne sw trending structures clearly visible on satellite imagery and on aeromagnetic maps relate to the position of this region within the metamorphic limpopo fold belt the limpopo belt is considered to be the earliest identified himalaya type orogeny formed when the zimbabwe and kaapvaal cratons collided around 2600 ma ago zhao et al 2000 a geological cross section of the study site fig 4 shows boreholes drilled where geophysical surveys identified dykes to exploit groundwater within zones of enhanced fracturing at the dyke country rock margins the molototsi is typical of ephemeral sand rivers throughout the limpopo region a 1300 m long reach of its course was selected for study this focus study site fig 5 was chosen due to the presence of a large number of boreholes and a riverbed well the latter used for small scale irrigation the molototsi sand river at the study site is considered typical of the landform in terms of geometry gradient and geology 3 methodology 3 1 groundwater levels groundwater levels were monitored to assess the relationship between deep and shallow groundwater three boreholes were drilled by dws at the study site to 120 mbgl metres below ground level in july august 2016 two of these boreholes h14 1702 and h14 1703 were equipped with solinst pressure transducers to monitor groundwater levels at hourly intervals water levels in the riverbed well and the other boreholes were monitored using a manual dip meter approximately every three months to may 2017 3 2 aquifer properties four methods of hydraulic conductivity estimation were applied to the sand river in may 2017 test pumping of the riverbed well falling head permeameter tests grain size analysis also for porosity and salt dilution tests two pumping tests were undertaken by measuring drawdown and recovery with a pressure transducer logging water levels at 30 s intervals in the riverbed well fig 2 during daily abstraction periods 3 4 h for irrigation the well of nominal diameter of 4 m is lined with brick lining to 1 2 m with a cone shaped base below the brick lining where the pump lies 1 m below the rest water level located at 0 5 mbgl an abstraction rate of 1 l s was determined using the farmer s flow meter drawdown data were analysed using the papadopulos and cooper 1967 method with aquiferwin32 software esi 2007 while recovery was analysed manually by the barker and herbert 1989 method using generated nomograms these methods were specifically developed for application to data from large diameter wells where well bore storage is considered falling head permeameter tests were conducted at 12 sites in the sand river test sites were installed by excavating pits into the sand to the water table then inserting a plain open ended tube 510 mm long and 43 mm diameter halfway into the riverbed the test involved filling the tube with water so that the falling water level rate could be measured by a pressure transducer until equilibrium is achieved testing sites were chosen to measure falling head rates within a range of alluvial grain sizes and positions within the channel including coarse clean sand in active central channel gravel bars and silty lee of mid channel outcrop the vertical hydraulic conductivity was estimated using the hvorslev 1951 method and application of the darcy equation as described by chen 2000 five unconsolidated sand samples from the sand river were collected and analysed in the laboratory for porosity and grain size distribution through mechanical sieving there are multiple methods available to estimate hydraulic conductivity from grain size distributions the hydrogeosievexl program presented by devlin 2015 computes 15 of these methods and was applied to the five grain size analyses six salt dilution tests were conducted to assess groundwater flow velocities each test consisted of excavating a pit in the sands to the water table installing a slotted tube with a bottom end cap piezometer 510 mm long and 43 mm diameter into the saturated river sand and adding 150 g of table salt following solution of salt through agitation the rate of decline in electrical conductivity ec with dissolution due to groundwater throughflow was monitored for an hour with an ec sonde within the piezometer four more pits were excavated around each testing site where the background salinity was measured testing and analysis followed the methodology presented by davies et al 1998 who applied this test to sand rivers in botswana 3 3 aquifer thickness a crucial aquifer characteristic of sand rivers is aquifer thickness i e saturated sand depth for estimation of groundwater storage methods of sand depth assessment applied included trial pits probing and geophysical surveys trial pits were manually excavated in the sand river to determine depth to the water table and the nature of the sediment infill while conducting falling head permeameter and salt dilution tests and while sampling alluvial sands and groundwater additionally an excavator mining sand for road construction was utilised to excavate trial pits to the base of the alluvial sands probing involves inserting usually by physically hammering a metal rod into the sands and is the most accurate method of determining depth to bedrock probing in this case employed a dynamic cone penetrometer dcp such testing was conducted as part of a separate civil engineering project to assess the strength and thickness of subsurface layers geophysical investigations were conducted by dws in may 2017 dws initially conducted a simultaneous magnetometer and em34 survey in the centre of the channel along a 1300 m reach followed by longitudinal and vertical resistivity surveys fig 5 magnetometer and em34 surveys are conducted by dws when attempting to locate dykes within deep bedrock geology and while being unable to estimate sand thickness could identify dykes subcropping within the alluvial sands a model g5 proton memory magnetometer geotron south africa was used to measure ground magnetic flux density at 10 m intervals an em34 geonics ltd ontario canada was used to measure subsurface apparent conductivity with a coil spacing of 20 m the equipment was operated in two dipole orientations horizontal vertical coils for identifying vertical structures at shallower depths and vertical horizontal coils for horizontal structures at deeper depths the effective investigation depths for the two dipole orientations are approximately 0 75 and 1 5 times the intercoil spacing respectively mcneill 1983 em34 measures the bulk conductivity of the ground the measurements representing a weighted mean related to depth of the formations within the range of investigation macdonald et al 2001 the resistivity system geotech environmental equipment inc colorado usa was operated using a schlumberger array with a half distance between current electrodes ab 2 of 30 m for the longitudinal survey at this electrode spacing each reading gives the bulk resistivity averaged though biased towards shallower depths over a depth of approximately 40 m van nostrand and cook 1966 this longitudinal resistivity survey could indicate the consistency of sand aquifer thickness and identify the locations of subcropping dykes five cross channel vertical electrical sounding ves surveys were conducted using a schlumberger array this expanding array system is used to determine the thickness of the upper dry zone by recognising the resistivity contrast between it and the underlying saturated zone similarly the depth to bedrock is recognised by the marked resistivity contrast between solid rock and saturated sands such a survey gives a 1d resistivity profile centred on the centre of the river channel the ves data electrode spacing and apparent resistivity was entered into res1d an open source computer program developed by geotomo software malaysia loke 2001 res1d computes an estimate of the number of layers their thickness and resistivity for each profile giving the lowest root mean square rms error 3 4 hydrochemistry groundwater samples were collected on three occasions in the molototsi area in february 2012 october 2015 and january 2017 on site analysis involved measurement of ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec while samples were filtered and acidified prior to transport to a laboratory for major ion analysis utilising dionex ion chromatography anions and atomic absorption spectroscopy cations groundwater samples were collected after purging boreholes with a portable water pump or the irrigation pump additionally twenty water samples for stable isotope analysis δ18o and δ2h were collected in may 2017 from sites in the sand river a borehole surface water and rainwater samples were collected in nalgene vials filled to the rim with caps sealed with tape 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater levels fig 6 shows that logged borehole groundwater levels are stable with little to no identifiable response to rainfall this is despite the occurrence of four rainfall events with daily totals 30 mm one of which had a daily total of 60 mm nor does there appear to be a correlation between the borehole groundwater levels and the water level in the sand river the groundwater level in boreholes h14 1701 and duv1 also showed little seasonal variation with depths to groundwater stable at 13 and 15 mbgl these levels are 5 8 m deeper than the observed water table depth in the sand river therefore there is no groundwater discharge into the sand river i e it is not a gaining stream the molototsi is also very unlikely to be a losing stream or the sand river water table would not settle at the observed depth of 1 m and a response would likely be seen in the borehole groundwater levels to surface water flows the groundwater levels are suggestive of a disconnected stream where an unsaturated zone exists between the stream and deeper groundwater it is noted that on the cross section in fig 4 the groundwater level in the boreholes is interpolated as a piezometric surface rather than a water table the drillers logs reported in fig 5 and presented in the supplementary material fig s1 stated that water strikes occurred at greater depths than the rest water level usually at the locations of fractured layers the initial water strikes were observed at depths of 16 31 mbgl and rest water levels are 7 18 mbgl weathered and fractured layers commonly occur above the water strikes within the level of the resting groundwater although water was not encountered at the time of drilling through these materials it seems likely that groundwater is present only in fractures and is therefore much deeper approximately 20 m below the base of the sand river than the observed water levels in the boreholes suggests the cause of the driving head leading groundwater to rise up the boreholes may be a connection with the ne sw trending lineaments shown in fig 3 that extend to the wetter mountains and recharge zone to the southwest thus creating a semi confined aquifer system the groundwater level in the sand river varied from a maximum depth of 1 2 mbgl in october 2016 following two years of drought to above surface during occasional flow events the proximity of the water table to the surface in october 2016 following one of the worst droughts on record baudoin et al 2017 illustrates the potential of the sand river aquifer for productive use wipplinger 1958 and nord 1985 are the commonly cited sources of the maximum evaporation extinction depth for river sands who showed with laboratory evaporation tests on cylinders of sand wipplinger 1958 and observations in sand rivers in botswana nord 1985 that the rate of evaporation decreased asymptotically until no further evaporation occurs at a depth of 0 9 m this depth generally matched multiple observations in the molototsi sand river at the end of the drought a depth of 0 9 m is not the maximum depth that the water table would reach because of the influence of drainage i e down gradient groundwater flow and or seepage through the base of the sand river which can reduce the level further phreatophytes on the channel banks and occasionally within the channel could also reduce the groundwater level to below the maximum evaporation extinction depth this was observed in hyperarid environments such as the kuiseb river in namibia where the water table drops to depths of 4 5 7 m benito et al 2010 during excavation of 50 small pits in may 2017 for falling head permeameter testing water sampling and for conducting salt dilution tests locations shown in fig 5 water table depth was measured and varied from 0 to 1 m depending on the position within the channel low spots where surface water flow last occurred and narrow gaps between in channel outcrops fig 7 had a water table closer to the surface than beneath protruding sand and gravel bars 4 2 aquifer properties the results from the aquifer properties tests are presented in table 1 the calculated hydraulic conductivity of 170 290 m d from the riverbed well pumping tests are provided with uncertainty due to a the non cylindrical shape of the well with its conical base and b pumping was halted prior to achievement of steady state giving little curve to match during analysis these factors evidenced by the discrepancy in hydraulic conductivity estimates between tests in the same well at least from the papadopulos and cooper 1967 method indicate that these results should be regarded as tenuous at best falling head permeameter tests gave vertical hydraulic conductivity estimates generally varying from 20 to 330 m d depending on the grain size distribution at the testing location with a median of 118 m d the grain size analyses fig 8 revealed moderately well sorted gravelly sands low in fines particles 0 075 mm the hydraulic conductivity range given by hydrogeosievexl for all methods and all samples excluding sample 1 see note on table 1 was 10 260 m d with a median of 71 m d a water volume test was conducted in the laboratory on the sand samples which indicated porosity of 39 this result was supported by application of the empirical relationship between coefficient of grain uniformity and porosity presented by vukovic and soro 1992 that gave results of 38 40 the computed groundwater flow velocities from the salt dilution tests were extremely high 12 31 m d with a hydraulic gradient of around 0 002 based on analysis of high resolution 20 m dem data these flow velocities equate to hydraulic conductivities in the 1000s m d it is suspected that the disturbance of the sands while inserting the piezometer some excavation and backfilling was required created loose and consequently very high hydraulic conductivity materials in the vicinity of the tests however the testing was not in vain as it confirmed that groundwater flow is occurring in the sands i e groundwater is not stagnant between bedrock outcrops and subcrops shallow bedrock close to the sand surface that does not outcrop this is an important finding as it means abstraction from a riverbed well should not drain an aquifer compartment as replenishment is occurring what s more test sites in narrow gaps between in channel outcrops fig 7 gave higher relative velocities than open channel areas and sites close to riverbanks which is further evidence for the connectedness of aquifer compartments many african sand river studies have measured hydraulic conductivity by various means and the results from an extensive literature review are presented in table 2 it can be seen that the results from this study are typical of values for the region however the difficulty experienced in obtaining reliable aquifer property data from this study site particularly regarding the riverbed well pumping tests and salt dilution tests should be emphasised table 2 may also demonstrate that the simple grain size analysis method of hydraulic conductivity estimation performs adequately for this sediment type analysis of the sand profile within trial pits generally showed near surface layers characterised by poorly sorted thinly bedded sediments deposited rapidly by ephemeral floods the sediment being derived locally from the rapid erosion of soils and regolith by surface runoff from areas denuded of vegetation below this zone there was commonly a zone of well graded coarse sands and gravels likely deposited by a perennially flowing river 4 3 aquifer thickness trial pits excavated in the sand river struck bedrock at 1 5 2 mbgl dcp testing essentially probing also occasionally reached the base of the sands at depths of 0 9 2 0 m several other locations gave clues as to sand depth including as dug blocky regolith material remaining beside river pits excavated for irrigation water or for cattle watering and weathered regolith material exposed by sand mining again suggesting a sand depth of around 2 m the longitudinal geophysical survey results are shown in fig 9 magnetic anomalies are caused by the anomalous distribution of magnetic minerals generally and applicable to this study basic rocks have a higher magnetic susceptibility than acid rocks and greater metamorphism tends to decrease magnetic susceptibility clark and emerson 1991 hunt et al 1995 therefore younger dolerite dykes within granitic gneisses may register as positive anomalies such a feature is clearly visible on the magnetometer plot at chainage 725 860 m regarding the em34 survey electrical conductivity of the ground is controlled by clay content presence of ferromagnesian minerals porosity and the presence and nature of pore fluids e g salinity the crystalline basement rocks of the study site would have low conductivity due to their low primary porosity whereas weathered regolith would have higher conductivity due to its higher clay and water content spikes in the vertical coil profile above dips in the horizontal coil profile e g at chainage 350 and 460 on fig 9 are interpreted as weathered mafic material relatively high conductivity at shallow depth above a dyke relatively low conductivity prior to the resistivity survey it was suspected that the channel bed and banks were mostly weathered regolith which should contrast well with the alluvial sands i e higher resistivity channel within low resistivity background or where unweathered gneiss and dolerite underlie the sand river lower resistivity channel within high resistivity background the resistivity peak visible in the profile in fig 9 at chainage 300 is indicative of high resistivity bedrock close to the surface the apparent resistivity curves from the cross channel ves surveys are shown in fig 10 and the interpreted layers are shown in fig s2 of the supplementary material processing with res1d led to estimates of sand aquifer thickness from 1 5 to 5 5 m though there is some uncertainty due to the presence of either weathered regolith with lower resistivity than sand or solid crystalline bedrock with higher resistivity than sand or both immediately beneath the sand accurate determination of sand aquifer thickness proved to be a difficult procedure trial pitting is problematic below the water table due to pit collapse shuttering and pumping is a possible solution probing involves uncertainty if the sands overlie weathered regolith and similarly ves provides thickness estimates only where layers are well defined unfortunately the geophysical survey did not provide sand thickness estimations of which we have high confidence based on the geophysics the sand thickness is estimated to be around 0 6 m although we can only confidently assert a sand thickness of up to around 2 m based on the trial pits and probing the discrepancy in estimates is due to a heterogeneities in the level of the bedrock between testing sites and b uncertainty in the geophysical interpretations of the presence and thickness of weathered regolith between the sands and the solid bedrock what the geophysics did reveal are abundant cross channel dykes and subcrops that compartmentalise though do not entirely separate due to discontinuities the aquifer where they reduce its thickness to a metre or less at subsurface or outcropping barriers as shown in fig 7 subsurface barriers that divide the alluvial aquifer into units are frequently reported in sand river literature e g morin et al 2009 love et al 2011 hussey 2007 many african sand river studies have measured aquifer thickness by various means and the results are presented in table 3 for comparison this list represents all the studies identified from an extensive literature review which give the depth of alluvial sands in ephemeral sand rivers the results from this study are typical of sand river aquifer thicknesses in the region though table 3 shows that sand river aquifers can be substantially thicker where the rivers are wider and more mature e g mzingwane river in zimbabwe and shashe river in botswana 4 4 hydrochemistry apparent from the groundwater quality analyses shown in table 4 and the piper plot in fig s3 of the supplementary material is the difference in deep and shallow groundwater hydrochemistry samples from deep boreholes show much higher ionic concentrations higher salinity which are characteristic of long water rock interaction time whereas the shallow groundwater samples from the sand river have hydrochemical signatures closer to surface water what is more nitrate and phosphate levels are generally lower in the sand river samples meaning that current farm activities through fertilizer and pesticide applications have little effect on the shallow groundwater quality the evidence suggests that at the study site there is little to no connectivity between deep groundwater and the sand river nor between cultivated fields and the sand river deep groundwater contributing to baseflow and irrigation water flowing through the surface or subsurface to the sand river could influence the alluvial aquifer hydrochemistry but that is not apparent the quality of shallow groundwater sampled in the sand river is very good and the water is fit for human consumption based on the inorganic and dissolved organic carbon doc analyses unlike the groundwater samples collected from deep boreholes who 2011 the sand river groundwater also has better sodium adsorption ratios sar whereas the deep groundwater is occasionally at concentrations sar 3 0 that may have adverse effects to crops under irrigation olson 2012 fig 11 shows the plot of stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h in and the local meteoric water lines lmwl for pretoria and harare the study site lies between the two the main cluster containing the majority of samples are from the sand river the two results that plot above the lmwls showing condensation represent a rainfall sample and a sample taken from a rare surface water flow the similarity in these results indicated that the surface water was derived from recent rain there had been little mixing with soil or groundwater as was observed when the river responded quite rapidly to a thunderstorm the deep borehole sample has a clearly different signature to the sand river samples showing the greatest depletion the sand river sample that plots closest to the deep groundwater sample was collected from the centre of the channel this result may be suggestive of some localised connectivity however such high depletion was not measured elsewhere this sample being the only anomaly from the studied reach note that all shallow groundwater samples were collected from the top 100 mm of the groundwater reservoir following more than two weeks with zero rainfall recorded anywhere within the catchment the result furthest right on fig 11 was sampled from a low point in the sand river with stagnant surface water consequently it shows the highest evaporation effect sand river samples were deliberately collected next to riverbanks and in the channel centre with the latter samples showing a slightly different isotopic signature mid channel samples show greater oxygen 18 depletion whereas the tight cluster cluster a on fig 11 showing lower oxygen 18 depletion includes the three samples taken immediately adjacent to high regolith banks therefore there may be some groundwater entering the channel through the banks from bank storage or interflow several pairs of samples were collected from immediately upstream and downstream of in channel outcrops to assess if sand river groundwater was originating from fractures within the outcrops pairs labelled b c and d on fig 11 it can be seen that there is little difference between results for each pair the stable isotope results show that deep and shallow groundwater and surface water all have different isotopic signatures suggesting there is no leakage to the deeper aquifer though this is based on just one deep groundwater sample 5 alluvial aquifer recharge the molototsi flowed at the onset of rains in december 2016 nord 1985 and owen 1989 stated that surface water flow only occurs in sand rivers when the alluvial aquifer is fully saturated therefore following two years of one of the worst droughts on record baudoin et al 2017 the alluvial aquifer was still able to completely refill at the onset of rains to enable surface flow there was no legacy of the drought i e excessive depletion preventing complete alluvial aquifer groundwater replenishment and surface water flow observations and dws data showed that the modjadji dam was well below capacity in december 2016 and did not release water dam releases are via a spillway thus occur when the reservoir is at 100 capacity this indicated that molototsi surface water flow and alluvial aquifer recharge did not originate from dam releases a field visit in may 2017 coincided with a surface water flow event tributaries in the lowveld portion of the catchment remained dry while contributing flow was only observed in streams from the mountains of which only a few are downstream of the dam catchment notably the flow receded within hours and a few days later only minor flow remained the lowveld tributaries flow infrequently because the sandy soils typically water starved vegetation and deep water tables mean that flow in these torrential streams is likely to occur only when rainfall is sufficiently intense to exceed the infiltration capacity of the ground leading to hortonian overland flow into the incised gullies conversely high intensity rainfall in the mountains caused the tributaries there to flow where steep slopes and thin soils above solid bedrock encourage runoff anecdotal observational and remote sensing analysis indicate the molototsi river flows and the alluvial aquifer fully recharges a few times per year walker et al 2018 6 conceptual model the information so far described was used to develop a conceptual model of the molototsi river catchment data collected suggested that there is a hydraulic disconnect between the regional groundwater and the alluvial aquifer groundwater level monitoring in boreholes located barely 100 m from the molototsi indicated that the regional groundwater level is below the water table in the sand river in addition borehole groundwater levels responded very little to rainfall perhaps the clearest evidence of this disconnect was given by the difference between the regional groundwater hydrochemistry and that of the alluvial aquifer throughout the measuring period the hydrochemistry of the sand river resembled the quality of rainwater whilst higher salinity and ionic concentrations were measured in the regional groundwater stable isotope analyses also resulted in clear differentiation of water samples although they gave possibly some indication of lateral inflow from bank storage the main pathway of sand river recharge is therefore surface runoff which occurs predominantly through erosion gullies and torrential tributaries high in the catchment as observed in may 2017 the geophysical surveys revealed the presence of abundant dykes and other subcrops that compartmentalise the alluvial aquifer however the lack of decline of the sand river water table to 1 mbgl in october 2016 even following two years of drought indicated that these subsurface structures are not barriers to flow salt dilution tests confirmed that the narrow passages between outcrops forming aquifer compartments are sites of greater groundwater flow velocity an uncertainty in the conceptual model is the regolith underlying the alluvial sands its presence thickness and properties observations and geophysics suggest that the sands directly overlie crystalline bedrock in some areas and regolith in others the perched nature of the sand river aquifer indicate that the regolith must be of very low hydraulic conductivity therefore the base of the aquifer is considered to be the base of the saturated sands 7 stored water volume available for productive use we will consider the study site sand river reach beginning at chainage 0 m and ending at the mid channel outcrop at chainage 1200 m visible in figs 5 and 7 the width of the sand channel there is no floodplain based on google earth measurements every 100 m ranges from 46 to 75 m with an average of 60 m the aquifer thickness measurements ranged from 0 6 m we can take a conservative average of 2 m because we have greatest confidence in the trial pitting and probing methods to obtain sand depth laboratory porosity analysis of the sands gave a value of 39 and this is conservatively converted to a specific yield of 30 based on porosity specific yield relationships at various grain sizes plotted by robson 1993 multiplying this length average width average thickness and specific yield gives the total drainable water volume of the aquifer however following surface flow and aquifer recharge evaporation from the sands reduces the water table to an observed depth of around 1 mbgl subtracting 1 m from the aquifer thickness produces a stored volume of about 21 650 m3 the purpose of this calculation is to highlight the potential for abstraction for small scale irrigation livestock and water supply etc the only farm abstracting groundwater from this reach monitored abstraction with a flow meter from september 2016 onwards during the drought the average abstraction from the riverbed well was 7 m3 d to irrigate approximately 0 2 ha of tomatoes with drip irrigation even if abstraction were to occur every day of the year the total abstracted volume would be 2555 m3 less than 12 of the stored volume what s more this simple but conservative calculation neglects to consider sand river groundwater flow from upstream and occasional surface water flow recharging the aquifer and increasing saturated thickness which would increase the volume of the shallow groundwater resource additionally neglected are wet periods days off or other downtime when no irrigation occurs all of which would reduce the abstracted volume taking this simple calculation a step further if we consider the aquifer geometry of the reach to be typical scale up the irrigated area assume the same irrigation rate and irrigate for 9 months of the year this equates to the potential for two 1 ha farms per kilometre of sand river within a 10 km reach centred on the study site only six farms currently irrigate from the sand river revealing the potential for a three fold increase in number of farms and a much greater increase in irrigated area 8 conclusions this study aimed to contribute findings from field investigations and observations of a sand river currently utilised for small scale irrigation to the limited pool of data available in published literature field investigations meant the aquifer could be characterised in terms of its properties geometry and relationship with surface and groundwater it is important to reiterate the difficulty in obtaining results in which we had a high degree of confidence therefore applying multiple methods is recommended pumping tests in a riverbed well falling head permeameter testing and grain size analysis indicated hydraulic conductivity of 20 300 m d depending on how silty or gravelly were the sands at the precise testing location porosity was measured at 38 40 aquifer thickness was estimated with trial pits probing observations and geophysics magnetometer em34 resistivity and ves and gave thickness varying from zero at in channel outcrops to about 6 m dykes and other subcrops that compartmentalise the aquifer are abundant though there remain channels through which groundwater can flow confirmed by salt dilution testing there is a hydraulic disconnect between the deep groundwater and the sand river revealed by borehole groundwater levels many metres below the sand river water table and showing no response to rainfall contrasting hydrochemistry and stable isotope signatures are further evidence for the deep and shallow groundwater disconnect the dominant recharge process of the alluvial aquifer is surface runoff which occurs predominantly through erosion gullies and torrential tributaries in the upper reaches of the catchment even when groundwater inflow from upstream and surface water flows recharging the aquifer are neglected the molototsi alluvial aquifer resource is plentiful and abstraction is sustainable when considering the current demand opportunities exist to increase abstraction of sand river groundwater at the study site reach more than eight fold based on the current 12 usage of stored volume for smallholder irrigation and other uses a resource assessment of the lower mzingwane sand river in zimbabwe by love et al 2011 indicated that water usage there could be tripled similarly the transboundary limpopo alluvial aquifer is abstracted at only around 20 of its potential cobbing et al 2008 the umzingwane sand river in zimbabwe is described as highly under utilised owen and dahlin 2005 and sand rivers in botswana are considered major sources of under utilised groundwater herbert et al 1997 further exploitation of these alluvial aquifers could aid in halting or reversing the declining trend in subsistence and smallholder agriculture in the region boosting food security and nutrition and alleviating poverty however additional factors must be considered such as the availability of arable land and of irrigation infrastructure all of the methodologies applied in this study are transferrable to sand rivers elsewhere to conduct a resource assessment knowledge of alluvial aquifer thickness is important though table 3 shows that sufficient thickness for a substantial stored water volume is generally found more important is to estimate the degree of compartmentalisation of the alluvial aquifer if outcrops or subcrops create barriers to flow e g morin et al 2009 love et al 2011 hussey 2007 there is the possibility of quickly depleting a small alluvial aquifer unit through abstraction in such cases monitoring of regional groundwater levels would indicate whether lateral inflows i e gaining conditions could sustain alluvial aquifer groundwater levels such monitoring would also suggest whether the sand river is losing or disconnected hydrochemical investigations would aid in this determination investigation of aquifer properties indicates the suitability for abstraction table 2 shows that high hydraulic conductivities are typical in sand rivers and that simple grain size analysis is probably sufficient for hydraulic conductivity estimation to assess the sustainability of abstraction recharge frequency must be estimated this is a more straightforward assessment than often in hydrogeological studies because a single river flow equates to complete alluvial aquifer recharge owen and dahlin 2005 however as rainfall in dryland regions is highly spatially variable and tributary contributions to flow are consequently highly spatially variable hughes and sami 1992 traditional means of estimating flow frequency through rainfall or flow monitoring may be unsuitable unless a high density monitoring network is available remote sensing proves to be a more appropriate flow detection

8487,study region molototsi sand river limpopo south africa study focus ephemeral sand rivers are common throughout the world s dryland regions often providing a water source where more conventional sources are unavailable however these alluvial aquifers are poorly represented in the literature extensive field investigations allowed estimation of stored water volume and characterisation of an alluvial aquifer new hydrological insights for the region computed alluvial aquifer properties included hydraulic conductivity of 20 300 m d porosity of 38 40 and aquifer thickness of 0 6 m dykes and other subcrops commonly compartmentalise the aquifer though do not form barriers to flow a hydraulic disconnect between deep groundwater occurring in fractured metamorphic rocks and the alluvial aquifer was revealed by groundwater levels and contrasting hydrochemistry and stable isotope signatures the dominant recharge process of the alluvial aquifer is surface runoff occurring from torrential tributaries in the catchment s upper reaches a fraction of available storage is currently abstracted and there exists potential for greater exploitation for smallholder irrigation and other

experience surface flows only following infrequent torrential rainfall tooth 2000 where the underlying geology is of low permeability e g african crystalline basement infrequent torrential flows fully recharge the alluvial aquifer creating an accessible water resource where unfavourable climate and geology create few alternatives drylands occupy 41 3 of the world s surface and are home to 2 1 billion people un 2017 many of whom obtain their water supplies from resources contained within sand rivers seely et al 2003 love et al 2011 smallholder irrigation often obtains water from sand rivers where minimal head difference and proximity of river channel to riparian fields minimises equipment and energy costs the relatively low stored water volumes can be sufficient for small scale farming activities hussey 2007 love et al 2007 south african agricultural policy makers and farmers recognise that subsistence smallholder agriculture can reduce the vulnerability of food insecure households improving livelihoods boosting nutritional intake and help mitigate food price inflation wenhold et al 2007 baiphethi and jacobs 2009 most poor and food insecure households in south africa are concentrated in former rural homeland areas increased food productivity by subsistence and smallholder farmers in these areas would enhance long term food security reversing the decline of smallholder agriculture baiphethi and jacobs 2009 pereira and drimie 2016 the decline in smallholder farming is in part due to increased failure of borehole and surface water sources especially poorly maintained systems installed before 1994 personal communication local farmers october 2016 and may 2017 identification of alternative cheap water sources to enhance smallholder agriculture should be prioritised sand rivers are potentially such alternative water sources sand rivers are defined as shallow unconsolidated alluvial deposits presently accumulating along active stream courses within which thin saturated basal sands form limited aquifers the depth to water table is less than a two metres within unconsolidated sands that are regularly recharged sand rivers can be considered a renewable resource where long term groundwater depletion is not expected if used sustainably owen 1989 moderate yields are possible from permeable alluvial deposits with high initial specific yield however the stored volume is often a limiting factor as sand rivers range in width from 10 to 100s m and in thickness from 1 to 30 m water qualities are generally good due to frequent recharge and the filtering effect of the sand nord 1985 owen and dahlin 2005 cobbing et al 2008 sand river aquifer recharge is almost entirely from surface water flow during occasional floods generated by torrential rainfall events little recharge results from normal annual precipitation owen and dahlin 2005 similar landforms elsewhere in the world such as wadis in the middle east e g meirovich et al 1998 gheith and sultan 2002 and arroyos in southwestern usa e g reid and frostick 1997 graf 1988 are fairly well researched due to local recognition of their value local research capacity and data availability tooth

sensing techniques investigations on the kuiseb sand river in namibia are reported by dahan et al 2008 morin et al 2009 and benito et al 2010 outside of these areas there are few published aquifer characteristic data for assessment of the sustainability of sand river exploitation mansell and hussey 2005 this study contributes data from field investigations and observations of a sand river currently utilised for small scale irrigation the objectives include characterisation of aquifer properties geometry and relationship between surface water and shallow and deep groundwaters the study aims to estimate the stored water volume to determine if the resource is being used sustainably and potential for further exploitation the molototsi study site is typical of sand rivers found in the wider region overlying crystalline basement rocks and receiving infrequent surface flows increased exploitation of sand rivers in the region could mitigate the impact of borehole and surface water infrastructure deterioration by increasing food security alleviating poverty and boosting nutritional intake 2 study site the molototsi catchment lies within the mopani district of limpopo province in northeast south africa fig 1 the catchment covers an area of 1170 km2 and the river has a length of approximately 120 km the molototsi drainage system comprising quaternary catchments b81g and b81h as defined by the south african department for water and sanitation dws is a torrential or sand river system with infrequent surface flow the catchment drains west to east where it joins the perennial groot letaba river that flows through kruger national park into the olifants river forming part of the transboundary limpopo basin the upper reaches of the molototsi catchment are hilly with populated valleys and forested slopes approximately 70 km2 of these upper reaches lie upstream of the modjadji dam which was constructed in 1997 with a capacity of 8 4 mm3 to supply potable water to the groot letaba municipal area dwaf 2010 downstream of the dam are flat sparsely populated plains supporting a mopane veld vegetation scrub and bushland population centres and agriculture becoming sparser in the drier east away from the mountains a pipeline is under construction to supply potable water from the nandoni dam in a catchment to the north to the sparse villages ringwood 2016 these villages have no sewage systems and may represent a significant source of groundwater pollution mopani 2017a the catchment is ungauged with the exception of an 18 month period during dam construction though data are available from dws recording modjadji dam releases dam releases are via a spillway when the reservoir exceeds full capacity and have occurred in nine of the 21 years from 1997 to 2018 no release has occurred since april 2014 to june 2018 agriculture in south africa is dominated by a corporate industrial structure with large scale commercial agriculture producing over 90 of marketed food greenberg 2013 recent agricultural policies focus on the importance of subsistence agriculture recognising its contribution to food security and poverty alleviation baiphethi and jacobs 2009 within mopani district only 6 7 of land is designated as arable of which 43 is under irrigation mopani 2017b the most important crops in terms of monetary value are citrus and subtropical fruits e g mango and banana with several irrigation schemes in the region utilising water supplied by dams on the letaba river there are no such large irrigation schemes within the molototsi catchment rather the farms are small and largely non mechanised physical measurement of a sample of 142 farms within the catchment using google earth reveals a median size of 4 8 ha and a 10th to 90th percentile range of 0 9 17 7 ha most of these farms are run by cooperatives with permission to farm communal lands governed under the traditional leadership and governance framework act 6 2005 discussions with local farmers revealed that most of these cooperative farms irrigate crops with water obtained from boreholes drilled by dws however riparian farms often utilise water from sand rivers even if they have a borehole sand river abstraction points include simple hand dug pits open brick lined wells fig 2 and buried metal tanks furrow and drip irrigation systems dominate using diesel pumps use of electric submersible pumps is rare due to a general lack of rural electrification crops cultivated for local market in addition to domestic subsistence use include okra courgettes tomatoes maize chili peppers amaranthus and fruits such as mango and watermelon the climate of this region of southern africa is categorised as hot semi arid according to the köppen geiger climate classification system peel et al 2007 the region experiences a single rainfall season during the summer months of november to march that is characterised by high interannual variability and occasional torrential rainfall potential evapotranspiration greatly exceeds precipitation droughts are regular phenomena often coinciding with el niño southern oscillation enso periods lindesay 1988 cook et al 2004 reason et al 2005 severe droughts in the past in limpopo have resulted in crop failure and economic loss trambauer et al 2014 limpopo suffered a period of reduced rainfall from around 2012 culminating in the major drought in 2016 maponya and mpandeli 2016 sunday times 2016 this is affirmed by dws rainfall and dam status data the regional air circulation is governed by high pressure cells located across the northern part of botswana and south africa that interact with low pressure cells from the antarctic besides warm air masses generated from the southern indian ocean abiye 2016 a distinct rainfall gradient is observed between the catchment headwaters in the west and the lowveld to the east in the west a dws rain gauge at modjadji dam measured mean annual rainfall for 1998 2017 of 1219 mm no formal rain gauges are sited in the east of the catchment though a farmer monitored rain gauge close to the study site recorded a mean annual rainfall from 2006 to 2017 of 430 mm the geology of study site is described by holland 2011 and witthüser et al 2011 archaean crystalline basement rocks dominate the regional geology fig 3 these being some of the oldest rocks on earth with ages up to 3600 ma kramers et al 2007 the hydrogeologically significant ventersdorp related mafic dykes represented as structural lines in fig 3 were intruded around 2700 ma ago ernst 2014 the ne sw trending structures clearly visible on satellite imagery and on aeromagnetic maps relate to the position of this region within the metamorphic limpopo fold belt the limpopo belt is considered to be the earliest identified himalaya type orogeny formed when the zimbabwe and kaapvaal cratons collided around 2600 ma ago zhao et al 2000 a geological cross section of the study site fig 4 shows boreholes drilled where geophysical surveys identified dykes to exploit groundwater within zones of enhanced fracturing at the dyke country rock margins the molototsi is typical of ephemeral sand rivers throughout the limpopo region a 1300 m long reach of its course was selected for study this focus study site fig 5 was chosen due to the presence of a large number of boreholes and a riverbed well the latter used for small scale irrigation the molototsi sand river at the study site is considered typical of the landform in terms of geometry gradient and geology 3 methodology 3 1 groundwater levels groundwater levels were monitored to assess the relationship between deep and shallow groundwater three boreholes were drilled by dws at the study site to 120 mbgl metres below ground level in july august 2016 two of these boreholes h14 1702 and h14 1703 were equipped with solinst pressure transducers to monitor groundwater levels at hourly intervals water levels in the riverbed well and the other boreholes were monitored using a manual dip meter approximately every three months to may 2017 3 2 aquifer properties four methods of hydraulic conductivity estimation were applied to the sand river in may 2017 test pumping of the riverbed well falling head permeameter tests grain size analysis also for porosity and salt dilution tests two pumping tests were undertaken by measuring drawdown and recovery with a pressure transducer logging water levels at 30 s intervals in the riverbed well fig 2 during daily abstraction periods 3 4 h for irrigation the well of nominal diameter of 4 m is lined with brick lining to 1 2 m with a cone shaped base below the brick lining where the pump lies 1 m below the rest water level located at 0 5 mbgl an abstraction rate of 1 l s was determined using the farmer s flow meter drawdown data were analysed using the papadopulos and cooper 1967 method with aquiferwin32 software esi 2007 while recovery was analysed manually by the barker and herbert 1989 method using generated nomograms these methods were specifically developed for application to data from large diameter wells where well bore storage is considered falling head permeameter tests were conducted at 12 sites in the sand river test sites were installed by excavating pits into the sand to the water table then inserting a plain open ended tube 510 mm long and 43 mm diameter halfway into the riverbed the test involved filling the tube with water so that the falling water level rate could be measured by a pressure transducer until equilibrium is achieved testing sites were chosen to measure falling head rates within a range of alluvial grain sizes and positions within the channel including coarse clean sand in active central channel gravel bars and silty lee of mid channel outcrop the vertical hydraulic conductivity was estimated using the hvorslev 1951 method and application of the darcy equation as described by chen 2000 five unconsolidated sand samples from the sand river were collected and analysed in the laboratory for porosity and grain size distribution through mechanical sieving there are multiple methods available to estimate hydraulic conductivity from grain size distributions the hydrogeosievexl program presented by devlin 2015 computes 15 of these methods and was applied to the five grain size analyses six salt dilution tests were conducted to assess groundwater flow velocities each test consisted of excavating a pit in the sands to the water table installing a slotted tube with a bottom end cap piezometer 510 mm long and 43 mm diameter into the saturated river sand and adding 150 g of table salt following solution of salt through agitation the rate of decline in electrical conductivity ec with dissolution due to groundwater throughflow was monitored for an hour with an ec sonde within the piezometer four more pits were excavated around each testing site where the background salinity was measured testing and analysis followed the methodology presented by davies et al 1998 who applied this test to sand rivers in botswana 3 3 aquifer thickness a crucial aquifer characteristic of sand rivers is aquifer thickness i e saturated sand depth for estimation of groundwater storage methods of sand depth assessment applied included trial pits probing and geophysical surveys trial pits were manually excavated in the sand river to determine depth to the water table and the nature of the sediment infill while conducting falling head permeameter and salt dilution tests and while sampling alluvial sands and groundwater additionally an excavator mining sand for road construction was utilised to excavate trial pits to the base of the alluvial sands probing involves inserting usually by physically hammering a metal rod into the sands and is the most accurate method of determining depth to bedrock probing in this case employed a dynamic cone penetrometer dcp such testing was conducted as part of a separate civil engineering project to assess the strength and thickness of subsurface layers geophysical investigations were conducted by dws in may 2017 dws initially conducted a simultaneous magnetometer and em34 survey in the centre of the channel along a 1300 m reach followed by longitudinal and vertical resistivity surveys fig 5 magnetometer and em34 surveys are conducted by dws when attempting to locate dykes within deep bedrock geology and while being unable to estimate sand thickness could identify dykes subcropping within the alluvial sands a model g5 proton memory magnetometer geotron south africa was used to measure ground magnetic flux density at 10 m intervals an em34 geonics ltd ontario canada was used to measure subsurface apparent conductivity with a coil spacing of 20 m the equipment was operated in two dipole orientations horizontal vertical coils for identifying vertical structures at shallower depths and vertical horizontal coils for horizontal structures at deeper depths the effective investigation depths for the two dipole orientations are approximately 0 75 and 1 5 times the intercoil spacing respectively mcneill 1983 em34 measures the bulk conductivity of the ground the measurements representing a weighted mean related to depth of the formations within the range of investigation macdonald et al 2001 the resistivity system geotech environmental equipment inc colorado usa was operated using a schlumberger array with a half distance between current electrodes ab 2 of 30 m for the longitudinal survey at this electrode spacing each reading gives the bulk resistivity averaged though biased towards shallower depths over a depth of approximately 40 m van nostrand and cook 1966 this longitudinal resistivity survey could indicate the consistency of sand aquifer thickness and identify the locations of subcropping dykes five cross channel vertical electrical sounding ves surveys were conducted using a schlumberger array this expanding array system is used to determine the thickness of the upper dry zone by recognising the resistivity contrast between it and the underlying saturated zone similarly the depth to bedrock is recognised by the marked resistivity contrast between solid rock and saturated sands such a survey gives a 1d resistivity profile centred on the centre of the river channel the ves data electrode spacing and apparent resistivity was entered into res1d an open source computer program developed by geotomo software malaysia loke 2001 res1d computes an estimate of the number of layers their thickness and resistivity for each profile giving the lowest root mean square rms error 3 4 hydrochemistry groundwater samples were collected on three occasions in the molototsi area in february 2012 october 2015 and january 2017 on site analysis involved measurement of ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec while samples were filtered and acidified prior to transport to a laboratory for major ion analysis utilising dionex ion chromatography anions and atomic absorption spectroscopy cations groundwater samples were collected after purging boreholes with a portable water pump or the irrigation pump additionally twenty water samples for stable isotope analysis δ18o and δ2h were collected in may 2017 from sites in the sand river a borehole surface water and rainwater samples were collected in nalgene vials filled to the rim with caps sealed with tape 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater levels fig 6 shows that logged borehole groundwater levels are stable with little to no identifiable response to rainfall this is despite the occurrence of four rainfall events with daily totals 30 mm one of which had a daily total of 60 mm nor does there appear to be a correlation between the borehole groundwater levels and the water level in the sand river the groundwater level in boreholes h14 1701 and duv1 also showed little seasonal variation with depths to groundwater stable at 13 and 15 mbgl these levels are 5 8 m deeper than the observed water table depth in the sand river therefore there is no groundwater discharge into the sand river i e it is not a gaining stream the molototsi is also very unlikely to be a losing stream or the sand river water table would not settle at the observed depth of 1 m and a response would likely be seen in the borehole groundwater levels to surface water flows the groundwater levels are suggestive of a disconnected stream where an unsaturated zone exists between the stream and deeper groundwater it is noted that on the cross section in fig 4 the groundwater level in the boreholes is interpolated as a piezometric surface rather than a water table the drillers logs reported in fig 5 and presented in the supplementary material fig s1 stated that water strikes occurred at greater depths than the rest water level usually at the locations of fractured layers the initial water strikes were observed at depths of 16 31 mbgl and rest water levels are 7 18 mbgl weathered and fractured layers commonly occur above the water strikes within the level of the resting groundwater although water was not encountered at the time of drilling through these materials it seems likely that groundwater is present only in fractures and is therefore much deeper approximately 20 m below the base of the sand river than the observed water levels in the boreholes suggests the cause of the driving head leading groundwater to rise up the boreholes may be a connection with the ne sw trending lineaments shown in fig 3 that extend to the wetter mountains and recharge zone to the southwest thus creating a semi confined aquifer system the groundwater level in the sand river varied from a maximum depth of 1 2 mbgl in october 2016 following two years of drought to above surface during occasional flow events the proximity of the water table to the surface in october 2016 following one of the worst droughts on record baudoin et al 2017 illustrates the potential of the sand river aquifer for productive use wipplinger 1958 and nord 1985 are the commonly cited sources of the maximum evaporation extinction depth for river sands who showed with laboratory evaporation tests on cylinders of sand wipplinger 1958 and observations in sand rivers in botswana nord 1985 that the rate of evaporation decreased asymptotically until no further evaporation occurs at a depth of 0 9 m this depth generally matched multiple observations in the molototsi sand river at the end of the drought a depth of 0 9 m is not the maximum depth that the water table would reach because of the influence of drainage i e down gradient groundwater flow and or seepage through the base of the sand river which can reduce the level further phreatophytes on the channel banks and occasionally within the channel could also reduce the groundwater level to below the maximum evaporation extinction depth this was observed in hyperarid environments such as the kuiseb river in namibia where the water table drops to depths of 4 5 7 m benito et al 2010 during excavation of 50 small pits in may 2017 for falling head permeameter testing water sampling and for conducting salt dilution tests locations shown in fig 5 water table depth was measured and varied from 0 to 1 m depending on the position within the channel low spots where surface water flow last occurred and narrow gaps between in channel outcrops fig 7 had a water table closer to the surface than beneath protruding sand and gravel bars 4 2 aquifer properties the results from the aquifer properties tests are presented in table 1 the calculated hydraulic conductivity of 170 290 m d from the riverbed well pumping tests are provided with uncertainty due to a the non cylindrical shape of the well with its conical base and b pumping was halted prior to achievement of steady state giving little curve to match during analysis these factors evidenced by the discrepancy in hydraulic conductivity estimates between tests in the same well at least from the papadopulos and cooper 1967 method indicate that these results should be regarded as tenuous at best falling head permeameter tests gave vertical hydraulic conductivity estimates generally varying from 20 to 330 m d depending on the grain size distribution at the testing location with a median of 118 m d the grain size analyses fig 8 revealed moderately well sorted gravelly sands low in fines particles 0 075 mm the hydraulic conductivity range given by hydrogeosievexl for all methods and all samples excluding sample 1 see note on table 1 was 10 260 m d with a median of 71 m d a water volume test was conducted in the laboratory on the sand samples which indicated porosity of 39 this result was supported by application of the empirical relationship between coefficient of grain uniformity and porosity presented by vukovic and soro 1992 that gave results of 38 40 the computed groundwater flow velocities from the salt dilution tests were extremely high 12 31 m d with a hydraulic gradient of around 0 002 based on analysis of high resolution 20 m dem data these flow velocities equate to hydraulic conductivities in the 1000s m d it is suspected that the disturbance of the sands while inserting the piezometer some excavation and backfilling was required created loose and consequently very high hydraulic conductivity materials in the vicinity of the tests however the testing was not in vain as it confirmed that groundwater flow is occurring in the sands i e groundwater is not stagnant between bedrock outcrops and subcrops shallow bedrock close to the sand surface that does not outcrop this is an important finding as it means abstraction from a riverbed well should not drain an aquifer compartment as replenishment is occurring what s more test sites in narrow gaps between in channel outcrops fig 7 gave higher relative velocities than open channel areas and sites close to riverbanks which is further evidence for the connectedness of aquifer compartments many african sand river studies have measured hydraulic conductivity by various means and the results from an extensive literature review are presented in table 2 it can be seen that the results from this study are typical of values for the region however the difficulty experienced in obtaining reliable aquifer property data from this study site particularly regarding the riverbed well pumping tests and salt dilution tests should be emphasised table 2 may also demonstrate that the simple grain size analysis method of hydraulic conductivity estimation performs adequately for this sediment type analysis of the sand profile within trial pits generally showed near surface layers characterised by poorly sorted thinly bedded sediments deposited rapidly by ephemeral floods the sediment being derived locally from the rapid erosion of soils and regolith by surface runoff from areas denuded of vegetation below this zone there was commonly a zone of well graded coarse sands and gravels likely deposited by a perennially flowing river 4 3 aquifer thickness trial pits excavated in the sand river struck bedrock at 1 5 2 mbgl dcp testing essentially probing also occasionally reached the base of the sands at depths of 0 9 2 0 m several other locations gave clues as to sand depth including as dug blocky regolith material remaining beside river pits excavated for irrigation water or for cattle watering and weathered regolith material exposed by sand mining again suggesting a sand depth of around 2 m the longitudinal geophysical survey results are shown in fig 9 magnetic anomalies are caused by the anomalous distribution of magnetic minerals generally and applicable to this study basic rocks have a higher magnetic susceptibility than acid rocks and greater metamorphism tends to decrease magnetic susceptibility clark and emerson 1991 hunt et al 1995 therefore younger dolerite dykes within granitic gneisses may register as positive anomalies such a feature is clearly visible on the magnetometer plot at chainage 725 860 m regarding the em34 survey electrical conductivity of the ground is controlled by clay content presence of ferromagnesian minerals porosity and the presence and nature of pore fluids e g salinity the crystalline basement rocks of the study site would have low conductivity due to their low primary porosity whereas weathered regolith would have higher conductivity due to its higher clay and water content spikes in the vertical coil profile above dips in the horizontal coil profile e g at chainage 350 and 460 on fig 9 are interpreted as weathered mafic material relatively high conductivity at shallow depth above a dyke relatively low conductivity prior to the resistivity survey it was suspected that the channel bed and banks were mostly weathered regolith which should contrast well with the alluvial sands i e higher resistivity channel within low resistivity background or where unweathered gneiss and dolerite underlie the sand river lower resistivity channel within high resistivity background the resistivity peak visible in the profile in fig 9 at chainage 300 is indicative of high resistivity bedrock close to the surface the apparent resistivity curves from the cross channel ves surveys are shown in fig 10 and the interpreted layers are shown in fig s2 of the supplementary material processing with res1d led to estimates of sand aquifer thickness from 1 5 to 5 5 m though there is some uncertainty due to the presence of either weathered regolith with lower resistivity than sand or solid crystalline bedrock with higher resistivity than sand or both immediately beneath the sand accurate determination of sand aquifer thickness proved to be a difficult procedure trial pitting is problematic below the water table due to pit collapse shuttering and pumping is a possible solution probing involves uncertainty if the sands overlie weathered regolith and similarly ves provides thickness estimates only where layers are well defined unfortunately the geophysical survey did not provide sand thickness estimations of which we have high confidence based on the geophysics the sand thickness is estimated to be around 0 6 m although we can only confidently assert a sand thickness of up to around 2 m based on the trial pits and probing the discrepancy in estimates is due to a heterogeneities in the level of the bedrock between testing sites and b uncertainty in the geophysical interpretations of the presence and thickness of weathered regolith between the sands and the solid bedrock what the geophysics did reveal are abundant cross channel dykes and subcrops that compartmentalise though do not entirely separate due to discontinuities the aquifer where they reduce its thickness to a metre or less at subsurface or outcropping barriers as shown in fig 7 subsurface barriers that divide the alluvial aquifer into units are frequently reported in sand river literature e g morin et al 2009 love et al 2011 hussey 2007 many african sand river studies have measured aquifer thickness by various means and the results are presented in table 3 for comparison this list represents all the studies identified from an extensive literature review which give the depth of alluvial sands in ephemeral sand rivers the results from this study are typical of sand river aquifer thicknesses in the region though table 3 shows that sand river aquifers can be substantially thicker where the rivers are wider and more mature e g mzingwane river in zimbabwe and shashe river in botswana 4 4 hydrochemistry apparent from the groundwater quality analyses shown in table 4 and the piper plot in fig s3 of the supplementary material is the difference in deep and shallow groundwater hydrochemistry samples from deep boreholes show much higher ionic concentrations higher salinity which are characteristic of long water rock interaction time whereas the shallow groundwater samples from the sand river have hydrochemical signatures closer to surface water what is more nitrate and phosphate levels are generally lower in the sand river samples meaning that current farm activities through fertilizer and pesticide applications have little effect on the shallow groundwater quality the evidence suggests that at the study site there is little to no connectivity between deep groundwater and the sand river nor between cultivated fields and the sand river deep groundwater contributing to baseflow and irrigation water flowing through the surface or subsurface to the sand river could influence the alluvial aquifer hydrochemistry but that is not apparent the quality of shallow groundwater sampled in the sand river is very good and the water is fit for human consumption based on the inorganic and dissolved organic carbon doc analyses unlike the groundwater samples collected from deep boreholes who 2011 the sand river groundwater also has better sodium adsorption ratios sar whereas the deep groundwater is occasionally at concentrations sar 3 0 that may have adverse effects to crops under irrigation olson 2012 fig 11 shows the plot of stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h in and the local meteoric water lines lmwl for pretoria and harare the study site lies between the two the main cluster containing the majority of samples are from the sand river the two results that plot above the lmwls showing condensation represent a rainfall sample and a sample taken from a rare surface water flow the similarity in these results indicated that the surface water was derived from recent rain there had been little mixing with soil or groundwater as was observed when the river responded quite rapidly to a thunderstorm the deep borehole sample has a clearly different signature to the sand river samples showing the greatest depletion the sand river sample that plots closest to the deep groundwater sample was collected from the centre of the channel this result may be suggestive of some localised connectivity however such high depletion was not measured elsewhere this sample being the only anomaly from the studied reach note that all shallow groundwater samples were collected from the top 100 mm of the groundwater reservoir following more than two weeks with zero rainfall recorded anywhere within the catchment the result furthest right on fig 11 was sampled from a low point in the sand river with stagnant surface water consequently it shows the highest evaporation effect sand river samples were deliberately collected next to riverbanks and in the channel centre with the latter samples showing a slightly different isotopic signature mid channel samples show greater oxygen 18 depletion whereas the tight cluster cluster a on fig 11 showing lower oxygen 18 depletion includes the three samples taken immediately adjacent to high regolith banks therefore there may be some groundwater entering the channel through the banks from bank storage or interflow several pairs of samples were collected from immediately upstream and downstream of in channel outcrops to assess if sand river groundwater was originating from fractures within the outcrops pairs labelled b c and d on fig 11 it can be seen that there is little difference between results for each pair the stable isotope results show that deep and shallow groundwater and surface water all have different isotopic signatures suggesting there is no leakage to the deeper aquifer though this is based on just one deep groundwater sample 5 alluvial aquifer recharge the molototsi flowed at the onset of rains in december 2016 nord 1985 and owen 1989 stated that surface water flow only occurs in sand rivers when the alluvial aquifer is fully saturated therefore following two years of one of the worst droughts on record baudoin et al 2017 the alluvial aquifer was still able to completely refill at the onset of rains to enable surface flow there was no legacy of the drought i e excessive depletion preventing complete alluvial aquifer groundwater replenishment and surface water flow observations and dws data showed that the modjadji dam was well below capacity in december 2016 and did not release water dam releases are via a spillway thus occur when the reservoir is at 100 capacity this indicated that molototsi surface water flow and alluvial aquifer recharge did not originate from dam releases a field visit in may 2017 coincided with a surface water flow event tributaries in the lowveld portion of the catchment remained dry while contributing flow was only observed in streams from the mountains of which only a few are downstream of the dam catchment notably the flow receded within hours and a few days later only minor flow remained the lowveld tributaries flow infrequently because the sandy soils typically water starved vegetation and deep water tables mean that flow in these torrential streams is likely to occur only when rainfall is sufficiently intense to exceed the infiltration capacity of the ground leading to hortonian overland flow into the incised gullies conversely high intensity rainfall in the mountains caused the tributaries there to flow where steep slopes and thin soils above solid bedrock encourage runoff anecdotal observational and remote sensing analysis indicate the molototsi river flows and the alluvial aquifer fully recharges a few times per year walker et al 2018 6 conceptual model the information so far described was used to develop a conceptual model of the molototsi river catchment data collected suggested that there is a hydraulic disconnect between the regional groundwater and the alluvial aquifer groundwater level monitoring in boreholes located barely 100 m from the molototsi indicated that the regional groundwater level is below the water table in the sand river in addition borehole groundwater levels responded very little to rainfall perhaps the clearest evidence of this disconnect was given by the difference between the regional groundwater hydrochemistry and that of the alluvial aquifer throughout the measuring period the hydrochemistry of the sand river resembled the quality of rainwater whilst higher salinity and ionic concentrations were measured in the regional groundwater stable isotope analyses also resulted in clear differentiation of water samples although they gave possibly some indication of lateral inflow from bank storage the main pathway of sand river recharge is therefore surface runoff which occurs predominantly through erosion gullies and torrential tributaries high in the catchment as observed in may 2017 the geophysical surveys revealed the presence of abundant dykes and other subcrops that compartmentalise the alluvial aquifer however the lack of decline of the sand river water table to 1 mbgl in october 2016 even following two years of drought indicated that these subsurface structures are not barriers to flow salt dilution tests confirmed that the narrow passages between outcrops forming aquifer compartments are sites of greater groundwater flow velocity an uncertainty in the conceptual model is the regolith underlying the alluvial sands its presence thickness and properties observations and geophysics suggest that the sands directly overlie crystalline bedrock in some areas and regolith in others the perched nature of the sand river aquifer indicate that the regolith must be of very low hydraulic conductivity therefore the base of the aquifer is considered to be the base of the saturated sands 7 stored water volume available for productive use we will consider the study site sand river reach beginning at chainage 0 m and ending at the mid channel outcrop at chainage 1200 m visible in figs 5 and 7 the width of the sand channel there is no floodplain based on google earth measurements every 100 m ranges from 46 to 75 m with an average of 60 m the aquifer thickness measurements ranged from 0 6 m we can take a conservative average of 2 m because we have greatest confidence in the trial pitting and probing methods to obtain sand depth laboratory porosity analysis of the sands gave a value of 39 and this is conservatively converted to a specific yield of 30 based on porosity specific yield relationships at various grain sizes plotted by robson 1993 multiplying this length average width average thickness and specific yield gives the total drainable water volume of the aquifer however following surface flow and aquifer recharge evaporation from the sands reduces the water table to an observed depth of around 1 mbgl subtracting 1 m from the aquifer thickness produces a stored volume of about 21 650 m3 the purpose of this calculation is to highlight the potential for abstraction for small scale irrigation livestock and water supply etc the only farm abstracting groundwater from this reach monitored abstraction with a flow meter from september 2016 onwards during the drought the average abstraction from the riverbed well was 7 m3 d to irrigate approximately 0 2 ha of tomatoes with drip irrigation even if abstraction were to occur every day of the year the total abstracted volume would be 2555 m3 less than 12 of the stored volume what s more this simple but conservative calculation neglects to consider sand river groundwater flow from upstream and occasional surface water flow recharging the aquifer and increasing saturated thickness which would increase the volume of the shallow groundwater resource additionally neglected are wet periods days off or other downtime when no irrigation occurs all of which would reduce the abstracted volume taking this simple calculation a step further if we consider the aquifer geometry of the reach to be typical scale up the irrigated area assume the same irrigation rate and irrigate for 9 months of the year this equates to the potential for two 1 ha farms per kilometre of sand river within a 10 km reach centred on the study site only six farms currently irrigate from the sand river revealing the potential for a three fold increase in number of farms and a much greater increase in irrigated area 8 conclusions this study aimed to contribute findings from field investigations and observations of a sand river currently utilised for small scale irrigation to the limited pool of data available in published literature field investigations meant the aquifer could be characterised in terms of its properties geometry and relationship with surface and groundwater it is important to reiterate the difficulty in obtaining results in which we had a high degree of confidence therefore applying multiple methods is recommended pumping tests in a riverbed well falling head permeameter testing and grain size analysis indicated hydraulic conductivity of 20 300 m d depending on how silty or gravelly were the sands at the precise testing location porosity was measured at 38 40 aquifer thickness was estimated with trial pits probing observations and geophysics magnetometer em34 resistivity and ves and gave thickness varying from zero at in channel outcrops to about 6 m dykes and other subcrops that compartmentalise the aquifer are abundant though there remain channels through which groundwater can flow confirmed by salt dilution testing there is a hydraulic disconnect between the deep groundwater and the sand river revealed by borehole groundwater levels many metres below the sand river water table and showing no response to rainfall contrasting hydrochemistry and stable isotope signatures are further evidence for the deep and shallow groundwater disconnect the dominant recharge process of the alluvial aquifer is surface runoff which occurs predominantly through erosion gullies and torrential tributaries in the upper reaches of the catchment even when groundwater inflow from upstream and surface water flows recharging the aquifer are neglected the molototsi alluvial aquifer resource is plentiful and abstraction is sustainable when considering the current demand opportunities exist to increase abstraction of sand river groundwater at the study site reach more than eight fold based on the current 12 usage of stored volume for smallholder irrigation and other uses a resource assessment of the lower mzingwane sand river in zimbabwe by love et al 2011 indicated that water usage there could be tripled similarly the transboundary limpopo alluvial aquifer is abstracted at only around 20 of its potential cobbing et al 2008 the umzingwane sand river in zimbabwe is described as highly under utilised owen and dahlin 2005 and sand rivers in botswana are considered major sources of under utilised groundwater herbert et al 1997 further exploitation of these alluvial aquifers could aid in halting or reversing the declining trend in subsistence and smallholder agriculture in the region boosting food security and nutrition and alleviating poverty however additional factors must be considered such as the availability of arable land and of irrigation infrastructure all of the methodologies applied in this study are transferrable to sand rivers elsewhere to conduct a resource assessment knowledge of alluvial aquifer thickness is important though table 3 shows that sufficient thickness for a substantial stored water volume is generally found more important is to estimate the degree of compartmentalisation of the alluvial aquifer if outcrops or subcrops create barriers to flow e g morin et al 2009 love et al 2011 hussey 2007 there is the possibility of quickly depleting a small alluvial aquifer unit through abstraction in such cases monitoring of regional groundwater levels would indicate whether lateral inflows i e gaining conditions could sustain alluvial aquifer groundwater levels such monitoring would also suggest whether the sand river is losing or disconnected hydrochemical investigations would aid in this determination investigation of aquifer properties indicates the suitability for abstraction table 2 shows that high hydraulic conductivities are typical in sand rivers and that simple grain size analysis is probably sufficient for hydraulic conductivity estimation to assess the sustainability of abstraction recharge frequency must be estimated this is a more straightforward assessment than often in hydrogeological studies because a single river flow equates to complete alluvial aquifer recharge owen and dahlin 2005 however as rainfall in dryland regions is highly spatially variable and tributary contributions to flow are consequently highly spatially variable hughes and sami 1992 traditional means of estimating flow frequency through rainfall or flow monitoring may be unsuitable unless a high density monitoring network is available remote sensing proves to be a more appropriate flow detection technique walker et al 2018 future work would assess the varying abstraction systems observed in sand rivers for efficiency and yield as well as modelling of increased abstraction to assess the impact

8488,study region arkansas river in colorado east of the rocky mountains study focus nonpoint source nps flows and solute loads from irrigated lands can markedly shape the water environment describing their diffuse and variable characteristics over vast regions is critical to assessing compliance with regulatory and performance standards for streams yet is particularly ambiguous the nature and degree of this uncertainty is addressed here using a stochastic mass balance of return flow rates and solute loads along two reaches of colorado s arkansas river valley measurement error spatiotemporal variability and trends in flow and concentration variables are considered allowing assessment of return flow rates and mass loading rates of total dissolved solids sulfate selenium uranium and nitrate using probability intervals and other statistics new hydrological insights for the region time series of the statistics of daily nps return flows and mass loading rates within a four year period are estimated and discussed coefficients of variation in nps mass loading rates range from about 32 to 134 for the five solutes considered there is an estimated 95 probability that mass loading rates lie within a range equivalent to 109 to 405 of the temporally averaged mean value depending on the solute and the river reach the sizeable uncertainty quantified in these findings should temper the interpretation modeling regulation and management of irrigation induced nps loading in this and similar settings keywords agricultural nonpoint source pollution water quality irrigation return flow uncertainty analysis arkansas river 1 introduction sediments and solutes in waters that traverse the surface and subsurface across broad agricultural landscapes are a leading contributor to stream pollution usepa 1996 2009 2017 novotny 2003 consequently the management of nonpoint source nps pollution from agricultural lands has been a topic of intense study over the last two decades and is likely to consume much attention and resources in the decades to come xiang et al 2017 for example usepa regulations for the adoption of total maximum daily loads tmdl to meet water quality standards in streams requires both the voluntary management of nps loads as well as the compliance of point source loads with national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permits hoornbeek et al 2013 usepa 2018 however the sheer expanse and variability of diffuse nps flows and their solute loads make them difficult to characterize and control estimating this ambiguity inherent to describing and predicting nps loads is important to management decisions and investments walker and selman 2014 recently highlighted this by citing the risk and uncertainty faced by point dischargers who wish to lower the cost of water treatment needed to comply with npdes permits through trades with agricultural producers to reduce nps loads determining just how much nps return flow and solute loading are actually occurring along a river and then estimating the likelihood that a given course of action would reduce them and by how much can be elusive gathering necessary field data over the large scales associated with nps flow and pollution assessment is difficult and resource intensive mobilizing expansive field monitoring expeditions is time consuming and costly collecting preserving and analyzing water samples for sediment and solute concentrations is especially demanding hence available data often are sparse and intermittent and significant uncertainty is cast over them by the considerable spatiotemporal variability that is typical of nps flow and solute properties moreover every individual measurement that is made at a given location and a given point in time is subject to error due to limitations in equipment and methodology one strategy that can be used to increase information availability is to estimate relationships between those properties that can be more easily and frequently measured and those that are more difficult or expensive to measure for example regression equations that relate solute concentrations to flow and in situ water quality parameters e g electrical conductivity ph can be developed to allow such concentrations to be estimated at locations where flow and in situ measurements are available but where water samples are not however the ambiguity in such regression models must also be accounted for river mass balance methods using field data on flows and concentrations can be beneficial in characterizing the magnitude and extent of existing baseline nps return flows and pollutant loads along a river they also can guide the calibration and testing of process based distributed parameter dp models of the larger stream aquifer system that encompasses the river in such cases the river nps inputs and outputs from or to the adjacent landscape and groundwater aquifer calculated using a river system mass balance can be compared to landscape and aquifer nps outputs inputs to from the river computed using the dp governing equations for flow and mass transport processes within the landscape aquifer system anderson et al 2015 and hill and tiedeman 2007 point out that it is advisable that dp groundwater models be calibrated against estimates of groundwater flow though such estimates are often uncertain rather than solely against estimates of groundwater head the approach of using a river mass balance to estimate groundwater flow and overland flow in exchange with rivers to calibrate dp models is most suitable under the following conditions 1 river mass balance estimates are used as targets for dp model simulated values that are influenced predominately by landscape and aquifer system flow and transport processes thereby promoting a higher degree of independence between the reciprocal computed inputs and outputs of the landscape aquifer system and the adjacent river system and 2 river mass balance estimates are not the sole targets for dp model calibration but are used in conjunction with other data like groundwater levels groundwater concentrations river concentrations evapotranspiration rates etc several investigators have used a mass balance approach to estimate nps return flows and solute mass loading along a stretch of a river jaworski et al 1992 jain 1996 jha et al 2005 jain et al 2007 such studies commonly neglect the effect of storage changes and internal sinks and sources associated with redox reactions adsorption and settling volatilization etc within a river reach to calculate unknown mass loading to or from the reach as the difference between measured in stream mass load fluxes at the downstream and upstream ends other researchers have used a variety of statistical methods to account for uncertainty primarily related to the estimation of in stream nutrient mass load fluxes often near the outlet of a watershed harmel et al 2006 examined uncertainty in several procedural categories for measuring key properties used in the calculation of in stream solute mass fluxes streamflow measurement collection of water quality samples sample preservation and storage and laboratory analysis cumulative error within each category was estimated using a root mean square error propagation method and was found to be substantial under typical conditions jiang et al 2014 used an error propagation method to account for flow and concentration measurement uncertainty as well as uncertainty in interpolating between measurements in describing the overall uncertainty in calculating in stream river nitrate nitrogen load fluxes rode and suhr 2007 provide an assessment of component uncertainties in estimating concentrations and loads of not only nutrients but also some heavy metals and biological compounds at in stream locations mueller price and gates 2008 expanded the consideration of uncertainty from that associated with the estimation of in stream mass load fluxes to that associated with the mass balance estimation of nonpoint source loads returning along river reaches from the landscape and aquifer they used a stochastic mass balance to account for multiple sources of uncertainty common to describing nps pollution in an application to irrigated regions of colorado s lower arkansas river valley larv employing an approach similar to mueller price and gates 2008 the present paper uses a more extensive data set to consider both nps flows and solute loads for two representative river reaches in the larv and estimates them as stochastic time series of daily rates rather than as uncertain quantities within discrete multi day sampling periods this allows an examination of seasonal variability in estimated measures of uncertainty also the time period considered here extends four years beyond the drought affected years reported by mueller price and gates 2008 permitting a comparison of the conditions within the two periods moreover the number of considered solutes is expanded here to include sulfate so4 uranium u and nitrate no3 as well as the previously considered total dissolved solids tds and selenium se a variety of available field data are used to reconstruct estimates of stream flows and concentrations along with diffuse flows and loads that return from the irrigated landscape and aquifer these data include gaged stream flows and water levels main stem and tributaries gaged canal diversions surveys of stream cross sections climatic variable records measurements of electrical conductivity ec as specific conductance at 25 c and intermittent water quality samples managing nps pollution in colorado s larv has reached a critical stage the colorado department of public health and environment cdphe is looking to administer tmdls for se especially for the wastewater treatment plant of the city of pueblo due to violation of state and recommended epa chronic standards on river concentrations also by 2022 colorado is considering implementing mandatory regulation not just voluntary action of nps nutrient loading from agricultural lands under regulation 85 in light of the violation of current guidelines for total n concentration in the river colorado ag water quality 2018 moreover kansas has expressed concern about the influence of pollutant loading in colorado on salt se and u concentrations in arkansas river flows into kansas whittemore 2000 2017 the stochastic analysis presented in this paper aims to address these and related concerns by providing a description of the range and likelihood of current nps pollution to the arkansas river this information is needed both to indicate a degree of confidence in evaluating current nps pollution in relation to compliance with regulatory and performance standards and in developing models to support future pollution control decisions the approach is applicable to similar settings where the description and management of broad scale nps pollution is of concern 2 methodology 2 1 study sites and field data a valuable agricultural resource for colorado the larv faces formidable water quality problems linked to return flows from extensive irrigation irrigation deep percolation and canal seepage carry dissolved oxygen and no3 along with other solutes to surficial groundwater which interacts with bedrock near surface shale and its weathered residuum to oxidize and mobilize salts se and u some of these solute laden flows travel through the subsurface to streams where they contribute to high stream concentrations others move upward from the shallow water table into the vadose zone salts carried in this upflux as well as those entering with irrigation water concentrate in the vadose zone due to et resulting in levels that threaten crop production gates et al 2009 morway and gates 2012 bailey et al 2014 alterations in land and water management are needed to achieve a dual aim lessen the pollution of groundwater and streams from solute laden nps return flows while also sustaining or enhancing agricultural productivity bailey et al 2015 gates et al 2016 a key constraint in meeting these objectives is the requirement that the magnitude and pattern of river flows not be altered sufficiently to harm river water diversion rights or flows into kansas as administered by the arkansas river compact this poses a dilemma since the modifications to irrigation management that are needed to meet pollution control and productivity objectives are expected to significantly change the rate and spatiotemporal distribution of return flows to the river assessing the current severity of nps pollution in the larv and then determining how to effectively meet agro environmental objectives while still complying with the river flow constraint will require both a description of the problem using the analysis of field based data and a prescription for solving the problem using dp modeling tools the methods and results described here will enable both a characterization that is couched in notions of uncertainty and a calibration of larv regional models in a manner that accounts for this uncertainty in an appraisal of the models ability to simulate current conditions flows concentrations and loads are estimated here for two representative regions in the larv an upstream study region usr encompassing about 50 600 ha 26 400 ha irrigated and located upstream of john martin reservoir and a downstream study region dsr covering about 55 200 ha 33 000 ha irrigated fig 1 data on flows stages and ec in the river tributaries and canals were compiled from records reported by the united states geological survey usgs and the colorado division of water resources cdwr for stream and canal gage locations shown in fig 1 and designated in table 1 also shown in fig 1 are locations of colorado agricultural meteorological network coagmet stations from which climatic data were obtained sites within the stream network where water quality samples were gathered in conjunction with ec measurements and locations along the river reaches where cross sections were surveyed water quality samples were gathered using peristaltic pumps with site dedicated tubing and were analyzed for solute concentrations in epa approved laboratories ec values were measured at sampling sites using calibrated conductivity probes field and laboratory procedures are described in gates et al 2009 2016 the nature and use of these data are described in sequel sections 2 2 mass balance estimation of return flow

solute the net internal sink source term x can be considered negligible moreover in semi arid agricultural landscapes the tributary loads l i k are themselves often of primarily nps origin in such cases the total nps load to the river reach l n p s can be estimated as the sum of the unaccounted for loads and the measured tributary loads 3 l n p s l u n p s k 1 n i l i k in the case of some non conservative solutes the x term may not be negligible however it cannot easily be accounted for in a simple mass balance model instead an ancillary process based analysis is required which commonly is included in dp river reactive solute transport models such models account for in stream chemical precipitation and dissolution affected by redox reactions sediment deposition and entrainment sorption and desorption to sediments and volatilization when considering non conservative solutes the mass balance eq 2 must be solved for the unknown sum l u n p s x not simply for l u n p s this collective term can then be used as a calibration target for dp models measurement error sparse sampling and or spatio temporal variability make the value of each mass balance component in eqs 1 and 2 ambiguous for each considered time step δt this uncertainty is addressed herein by considering each component of the equations as a random variable whose value is governed by an appropriate probability distribution thereby rendering eqs 1 and 2 stochastic equations the approach taken in modeling each random mass balance component for the regions in the larv are described in the following sections 2 2 1 flow uncertainty volumetric flow rate in the arkansas river and its tributaries is estimated using stage discharge relationships developed for gaging stations maintained by the usgs or cdwr the error in predicting flow rate as a function of measured stage at these locations is assessed using the qualitative accuracy classification of excellent good fair and poor described by novak 1985 a probable error range per expressed as π is used to quantify the error associated with each of these classifications π is a percentage of the variable of interest in this case the flow rate q estimated from the stage discharge relationship harmel and smith 2007 for stream gages classified as excellent π 5 for good π 10 for fair π 15 and for poor π 15 values of flow at the lower and upper end of the per q 1 π 100 and q 1 π 100 are assumed in this study to lie at the 2 5th quantile and the 97 5th quantile respectively of a normal distribution with the measured value taken as the mean for stream gauges classified as poor where an inequality defines the per a fixed value of π 20 was assumed to account for the additional uncertainty the accuracy classifications of q measurements at each of the six stream gage stations in the usr and five stations within or upstream from the dsr fig 1 at the time of this study are summarized in table 1 measurement structures commonly parshall flumes that were used to estimate flow to the five and two irrigation canals respectively with diversion headgates along the study reaches in the usr and dsr fig 1 were assumed to be of good quality with π 10 measured and reported flows from the la junta wastewater treatment facility to the arkansas river and from an augmentation flow return to the river from the rocky ford canal in the usr also were assumed to be of good quality at each stream gauge and canal headgate location the measured daily average q is taken in this study to represent the mean of the normal probability distribution describing the uncertainty due to measurement error at that location the measured daily average q values at the various locations are significantly correlated due to their hydrologic linkages for example the pearson correlation between q r u s and q r d s in the usr and dsr are about 0 80 and 0 88 respectively also since π is a fixed percentage of the measured daily average values the statistics of the respective probability distributions of the correlated qs are themselves also correlated 2 2 2 volume storage change uncertainty the rate of change in δs along the river reach is subject to uncertainty derived from errors in measuring river stage and from spatiotemporal variability in hydraulic geometry along the reach here it is modeled as the sum of storage changes due to changes in average flow area estimated within several segments along the river reach 4 δ s δ t j 1 n r s l j δ a j δ t wherein l j length of the jth segment along the river reach m δ a j average change in cross sectional area of flow within the jth segment along the river reach over δt m2 nrs the number of considered river segments along the reach the value of δ a j is modeled here as 5 δ a j t w j t δ t t w j t 2 h j t δ t h j t wherein t w j t average top width along the jth river segment at time t m and h j t average stage along the jth river segment at time t m following an approach similar to those described by gates and al zahrani 1996a 1996b and by huizenga et al 2017 the value of t w j t along a river reach was estimated as a stochastic power function of measured river stage 6 t w j t τ 1 h j t τ 2 ε t w the geometric parameters τ1 and τ2 in eq 6 are treated as random variables with probability distributions estimated from values determined by a regression analysis of tw

cross sections were surveyed along the river reach in the usr using a total station and global positioning system and analyzed as were14 cross sections in the dsr the maximum likelihood estimator method with kolmogorov smirnov cramer von mises and anderson darling goodness of fit tests were used to fit probability distributions to τ1 τ2 and ε t w using the r statistical software r core team 2016 values of τ1 were estimated to have a logistic probability distribution with mean of 16 8 in the usr and 28 2 in the dsr and standard deviation 13 7 in the usr and 8 8 in the dsr values of τ2 were lognormal with a mean of the log values 1 27 in the usr and 0 43 in the dsr and a standard deviation 1 57 in the usr and 0 65 in the dsr a logistic distribution was fit to the ε t w values with mean of 1 99 m in the usr and 0 87 m in the dsr and standard deviation of 1 8 m in the usr and 1 03 m in the dsr each value of hj t used in eq 6 also was treated as a random variable 7 h j t h ˆ j t ε

in using the stage measured at a single river location to represent the average value over an entire river segment values of ε h were assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and ranging 0 08

wherein p average regional precipitation over δt m p was calculated as the average of measured and reported precipitation from the aforementioned three coagmet stations in the usr and the three coagmet stations in the dsr and was assumed to have a per with π 10 2 2 5 solute concentration uncertainty a number of water samples were gathered from the arkansas river and tributary locations over

from the gage at that location it was assumed that the ec measured at the nearest upstream gage dr0 would sufficiently represent the ec values at dr1 thus these data were used to develop the regression equation at dr1 since the coefficient of determination r 2 and related measures have been deemed inappropriate for describing the goodness of fit of nonlinear regression models kvalseth

which is the square root of the mean of the square of the regression error ε r c i j between the concentration values predicted by the first four terms on the right hand side of eq 12 and the available measured concentration values values of the regression coefficients in eq 12 determined for each location and constituent are summarized in table 2 along with the number of data points n and

duplicate samples collected over numerous locations in both the usr and dsr and the corresponding average of each duplicate pair the statistics of the best fit logistic distributions of ε l c i are

core team 2016 constituent concentrations in effluent from the la junta wastewater treatment plant wwtp which discharges at the mouth of king arroyo also were estimated effluent flow rate is measured

the regression coefficients in eq 14 also using rmse as a comparable measure of goodness of fit values of s and u in eq 14 were estimated from 87 observations as 125 62 and 9 58 respectively with an rmse of 4 2 μg l 1 the best fit distribution of the residual error ε r s e w w t p was logistic with mean 0 37 μg l 1and standard deviation 4 24 μg l 1 samples for c t d s c s o 4 cu c n o 3 n and ec in effluent were not routinely gathered by personnel at the la junta wwtp however since the water supply for the city of la junta is obtained from a battery of pumping wells located near the city it was assumed that relationships between sampled constituent concentrations and ec in monitoring wells near the water supply well field would be similar to those for the wwtp effluent further samples taken from the effluent dominated flow at the mouth of king arroyo just downstream of the wwtp discharge point allowed estimation of a relationship between qwwtp and ec wwtp thus constituent

lie at the 2 5th quantile and the 97 5th quantile respectively of a normal distribution with π 5 for excellent for good π 10 for fair π 15 and for poor π 20 the accuracy classifications of each of the stream gages stations with measured ec are summarized in table 1 2 2 6 mass storage change uncertainty the average rate of change in stored constituent mass along the river reaches δ s m i δ t in the usr and dsr was estimated as 17 δ s m i δ t j 1 n r s c i j l j δ a j δ t wherein δ s m i average change in stored mass of constituent i kg within the river reach over δt d and c i j average concentration of constituent i within the jth segment along the river reach kg m 3 the value of c i j was estimated as the average of c i at the upstream and downstream ends of the jth segment at time t 2 3 stochastic simulation available data allowed the water and mass balance eqs 1 and 2 to be solved for 859 days within the 1461 day period october 1 2006 september 30 2010 in the usr and for 730 days within the same period in the dsr since data were not available for evaluation of the sink source term x eq 2 was solved for the collective term lunps x for each solute constituent these stochastic equations were solved using monte carlo simulation wherein an ensemble of 5000 realizations of all independent random variables were generated from their respective probability distributions using the rtnorm rlogis and rlnorm routines in r r core team 2016 this resulted in an ensemble of 5000 possible realized daily values for the water and solute mass balance components of eqs 1 and 2 for the usr and the dsr along with the corresponding computed values of qunps and each lunps x here we primarily are concerned with the ensemble statistics of mean coefficient of variation cv and probability interval range pir for each day for a given random variable xr the p probability interval is defined as the interval a b such that p a xr b p with b a being the pir 3 results and discussion 3 1 stochastic in stream flow and concentrations time series of the statistics of q r d s at the downstream end of the river reach in the usr and in the dsr are plotted in fig 2 the plots reflect temporal variation due to natural hydrology river administration and irrigation return flows river flow rates are considerably larger in the usr but also more variable reflecting the presence of four major tributaries and drainages and five canal diversions along the usr reach compared to two tributaries and two canals along the dsr moreover river flows in the dsr also are affected by releases from john martin reservoir which are regulated by the arkansas river compact the degree of uncertainty in measured q r d s is similar for both regions reflecting the fair accuracy classification during the study period for both downstream gages example time series of the ensemble statistics of modeled solute concentrations for ctds cse and cu at the upstream and downstream ends of the arkansas river reach for both the usr and dsr are plotted for comparison in figs 3 5 respectively estimated ensemble mean ctds averaged over the study period increases markedly along the river by 789 mg l 1 97 along the reach in the usr and by 695 mgl 1 28 along the dsr with temporal variability reflecting seasonal patterns associated with the high and low river flows depicted in fig 2 the size of the temporally averaged 95 pir is greater in the dsr 1415 mg l 1 averaged between upstream boundary and downstream boundaries than in the usr 686 mg l 1 this is reflective of the larger residual errors in the concentration regression equations for the dsr compared to those for the usr table 2 however the degree of uncertainty relative to the ensemble mean is smaller in the dsr where the average 95 pir is about 51 of the average ensemble mean over the study period compared to the usr where it is about 70 of the average ensemble mean value the respective increases along the usr and dsr are 13 1 μg l 1 106 and 8 3 μg l 1 15 for time averaged ensemble mean cu and are 0 24 μg l 1 2 and 2 7 μg l 1 26 for time averaged ensemble mean cse the variation in percent increases in ctds cu and cse in the usr and dsr may reflect differences in nps solute mass loading rates and redox chemistry as well as differences in riparian and hyporheic zone characteristics along the river reaches the colorado chronic standards of 4 6 μg l 1 and 30 μg l 1 for cse and cu as 85th percentile values respectively are shown in figs 4 and 5 the severe violation of the standards in both regions but more so in the dsr underlines the challenge faced in finding effective ways to mitigate these conditions 3 2 stochastic nonpoint source rates and loads fig 6 presents time series of the ensemble statistics of q u n p s calculated from eq 1 for the arkansas river reaches in the usr and dsr q u n p s is slightly larger in the dsr but more temporally variable in the usr reflecting differences in hydrology river administration and return flow patterns in the usr a much greater fraction of total nps return flows are routed through tributary streams rather than as q u n p s opposite to the conditions in the dsr the time averaged ensemble mean value of q u n p s over the entire study period is 0 038 m3 d 1 km 1 in the usr and 0 043 m3 d 1 km 1 in the dsr the degree of uncertainty is larger in the usr where the average ensemble 95 pir is about 246 of the average ensemble mean over the study period in the usr compared to the dsr where it is about 101 of the average ensemble mean value there are times primarily during the high flow season late may early july where a likelihood of river seepage to groundwater negative q u n p s is indicated due primarily to high river stage and or pumping from irrigation and municipal wells the ensemble mean cv and 95 pir averaged over the entire study period over the irrigation season march 15th november 15th and over the non irrigation season november 16th march 14th are summarized for tds so4 se u and no3 n loads in table 6 for both the usr and the dsr time series plots of the ensemble statistics of lunps x calculated from eq 2 for tds so4 se u and no3 n for the arkansas river reaches in the usr and dsr are presented in figs 7 11 respectively shultz et al 2018 periods of negative lunps x are noted indicating river seepage to groundwater in both study regions the estimated time averaged ensemble mean lunps x for all of the solutes typically is larger over the available dates in the irrigation season than in the non irrigation season this is primarily due to the larger return flow rates driving solute advection in the irrigation season compared to the non irrigation season fig 6 moreover associated increases in no3 concentrations due to fertilizer application may boost oxidative dissolution from shale and weathered shale during the irrigation season as well as inhibit chemical reduction in return flows and in stream flows estimated average ensemble mean values of lunps x over the entire study period are 105 73 33 and 36 larger for tds so4 se and u respectively in the dsr than in the usr since average ensemble mean q u n p s is only about 11 larger in the dsr than in the usr this points to substantially larger concentrations in the return flows in the dsr likely influenced in part by less chemical reduction in the riparian and hyporheic zones along the dsr river corridor for no3 n average ensemble mean lunps x is 25 smaller over the entire study period in the dsr than in the usr corresponding to lower values of c n o 3 n that have been reported in groundwater monitoring wells in the dsr gates et al 2009 2016 perhaps due to lower fertilizer application rates compared to the usr the substantial uncertainty in estimated values of lunps x for the considered solutes is indicated by average ensemble cv values and the average ensemble 95 pir values average ensemble cv values range between 32 and 134 average ensemble 95 pir values are about 2 4 times the average ensemble mean values in the usr and 1 2 times the average ensemble mean values in the dsr such sizable spreads around the ensemble mean are important to consider when calibrating dp regional models tempering how a modeler should interpret a model s predictive performance in the present case modelers might be more flexible in judging the suitability of values of lunps x simulated by a dp model for the usr where the spread estimated by stochastic mass balance using field data is considerably larger than in the case of the dsr mueller price and gates 2008 reported an ensemble mean of 8383 kg d 1 km 1 and an ensemble 90 pir of 13 691 kg d 1 km 1 for total tds loads with sinks sources lnps x to the arkansas river averaged over 58 discrete sampling periods of one to three days within the time frame may 2000 july 2005 in the usr this time frame was quite drought affected with the average flow rate in the arkansas river and the average flow diverted to the canals along the usr study reach being only about 52 and 63 of the respective long term average flows over 1975 2012 by contrast the average measured river and canal flow rates over the study reach within the later time frame of the present study were about 92 and 101 of the corresponding long term averages accordingly the average ensemble mean and 90 pir for tds loads over the time interval of the present study were estimated as 11 623 kg d 1 km 1 and 19 485 kg d 1 km 1 respectively which are markedly larger than values reported in the earlier study the ensemble mean and 90 pir reported by mueller price and gates 2008 for tds loads lnps x to the river in the dsr averaged over 61 discrete sampling periods of one to three days within the drought affected time interval april 2002 october 2005 were 8545 kg d 1 km 1 and 11 183 kg d 1 km 1 respectively over these same sampling periods they reported average ensemble mean and 90 pir values of 0 038 kg d 1 km 1 and 0 028 kg d 1 km 1 for total se loads to the river the average measured flow rate within the arkansas river and diverted to the canals over the study reach in the dsr over this interval were only about 37 and 70 of the respective long term average flows for the same periods over 1975 2012 in contrast during the period of the present study the average measured river and canal flow rates over the study reach were about 66 and 104 of the corresponding long term averages accordingly the average ensemble mean and 90 pir for tds loads over the time interval of the present study were significantly larger at 18 476 kg d 1 km 1 and 13 757 kg d 1 km 1 respectively similarly estimated average ensemble mean and average 90 pir for se loads were respectively 0 070 kg d 1 km 1 and 0 078 kg d 1 km 1 4 conclusions and implications nps flows and solute loads from irrigated landscapes need to be better understood so that they can be better managed with a goal to enhance the water environment without jeopardizing the productivity of irrigated agriculture gaining the required understanding and then making the proper land and water management decisions often are hampered by uncertainty that arises from the varied and difficult to measure properties and processes that affect nps flows and solute loads over expansive regions this paper applies stochastic mass balance models to two river reaches in irrigated regions of the arkansas river valley within a context of uncertainty the models provide statistical distributions of baseline return flow rates and solute loads revealing a wide range of possible values and underscoring the obscure nature of nps processes moreover the mass balance models provide bracketing ranges with associated probability that are useful as calibration targets for dp models such probability intervals allow for a more realistic assessment of whether or not a developed dp model can simulate values that reasonably match field conditions since comparisons are made not simply to a single target value but to a range of values that can be associated with an estimated likelihood of occurrence the results of this study are being used to evaluate the likely degree of current nps pollution and to guide calibration and testing of finite difference models of coupled groundwater stream flow and solute transport in the considered

8488,study region arkansas river in colorado east of the rocky mountains study focus nonpoint source nps flows and solute loads from irrigated lands can markedly shape the water environment describing their diffuse and variable characteristics over vast regions is critical to assessing compliance with regulatory and performance standards for streams yet is particularly ambiguous the nature and degree of this uncertainty is addressed here using a stochastic mass balance of return flow rates and solute loads along two reaches of colorado s arkansas river valley measurement error spatiotemporal variability and trends in flow and concentration variables are considered allowing assessment of return flow rates and mass loading rates of total dissolved solids sulfate selenium uranium and nitrate using probability intervals and other statistics new hydrological insights for the region time series of the statistics of daily nps return flows and mass loading rates within a four year period are estimated and discussed coefficients of variation in nps mass loading rates range from about 32 to 134 for the five solutes considered there is an estimated 95 probability that mass loading rates lie within a range equivalent to 109 to 405 of the temporally averaged mean value depending on the solute and the river reach the sizeable uncertainty quantified in these findings should temper the interpretation modeling regulation and management of irrigation induced nps loading in this and similar settings keywords agricultural nonpoint source pollution water quality irrigation return flow uncertainty analysis arkansas river 1 introduction sediments and solutes in waters that traverse the surface and subsurface across broad agricultural landscapes are a leading contributor to stream pollution usepa 1996 2009 2017 novotny 2003 consequently the management of nonpoint source nps pollution from agricultural lands has been a topic of intense study over the last two decades and is likely to consume much attention and resources in the decades to come xiang et al 2017 for example usepa regulations for the adoption of total maximum daily loads tmdl to meet water quality standards in streams requires both the voluntary management of nps loads as well as the compliance of point source loads with national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permits hoornbeek et al 2013 usepa 2018 however the sheer expanse and variability of diffuse nps flows and their solute loads make them difficult to characterize and control estimating this ambiguity inherent to describing and predicting nps loads is important to management decisions and investments walker and selman 2014 recently highlighted this by citing the risk and uncertainty faced by point dischargers who wish to lower the cost of water treatment needed to comply with npdes permits through trades with agricultural producers to reduce nps loads determining just how much nps return flow and solute loading are actually occurring along a river and then estimating the likelihood that a given course of action would reduce them and by how much can be elusive gathering necessary field data over the large scales associated with nps flow and pollution assessment is difficult and resource intensive mobilizing expansive field monitoring expeditions is time consuming and costly collecting preserving and analyzing water samples for sediment and solute concentrations is especially demanding hence available data often are sparse and intermittent and significant uncertainty is cast over them by the considerable spatiotemporal variability that is typical of nps flow and solute properties moreover every individual measurement that is made at a given location and a given point in time is subject to error due to limitations in equipment and methodology one strategy that can be used to increase information availability is to estimate relationships between those properties that can be more easily and frequently measured and those that are more difficult or expensive to measure for example regression equations that relate solute concentrations to flow and in situ water quality parameters e g electrical conductivity ph can be developed to allow such concentrations to be estimated at locations where flow and in situ measurements are available but where water samples are not however the ambiguity in such regression models must also be accounted for river mass balance methods using field data on flows and concentrations can be beneficial in characterizing the magnitude and extent of existing baseline nps return flows and pollutant loads along a river they also can guide the calibration and testing of process based distributed parameter dp models of the larger stream aquifer system that encompasses the river in such cases the river nps inputs and outputs from or to the adjacent landscape and groundwater aquifer calculated using a river system mass balance can be compared to landscape and aquifer nps outputs inputs to from the river computed using the dp governing equations for flow and mass transport processes within the landscape aquifer system anderson et al 2015 and hill and tiedeman 2007 point out that it is advisable that dp groundwater models be calibrated against estimates of groundwater flow though such estimates are often uncertain rather than solely against estimates of groundwater head the approach of using a river mass balance to estimate groundwater flow and overland flow in exchange with rivers to calibrate dp models is most suitable under the following conditions 1 river mass balance estimates are used as targets for dp model simulated values that are influenced predominately by landscape and aquifer system flow and transport processes thereby promoting a higher degree of independence between the reciprocal computed inputs and outputs of the landscape aquifer system and the adjacent river system and 2 river mass balance estimates are not the sole targets for dp model calibration but are used in conjunction with other data like groundwater levels groundwater concentrations river concentrations evapotranspiration rates etc several investigators have used a mass balance approach to estimate nps return flows and solute mass loading along a stretch of a river jaworski et al 1992 jain 1996 jha et al 2005 jain et al 2007 such studies commonly neglect the effect of storage changes and internal sinks and sources associated with redox reactions adsorption and settling volatilization etc within a river reach to calculate unknown mass loading to or from the reach as the difference between measured in stream mass load fluxes at the downstream and upstream ends other researchers have used a variety of statistical methods to account for uncertainty primarily related to the estimation of in stream nutrient mass load fluxes often near the outlet of a watershed harmel et al 2006 examined uncertainty in several procedural categories for measuring key properties used in the calculation of in stream solute mass fluxes streamflow measurement collection of water quality samples sample preservation and storage and laboratory analysis cumulative error within each category was estimated using a root mean square error propagation method and was found to be substantial under typical conditions jiang et al 2014 used an error propagation method to account for flow and concentration measurement uncertainty as well as uncertainty in interpolating between measurements in describing the overall uncertainty in calculating in stream river nitrate nitrogen load fluxes rode and suhr 2007 provide an assessment of component uncertainties in estimating concentrations and loads of not only nutrients but also some heavy metals and biological compounds at in stream locations mueller price and gates 2008 expanded the consideration of uncertainty from that associated with the estimation of in stream mass load fluxes to that associated with the mass balance estimation of nonpoint source loads returning along river reaches from the landscape and aquifer they used a stochastic mass balance to account for multiple sources of uncertainty common to describing nps pollution in an application to irrigated regions of colorado s lower arkansas river valley larv employing an approach similar to mueller price and gates 2008 the present paper uses a more extensive data set to consider both nps flows and solute loads for two representative river reaches in the larv and estimates them as stochastic time series of daily rates rather than as uncertain quantities within discrete multi day sampling periods this allows an examination of seasonal variability in estimated measures of uncertainty also the time period considered here extends four years beyond the drought affected years reported by mueller price and gates 2008 permitting a comparison of the conditions within the two periods moreover the number of considered solutes is expanded here to include sulfate so4 uranium u and nitrate no3 as well as the previously considered total dissolved solids tds and selenium se a variety of available field data are used to reconstruct estimates of stream flows and concentrations along with diffuse flows and loads that return from the irrigated landscape and aquifer these data include gaged stream flows and water levels main stem and tributaries gaged canal diversions surveys of stream cross sections climatic variable records measurements of electrical conductivity ec as specific conductance at 25 c and intermittent water quality samples managing nps pollution in colorado s larv has reached a critical stage the colorado department of public health and environment cdphe is looking to administer tmdls for se especially for the wastewater treatment plant of the city of pueblo due to violation of state and recommended epa chronic standards on river concentrations also by 2022 colorado is considering implementing mandatory regulation not just voluntary action of nps nutrient loading from agricultural lands under regulation 85 in light of the violation of current guidelines for total n concentration in the river colorado ag water quality 2018 moreover kansas has expressed concern about the influence of pollutant loading in colorado on salt se and u concentrations in arkansas river flows into kansas whittemore 2000 2017 the stochastic analysis presented in this paper aims to address these and related concerns by providing a description of the range and likelihood of current nps pollution to the arkansas river this information is needed both to indicate a degree of confidence in evaluating current nps pollution in relation to compliance with regulatory and performance standards and in developing models to support future pollution control decisions the approach is applicable to similar settings where the description and management of broad scale nps pollution is of concern 2 methodology 2 1 study sites and field data a valuable agricultural resource for colorado the larv faces formidable water quality problems linked to return flows from extensive irrigation irrigation deep percolation and canal seepage carry dissolved oxygen and no3 along with other solutes to surficial groundwater which interacts with bedrock near surface shale and its weathered residuum to oxidize and mobilize salts se and u some of these solute laden flows travel through the subsurface to streams where they contribute to high stream concentrations others move upward from the shallow water table into the vadose zone salts carried in this upflux as well as those entering with irrigation water concentrate in the vadose zone due to et resulting in levels that threaten crop production gates et al 2009 morway and gates 2012 bailey et al 2014 alterations in land and water management are needed to achieve a dual aim lessen the pollution of groundwater and streams from solute laden nps return flows while also sustaining or enhancing agricultural productivity bailey et al 2015 gates et al 2016 a key constraint in meeting these objectives is the requirement that the magnitude and pattern of river flows not be altered sufficiently to harm river water diversion rights or flows into kansas as administered by the arkansas river compact this poses a dilemma since the modifications to irrigation management that are needed to meet pollution control and productivity objectives are expected to significantly change the rate and spatiotemporal distribution of return flows to the river assessing the current severity of nps pollution in the larv and then determining how to effectively meet agro environmental objectives while still complying with the river flow constraint will require both a description of the problem using the analysis of field based data and a prescription for solving the problem using dp modeling tools the methods and results described here will enable both a characterization that is couched in notions of uncertainty and a calibration of larv regional models in a manner that accounts for this uncertainty in an appraisal of the models ability to simulate current conditions flows concentrations and loads are estimated here for two representative regions in the larv an upstream study region usr encompassing about 50 600 ha 26 400 ha irrigated and located upstream of john martin reservoir and a downstream study region dsr covering about 55 200 ha 33 000 ha irrigated fig 1 data on flows stages and ec in the river tributaries and canals were compiled from records reported by the united states geological survey usgs and the colorado division of water resources cdwr for stream and canal gage locations shown in fig 1 and designated in table 1 also shown in fig 1 are locations of colorado agricultural meteorological network coagmet stations from which climatic data were obtained sites within the stream network where water quality samples were gathered in conjunction with ec measurements and locations along the river reaches where cross sections were surveyed water quality samples were gathered using peristaltic pumps with site dedicated tubing and were analyzed for solute concentrations in epa approved laboratories ec values were measured at sampling sites using calibrated conductivity probes field and laboratory procedures are described in gates et al 2009 2016 the nature and use of these data are described in sequel sections 2 2 mass balance estimation of return flow

solute mass m within the river reach over δt and x average net internal sink or source rate of solute mass depletion accumulation within the reach mt 1 when considering a relatively conservative solute the net internal sink source term x can be considered negligible moreover in semi arid agricultural landscapes the tributary loads l i k are themselves often of primarily nps origin in such cases the total nps load to the river reach l n p s can be estimated as the sum of the unaccounted for loads and the measured tributary loads 3 l n p s l u n p s k 1 n i l i k in the case of some non conservative solutes the x term may not be negligible however it cannot easily be accounted for in a simple mass balance model instead an ancillary process based analysis is required which commonly is included in dp river reactive solute transport models such models account for in stream chemical precipitation and dissolution affected by redox reactions sediment deposition and entrainment sorption and desorption to sediments and volatilization when considering non conservative solutes the mass balance eq 2 must be solved for the unknown sum l u n p s x not simply for l u n p s this collective term can then be used as a calibration target for dp models measurement error sparse sampling and or spatio temporal variability make the value of each mass balance component in eqs 1 and 2 ambiguous for each considered time step δt this uncertainty is addressed herein by considering each component of the equations as a random variable whose value is governed by an appropriate probability distribution thereby rendering eqs 1 and 2 stochastic equations the approach taken in modeling each random mass balance component for the regions in the larv are described in the following sections 2 2 1 flow uncertainty volumetric flow rate in the arkansas river and its tributaries is estimated using stage discharge relationships developed for gaging stations maintained by the usgs or cdwr the error in predicting flow rate as a function of measured stage at these locations is assessed using the qualitative accuracy classification of excellent good fair and poor described by novak 1985 a probable error range per expressed as π is used to quantify the error associated with each of these classifications π is a percentage of the variable of interest in this case the flow rate q estimated from the stage discharge relationship harmel and smith 2007 for stream gages classified as excellent π 5 for good π 10 for fair π 15 and for poor π 15 values of flow at the lower and upper end of the per q 1 π 100 and q 1 π 100 are assumed in this study to lie at the 2 5th quantile and the 97 5th quantile respectively of a normal distribution with the measured value taken as the mean for stream gauges classified as poor where an inequality defines the per a fixed value of π 20 was assumed to account for the additional uncertainty the accuracy classifications of q measurements at each of the six stream gage stations in the usr and five stations within or upstream from the dsr fig 1 at the time of this study are summarized in table 1 measurement structures commonly parshall flumes that were used to estimate flow to the five and two irrigation canals respectively with diversion headgates along the study reaches in the usr and dsr fig 1 were assumed to be of good quality with π 10 measured and reported flows from the la junta wastewater treatment facility to the arkansas river and from an augmentation flow return to the river from the rocky ford canal in the usr also were assumed to be of good quality at each stream gauge and canal headgate location the measured daily average q is taken in this study to represent the mean of the normal probability distribution describing the uncertainty due to measurement error at that location the measured daily average q values at the various locations are significantly correlated due to their hydrologic linkages for example the pearson correlation between q r u s and q r d s in the usr and dsr are about 0 80 and 0 88 respectively also since π is a fixed percentage of the measured daily average values the statistics of the respective probability distributions of the correlated qs are themselves also correlated 2 2 2 volume storage change uncertainty the rate of change in δs along the river reach is subject to uncertainty derived from errors in measuring river stage and from spatiotemporal variability in hydraulic geometry along the reach here it is modeled as the sum of storage changes due to changes in average flow area estimated within several segments along the river reach 4 δ s δ t j 1 n r s l j δ a j δ t wherein l j length of the jth segment along the river reach m δ a j average change in cross sectional area of flow within the jth segment along the river reach over δt m2 nrs the number of considered river segments along the reach the value of δ a j is modeled here as 5 δ a j t w j t δ t t w j t 2 h j t δ t h j t wherein t w j t average top width along the jth river segment at time t m and h j t average stage along the jth river segment at time t m following an approach similar to those described by gates and al zahrani 1996a 1996b and by huizenga et al 2017 the value of t w j t along a river reach was estimated as a stochastic power function of measured river stage 6 t w j t τ 1 h j t τ 2 ε t w the geometric parameters τ1 and τ2 in eq 6 are treated as random variables with probability distributions estimated from values determined by a regression analysis of tw versus h at a number of surveyed cross sections along a river reach the term ε t w is a residual error associated with fitting a regression equation of tw versus h for a river reach a total of 26 cross sections were surveyed along the river reach in the usr using a total station and global positioning system and analyzed as were14 cross sections in the dsr the maximum likelihood estimator method with kolmogorov smirnov cramer von mises and anderson darling goodness of fit tests were used to fit probability distributions to τ1 τ2 and ε t w using the r statistical software r core team 2016 values of τ1 were estimated to have a logistic probability distribution with mean of 16 8 in the usr and 28 2 in the dsr and standard deviation 13 7 in the usr and 8 8 in the dsr values of τ2 were lognormal with a mean of the log values 1 27 in the usr and 0 43 in the dsr and a standard deviation 1 57 in the usr and 0 65 in the dsr a logistic distribution was fit to the ε t w values with mean of 1 99 m in the usr and 0 87 m in the dsr and standard deviation of 1 8 m in the usr and 1 03 m in the dsr each value of hj t used in eq 6 also was treated as a random variable 7 h j t h ˆ j t ε h wherein h ˆ j t the measured and reported value of stage at time t at the gaging station representing the jth segment m and ε h random error term accounting both for measurement error and for error in using the stage measured at a single river location to represent the average value over an entire river segment values of ε h were assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and ranging 0 08 m between the 2 5th and 97 5th quantiles 2 2 3 evaporation uncertainty evaporation from the free water surface along a river reach q e was calculated as a product of the water surface area along the river reach and the calculated rate of free water evaporation which depends upon uncertain climatic data available in the usr and dsr 8 q e j 1 n r s a w s j k w e e t o wherein a w s j l j t w j t δ

the average of computed and reported values from three coagmet stations in the usr fwl01 near fowler rfd01 near rocky ford and ljt01 near la junta and from three coagmet stations in the dsr lam04 near lamar hly02 near hartman and hly01 near holly comparisons of e t ˆ 0 values with values measured in a large weighing lysimeter at the csu arkansas valley research center near rocky ford co indicate that ε e t is a normally distributed error with a mean of about 0 00047 m i e e t ˆ 0 under estimates e t o and with 0 00098 m between the 2 5th and 97 5th quantiles the value of k w e is used to

quantiles and yc reference crop height taken to be 0 5 m herein 2 2 4 precipitation uncertainty precipitation onto the water surface of the river reach q p was estimated as 11 q p j 1 n r s a w s j p wherein p average regional precipitation over δt m p was calculated as the average of measured and reported precipitation from the aforementioned three coagmet stations in the usr and the three coagmet stations in the dsr and was assumed to have a per with π 10 2 2 5 solute concentration uncertainty a number of water samples were gathered from the arkansas river and tributary locations over the period 2006 2015 in the usr and 2003 2015 in the dsr for analysis of tds concentration c t d s so4 concentration c s o 4 total dissolved se concentration cse total dissolved u concentration cu and no3 as n concentration c n o 3 n the majority of these samples were collected between 2006 and 2011 with approximately 70 occurring within the modelled time period in the usr and 50 occurring within the time period in the dsr at the times that water samples were gathered data on q and ec also were available at a number of locations within the stream system allowing relationships of the following form to be estimated for concentrations within the river and tributaries 12 c i j t a e c k t b q k t c d e c k t q k t e ε r c i j ε l c i wherein c i j t concentration of constituent i at location j along the river reach or at a tributary mouth and at day t mg l 1 for c t d s c s o 4 and c n o 3 n or μg l 1 for cse and cu q k t average daily flow rate at location k at or near location j at day t m3s 1 e c k t average daily ec dsm 1 at location k at or near location j at day t a b c d and e are empirical constants determined from regression analysis of available measured values of c i j e c k and q k and ε r c i j regression residual error for estimating c i j mg l 1 for c t d s c s o 4 and c n o 3 n or μg l 1 for cse and cu and ε l c i error in sampling and laboratory analysis of concentration c i j in water samples used to develop the regression equation at location j mg l 1 for c t d s c s o 4 and c n o 3 n or μg l 1 for cse and cu in the dsr at dr1 no ec data were available from the gage at that location it was assumed that the ec measured at the nearest upstream gage dr0 would sufficiently represent the ec values at dr1 thus these data were used to develop the regression equation at dr1 since the coefficient of determination r 2 and related measures have been deemed inappropriate for describing the goodness of fit of nonlinear regression models kvalseth 1985 sapra 2014 we instead report the root mean square error rmse here the general guidelines laid out in kvalseth 1985 bennett et al 2013 and archontoulis and miguez 2015 were followed in employing the nonlinear least squares nls module of the r software package r core team 2016 to estimate the regression coefficients in eq 12 using the rmse coefficient values were selected to minimize the rmse which is the square root of the mean of the square of the regression error ε r c i j between the concentration values predicted by the first four terms on the right hand side of eq 12 and the available measured concentration values values of the regression coefficients in eq 12 determined for each location and constituent are summarized in table 2 along with the number of data points n and the rmse values for comparison to rmse the means of the observed values for each location and constituent also are given the regression error ε r c i j for each location and constituent was modeled as a random variable with best fit probability distribution and associated statistics determined in r using kolmogorov smirnoff and andersen darling statistics r core team 2016 and are summarized in table 2 the error ε l c i was modeled as a random variable with a probability distribution fit to the differences between laboratory determined values of ci for each sample within numerous pairs of duplicate samples collected over numerous locations in both the usr and dsr and the corresponding average of each duplicate pair the statistics of the best fit logistic distributions of ε l c i are summarized in table 3 for the different constituents it was found that constituent concentrations within the arkansas river at the locations of canal diversions could be related to the flow rate at the upstream end of the river reach q r u s the ec at the upstream end of the river reach e c r u s and the distance x m of the canal headgate diversion from the upstream end 13 c i j t g e c r u s l q r u s m n e c j t q r u s p x q ε r c i d ε l c i wherein c i j t concentration of constituent i at location j of a diversion from the river at time t mg l 1 for c t d s c s o 4 and c n o 3 n or μg

estimating c i j t mg l 1 for c t d s c s o 4 and c n o 3 n or μg l 1 for cse and cu at diversion locations data on c i collected from numerous locations along the river reach were used to develop the relationships described by eq 13 regression coefficient values in eq 13 determined for each diversion location and constituent using the nls module in r along with rmse values are summarized in table 4 also summarized in table 4 are the best fit probability distributions and statistics of the regression errors ε r c i d determined in r using kolmogorov smirnoff and andersen darling statistics r core team 2016 constituent concentrations in effluent from the la junta wastewater treatment plant wwtp which discharges at the mouth of king arroyo also were estimated effluent flow rate is measured continuously and in the case of se effluent samples are periodically taken and analyzed for cse this allowed a linear relationship to be developed 14 c s e w w t p t s q w w t p t u ε r s e w w t p ε l c i wherein c s e w w t p t se concentration in wastewater treatment plant effluent at day t μg l 1 q w w t p t average daily wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge m3s 1 for day t s and u are empirical regression coefficients and ε r s e w w t p regression residual error for estimating c s e w w t p t μg l 1 the linear least squares lm module in r r core team 2016 was used to estimate the regression coefficients in eq 14 also using rmse as a comparable measure of goodness of fit values of s and u in eq 14 were estimated from 87 observations as 125 62 and 9 58 respectively with an rmse of 4 2 μg l 1 the best fit distribution of the residual error ε r s e w w t p was logistic with mean 0 37 μg l 1and standard deviation 4 24 μg l 1 samples for c t d s c s o 4 cu c n o 3 n and ec in effluent were not routinely gathered by personnel at the la junta wwtp however since the water supply for the city of la junta is obtained from a battery of pumping wells located near the city it was assumed that relationships between sampled constituent concentrations and ec in monitoring wells near the water supply well field would be similar to those for the wwtp effluent further samples taken from the effluent dominated flow at the mouth of king arroyo just downstream of the wwtp discharge point allowed estimation of a relationship between qwwtp and ec wwtp thus constituent concentrations in wwtp effluent with the exception of cse which was estimated using eq 14 were estimated from 15 c i w w t p t v e c w w t p t w ε r i w w t p t ε l c i wherein c i w w t p t concentration of constituent i in wastewater treatment plant effluent at day t μg l 1 e c w w t p t average daily ec of treatment plant effluent dsm 1 for day t v and w are empirical coefficients determined from regression analysis of available measured values of c i and ec in monitoring wells near the la junta well field and ε r i w w t p t regression residual error for estimating c i w w t p t at day t μg l 1 based upon the analysis of the well field data values of v w and associated rmse values determined for eq 15 are summarized in table 5 for the different constituents in la junta wwtp effluent the probability distribution of ε r i w w t p t is logistic for each one of the constituents and the associated statistics are summarized in table 5 the value of e c w w t p t in eq 15 on a given day is estimated from the available daily q w w t p t using 16 e c w w t p t y q w w t p t z ε r e c w w t p wherein y and z are empirical coefficients determined from regression analysis of available q w w t p and corresponding ec in water samples gathered from king arroyo just downstream of the effluent discharge point and ε r e c w w t p regression residual error for estimating e c w w t p t ds m 1 based upon the analysis of the king arroyo data values of y and z in eq 16 were estimated from 19 observations as 44 92 and 2 21 respectively the rmse is 0 71 ds m 1 and the best fit distribution of the residual error ε r e c w w t p is logistic with mean 0 03 ds m 1and standard deviation 0 73 ds m 1 measured values of ec at the stream gauges used in eqs 12 and 13 were assumed to be subject to measurement error with an associated per similar to the treatment of measured q values hence values of ec at the lower and upper end of the per ec 1 π 100 and ec 1 π 100 were assumed to lie at the 2 5th quantile and the 97 5th quantile respectively of a normal distribution with π 5 for excellent for good π 10 for fair π 15 and for poor π 20 the accuracy classifications of each of the stream gages stations with measured ec are summarized in table 1 2 2 6 mass storage change uncertainty the average rate of change in stored constituent mass along the river reaches δ s m i δ t in the usr and dsr was estimated as 17 δ s m i δ t j 1 n r s c i j l j δ a j δ t wherein δ s m i average change in stored mass of constituent i kg within the river reach over δt d and c i j average concentration of constituent i within the jth segment along the river reach kg m 3 the value of c i j was estimated as the average of c i at the upstream and downstream ends of the jth segment at time t 2 3 stochastic simulation available data allowed the water and mass balance eqs 1 and 2 to be solved for 859 days within the 1461 day period october 1 2006 september 30 2010 in the usr and for 730 days within the same period in the dsr since data were not available for evaluation of the sink source term x eq 2 was solved for the collective term lunps x for each solute constituent these stochastic equations were solved using monte carlo simulation wherein an ensemble of 5000 realizations of all independent random variables were generated from their respective probability distributions using the rtnorm rlogis and rlnorm routines in r r core team 2016 this resulted in an ensemble of 5000 possible realized daily values for the water and solute mass balance components of eqs 1 and 2 for the usr and the dsr along with the corresponding computed values of qunps and each lunps x here we primarily are concerned with the ensemble statistics of mean coefficient of variation cv and probability interval range pir for each day for a given random variable xr the p probability interval is defined as the interval a b such that p a xr b p with b a being the pir 3 results and discussion 3 1 stochastic in stream flow and concentrations time series of the statistics of q r d s at the downstream end of the river reach in the usr and in the dsr are plotted in fig 2 the plots reflect temporal variation due to natural hydrology river administration and irrigation return flows river flow rates are considerably larger in the usr but also more variable reflecting the presence of four major tributaries and drainages and five canal diversions along the usr reach compared to two tributaries and two canals along the dsr moreover river flows in the dsr also are affected by releases from john martin reservoir which are regulated by the arkansas river compact the degree of uncertainty in measured q r d s is similar for both regions reflecting the fair accuracy classification during the study period for both downstream gages example time series of the ensemble statistics of modeled solute concentrations for ctds cse and cu at the upstream and downstream ends of the arkansas river reach for both the usr and dsr are plotted for comparison in figs 3 5 respectively estimated ensemble mean ctds averaged over the study period increases markedly along the river by 789 mg l 1 97 along the reach in the usr and by 695 mgl 1 28 along the dsr with temporal variability reflecting seasonal patterns associated with the high and low river flows depicted in fig 2 the size of the temporally averaged 95 pir is greater in the dsr 1415 mg l 1 averaged between upstream boundary and downstream boundaries than in the usr 686 mg l 1 this is reflective of the larger residual errors in the concentration regression equations for the dsr compared to those for the usr table 2 however the degree of uncertainty relative to the ensemble mean is smaller in the dsr where the average 95 pir is about 51 of the average ensemble mean over the study period compared to the usr where it is about 70 of the average ensemble mean value the respective increases along the usr and dsr are 13 1 μg l 1 106 and 8 3 μg l 1 15 for time averaged ensemble mean cu and are 0 24 μg l 1 2 and 2 7 μg l 1 26 for time averaged ensemble mean cse the variation in percent increases in ctds cu and cse in the usr and dsr may reflect differences in nps solute mass loading rates and redox chemistry as well as differences in riparian and hyporheic zone characteristics along the river reaches the colorado chronic standards of 4 6 μg l 1 and 30 μg l 1 for cse and cu as 85th percentile values respectively are shown in figs 4 and 5 the severe violation of the standards in both regions but more so in the dsr underlines the challenge faced in finding effective ways to mitigate these conditions 3 2 stochastic nonpoint source rates and loads fig 6 presents time series of the ensemble statistics of q u n p s calculated from eq 1 for the arkansas river reaches in the usr and dsr q u n p s is slightly larger in the dsr but more temporally variable in the usr reflecting differences in hydrology river administration and return flow patterns in the usr a much greater fraction of total nps return flows are routed through tributary streams rather than as q u n p s opposite to the conditions in the dsr the time averaged ensemble mean value of q u n p s over the entire study period is 0 038 m3 d 1 km 1 in the usr and 0 043 m3 d 1 km 1 in the dsr the degree of uncertainty is larger in the usr where the average ensemble 95 pir is about 246 of the average ensemble mean over the study period in the usr compared to the dsr where it is about 101 of the average ensemble mean value there are times primarily during the high flow season late may early july where a likelihood of river seepage to groundwater negative q u n p s is indicated due primarily to high river stage and or pumping from irrigation and municipal wells the ensemble mean cv and 95 pir averaged over the entire study period over the irrigation season march 15th november 15th and over the non irrigation season november 16th march 14th are summarized for tds so4 se u and no3 n loads in table 6 for both the usr and the dsr time series plots of the ensemble statistics of lunps x calculated from eq 2 for tds so4 se u and no3 n for the arkansas river reaches in the usr and dsr are presented in figs 7 11 respectively shultz et al 2018 periods of negative lunps x are noted indicating river seepage to groundwater in both study regions the estimated time averaged ensemble mean lunps x for all of the solutes typically is larger over the available dates in the irrigation season than in the non irrigation season this is primarily due to the larger return flow rates driving solute advection in the irrigation season compared to the non irrigation season fig 6 moreover associated increases in no3 concentrations due to fertilizer application may boost oxidative dissolution from shale and weathered shale during the irrigation season as well as inhibit chemical reduction in return flows and in stream flows estimated average ensemble mean values of lunps x over the entire study period are 105 73 33 and 36 larger for tds so4 se and u respectively in the dsr than in the usr since average ensemble mean q u n p s is only about 11 larger in the dsr than in the usr this points to substantially larger concentrations in the return flows in the dsr likely influenced in part by less chemical reduction in the riparian and hyporheic zones along the dsr river corridor for no3 n average ensemble mean lunps x is 25 smaller over the entire study period in the dsr than in the usr corresponding to lower values of c n o 3 n that have been reported in groundwater monitoring wells in the dsr gates et al 2009 2016 perhaps due to lower fertilizer application rates compared to the usr the substantial uncertainty in estimated values of lunps x for the considered solutes is indicated by average ensemble cv values and the average ensemble 95 pir values average ensemble cv values range between 32 and 134 average ensemble 95 pir values are about 2 4 times the average ensemble mean values in the usr and 1 2 times the average ensemble mean values in the dsr such sizable spreads around the ensemble mean are important to consider when calibrating dp regional models tempering how a modeler should interpret a model s predictive performance in the present case modelers might be more flexible in judging the suitability of values of lunps x simulated by a dp model for the usr where the spread estimated by stochastic mass balance using field data is considerably larger than in the case of the dsr mueller price and gates 2008 reported an ensemble mean of 8383 kg d 1 km 1 and an ensemble 90 pir of 13 691 kg d 1 km 1 for total tds loads with sinks sources lnps x to the arkansas river averaged over 58 discrete sampling periods of one to three days within the time frame may 2000 july 2005 in the usr this time frame was quite drought affected with the average flow rate in the arkansas river and the average flow diverted to the canals along the usr study reach being only about 52 and 63 of the respective long term average flows over 1975 2012 by contrast the average measured river and canal flow rates over the study reach within the later time frame of the present study were about 92 and 101 of the corresponding long term averages accordingly the average ensemble mean and 90 pir for tds loads over the time interval of the present study were estimated as 11 623 kg d 1 km 1 and 19 485 kg d 1 km 1 respectively which are markedly larger than values reported in the earlier study the ensemble mean and 90 pir reported by mueller price and gates 2008 for tds loads lnps x to the river in the dsr averaged over 61 discrete sampling periods of one to three days within the drought affected time interval april 2002 october 2005 were 8545 kg d 1 km 1 and 11 183 kg d 1 km 1 respectively over these same sampling periods they reported average ensemble mean and 90 pir values of 0 038 kg d 1 km 1 and 0 028 kg d 1 km 1 for total se loads to the river the average measured flow rate within the arkansas river and diverted to the canals over the study reach in the dsr over this interval were only about 37 and 70 of the respective long term average flows for the same periods over 1975 2012 in contrast during the period of the present study the average measured river and canal flow rates over the study reach were about 66 and 104 of the corresponding long term averages accordingly the average ensemble mean and 90 pir for tds loads over the time interval of the present study were significantly larger at 18 476 kg d 1 km 1 and 13 757 kg d 1 km 1 respectively similarly estimated average ensemble mean and average 90 pir for se loads were respectively 0 070 kg d 1 km 1 and 0 078 kg d 1 km 1 4 conclusions and implications nps flows and solute loads from irrigated landscapes need to be better understood so that they can be better managed with a goal to enhance the water environment without jeopardizing the productivity of irrigated agriculture gaining the required understanding and then making the proper land and water management decisions often are hampered by uncertainty that arises from the varied and difficult to measure properties and processes that affect nps flows and solute loads over expansive regions this paper applies stochastic mass balance models to two river reaches in irrigated regions of the arkansas river valley within a context of uncertainty the models provide statistical distributions of baseline return flow rates and solute loads revealing a wide range of possible values and underscoring the obscure nature of nps processes moreover the mass balance models provide bracketing ranges with associated probability that are useful as calibration targets for dp models such probability intervals allow for a more realistic assessment of whether or not a developed dp model can simulate values that reasonably match field conditions since comparisons are made not simply to a single target value but to a range of values that can be associated with an estimated likelihood of occurrence the results of this study are being used to evaluate the likely degree of current nps pollution and to guide calibration and testing of finite difference models of coupled groundwater stream flow and solute transport in the considered

provides future flood risk management for floods that exceed design levels fedl based on past flood control systems and land use considering the natural topography in the area that was inundated by flood water from the kinu river new hydrological insights for the region the results of the literature research reveal flood management methods for preventing inundation of the city of mitsukaido such as drainage using a discontinuous embankment and a low lying backswamp in addition the areas inundated by this flood were mainly those around a high altitude natural levee and residential land in the

fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc pointed out that localized torrential rain is becoming more intense and frequent in mid latitude areas ipcc 2013 therefore the preparation of countermeasures against floods that exceed design levels fedl is an urgent issue in japan and the monsoon region of asia urban areas have traditionally relied on river canalization as a flood control method to mitigate flood hazards but this approach has been criticized for degrading riverine ecosystems and increasing long term flood risk pedroli et al 2002 rohde et al 2006 alternative flood management concepts have emerged which emphasize integrated watershed management and structural and nonstructural measures schneidergruber et al 2004 recently the concept of ecosystem based disaster risk reduction eco drr has emerged renaud 2013 in which disaster prevention measures themselves are required to strengthen ecosystem function iwasa and nishida 2017 examples of such countermeasures include conserving wetlands and floodplains wharton and gilvear 2007 birol et al 2009 hey and philippi 1995 gopakumar 2011 using paddy fields natuhara 2013 yu et al 2006 yoon

embankments saito and fukuoka 2013 gouldby et al 2008 klijn et al 2015 nillesen and kok 2015 van veelen et al 2015 and reducing vulnerability in inland areas it is also important to apply traditional knowledge and facilities for flood control in japan localized flood control methods such as flood control forests okuma 1997 nagao 2004 watanabe and hirakawa 2010 and circle levees hori and tanabe 2012 nakajima et al 2005 hori et al 2008 shimazu 2013 were developed in ancient times such localized technology is now deemed effective for reducing vulnerability the present research is aimed at the flooding that occurred in september 2015 when the kinu river burst its banks causing enormous damage to the city of joso in ibaraki prefecture in japan this event occurred because of heavy rainfall 511 mm per basin area fell during three days roughly 1 110 of the annual exceedance probability sayama and takara 2016a comprehensive flood management policy throughout the watershed basin was shown to be effective against large scale floods a japanese river council report in 2000 pointed out the importance of various countermeasures against large scale floods in rivers and watersheds to minimize flood damage recognizing the delineation of correspondence with flood control facilities land use management strengthening of partnerships between rivers and sewerage systems and hazard map development were described as important issues japanese river council 2000 furthermore measures that have been proposed for adapting to climate change include i conserving natural levees or consecutive embankments that are intended to stop floods from spreading ii flood management considering land use and iii providing guidance to local residents regarding urban functions in areas of low flood risk japanese council for social infrastructure 2015 a river has both a natural history and a social history the former directs the latter and the latter reflects the former in addition social history takes at least several thousand years and is the result of continuous experiments that continue today koide 1974 therefore countermeasures against fedl should be designed to accept not only changes in the force of the disaster but also potential future social changes based on historical land use and development furthermore issues such as rapid population reduction overcrowding in urban areas depopulation in rural areas and reduction in public investment are currently aggravating the situation in japan in dealing with countermeasures against fedl it is necessary to take these social issues into consideration the purpose of this paper is to propose countermeasures against fedl the aim is to reduce the flood risk and control the flood water based on past flood control systems and land use the target is the flooding of the kinu river in the heavy rainfall disaster of september 2015 in the districts of kanto and tohoku hereinafter the disaster is referred to as kt2015 2 methodology 2 1 geographical characteristics of the study area this study is focused on the area surrounded by the kinu river and the kokai river that was inundated by kt2015 see fig 1 to the west of the kinu river is the alluvium based floodplain of the kinu and kokai rivers known as akuto this floodplain is roughly 12 m sea level and is used for paddy fields the community extends above the natural levee the urban district of the city of mitsukaido is located at the southern end of the floodplain where the kinu and kokai rivers are the closest a flat and gently undulating plateau extends southward on the east of the kinu river and is used for upland farming hill bottom intricately complicated in the plateau and applied to paddy field called yatsuda mitsukaido city history editing committee 1983 fig 2 shows the flow channel of the object area in about ce 1 000 the kinu river flowed into lake kasumigaura through the current flow channel of the kokai river the kinu river joined together with the kokai river at tobanoe where many lakes were formed blocked by the natural levee of the kinu river editing committee of 100 years history of the tone river et al 1987 2 2 development history in the target area before the meiji period before 1868 because the natural and social histories of watersheds are closely related to each other it is important to understand the development of study areas and changes to rivers due to anthropogenic activity to take measures against fedl particularly because these areas have been developed since ancient times to produce new fields for irrigation and for flood control therefore a river channel s current situation and land use in the area are based on previous development there is no method for knowing development and water management histories before the modern era prior to the meiji period other than historical documents therefore through an exhaustive survey of the literature we revealed the following i anthropogenic modification of the river channel ii water management details including drainage and iii the floodplain s development history 2 3 understanding of land use change and past flood control systems after the meiji period land use and residential area development significantly changed because of an increasing degree of flood safety due to the progress of flood prevention projects based on the knowledge of the development history in former eras from a literature survey we have described land use changes and past flood control systems we accomplished this using a landform classification map for flood control geographical survey institute 2007 and a rapid survey map drawn in 1883 1890 by the survey department of the staff headquarters of the imperial japanese army national institute for agro environmental sciences 2015 the relationship between land use change and microtopography was understood by comparing these maps in addition we analyzed past flood control systems by the locations and ages of embankments described in the landform classification map 2 4 field survey of existing situation of past flood control systems it is possible that the past flood control systems that we analyzed using the landform classification map have disappeared owing to estate or farmland development because the presence or absence of past flood control systems influenced the behavior of kt2015 floodwaters and would influence floodwater behavior in future large scale floods we conducted a field survey to understand the existing situation on the basis of our literature survey and field study we propose various countermeasures against fedl in section 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 development history of the inundated area broad scale development such as the development of new fields in the alluvial plain of the kinu and kokai rivers was conducted after the 17th century a river improvement work for enhancing the degree of safety against floods was conducted in conjunction with the development of new fields the regional development history is described as follows 3 1 1 separation of the kinu river and the kokai river oki excavation fig 3 shows the alternation of the flow channel in the kinu and kokai rivers in 1629 the kinu river was separated from the kokai river by excavating the platform of oki whereupon it flowed directly into the hitachi river in addition the uplands between todai and haneno in the kokai river and between fukawa and fusa in the tone river were excavated in 1630 as a result of this excavation the hitachi river flowed between fukawa and fusa converged with the kokai river which was replaced at haneno the kinu river was brought into convergence with the tone river hitachi river through the flow channel of the kokai river at fujikura before the improvement of 1629 1630 the excavation of the upland of oki moved the confluence of the kinu and tone rivers upstream by about 30 km the purpose of these river channel modifications was two fold namely to develop new fields and to aid ship transportation the floodplain surrounded by the kinu and kokai rivers suffered from flood damage making it difficult to develop the area in particular developing new paddy fields meant lowering the water level of the floodplain managing the flood risk and constructing water intake facilities separating the kinu and kokai rivers promoted such development mitsukaido city history editing committee 1983 first the water level of the floodplain was lowered by isolating the kinu river whose river bed was high because of an abundant supply of sediment in addition the separation reduced the flow rate of the kokai river second i described the viewpoint of the flood risk the kinu river has a large mountainous area upstream whereas the watershed of the kokai river is composed of plains therefore the flood risk of the kokai river was lower than that of the kinu river basin the flood risk of the kokai river was reduced by the separation in addition the management the kokai river for water supply was considered important to develop new field finally the construction of water intake facilities such as fukuoka weir constructed in 1627 oka weir constructed in 1630 and toyota weir constructed in 1667 significantly reduced the flood risk of the kokai river shimotsuma city history editing committee 1979 as mentioned above the separation of the kinu and kokai rivers due to the oki excavation had profound influences on the development of the floodplain surrounded by these two rivers koide 1974 pointed out that the kokai and kinu rivers were separated not only to develop new fields but also to create a ship transportation network around edo a former geographical name for tokyo the kinu river played an important role as a channel for water transportation from the northern part of the kanto region to edo there were many river ports along the kinu river such as mitsukaido sodo and shimotsuma however to travel by river from the northern part of the kanto region to edo it was necessary to go down along the kokai river toward the east and proceed to the west before the oki excavation therefore the annual rice tax from the newly developed area could not be transported effectively after the oki excavation the junction with the hitachi river was 30 km farther upstream shortening the route to edo by about 60 km fig 4 furthermore ship transportation efficiency was improved dramatically by the increased water volume in the hitachi river by changing the confluence of the kinu river okuma 2009 as a result not only the northern kanto region but also the tohoku region was linked to the trading area of edo and the river ports that were developed along the kinu river became hubs from which the product economy of the villages in the basin could spread widely shimotsuma city history editing committee 1979 before the improvement of the river channel for river traffic there were 15 river ships along the kinu river in the genroku era 1688 1704 this increased to 39 river ships in the anei era 1772 1781 indicating the economic effect of the oki excavation 3 1 2 water utilization and floodplain drainage in the upper reaches of the inundation area lakes formed because of blockage by the natural levee of the kinu river and were used as a water source fig 2 however the lakes were reclaimed for paddy fields in the 18th century ending their function as a water source in 1726 the edure irrigation channel was constructed as a replacement water source however water intake became difficult in the late 18th century because of the lowering water level caused by the degradation of the river bed in the kinu river in addition it became difficult to maintain the irrigation channel because of increasing ground elevation caused by ash fall from the eruption of mount asama in 1783 the villagers living on the floodplain abandoned the edure irrigation channel in 1789 and in 1838 a main irrigation channel was constructed to integrate water from the kinu river and the upland lakes fig 5 in addition in the lowland area surrounded by the kinu and kokai rivers it was difficult to drain residual water drawn to the paddy field the hachikenbori river which flows down to the center of the lowland area was constructed in 1635 to discharge the drainage of the paddy field of the area originally the hachikenbori river was confluent with the kokai river at the village of terahata in the county of souma fig 5 initially this area was governed by a single local governor however after having a mutual salary and multiple rulers the management of the hachikenbori river became insufficient making drainage difficult in 1695 and 1697 farmers living in the downstream area of the hachikenbori river petitioned to have the confluence of the hachikenbori river changed from the kokai river to the kinu river whose river bed was degraded by the oki excavation the project to change the confluence was completed in 1700 whereupon the river channel of the hachikenbori river became situated where it is today fig 5 in the target area a large scale river improvement work was conducted to improve water transportation and develop new paddy fields along with a small scale river improvement work to reform water utilization and drainage to sustain farming sustainable management of villages seemed to be due to the involvement of various agents in floodplain management therefore it is necessary to discuss countermeasures against fedl based on the history of floodplain management and irrigation carried out by various entities including river administrators 3 2 flood management of interior land inferred from landform classification map for flood control in the previous subsection the development history of the targeted area was discussed attention turns now to the flood control measures that have been adopted for the landside area records concerning localized flood control projects are scarce before the department of home affairs established direct control in 1897 therefore i use a landform classification map for flood control to estimate the flood management measures 3 2 1 flood control in the city of mitsukaido and the hachikenbori river the hachikenbori river was an artificially excavated channel for the drainage of lowland areas and plays the role of collecting inundated water from the landside area and returning it to the kinu river when the kinu or kokai river floods the current drainage pump station was constructed in 1981 and the water of the hachikenbori river is currently forced to discharge to the kinu river to prevent flooding when the water level of the hachikenbori river rises fig 6 shows the landform classification map for flood control in the northern part of mitsukaido this map indicates that the western levee of the hachikenbori river upland of mitsukaido was constructed discontinuously from the end of the taisho period 1912 1926 to the early showa period 1926 1989 before construction of the drainage pump station now located at the confluence of the hachikenbori and kinu rivers it was necessary to avoid concentrating flood water downstream to avoid flooding the urban district of mitsukaido therefore this discontinuous levee seems to have had the function of routing flood water collected from the inland area to a low lying backswamp in a sparsely populated area to prevent flooding the crowded city located downstream of the discontinuous levee currently the hachikenbori river has continuous embankments on both its banks and the aforementioned flood prevention system cannot be confirmed 3 2 2 secondary levee of the middle reach of the hachikenbori river fig 6 indicates the positional relationship between the secondary levee of the eastern bank of the hachikenbori river and urban area and rapid survey map of the area from the landform classification map for flood control the embankment of the eastern bank of the hachikenbori river constructed in 1945 1954 was confirmed the tributary of the hachikenbori river located in this position was identified in the rapid survey map therefore this embankment can be judged as the dike of the tributary of the hachikenbori river the reason for the banking was to defend the residential district constructed in the west side of the bank because this residential area cannot be confirmed from the rapid survey map it is estimated that it was built from the meiji period 1868 1912 until 1945 1954 in addition this embankment was extended upstream in 1955 1964 to connect up to the natural levee this was done most likely to improve the drainage of inland water by utilizing the area between the embankment and the eastern bank dike of the hachikenbori river the former acted as a secondary levee of the latter from the mentioned above there were multiple defense ideas to reduce flood risk using multiple flood control facilities in this area the secondary levee has now been removed because of farmland consolidation 3 2 3 flood control system of the southern part of mitsukaido fig 7 shows the landform classification map for flood control of the southern part of mitsukaido in this area the former meandering river bed of the kokai river and the spread of the urban area of mitsukaido onto the floodplain can be seen this urban spread is not confirmed by the rapid survey map the embankment located at the eastern bank of the former river bed of the kokai river was most likely for flood prevention to protect mitsukaido from being inundated by flood water from the kokai river the downstream part of the embankment was constructed from the end of the taisho period to the early showa period it was extended in the 1960s accompanied by the urbanization of the southern part of mitsukaido in addition a natural levee seems to have been excavated artificially in the western bank of the kinu river and a sluice way was installed in this area a water channel formed by excavating the natural levee can be confirmed in the rapid survey map it seems that the function of the water channel was to route flood water from the kokai river to the kinu river the flood control systems inferred from the landform classification map for flood control and the rapid survey map reveal past flood management that used the natural terrain and multiple defense ideas to reduce the flood risk in the heavily populated city of mitsukaido the flood management idea using natural terrain for land use or accumulation of population and property should be used as future countermeasures against fedl table 1 provides a chronological view of the kinu river basin s development history which we obtained through a literature survey antiquities of the jomon period 131 4 bce were excavated in this area thus it seems that humans started residing at this location during that time the excavated antiquities were concentrated on the plateau on the kinu river s left side human residence was considered to be limited to the high altitude plateau to avoid flood damage major development in this area began after the kinu and kokai rivers separated in 1629 development of new agricultural fields and irrigation was actively performed with floodplain or backswamp used for paddy fields and a natural levee or plateau used for residence however channel improvement for flood control was not conducted because this area was managed by various administrators local flood control facilities such as the secondary levee and flood defense forests in the floodplain are considered to have been established for the self defense of the human settlements there after the meiji period the department of home affairs and the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit implemented flood control projects constructing a continuous levee thus resulting in the current situation flood control systems introduced during the edo period mainly for self defense were superior at controlling floodwater however the continuous embankment construction currently being performed is an effective flood control measure that does not cause flooding downstream from the designed flood discharge in addition to having a continuous embankment it is necessary to control floodwater flow and countermeasures that combine these factors are important for ensuring a degree of safety against fedl which likely occur during inundation flow 4 suggestions for countermeasures against floods that exceed design levels 4 1 identifying the location of foreland floods as a fedl countermeasure identifying potential flood locations is an effective flood risk reduction method for the entire basin matsuura 1986 seiji 2011 before the construction of the continuous embankment flood control measures that used the floodplain were adopted and discontinuous or fuse plug levees were developed in many areas of japan to reduce large scale flooding risks nakajima and ohgushi 2013 kawanaka et al 2007 wada et al 2005 in addition local residents successfully used flooding sending inundation water to the backswamp to improve paddy field fertility nagao 1986 sawada 1986 recently these flood control facilities which water overflow focused not only on being fedl countermeasures but also on balancing the environment and flood control ishigaki et al 2002 sugiura 2007 moreover these facilities are also a historical flood control heritage facilities that raise disaster prevention awareness for new residents allowing the creation of educational places and adding value to the cultural landscape haruyama and murai 2004 discontinuous levees exist in 54 of the 109 water drainage systems mlit manages however discontinuous levees do not exist in traditional forms but instead have been devised using modern construction methods in policy matters these traditional flood control facilities are observed as environmentally conscious fedl countermeasures japan council for social infrastructure 2015 however social and technical challenges exist for introduction and conservation research on interview surveys of residents around discontinuous levees show that many residents feel a sense of inequality with non flooded areas although they recognized the importance of these facilities haruyama and murai 2004 tanabe and okuma 2001 sugiura 2007 in addition consideration of flood control and the environment is necessary for designing a flood control basin as a fedl countermeasure until now research focusing on controlling water such as optimal fuse plug levee structure or flood control verification has been conducted fukuoka et al 2007 akiyama et al 2014 matsumoto et al 2014 however there have been few studies concerning the flood control basin structure from an environmental conservation perspective and systematized knowledge such as design criteria do not exist because floodplain wetlands have been lost on a global scale owing to land formation or river improvement pinter 2005 a newly designed flood control basin is expected to function as an alternative to the floodplain wetland for example because floodplain vegetation varies depending on flood frequency van geest et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 diversity of the water depth spatiotemporal distribution is required for endangered species conservation and invasive species prevention in addition because of the diversity of the floodplain s physical environment including its connection with the main river causes variations in spatial patterns of adult and juvenile fish csoboth and garvey 2008 górski et al 2010 gogola et al 2013 and newly constructed flood control basins intended to be used as fedl countermeasures are required to have various environmental structures in the area inundated by kt2015 the natural levee on the western bank of the kinu river has been inhabited since ancient times and housing density is high almost everywhere in addition mitsukaido is located downstream of the western bank area therefore it is undesirable to concentrate flood water there in contrast the population density is smaller on the side of the eastern bank and the lowland area is distributed in the valley making it more difficult for flood water to reach residential areas hence detaining storm water in lowland farming areas would be an effective countermeasure against fedl measures to strengthen the ecosystem function are important when installing these flood control basins for instance changing the inflow method of flood water complicating the structure to diversify water depth or flow velocity and disrupting flood frequency by varying the height of the intake portion are effective in creating a habitat for various organisms although flooding frequency is low preparing social measures such as compensation is necessary when considering the influence of flooding on agricultural production 4 2 land use management and facility location the plain of japan is a sedimentary plain thus the sedimentary condition of gravel and minute undulations of the plain indicate its flood history therefore we can acquire flooding occurrence inundation time length of past floods by classifying the plain s microtopography oya 1960 relationships between natural microtopography and flood damage have been investigated mainly in the field of geography nakano 1961 kusaka 1969 ho et al 2013 in general the degree of safety against flood damage is high in plateaus and other elevated areas natural levee and low in the former river bed and backswamp because of elevation therefore since ancient times in japan people have lived on natural levees and cultivated the surrounding backswamp to minimize the damage from large scale flooding yamamuro 1979 iseki 1972 matsushita 1989 ando 1988 however the construction of continuous embankment for modern flood control has decreased floodplain flood frequency and land use changes such as estate development have occurred in areas where the potential flooding frequency and inundation depth are high tanabe and okuma 2001 ueno 2002 reducing flood risk by controlling land use has been researched and suggested cœur and lang 2008 posthumus et al 2008 saitou and ubaura 2012 teramoto et al 2010 however the implementation has been difficult in the current situation while considering a flood levee breach due to fedl it is important to take measures in the inland area that consider natural microtopography and land use to minimize flood damage in the flood damage of kt2015 increasing the inundation height and period was confirmed in the lowland area therefore land use management based on topography and flood risk is essential for countermeasures against fedl fig 8 shows the inundation depth in this flood sayama and takara 2016b the landform classification map for flood control a rapid survey map and an aerial photograph taken in 1947 national institute for agro environmental sciences 2015 of the area surrounding shinishige in the city of joso in this area an administrative agency an educational institution and a large commercial complex are concentrated on the floodplain behind the natural levee where the inundation depth was high for the large commercial facility about 100 people were evacuated to the second floor and rescued by japan self defense forces these buildings that many people use in normal times and that are likely to function as evacuation places in the event of flood need to be placed in areas with low flood risk based on the circumstances of the surrounding natural topography the rapid survey map and aerial photograph national institute for agro environmental sciences 2015 reveal expansion of the residual land and commercial facilities since 1947 with these areas having been developed relatively recently on the basis of the predicted future changes in the social situation restricting development of these areas or diverting their application to disaster prevention is necessary for flood risk management of inland areas 4 3 flood water control in interior lands when fedl events occur it is important to properly control floodwater to minimize the damage in japan ring levees discontinuous levees secondary levees and flood defense forests have been constructed in inland areas to control floodwater wada et al 2005 many of these flood control facilities have been removed because of estate development or farmland consideration however the functions of these facilities have been reviewed as fedl countermeasures in recent years for instance research has investigated the function and historical reasons for installing flood defense forests okuma 1997 nagao 2004 kishihara 1979 and verified the flood control ability of flood defense forests using numerical simulations and model experiments shigeeda and akiyama 2003 akiyama et al 2012 fukuoka et al 1998 further studies on the influence of banking structure railway and road embankment on floodwater control have also been conducted fukuoka et al 1994 huang 2010 akiyama et al 2016 when dealing with fedl countermeasures in the future it will be necessary to verify the effects of these existing facilities preserve them as needed and plan to consider flood control function when introducing new facilities technical factors do not entirely affect the success or failure of floodwater control as measures against fedl in inland areas various administrative organizations such as road planning or urban design sector related groups do not necessarily plan based on measures against flooding to respond to this issue taki et al 2010 proposed the establishment of a floodplain administrator to conduct local safety surveys for inundation land use and collaboration with related organizations fig 9 shows the landform classification map for flood control in the southern city of mitsukaido in this area the embankment located at the eastern bank of the former river bed of the kokai river was constructed from the end of the taisho period to the early showa period and was extended in the 1950s part of the levee remains in existence accompanied by a forest to protect against flood damage fig 9 photo 1 however part of the embankment has been demolished by development or road building and it is assumed that its previous function has not been maintained fig 9 photo 2 as a countermeasure against fedl it is necessary to verify the effect of flood flow control by these embankments located inland and to preserve them as necessary if development requires the inland embankment to be excavated accompanying measures are required such as rehabilitation of the function by flood fighting activity or making the structure capable of demonstrating the previous function in a time of disaster by land lock in addition in the southern part of mitsukaido the former river bed of the kokai river has not been developed and remains a floodplain fig 9 photo 3 such floodplains function as flood control basins in fedl as well as important habitats for floodplain dependent animals therefore former river channels should be positively preserved as measures against fedl 4 4 river improvement method of landside water drainage rivers progress in continuous embankment development has greatly influenced agricultural property drainage the natural drainage method was adopted in lowland areas adjacent to the main river where internal drainage is necessary however as continuous embankment development progressed the external river water level rose and drainage machinery was introduced when the removal of water through natural drainage methods became difficult in addition countermeasures for inundation damage of paddy fields based on a 10 year occurrence probability was conducted from a farmland disaster prevention perspective in areas where residential and agricultural lands coexist the scales of drainage facilities are enhanced to meet a 20 year to 30 year occurrence probability in the context of regional disaster prevention masumoto 1998 as described above a concentrated drainage system that collects landside water at the lowest part of the drainage canal and drains that water using a drainage pump has been adopted in lowland areas the runoff mechanism in these lowland areas is characterized by submersion and subsequent runoff mechanism changes suzuki and nishihata 1969 since then research on reproduction of inundation mechanisms has used numerical calculations or developed optimal drainage schemes kamada 1989 chikamori and kadoya 1994 nohara et al 1994 kawaike et al 2005 however although the concentrated drainage system is extremely effective within the planned scale range there is a possibility that a concentration of floodwater is caused during excessive flooding during kt2015 a concentration of floodwater that exceeded the drainage ability of pumping station from the kinu river at the lowest landside water drainage site was confirmed ohtsuki et al 2016 in addition to a concentrated drainage system a dispersive water retention system using paddy fields or an agricultural drainage channel is required for fedl yoshikawa et al 2009 natuhara 2013 the hachikenbori river has the function of draining flood water from the floodplain enclosed by the kinu and kokai rivers as mentioned in section 3 2 distributed flood water management was adopted in this area to avoid concentrating the inundated water on mitsukaido as a result of river improvement since 1963 the discharge capacity of the hachikenbori river has increased greatly increasing the discharge capacity helps in improving safety during floods that are within design levels but may increase the potential for flood damage during fedl constructing consecutive embankments has increased the fluid power of flood water in the event of the dike breakage and has reduced the flow time of flood water to the mitsukaido area in addition it is necessary to consider the vulnerability of the levee body to the rise of the inland and river water levels in the event of large inundation considering fedl accompanied by inundation due to dike breakage a river improvement method that increases the fluid force in the event of dike breakage is not desirable rather a method for setting back of the levee or controlling the inundated water by installing a secondary bank is considered more appropriate river bed excavation also seems to be an effective method however consideration is required of habitat degradation or prevention of redeposition 5 toward realization of countermeasures against floods that exceed design levels countermeasures against fedl proposed in the previous section will be achieved through the efforts of administrative agencies engineers researchers and society first a river administrator will need to prepare countermeasures on the premise that floods exceeding the planned scale will occur in addition to conventional river channel improvements countermeasures in the floodplain such as land use regulations or floodwater control will be required to develop facility layout plans to counter fedl the cooperation of administrators related to floodplain management such as road development urban design and building restriction will be essential furthermore social structure changes such as demographic movement will affect floodplain management increasing amounts of deserted cultivated land associated with decreasing agriculture and increases of open area due to depopulation can be used as fedl countermeasures in addition the proposed countermeasures have many problems that must be solved to execute there are studies evaluating discontinuous levees and flood prevention forests independently however no research verifies the effects of these flood control facilities as a system many of these facilities have already been lost therefore it is necessary to interpret past flood control systems from topography and historic documents in addition designs that cooperate with flood control and environmental conservation are indispensable in the present situation in which the floodplain environment disappears designing facilities to improve environmental function is required finally we describe social challenges the increasing degree of flood safety due to continuous levees reduces flood risk however it also leads to a decline in disaster prevention consciousness or communalized flood prevention acts improvement of disaster literacy such as understanding area history topography and flood damage history is essential to reduce the damage caused by fedl 6 conclusion this paper has provided future flood risk management for fedl based on past flood control systems and land use considering the natural topography in the area that was inundated by kt2015 the knowledge acquired from the results is summarized as follows the results of the literature research revealed a method for flood management to prevent inundation of the city of mitsukaido such as drainage using a discontinuous embankment a low lying backswamp and a secondary bank installed at the former river bed of the kokai river in addition the areas inundated by kt2015 were mainly those around the high altitude natural levee and development of residential land in the backland lowland area was after the meiji period furthermore a field survey revealed that many of these flood management systems are not functioning completely because of artificial modification identification of potential flooding locations in areas of low population density is necessary as a countermeasure against fedl furthermore it is important to consider strengthening the ecosystem function e g creating a habitat for various organisms when installing these flooding locations it is also important to recognize microtopography such as natural levees or backswamps to induce land use based on the different flood risks of these topographies and to utilize historical flood control systems as countermeasures against fedl funding this work was supported by a grant from jst ristex as part of its future earth initiative acknowledgment this

claim to represent the views of the society 
8489,study region the kinu river basin receiving serious damage in september 2015 because of the heavy rainfall disaster that hit the districts of kanto and tohoku in japan study focus this paper provides future flood risk management for floods that exceed design levels fedl based on past flood control systems and land use considering the natural topography in the area that was inundated by flood water from the kinu river new hydrological insights for the region the results of the literature research reveal flood management methods for preventing inundation of the city of mitsukaido such as drainage using a discontinuous embankment and a low lying backswamp in addition the areas inundated by this flood were mainly those around a high altitude natural levee and residential land in the backland lowland area was developed after the meiji period 1868 1912 furthermore a field survey revealed that many of these flood management systems are not functioning completely because of artificial modification identifying locations of potential flooding in areas of low population density is necessary as a countermeasure against fedl it is also important to recognize microtopography such as natural levees or backswamps to induce land use based on the different flood risks of these topographies and to utilize historical flood control systems as countermeasures against fedl keywords flood management land use natural levee landform classification map traditional knowledge 1 introduction the world is experiencing major problems due to destructive flood damage and other natural disasters wilby and keenan 2012 sanyal and lu 2004 chang and franczyk 2008 kundzewicz et al 2010 recently large scale floods have occurred in central europe vogel 2002 the uk arduino et al 2005 the southern united states travis 2005 and southeast asia alam and rabbani 2007 the potentially changing global climate could exacerbate the risk of flooding van aalst 2006 milly et al 2002 the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc pointed out that localized torrential rain is becoming more intense and frequent in mid latitude areas ipcc 2013 therefore the preparation of countermeasures against floods that exceed design levels fedl is an urgent issue in japan and the monsoon region of asia urban areas have traditionally relied on river canalization as a flood control method to mitigate flood hazards but this approach has been criticized for degrading riverine ecosystems and increasing long term flood risk pedroli et al 2002 rohde et al 2006 alternative flood management concepts have emerged which emphasize integrated watershed management and structural and nonstructural measures schneidergruber et al 2004 recently the concept of ecosystem based disaster risk reduction eco drr has emerged renaud 2013 in which disaster prevention measures themselves are required to strengthen ecosystem function iwasa and nishida 2017 examples of such countermeasures include conserving wetlands and floodplains wharton and gilvear 2007 birol et al 2009 hey and philippi 1995 gopakumar 2011 using paddy fields natuhara 2013 yu et al 2006 yoon

embankments saito and fukuoka 2013 gouldby et al 2008 klijn et al 2015 nillesen and kok 2015 van veelen et al 2015 and reducing vulnerability in inland areas it is also important to apply traditional knowledge and facilities for flood control in japan localized flood control methods such as flood control forests okuma 1997 nagao 2004 watanabe and hirakawa 2010 and circle levees hori and tanabe 2012 nakajima et al 2005 hori et al 2008 shimazu 2013 were developed in ancient times such localized technology is now deemed effective for reducing vulnerability the present research is aimed at the flooding that occurred in september 2015 when the kinu river burst its banks causing enormous damage to the city of joso in ibaraki prefecture in japan this event occurred because of heavy rainfall 511 mm per basin area fell during three days roughly 1 110 of the annual exceedance probability sayama and takara 2016a comprehensive flood management policy throughout the watershed basin was shown to be effective against large scale floods a japanese river council report in 2000 pointed out the importance of various countermeasures against large scale floods in rivers and watersheds to minimize flood damage recognizing the delineation of correspondence with flood control facilities land use management strengthening of partnerships between rivers and sewerage systems and hazard map development were described as important issues japanese river council 2000 furthermore measures that have been proposed for adapting to climate change include i conserving natural levees or consecutive embankments that are intended to stop floods from spreading ii flood management considering land use and iii providing guidance to local residents regarding urban functions in areas of low flood risk japanese council for social infrastructure 2015 a river has both a natural history and a social history the former directs the latter and the latter reflects the former in addition social history takes at least several thousand years and is the result of continuous experiments that continue today koide 1974 therefore countermeasures against fedl should be designed to accept not only changes in the force of the disaster but also potential future social changes based on historical land use and development furthermore issues such as rapid population reduction overcrowding in urban areas depopulation in rural areas and reduction in public investment are currently aggravating the situation in japan in dealing with countermeasures against fedl it is necessary to take these social issues into consideration the purpose of this paper is to propose countermeasures against fedl the aim is to reduce the flood risk and control the flood water based on past flood control systems and land use the target is the flooding of the kinu river in the heavy rainfall disaster of september 2015 in the districts of kanto and tohoku hereinafter the disaster is referred to as kt2015 2 methodology 2 1 geographical characteristics of the study area this study is focused on the area surrounded by the kinu river and the kokai river that was inundated by kt2015 see fig 1 to the west of the kinu river is the alluvium based floodplain of the kinu and kokai rivers known as akuto this floodplain is roughly 12 m sea level and is used for paddy fields the community extends above the natural levee the urban district of the city of mitsukaido is located at the southern end of the floodplain where the kinu and kokai rivers are the closest a flat and gently undulating plateau extends southward on the east of the kinu river and is used for upland farming hill bottom intricately complicated in the plateau and applied to paddy field called yatsuda mitsukaido city history editing committee 1983 fig 2 shows the flow channel of the object area in about ce 1 000 the kinu river flowed into lake kasumigaura through the current flow channel of the kokai river the kinu river joined together with the kokai river at tobanoe where many lakes were formed blocked by the natural levee of the kinu river editing committee of 100 years history of the tone river et al 1987 2 2 development history in the target area before the meiji period before 1868 because the natural and social histories of watersheds are closely related to each other it is important to understand the development of study areas and changes to rivers due to anthropogenic activity to take measures against fedl particularly because these areas have been developed since ancient times to produce new fields for irrigation and for flood control therefore a river channel s current situation and land use in the area are based on previous development there is no method for knowing development and water management histories before the modern era prior to the meiji period other than historical documents therefore through an exhaustive survey of the literature we revealed the following i anthropogenic modification of the river channel ii water management details including drainage and iii the floodplain s development history 2 3 understanding of land use change and past flood control systems after the meiji period land use and residential area development significantly changed because of an increasing degree of flood safety due to the progress of flood prevention projects based on the knowledge of the development history in former eras from a literature survey we have described land use changes and past flood control systems we accomplished this using a landform classification map for flood control geographical survey institute 2007 and a rapid survey map drawn in 1883 1890 by the survey department of the staff headquarters of the imperial japanese army national institute for agro environmental sciences 2015 the relationship between land use change and microtopography was understood by comparing these maps in addition we analyzed past flood control systems by the locations and ages of embankments described in the landform classification map 2 4 field survey of existing situation of past flood control systems it is possible that the past flood control systems that we analyzed using the landform classification map have disappeared owing to estate or farmland development because the presence or absence of past flood control systems influenced the behavior of kt2015 floodwaters and would influence floodwater behavior in future large scale floods we conducted a field survey to understand the existing situation on the basis of our literature survey and field study we propose various countermeasures against fedl in section 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 development history of the inundated area broad scale development such as the development of new fields in the alluvial plain of the kinu and kokai rivers was conducted after the 17th century a river improvement work for enhancing the degree of safety against floods was conducted in conjunction with the development of new fields the regional development history is described as follows 3 1 1 separation of the kinu river and the kokai river oki excavation fig 3 shows the alternation of the flow channel in the kinu and kokai rivers in 1629 the kinu river was separated from the kokai river by excavating the platform of oki whereupon it flowed directly into the hitachi river in addition the uplands between todai and haneno in the kokai river and between fukawa and fusa in the tone river were excavated in 1630 as a result of this excavation the hitachi river flowed between fukawa and fusa converged with the kokai river which was replaced at haneno the kinu river was brought into convergence with the tone river hitachi river through the flow channel of the kokai river at fujikura before the improvement of 1629 1630 the excavation of the upland of oki moved the confluence of the kinu and tone rivers upstream by about 30 km the purpose of these river channel modifications was two fold namely to develop new fields and to aid ship transportation the floodplain surrounded by the kinu and kokai rivers suffered from flood damage making it difficult to develop the area in particular developing new paddy fields meant lowering the water level of the floodplain managing the flood risk and constructing water intake facilities separating the kinu and kokai rivers promoted such development mitsukaido city history editing committee 1983 first the water level of the floodplain was lowered by isolating the kinu river whose river bed was high because of an abundant supply of sediment in addition the separation reduced the flow rate of the kokai river second i described the viewpoint of the flood risk the kinu river has a large mountainous area upstream whereas the watershed of the kokai river is composed of plains therefore the flood risk of the kokai river was lower than that of the kinu river basin the flood risk of the kokai river was reduced by the separation in addition the management the kokai river for water supply was considered important to develop new field finally the construction of water intake facilities such as fukuoka weir constructed in 1627 oka weir constructed in 1630 and toyota weir constructed in 1667 significantly reduced the flood risk of the kokai river shimotsuma city history editing committee 1979 as mentioned above the separation of the kinu and kokai rivers due to the oki excavation had profound influences on the development of the floodplain surrounded by these two rivers koide 1974 pointed out that the kokai and kinu rivers were separated not only to develop new fields but also to create a ship transportation network around edo a former geographical name for tokyo the kinu river played an important role as a channel for water transportation from the northern part of the kanto region to edo there were many river ports along the kinu river such as mitsukaido sodo and shimotsuma however to travel by river from the northern part of the kanto region to edo it was necessary to go down along the kokai river toward the east and proceed to the west before the oki excavation therefore the annual rice tax from the newly developed area could not be transported effectively after the oki excavation the junction with the hitachi river was 30 km farther upstream shortening the route to edo by about 60 km fig 4 furthermore ship transportation efficiency was improved dramatically by the increased water volume in the hitachi river by changing the confluence of the kinu river okuma 2009 as a result not only the northern kanto region but also the tohoku region was linked to the trading area of edo and the river ports that were developed along the kinu river became hubs from which the product economy of the villages in the basin could spread widely shimotsuma city history editing committee 1979 before the improvement of the river channel for river traffic there were 15 river ships along the kinu river in the genroku era 1688 1704 this increased to 39 river ships in the anei era 1772 1781 indicating the economic effect of the oki excavation 3 1 2 water utilization and floodplain drainage in the upper reaches of the inundation area lakes formed because of blockage by the natural levee of the kinu river and were used as a water source fig 2 however the lakes were reclaimed for paddy fields in the 18th century ending their function as a water source in 1726 the edure irrigation channel was constructed as a replacement water source however water intake became difficult in the late 18th century because of the lowering water level caused by the degradation of the river bed in the kinu river in addition it became difficult to maintain the irrigation channel because of increasing ground elevation caused by ash fall from the eruption of mount asama in 1783 the villagers living on the floodplain abandoned the edure irrigation channel in 1789 and in 1838 a main irrigation channel was constructed to integrate water from the kinu river and the upland lakes fig 5 in addition in the lowland area surrounded by the kinu and kokai rivers it was difficult to drain residual water drawn to the paddy field the hachikenbori river which flows down to the center of the lowland area was constructed in 1635 to discharge the drainage of the paddy field of the area originally the hachikenbori river was confluent with the kokai river at the village of terahata in the county of souma fig 5 initially this area was governed by a single local governor however after having a mutual salary and multiple rulers the management of the hachikenbori river became insufficient making drainage difficult in 1695 and 1697 farmers living in the downstream area of the hachikenbori river petitioned to have the confluence of the hachikenbori river changed from the kokai river to the kinu river whose river bed was degraded by the oki excavation the project to change the confluence was completed in 1700 whereupon the river channel of the hachikenbori river became situated where it is today fig 5 in the target area a large scale river improvement work was conducted to improve water transportation and develop new paddy fields along with a small scale river improvement work to reform water utilization and drainage to sustain farming sustainable management of villages seemed to be due to the involvement of various agents in floodplain management therefore it is necessary to discuss countermeasures against fedl based on the history of floodplain management and irrigation carried out by various entities including river administrators 3 2 flood management of interior land inferred from landform classification map for flood control in the previous subsection the development history of the targeted area was discussed attention turns now to the flood control measures that have been adopted for the landside area records concerning localized flood control projects are scarce before the department of home affairs established direct control in 1897 therefore i use a landform classification map for flood control to estimate the flood management measures 3 2 1 flood control in the city of mitsukaido and the hachikenbori river the hachikenbori river was an artificially excavated channel for the drainage of lowland areas and plays the role of collecting inundated water from the landside area and returning it to the kinu river when the kinu or kokai river floods the current drainage pump station was constructed in 1981 and the water of the hachikenbori river is currently forced to discharge to the kinu river to prevent flooding when the water level of the hachikenbori river rises fig 6 shows the landform classification map for flood control in the northern part of mitsukaido this map indicates that the western levee of the hachikenbori river upland of mitsukaido was constructed discontinuously from the end of the taisho period 1912 1926 to the early showa period 1926 1989 before construction of the drainage pump station now located at the confluence of the hachikenbori and kinu rivers it was necessary to avoid concentrating flood water downstream to avoid flooding the urban district of mitsukaido therefore this discontinuous levee seems to have had the function of routing flood water collected from the inland area to a low lying backswamp in a sparsely populated area to prevent flooding the crowded city located downstream of the discontinuous levee currently the hachikenbori river has continuous embankments on both its banks and the aforementioned flood prevention system cannot be confirmed 3 2 2 secondary levee of the middle reach of the hachikenbori river fig 6 indicates the positional relationship between the secondary levee of the eastern bank of the hachikenbori river and urban area and rapid survey map of the area from the landform classification map for flood control the embankment of the eastern bank of the hachikenbori river constructed in 1945 1954 was confirmed the tributary of the hachikenbori river located in this position was identified in the rapid survey map therefore this embankment can be judged as the dike of the tributary of the hachikenbori river the reason for the banking was to defend the residential district constructed in the west side of the bank because this residential area cannot be confirmed from the rapid survey map it is estimated that it was built from the meiji period 1868 1912 until 1945 1954 in addition this embankment was extended upstream in 1955 1964 to connect up to the natural levee this was done most likely to improve the drainage of inland water by utilizing the area between the embankment and the eastern bank dike of the hachikenbori river the former acted as a secondary levee of the latter from the mentioned above there were multiple defense ideas to reduce flood risk using multiple flood control facilities in this area the secondary levee has now been removed because of farmland consolidation 3 2 3 flood control system of the southern part of mitsukaido fig 7 shows the landform classification map for flood control of the southern part of mitsukaido in this area the former meandering river bed of the kokai river and the spread of the urban area of mitsukaido onto the floodplain can be seen this urban spread is not confirmed by the rapid survey map the embankment located at the eastern bank of the former river bed of the kokai river was most likely for flood prevention to protect mitsukaido from being inundated by flood water from the kokai river the downstream part of the embankment was constructed from the end of the taisho period to the early showa period it was extended in the 1960s accompanied by the urbanization of the southern part of mitsukaido in addition a natural levee seems to have been excavated artificially in the western bank of the kinu river and a sluice way was installed in this area a water channel formed by excavating the natural levee can be confirmed in the rapid survey map it seems that the function of the water channel was to route flood water from the kokai river to the kinu river the flood control systems inferred from the landform classification map for flood control and the rapid survey map reveal past flood management that used the natural terrain and multiple defense ideas to reduce the flood risk in the heavily populated city of mitsukaido the flood management idea using natural terrain for land use or accumulation of population and property should be used as future countermeasures against fedl table 1 provides a chronological view of the kinu river basin s development history which we obtained through a literature survey antiquities of the jomon period 131 4 bce were excavated in this area thus it seems that humans started residing at this location during that time the excavated antiquities were concentrated on the plateau on the kinu river s left side human residence was considered to be limited to the high altitude plateau to avoid flood damage major development in this area began after the kinu and kokai rivers separated in 1629 development of new agricultural fields and irrigation was actively performed with floodplain or backswamp used for paddy fields and a natural levee or plateau used for residence however channel improvement for flood control was not conducted because this area was managed by various administrators local flood control facilities such as the secondary levee and flood defense forests in the floodplain are considered to have been established for the self defense of the human settlements there after the meiji period the department of home affairs and the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit implemented flood control projects constructing a continuous levee thus resulting in the current situation flood control systems introduced during the edo period mainly for self defense were superior at controlling floodwater however the continuous embankment construction currently being performed is an effective flood control measure that does not cause flooding downstream from the designed flood discharge in addition to having a continuous embankment it is necessary to control floodwater flow and countermeasures that combine these factors are important for ensuring a degree of safety against fedl which likely occur during inundation flow 4 suggestions for countermeasures against floods that exceed design levels 4 1 identifying the location of foreland floods as a fedl countermeasure identifying potential flood locations is an effective flood risk reduction method for the entire basin matsuura 1986 seiji 2011 before the construction of the continuous embankment flood control measures that used the floodplain were adopted and discontinuous or fuse plug levees were developed in many areas of japan to reduce large scale flooding risks nakajima and ohgushi 2013 kawanaka et al 2007 wada et al 2005 in addition local residents successfully used flooding sending inundation water to the backswamp to improve paddy field fertility nagao 1986 sawada 1986 recently these flood control facilities which water overflow focused not only on being fedl countermeasures but also on balancing the environment and flood control ishigaki et al 2002 sugiura 2007 moreover these facilities are also a historical flood control heritage facilities that raise disaster prevention awareness for new residents allowing the creation of educational places and adding value to the cultural landscape haruyama and murai 2004 discontinuous levees exist in 54 of the 109 water drainage systems mlit manages however discontinuous levees do not exist in traditional forms but instead have been devised using modern construction methods in policy matters these traditional flood control facilities are observed as environmentally conscious fedl countermeasures japan council for social infrastructure 2015 however social and technical challenges exist for introduction and conservation research on interview surveys of residents around discontinuous levees show that many residents feel a sense of inequality with non flooded areas although they recognized the importance of these facilities haruyama and murai 2004 tanabe and okuma 2001 sugiura 2007 in addition consideration of flood control and the environment is necessary for designing a flood control basin as a fedl countermeasure until now research focusing on controlling water such as optimal fuse plug levee structure or flood control verification has been conducted fukuoka et al 2007 akiyama et al 2014 matsumoto et al 2014 however there have been few studies concerning the flood control basin structure from an environmental conservation perspective and systematized knowledge such as design criteria do not exist because floodplain wetlands have been lost on a global scale owing to land formation or river improvement pinter 2005 a newly designed flood control basin is expected to function as an alternative to the floodplain wetland for example because floodplain vegetation varies depending on flood frequency van geest et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 diversity of the water depth spatiotemporal distribution is required for endangered species conservation and invasive species prevention in addition because of the diversity of the floodplain s physical environment including its connection with the main river causes variations in spatial patterns of adult and juvenile fish csoboth and garvey 2008 górski et al 2010 gogola et al 2013 and newly constructed flood control basins intended to be used as fedl countermeasures are required to have various environmental structures in the area inundated by kt2015 the natural levee on the western bank of the kinu river has been inhabited since ancient times and housing density is high almost everywhere in addition mitsukaido is located downstream of the western bank area therefore it is undesirable to concentrate flood water there in contrast the population density is smaller on the side of the eastern bank and the lowland area is distributed in the valley making it more difficult for flood water to reach residential areas hence detaining storm water in lowland farming areas would be an effective countermeasure against fedl measures to strengthen the ecosystem function are important when installing these flood control basins for instance changing the inflow method of flood water complicating the structure to diversify water depth or flow velocity and disrupting flood frequency by varying the height of the intake portion are effective in creating a habitat for various organisms although flooding frequency is low preparing social measures such as compensation is necessary when considering the influence of flooding on agricultural production 4 2 land use management and facility location the plain of japan is a sedimentary plain thus the sedimentary condition of gravel and minute undulations of the plain indicate its flood history therefore we can acquire flooding occurrence inundation time length of past floods by classifying the plain s microtopography oya 1960 relationships between natural microtopography and flood damage have been investigated mainly in the field of geography nakano 1961 kusaka 1969 ho et al 2013 in general the degree of safety against flood damage is high in plateaus and other elevated areas natural levee and low in the former river bed and backswamp because of elevation therefore since ancient times in japan people have lived on natural levees and cultivated the surrounding backswamp to minimize the damage from large scale flooding yamamuro 1979 iseki 1972 matsushita 1989 ando 1988 however the construction of continuous embankment for modern flood control has decreased floodplain flood frequency and land use changes such as estate development have occurred in areas where the potential flooding frequency and inundation depth are high tanabe and okuma 2001 ueno 2002 reducing flood risk by controlling land use has been researched and suggested cœur and lang 2008 posthumus et al 2008 saitou and ubaura 2012 teramoto et al 2010 however the implementation has been difficult in the current situation while considering a flood levee breach due to fedl it is important to take measures in the inland area that consider natural microtopography and land use to minimize flood damage in the flood damage of kt2015 increasing the inundation height and period was confirmed in the lowland area therefore land use management based on topography and flood risk is essential for countermeasures against fedl fig 8 shows the inundation depth in this flood sayama and takara 2016b the landform classification map for flood control a rapid survey map and an aerial photograph taken in 1947 national institute for agro environmental sciences 2015 of the area surrounding shinishige in the city of joso in this area an administrative agency an educational institution and a large commercial complex are concentrated on the floodplain behind the natural levee where the inundation depth was high for the large commercial facility about 100 people were evacuated to the second floor and rescued by japan self defense forces these buildings that many people use in normal times and that are likely to function as evacuation places in the event of flood need to be placed in areas with low flood risk based on the circumstances of the surrounding natural topography the rapid survey map and aerial photograph national institute for agro environmental sciences 2015 reveal expansion of the residual land and commercial facilities since 1947 with these areas having been developed relatively recently on the basis of the predicted future changes in the social situation restricting development of these areas or diverting their application to disaster prevention is necessary for flood risk management of inland areas 4 3 flood water control in interior lands when fedl events occur it is important to properly control floodwater to minimize the damage in japan ring levees discontinuous levees secondary levees and flood defense forests have been constructed in inland areas to control floodwater wada et al 2005 many of these flood control facilities have been removed because of estate development or farmland consideration however the functions of these facilities have been reviewed as fedl countermeasures in recent years for instance research has investigated the function and historical reasons for installing flood defense forests okuma 1997 nagao 2004 kishihara 1979 and verified the flood control ability of flood defense forests using numerical simulations and model experiments shigeeda and akiyama 2003 akiyama et al 2012 fukuoka et al 1998 further studies on the influence of banking structure railway and road embankment on floodwater control have also been conducted fukuoka et al 1994 huang 2010 akiyama et al 2016 when dealing with fedl countermeasures in the future it will be necessary to verify the effects of these existing facilities preserve them as needed and plan to consider flood control function when introducing new facilities technical factors do not entirely affect the success or failure of floodwater control as measures against fedl in inland areas various administrative organizations such as road planning or urban design sector related groups do not necessarily plan based on measures against flooding to respond to this issue taki et al 2010 proposed the establishment of a floodplain administrator to conduct local safety surveys for inundation land use and collaboration with related organizations fig 9 shows the landform classification map for flood control in the southern city of mitsukaido in this area the embankment located at the eastern bank of the former river bed of the kokai river was constructed from the end of the taisho period to the early showa period and was extended in the 1950s part of the levee remains in existence accompanied by a forest to protect against flood damage fig 9 photo 1 however part of the embankment has been demolished by development or road building and it is assumed that its previous function has not been maintained fig 9 photo 2 as a countermeasure against fedl it is necessary to verify the effect of flood flow control by these embankments located inland and to preserve them as necessary if development requires the inland embankment to be excavated accompanying measures are required such as rehabilitation of the function by flood fighting activity or making the structure capable of demonstrating the previous function in a time of disaster by land lock in addition in the southern part of mitsukaido the former river bed of the kokai river has not been developed and remains a floodplain fig 9 photo 3 such floodplains function as flood control basins in fedl as well as important habitats for floodplain dependent animals therefore former river channels should be positively preserved as measures against fedl 4 4 river improvement method of landside water drainage rivers progress in continuous embankment development has greatly influenced agricultural property drainage the natural drainage method was adopted in lowland areas adjacent to the main river where internal drainage is necessary however as continuous embankment development progressed the external river water level rose and drainage machinery was introduced when the removal of water through natural drainage methods became difficult in addition countermeasures for inundation damage of paddy fields based on a 10 year occurrence probability was conducted from a farmland disaster prevention perspective in areas where residential and agricultural lands coexist the scales of drainage facilities are enhanced to meet a 20 year to 30 year occurrence probability in the context of regional disaster prevention masumoto 1998 as described above a concentrated drainage system that collects landside water at the lowest part of the drainage canal and drains that water using a drainage pump has been adopted in lowland areas the runoff mechanism in these lowland areas is characterized by submersion and subsequent runoff mechanism changes suzuki and nishihata 1969 since then research on reproduction of inundation mechanisms has used numerical calculations or developed optimal drainage schemes kamada 1989 chikamori and kadoya 1994 nohara et al 1994 kawaike et al 2005 however although the concentrated drainage system is extremely effective within the planned scale range there is a possibility that a concentration of floodwater is caused during excessive flooding during kt2015 a concentration of floodwater that exceeded the drainage ability of pumping station from the kinu river at the lowest landside water drainage site was confirmed ohtsuki et al 2016 in addition to a concentrated drainage system a dispersive water retention system using paddy fields or an agricultural drainage channel is required for fedl yoshikawa et al 2009 natuhara 2013 the hachikenbori river has the function of draining flood water from the floodplain enclosed by the kinu and kokai rivers as mentioned in section 3 2 distributed flood water management was adopted in this area to avoid concentrating the inundated water on mitsukaido as a result of river improvement since 1963 the discharge capacity of the hachikenbori river has increased greatly increasing the discharge capacity helps in improving safety during floods that are within design levels but may increase the potential for flood damage during fedl constructing consecutive embankments has increased the fluid power of flood water in the event of the dike breakage and has reduced the flow time of flood water to the mitsukaido area in addition it is necessary to consider the vulnerability of the levee body to the rise of the inland and river water levels in the event of large inundation considering fedl accompanied by inundation due to dike breakage a river improvement method that increases the fluid force in the event of dike breakage is not desirable rather a method for setting back of the levee or controlling the inundated water by installing a secondary bank is considered more appropriate river bed excavation also seems to be an effective method however consideration is required of habitat degradation or prevention of redeposition 5 toward realization of countermeasures against floods that exceed design levels countermeasures against fedl proposed in the previous section will be achieved through the efforts of administrative agencies engineers researchers and society first a river administrator will need to prepare countermeasures on the premise that floods exceeding the planned scale will occur in addition to conventional river channel improvements countermeasures in the floodplain such as land use regulations or floodwater control will be required to develop facility layout plans to counter fedl the cooperation of administrators related to floodplain management such as road development urban design and building restriction will be essential furthermore social structure changes such as demographic movement will affect floodplain management increasing amounts of deserted cultivated land associated with decreasing agriculture and increases of open area due to depopulation can be used as fedl countermeasures in addition the proposed countermeasures have many problems that must be solved to execute there are studies evaluating discontinuous levees and flood prevention forests independently however no research verifies the effects of these flood control facilities as a system many of these facilities have already been lost therefore it is necessary to interpret past flood control systems from topography and historic documents in addition designs that cooperate with flood control and environmental conservation are indispensable in the present situation in which the floodplain environment disappears designing facilities to improve environmental function is required finally we describe social challenges the increasing degree of flood safety due to continuous levees reduces flood risk however it also leads to a decline in disaster prevention consciousness or communalized flood prevention acts improvement of disaster literacy such as understanding area history topography and flood damage history is essential to reduce the damage caused by fedl 6 conclusion this paper has provided future flood risk management for fedl based on past flood control systems and land use considering the natural topography in the area that was inundated by kt2015 the knowledge acquired from the results is summarized as follows the results of the literature research revealed a method for flood management to prevent inundation of the city of mitsukaido such as drainage using a discontinuous embankment a low lying backswamp and a secondary bank installed at the former river bed of the kokai river in addition the areas inundated by kt2015 were mainly those around the high altitude natural levee and development of residential land in the backland lowland area was after the meiji period furthermore a field survey revealed that many of these flood management systems are not functioning completely because of artificial modification identification of potential flooding locations in areas of low population density is necessary as a countermeasure against fedl furthermore it is important to consider strengthening the ecosystem function e g creating a habitat for various organisms when installing these flooding locations it is also important to recognize microtopography such as natural levees or backswamps to induce land use based on the different flood risks of these topographies and to utilize historical flood control systems as countermeasures against fedl funding this work was supported by a grant from jst ristex as part of its future earth initiative acknowledgment this report summarizes some of the activities of the investigation team for the 2015 flood disaster in kinu river organized by the president of the ecology and civil engineering society however it does not
