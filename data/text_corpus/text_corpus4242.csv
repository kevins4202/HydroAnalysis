21210,the scale model experiment for typical offshore floating structures with increasingly excessive mooring lines is usually complex and difficult to set up which often results in low reliability of the experimental results in the previous paper liang et al 2019 proposed a mooring system simplification methodology for the scale model experiment based on the equivalent of the vessel mooring coupled dynamics for vessel with original and simplified mooring systems and demonstrated its effectiveness by numerical studies in this paper the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology is further evaluated by a model test for a very large floating structure s vlfs s mooring system comprising 20 mooring chains a 10 chains simplified mooring system is obtained with the correlation coefficients of coupled vessel mooring dynamics larger than 0 9 thereafter the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems is validated by performing the decay test white noise test regular and irregular wave tests the coincidence of the model test results including natural period damping coefficient response amplitude operator rao motion power spectral density and motion time series of the vlfs model confirms the equivalence of the simplified mooring system with the original mooring system and indicates that the mooring system simplification methodology is effective in designing the simplified mooring system to replace the original mooring system in a scale model experiment keywords scale model experiment simplification methodology vessel mooring dynamics equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems 1 introduction as typical offshore floating structures very large floating structures vlfss including pontoon type mega floats and semi submersible type mobile off shore bases mobs have attracted much interest in the field of coastal and ocean engineering watanabe et al 2004 palo 2005 suzuki 2005 lamas pardo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 etc for these floating structures the line number of their mooring system is increasingly numerous due to their huge size and high station keeping requirements felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 fan et al 2018 especially for long term service vlfss for airport or military use which often comprise five or more modules the mooring system for each module has 20 or more mooring lines girard et al 2001 2003 it is challenging to conduct a scale model experiment for these kinds of offshore floating structures since the uncertainties cost by the excessive number of mooring lines significantly decrease the accuracy of the experimental results and increase the complexity of experimental setup which can lead to low reliability of the obtained results even with high cost of labor and time hughes 1993 ji and yuan 2015 the uncertainty of experimental results δ z can be expressed as follows 1 δ z i 1 n f x i 2 δ x i 2 where δ z is the uncertainty of the output z that z f x 1 x 1 x n x i and δ x i are the i th input and its uncertainty respectively n is the number of the input for a vlfs scaled model test with excessive number of mooring lines the uncertainty of the mooring system input δ x i cannot be inherently eliminated and will propagate with the increase of mooring lines therefore instead of reducing the input related uncertainties of the mooring system in a model test reducing the number of mooring lines is an alternatively effective way to improve the reliability of experimental results however within the knowledge of authors the relevant theoretical and experimental studies are rare in the field of coastal and ocean engineering kim et al 2005 have conducted a model test where the prototype mooring system with 12 lines is replaced by an equivalent mooring system with 4 lines according to their study the equivalent diameter was derived from the condition of equal drag force felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 have designed a 4 lines scaled mooring system for simulating a 16 lines prototype mooring system based on equivalent of static restoring forces blanke and nguyen 2018 have proposed a model experiment to validate the concept for scenarios with mooring line breaking a 4 lines mooring system is utilized in their model experiment to replace the 16 lines mooring system the simplified mooring system is supposed to replace the original mooring system in a model test which implies that the static and dynamic characteristics of the simplified mooring system should be equivalent to that of the original mooring system in this perspective the mooring system simplification problem is similar to the mooring system truncation problem which is dedicated to overcoming the limited depth of the ocean engineering basin in modeling the mooring lines where the motion response of the vessel with the full depth and truncated mooring systems should be equivalent su et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 and wei et al 2017 transformed the truncation problem into a multi objective optimization problem and used the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to find the optimal truncated mooring system however different from the truncation problem the simplification of the mooring system focuses on the equivalence of the mooring system performance the equivalence of the static and dynamic characteristics of the individual mooring line cannot be accomplished because of the different mooring line number and therefore is not the objective function of the mooring system simplification thus the method of designing truncated mooring system cannot be directly utilized to design the simplified mooring system the methodologies for designing the mooring systems can also be found in other studies shafieefar and rezvani 2007 described a mooring system optimization design methodologies based on genetic algorithm ga the weighted sum method was used to normalize the objective functions felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 introduced an optimized design procedure for statically equivalent mooring system based on ga in their study three objective functions were normalized by utilizing several sets of weighting factors brommundt et al 2012 described a new tool for the optimization of catenary mooring system for floating wind turbine they established an optimization problem with four design variables and three constraints to minimize the mooring line length da fonseca monteiro et al 2016 proposed a study of designing mooring system by using particle swarm optimization pso and the differential evolution de methods however a simplified mooring system design requires to ensure that the performance of original and simplified mooring system is equivalent thus the methodologies mentioned above cannot meet this specific requirement to tackle the problem for designing simplified mooring system for experiment use liang et al 2020 proposed a mooring system simplification methodology based on the equivalent of the vessel mooring coupled dynamics in this paper the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology is further evaluated by a series of model tests for a vlfs s mooring system comprising 20 mooring chains the main contributions of this paper includes 1 the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology is demonstrated by a series of numerical simulations where a 10 chains simplified mooring system is designed to replace the 20 chains original mooring system of a vlfs module in the scale model test 2 the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology is verified by validating the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring system in a series of scale model tests which include decay test white noise test regular and irregular wave tests the paper is organized as follows the outline of the mooring system simplification methodology is described in section 2 the main parameters of the original mooring system and the vlfs module are given in section 3 the simplified mooring system is designed by the mooring system simplification methodology in section 4 the model experimental setup and the results are described in sections 5 and 6 respectively finally the conclusion is drawn in section 7 2 outline of the mooring system simplification methodology in this paper we only give an outline of the mooring system simplification methodology while the details can be found in liang et al 2020 the mooring system simplification for model experiment requires that the motion response of the floating structure with the original and simplified mooring systems should be equivalent the motion response of floating structure under environmental excitation can be obtained by 2 m a y c y k y f e f m where m and a are respectively the mass and the added mass matrix of the floating structure c is the damping matrix k is the stiffness matrix y y y are the acceleration velocity and position vectors of the floating structure respectively f m is the mooring force and f e is the external environmental force for the floating structure in a particular environmental condition the difference of its motion response mainly results from the f m when coupling with different mooring systems as can be inferred if the f m of the original mooring system is modeled accurately by the simplified mooring system the motion response of the floating structure can remain unchanged in a model test when its original mooring system is replaced by the simplified mooring system therefore the governing principles of designing a simplified mooring system can be drawn as follows 1 the equivalent of static restoring forces in the vessel six degrees of freedom dofs 2 the equivalent of dynamic restoring forces in the vessel six dofs 3 the equivalent of motion responses of vessel mooring coupled system the three governing principles can be expressed mathematically as follows 3 ϕ 1 1 n 1 j 1 n 1 r j s r j s r j s 2 4 ϕ 2 1 n 2 j 1 n 2 r j d r j d r m a x d 2 5 ϕ 3 c o v y s y o v y s v y o where r s and r s r 6 n 1 which are the static restoring force vector of the original and simplified mooring systems respectively r d and r d r 6 n 2 which are the dynamic restoring forces of the original and simplified mooring systems respectively r m a x d is the maximum dynamic restoring force of the original mooring system n 1 and n 2 are the number of elements in the static and dynamic restoring force series respectively j indicates the j th element in the restoring force series y s y o are the time histories of the floating structure motion response when coupled with simplified and original mooring systems respectively c o v is the covariance operation v is the variance operation the equivalence of the static and dynamic restoring forces can be quantified by the ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 which are the relative deviation of the restoring force between original and simplified mooring systems the smaller value of ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 indicate a better equivalence of the static and dynamic restoring forces the equivalence of the vessel mooring coupled dynamics is quantified by the correlation coefficient ϕ 3 the vessel mooring coupled system has a higher correlation if the ϕ 3 is closer to 1 in a scale model experiment the mooring chain model can be made of different materials such as stainless steel galvanized steel aluminum brass and different types of plastics while its axial stiffness is provided by a light linear spring thus the diameter of the chain model is not fully correlated with the axial stiffness and submerged mass the static restoring force of a mooring system is determined by the diameter unrelated parameters such as mooring line number line length axial stiffness submerged mass and mooring system layout besides the diameter unrelated parameters the dynamic restoring force of a mooring system is determined by the diameter related parameters such as nominal diameter and dry mass therefore the diameter related and diameter unrelated parameters of the simplified mooring system can be designed separately by achieving the equivalent of static and dynamic restoring forces to find the optimal diameter unrelated parameters the multi objective optimization problem for achieving the static restoring force equivalent can be established p r o b l e m 1 m i n i m i z e f l e a ω s u b n α ϕ 1 i i 1 6 s u b j e c t t o l e a ω s u b n α ω s where l is the mooring line length e a is the axial stiffness ω s u b is the submerged mass n is the mooring line number α represents the mooring system layout i indicates the i th dof of the vessel model with the achieving of the static restoring force equivalence several sets of diameter unrelated parameters can be obtained non dimensionalizing those sets of parameters by eq 6 to convert them into points in a coordinate system the diameter unrelated parameter sets are divided into different groups by grouping the corresponding points with a sphere which has a radius of δ u one representative set of diameter unrelated parameters is selected from each group since an arbitrary solution in the same group can represent the others the fig 1 gives an example of non dimensionalizing and grouping of the solutions 6 p i p i p i min p i max p i min where the p i is the i th dimensionless design variable p i max and p i min are the maximum and minimum values of design variable p i thereafter the diameter related parameters can be designed for each representative set of diameter unrelated parameters by achieving the dynamic restoring force the corresponding multi objective optimization problem can be established p r o b l e m 2 m i n i m i z e f d ω d r y ϕ 2 i i 1 6 s u b j e c t t o d ω d r y ω d where d is the nominal diameter ω d r y is the dry mass i indicates the i th dof of the vessel model the global optimum solutions of the p r o b l e m 1 and p r o b l e m 2 are difficult to obtain since the objective functions may be in contradiction the nsga ii srinivas and deb 1994 deb et al 2002 hassan et al 2005 can be utilized to solve the p r o b l e m 1 and p r o b l e m 2 the details of the mooring system simplification methodology can be found in liang et al 2020 after the diameter related and diameter unrelated parameters are obtained the desired simplified mooring system can be selected according to the equivalence of vessel mooring coupled dynamics when the floating structure couples with the original and simplified mooring systems 3 description of the model in this study a catenary mooring system of a semi submersible vlfs module is selected as an example to demonstrate the mooring system simplification methodology the two coordinate systems used to define the motion of vlfs module include the global coordinate system o g x g y g z g and the body fixed coordinate system o b x b y b z b the global coordinate system is fixed in space with o g x g y g plane located at the still water surface and z g axis oriented straight up the body fixed coordinate system is fixed to the vlfs module and coincides with the global coordinate system in its initial position see fig 2 as shown in fig 3 the semi submersible vlfs module is composed of ten cylinder columns five pontoons and eight cylinder braces the red points on the side of the pontoons indicate the fairleads the properties of the vlfs module are listed in table 1 each mooring chain of the original mooring system consists of two segments the top segment and the bottom segment the properties of the original mooring system including the chain length for operational and survival conditions l o and l s the nominal diameter d the dry mass ω d r y the submerged mass ω s u b and the axial stiffness e a are listed in table 2 the original mooring system of the vlfs module consists of 20 mooring chains stretching out from 10 fairleads and can be grouped into 10 bunches according to the fairleads it is reasonable to simplify the 2 mooring chains of each bunch into one mooring chain thus the number of the mooring chain in the simplified mooring system is reduced as 10 the original mooring system is anchored at the water depth of 50 m the coordinates of its anchor points and the fairleads are listed in table 3 the environmental conditions utilized in this study consist four regular waves and three irregular waves which are listed in tables 4 and 5 where env is the abbreviation of environment the env 5 irregular wave is the operational condition and the env 6 and env 7 irregular waves are the survival conditions 4 design of the simplified mooring system to demonstrate the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology a 10 chains simplified mooring system is designed for the vlfs scale model test to replace the 20 chains original mooring system according to table 2 the top segment length of the original mooring system is larger in the survival condition than that in the operational condition which leads to the changes in performance of the original mooring system consequently the original mooring system for the operational and survival conditions should be respectively modeled by two simplified mooring systems in this study it is required that the parameters of the two simplified mooring systems are the same except that the top segment length is increased in the survival condition therefore the top segment length for the survival condition can be updated based on the obtained simplified mooring system for operational condition 4 1 simplification design for operational condition 4 1 1 problem establishment the chain number should be determined before designing the simplified mooring system as described in section 3 the chains in the original mooring system are grouped into ten bundles it is reasonable to simplify each bundle of the original mooring chains into one thus the simplified mooring system should consist of 10 mooring chains meanwhile the anchor point and fairlead of each mooring chain in the simplified system locates at the average position of corresponding bundle of mooring chains in the original mooring system which are listed in table 6 corresponding to the original mooring system the mooring chain in the simplified mooring system should be divided into top and bottom segments the diameter unrelated mooring chain parameters of each segment including mooring chain segment length l o submerged mass ω s u b and the axial stiffness e a are found by achieving the static restoring force equivalence hence the corresponding multi objective optimization problem can be established based on the p r o b l e m 1 p r o b l e m 3 m i n i m i z e f l o t l o b ω s u b t ω s u b b e a t e a b ϕ 1 i i 1 6 s u b j e c t t o l o t l o b ω s u b t ω s u b b e a t e a b ω s where ω s is the feasible range of design variables the superscript t and b represent the top segment and bottom segment respectively the diameter related mooring chain parameters including nominal diameter d and dry mass ω d r y are found by achieving the dynamic restoring force equivalence meanwhile the dry mass ω d r y can be obtained by the equation 7 ω d r y ω s u b 1 4 k d 2 π ρ where ω s u b is the submerged mass k is an empirical parameter for the studlink mooring chain used in this paper k 1 89 ρ is the water density thus the nominal diameter d is the only decision variable the multi objective optimization problem for achieving the dynamic restoring force equivalent in operational condition can be established based on p r o b l e m 2 p r o b l e m 4 m i n i m i z e f d t d b ϕ 2 i i 1 6 s u b j e c t t o d t d b ω d where ω d is the feasible range of design variables 4 1 2 simplified mooring system for operational condition the population and generation of nsga ii are respectively set as 300 and 100 for solving the p r o b l e m 3 and the static restoring force equivalent of the original and simplified mooring systems is achieved if the ϕ 1 is less than 0 02 eleven sets of diameter unrelated parameters are obtained with the achieving of static restoring force equivalent non dimensionalizing the eleven sets of solutions to convert them into points in a coordinate system the eleven points are divided into two groups by a sphere with a radius of 0 1 the representative set of diameter unrelated parameters selected from the two groups are listed in table 7 the static restoring forces of the two candidate simplified mooring systems and the original mooring system are compared in fig 4 it is clear to see that the static restoring force of the two candidate simplified mooring systems agree well with that of the original mooring system with the achieving of the static restoring force equivalent the diameter related parameters can be designed by achieving the dynamic restoring force equivalent according to the numerical simulation the dynamic restoring forces of the two candidate simplified mooring systems are obtained by applying the forced oscillation to their fairleads here the forced oscillation is the motion response of the vlfs module coupled with the original mooring system under the operational condition the population and generation of nsga ii are both set as 100 for solving the p r o b l e m 4 and the equivalent of the dynamic restoring force is achieved if the ϕ 2 is less than 0 05 after the computation is completed several sets of nominal diameter are obtained for the two candidate simplified mooring systems in this study the chain model is made of steel and the ratio of the submerged mass and dry mass for steel stud link chain is approximately equal to 0 87 thus the obtained nominal diameter with the ratio of the submerged mass and dry mass close to 0 87 is selected for each simplified mooring system as listed in table 8 as shown in fig 5 the dynamic restoring force of the two candidate simplified mooring systems coincide well with that of the original mooring system further the equivalence of motion response of the vessel mooring coupled system is validated to select the desired simplified mooring system the typical time series of the motion responses of the vlfs model coupled with the set 1 simplified mooring system and the original mooring system are presented in fig 6 the good coincidence of the vlfs motion response indicates that the simplified mooring system is equivalent with the original mooring system the correlation coefficients or ϕ 3 i for each set of the simplified mooring system are calculated and listed in table 9 when coupled with the two candidate simplified mooring systems the correlation coefficients of the vlfs module motion responses are all higher than 0 9 except for the roll motion of set 2 simplified mooring system the correlation coefficients are higher when the vlfs module coupled with the set 1 simplified mooring system than that coupled with the set 2 simplified mooring system therefore the set 1 simplified mooring system is selected as the desired simplified mooring system for operational condition 4 2 simplification design for survival condition 4 2 1 problem establishment the simplified mooring system for the survival condition is the same with that of the operational condition except that the mooring chain top segment length should be increased since the top segment length is the only design variable and the requirement of dynamic restoring force equivalence is more stringent the top segment length for survival condition is updated by achieving the dynamic restoring force equivalent directly thus the corresponding multi objective optimization problem for updating the top segment length is the same as p r o b l e m 4 except that the top segment length for survival condition l s t is the only design variable the population and generation of nsga ii are both set as 100 for finding the optimal top segment length the motion response of the vlfs module coupled with original mooring system under the two survival conditions are calculated to prepare the forced oscillation series for achieving dynamic restoring force equivalent and the equivalent is achieved if the ϕ 2 i is less than 0 05 4 2 2 simplified mooring system for survival condition with the achieving of dynamic restoring force equivalent ten sets of top segment length l s t are obtained the ten solutions are non dimensionalized and divided into one group by a sphere with a radius of 0 1 the selected representative top segment length for survival condition is listed in table 11 the comparison of dynamic restoring force of the original mooring system and the simplified mooring system under the survival condition env 7 irregular wave is shown in fig 7 which shows a good agreement of the dynamic restoring force between the original and simplified mooring systems the fig 8 shows the motion response of the vlfs module in env 7 irregular wave it can be found that the motion response of the vlfs module coincides well when it is coupled with the original and simplified mooring systems the correlation coefficients for the simplified mooring system are obtained as listed in table 10 the correlation coefficients for the two survival conditions are all larger than 0 9 which indicates that the motion response of the vlfs module coupled with the simplified mooring system is equivalent to that of the original mooring system in survival condition the complete parameters of the simplified mooring system are given in table 11 the simplified mooring system consists of 10 mooring chains and the coordinates of its anchor point and fairlead are listed in table 6 the calculation of designing process is completed on a server with two e5 2650 cpus and takes less than 10 hours according to the numerical simulation results the simplified mooring system designed by the proposed methodology has the equivalent static and dynamic restoring forces with the original mooring system and the vlfs module has a equivalent motion response when coupled with the original and simplified mooring systems thereafter a series of model tests were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mooring system simplification methodology 5 experimental setup a series of model tests of the original and simplified mooring systems were carried out based on the numerical simulation to further validate the proposed methodology the model tests were performed in the ocean engineering basin at shanghai jiao tong university the length width and depth of the basin are 50 m 30 m and 6 m respectively an artificial moveable bottom is employed to adjust the water depth various ocean environments including collinear or non collinear waves currents and winds can be modeled by using a double flap high powered wave generator a high pressure water jet current generation system and an axial wind fan the linear scale ratio is 1 100 in experimental tests the water depth of the model test is fixed at 0 5 meters in model scale the properties of the vlfs module the original and simplified mooring systems are listed in tables 1 2 and 11 the geometry and mass properties of the vlfs module were exactly modeled including the dimensions mass draft position of the center of gravity cog and radii of gyration the mooring chain models of the original and simplified mooring systems were fabricated by using small steel chains and their axial stiffness were exactly modeled by light linear springs the mooring chain models were fixed at the corresponding anchor points which are listed in tables 3 and 6 respectively figs 9 and 10 show snapshots of the vlfs model and mooring chain model several weights were placed on the deck to adjust the mass and the position of the cog of the vlfs model the bulbs on the mast were the targets of the non contact optical motion tracking system to measure the 6 dof motion of the vlfs model the top end tension of mooring chains were measured by force transducers the ambient wave elevation was measured by wave gauges the layout of the experiment is shown in fig 11 where the range of the force transducer is 0 10 kg with the precision of 0 001 kg the measurement precision of the non contact optical motion tracking system is 0 1 mm and the range of the wave gauge is 0 30 cm with the precision of 1 mm the environmental conditions of regular and irregular wave parameters are listed in tables 4 and 5 the accuracy of the model fabrication was validated by the static offset test and non moored decay test the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems was investigated based on a series of tests including decay test white noise test and the regular and irregular wave tests the time duration of irregular wave tests was 3 h in the full scale which was 18 min in the model test 6 results and discussion 6 1 calibration of the vlfs and mooring chain models the non moored decay test for the vlfs model was conducted to calibrate the model fabrication the motion response of the vlfs model in heave roll and pitch dofs measured in decay test are compared with the simulation results in fig 12 the good coincidence indicates that the geometry and mass properties of the vlfs model were exactly modeled the original and simplified mooring chain models were installed on the calibrated vlfs model and the static offset test was performed to calibrate the chain model fabrication the measured static restoring forces of the original and simplified mooring systems for operational and survival conditions are compared with the simulation results in fig 13 it can be seen that the measured static restoring forces coincide very well with the simulation results which implies that the mooring chain models were correctly fabricated and the two mooring systems were properly installed on the vlfs model meanwhile fig 13 shows that the static performance of the original and simplified mooring systems are equivalent since the static restoring forces of the two mooring systems for both operational and survival conditions coincide well 6 2 decay test the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems in natural period and damping coefficient was validated by performing a decay test as shown in fig 14 for both operational and survival conditions the measured motion responses of the vlfs model moored by the original and simplified mooring systems coincide well except some differences caused by the initial position deviation of the vlfs model can be observed in surge dof for operational condition further the natural period and damping coefficient calculated from the measured results are listed in tables 12 and 13 the difference of the natural period of the 6 dof motion responses of the vlfs model moored by the original and simplified mooring systems is less than 4 and the difference of the corresponding damping coefficient is not larger than 0 02 which implies that the two mooring systems have the equivalent damping and stiffness characteristics within the tolerance hence the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems for both operational and survival conditions is preliminarily verified by the decay test the decreasing of the mooring chain length leads to a stronger restoring force of the mooring system the natural periods of surge sway and yaw motions of the vlfs model coupled with the mooring system for operational condition are only 50 to 60 of that for the survival condition however the natural periods of heave roll and pitch motions are not significantly affected by the change of mooring chain length 6 3 white noise and regular wave tests the original and simplified mooring systems for operational condition were utilized in the white noise and regular wave tests to investigate the equivalence of their performance in waves the properties of the regular waves are listed in table 4 the motion raos of the vlfs model with the original and simplified mooring systems are calculated based on the results measured in white noise test which are shown in fig 15 for both original and simplified mooring systems the motion response of the vlfs model is mainly concentrated on the frequency lower than 0 4 rad s the motion near the natural frequency dominants the motion response in surge sway pitch and yaw dofs for the heave and pitch motions besides the rao peak at natural frequency an obvious peak can be observed at the frequency lower than 0 2 rad s and near 0 4 rad s meanwhile a relatively small peak of the roll and pitch motions can be observed at the frequency near 1 2 rad s according to the white noise test results the raos of the vlfs model motion responses show a good agreement which indicates the vlfs model has the same amplitude of motion response at the same frequency moored by the original and simplified mooring systems the results validate the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring system the deviations appear in the raos is attributed to the experimental setup and the data measurement the motion responses of the vlfs model coupled with the original and simplified mooring systems were measured in the regular wave test the motion responses under the env 1 and env 4 regular waves are shown in fig 16 as examples where the high frequency noise in the measured results were filtered out the motion response of the vlfs model with the simplified mooring system coincides well with that of the original mooring system however since the vlfs model has the lower raos at the frequency of 0 6 rad s the actual motion response of the vlfs model excited by regular wave is consequently small taking the surge motion in env 1 regular wave as an example fig 16 a the maximum amplitude of the surge motion is less than 0 2 meters which is 2 millimeters measured in the model test in such a small measured value the actual surge motion response may be affected by the system noise and is difficult to completely extract from the measured results which leads to an obvious deviation of the vlfs model surge motion response with the increasing of the wave height and period the actual motion response of the vlfs model dominates the measured results and the coincidence shows for the motion response of the vlfs model when moored by the original and simplified mooring systems further the correlation coefficients of the vlfs motion responses when moored by the original and simplified mooring systems are calculated based on the regular wave test results and listed in table 14 it can be found that except for env 1 regular wave the correlation coefficients of vlfs motion response are higher than 0 95 which indicates a high equivalence of vlfs motion response when moored by the original and simplified mooring systems and confirms the equivalence of the two kinds of mooring systems in summary the results of the white noise and regular wave test show that the simplified mooring system for operational condition is equivalent with the original mooring system within acceptable discrepancy the simplified mooring system designed by the mooring system simplification methodology liang et al 2020 can be used in a scale model test to replace the original mooring system without significantly affecting the motion response of the vlfs model 6 4 irregular wave test the equivalent of the original and simplified mooring systems for operational and survival conditions was validated by performing an irregular wave test the properties of the irregular waves are presented in table 5 the typical time series of motion response of the vlfs model in the env 5 and env 7 irregular waves are shown in fig 17 as shown in the figure the vlfs model has the coincidence motion response when moored by the original and simplified mooring systems in survival condition however the deviation can be found in phase when the vlfs model is tested in operational condition the frequency range of the env 5 irregular wave is from 0 5 rad s to 1 9 rad s in which the moored vlfs model has a small motion response fig 15 thus the actual motion response excited by the env 5 irregular wave may be affected by the system noise and is difficult to completely extract from the measured results for the survival conditions the increasing of the significant wave height and decreasing of the wave peak frequency lead to the dominance of actual motion response in the measured results and the high equivalence of vlfs model motion response when moored by the original and simplified mooring system is also revealed further the power spectral density psd of the vlfs model motion response is obtained and shown in figs 18 and 19 the low frequency motion dominates the vlfs model motion response both in operational and survival conditions and the obvious wave frequency motion is observed in the heave roll and pitch dof in survival condition the effect of lower actual motion response in operational condition on the experimental results is also shown in psd of the vlfs model motion for the operational condition except for the surge motion the main power peak appears at the same frequency when vlfs model is moored by the original and simplified mooring system while the main peak value is smaller for the vlfs model with the simplified mooring system for the survival condition the 6 dof motion psds of the vlfs model with the original and simplified mooring systems coincide well in both low frequency and wave frequency while some discrepancy introduced by the fourier transform in main peak value can be observed in the roll motion although the measured results of the operational condition have some deviation the time series and psds of the vlfs model motions in survival condition are enough to validate that the original and simplified mooring systems have the equivalent performance under the irregular wave conditions further the equivalence of the vlfs model motion response is quantified by using correlation coefficients which are listed in table 15 the correlation coefficients in the two survival conditions are larger than 0 8 while the correlation coefficients are much lower in the operational condition as described before the experimental bias is the cause of the low correlation coefficients in operational condition and the correlation coefficients in the two survival conditions indicate a significant correlation of the vlfs model motion response and also confirms the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems the statistics of the vlfs model motion in the operational and survival conditions are compared in fig 20 where the height of the box represents the standard deviation the maximum and minimum value measured in the model test have some randomness and uncertainty thus instead of the maximum and minimum value the mean value and standard deviation are more effective in demonstrating the equivalence of the vlfs motion response the mean value and standard deviation of the motion response of the vlfs model with the simplified mooring system are close to that of the original mooring system in both operational and survival conditions which further proves that the motion responses of the vlfs model are equivalent in the irregular wave condition when it is moored by the original and simplified mooring systems it can be concluded that the simplified mooring system designed by the mooring system simplification methodology is equivalent with the original mooring system and can be utilized to replace the original mooring system in irregular wave tests the correlation coefficients obtained based on the model tests are lower than that obtained in the numerical simulation by comparing the tables 9 10 and 15 the discrepancy introduced by the model fabrication experimental setup and data measurement jointly reduce the equivalence of motion response of the vlfs coupled with the original and simplified mooring systems the small scale ratio which is 1 100 in this model test also enlarges the proportion of discrepancy and systematic noise in the measured result to some extent on the other aspect the linear theory used in the numerical simulation cannot accurately predict the damping and wave exciting force induced by nonlinear effects rudman and cleary 2016 in the scale model test meanwhile the nonlinear effects such as slamming and green water were frequently observed in the irregular wave tests in survival condition which also accounte for the discrepancies with the decreasing of the mooring line number the complexity of the experimental setup is reduced which also leads to the reduction of the experiment uncertainty moreover in our future work a model testing of a multi module vlfs with a mooring system consists 80 to 100 mooring chains is about to be conducted it can be expected that the validated mooring system simplification methodology can be a powerful tool for reducing mooring lines with retaining same dynamic response coupled with the vlfs in that case however reducing the number of fairleads might also be a valuable option to be further investigated 7 conclusion to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the mooring system simplification methodology proposed in our previous study liang et al 2020 a 10 chains simplified mooring system is designed to replace a 20 chains original mooring system in a scale model test and a series scale model test including decay test white noise test regular and irregular wave tests are presented in this paper to validate the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems is calibrated by the model test results that the difference of the natural period and damping coefficient of the 6 dof motion response of the vlfs model with the original and simplified mooring system is less than 4 and 0 02 and the correlation coefficients of the vlfs motion response with the original and simplified mooring systems are larger than 0 9 in regular wave conditions and larger than 0 8 in survival conditions although the motion responses measured in the operational condition are affected by the system noise due to the selected too small scale ratio the statistical results agree well for the vlfs module with the original and simplified mooring systems the equivalence of the two mooring systems indicates that the mooring system simplification methodology is effective in designing the simplified mooring system to replace the original mooring system in a scale model test the model fabrication experimental setup data measurement can introduce the dependency to reduce the equivalence between the original and simplified mooring systems in the scale model experiment the nonlinear effects which cannot be accurately predicted when designing the simplified mooring system also accounte for the performance discrepancy between the original and simplified mooring systems if applicable the model scale ratio should be selected as large as possible to reduce the systematic noise effects in the measured experimental results with the validation of the mooring system simplification methodology this methodology can be used in the model test of a multi module vlfs with a mooring system consists 80 to 100 mooring chains in our future work with the help of mooring system simplification methodology an equivalent mooring system with less mooring chain can be designed and utilized in the model test to

21210,the scale model experiment for typical offshore floating structures with increasingly excessive mooring lines is usually complex and difficult to set up which often results in low reliability of the experimental results in the previous paper liang et al 2019 proposed a mooring system simplification methodology for the scale model experiment based on the equivalent of the vessel mooring coupled dynamics for vessel with original and simplified mooring systems and demonstrated its effectiveness by numerical studies in this paper the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology is further evaluated by a model test for a very large floating structure s vlfs s mooring system comprising 20 mooring chains a 10 chains simplified mooring system is obtained with the correlation coefficients of coupled vessel mooring dynamics larger than 0 9 thereafter the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems is validated by performing the decay test white noise test regular and irregular wave tests the coincidence of the model test results including natural period damping coefficient response amplitude operator rao motion power spectral density and motion time series of the vlfs model confirms the equivalence of the simplified mooring system with the original mooring system and indicates that the mooring system simplification methodology is effective in designing the simplified mooring system to replace the original mooring system in a scale model experiment keywords scale model experiment simplification methodology vessel mooring dynamics equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems 1 introduction as typical offshore floating structures very large floating structures vlfss including pontoon type mega floats and semi submersible type mobile off shore bases mobs have attracted much interest in the field of coastal and ocean engineering watanabe et al 2004 palo 2005 suzuki 2005 lamas pardo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 etc for these floating structures the line number of their mooring system is increasingly numerous due to their huge size and high station keeping requirements felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 fan et al 2018 especially for long term service vlfss for airport or military use which often comprise five or more modules the mooring system for each module has 20 or more mooring lines girard et al 2001 2003 it is challenging to conduct a scale model experiment for these kinds of offshore floating structures since the uncertainties cost by the excessive number of mooring lines significantly decrease the accuracy of the experimental results and increase the complexity of experimental setup which can lead to low reliability of the obtained results even with high cost of labor and time hughes 1993 ji and yuan 2015 the uncertainty of experimental results δ z can be expressed as follows 1 δ z i 1 n f x i 2 δ x i 2 where δ z is the uncertainty of the output z that z f x 1 x 1 x n x i and δ x i are the i th input and its uncertainty respectively n is the number of the input for a vlfs scaled model test with excessive number of mooring lines the uncertainty of the mooring system input δ x i cannot be inherently eliminated and will propagate with the increase of mooring lines therefore instead of reducing the input related uncertainties of the mooring system in a model test reducing the number of mooring lines is an alternatively effective way to improve the reliability of experimental results however within the knowledge of authors the relevant theoretical and experimental studies are rare in the field of coastal and ocean engineering kim et al 2005 have conducted a model test where the prototype mooring system with 12 lines is replaced by an equivalent mooring system with 4 lines according to their study the equivalent diameter was derived from the condition of equal drag force felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 have designed a 4 lines scaled mooring system for simulating a 16 lines prototype mooring system based on equivalent of static restoring forces blanke and nguyen 2018 have proposed a model experiment to validate the concept for scenarios with mooring line breaking a 4 lines mooring system is utilized in their model experiment to replace the 16 lines mooring system the simplified mooring system is supposed to replace the original mooring system in a model test which implies that the static and dynamic characteristics of the simplified mooring system should be equivalent to that of the original mooring system in this perspective the mooring system simplification problem is similar to the mooring system truncation problem which is dedicated to overcoming the limited depth of the ocean engineering basin in modeling the mooring lines where the motion response of the vessel with the full depth and truncated mooring systems should be equivalent su et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 and wei et al 2017 transformed the truncation problem into a multi objective optimization problem and used the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to find the optimal truncated mooring system however different from the truncation problem the simplification of the mooring system focuses on the equivalence of the mooring system performance the equivalence of the static and dynamic characteristics of the individual mooring line cannot be accomplished because of the different mooring line number and therefore is not the objective function of the mooring system simplification thus the method of designing truncated mooring system cannot be directly utilized to design the simplified mooring system the methodologies for designing the mooring systems can also be found in other studies shafieefar and rezvani 2007 described a mooring system optimization design methodologies based on genetic algorithm ga the weighted sum method was used to normalize the objective functions felix gonzalez and mercier 2016 introduced an optimized design procedure for statically equivalent mooring system based on ga in their study three objective functions were normalized by utilizing several sets of weighting factors brommundt et al 2012 described a new tool for the optimization of catenary mooring system for floating wind turbine they established an optimization problem with four design variables and three constraints to minimize the mooring line length da fonseca monteiro et al 2016 proposed a study of designing mooring system by using particle swarm optimization pso and the differential evolution de methods however a simplified mooring system design requires to ensure that the performance of original and simplified mooring system is equivalent thus the methodologies mentioned above cannot meet this specific requirement to tackle the problem for designing simplified mooring system for experiment use liang et al 2020 proposed a mooring system simplification methodology based on the equivalent of the vessel mooring coupled dynamics in this paper the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology is further evaluated by a series of model tests for a vlfs s mooring system comprising 20 mooring chains the main contributions of this paper includes 1 the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology is demonstrated by a series of numerical simulations where a 10 chains simplified mooring system is designed to replace the 20 chains original mooring system of a vlfs module in the scale model test 2 the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology is verified by validating the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring system in a series of scale model tests which include decay test white noise test regular and irregular wave tests the paper is organized as follows the outline of the mooring system simplification methodology is described in section 2 the main parameters of the original mooring system and the vlfs module are given in section 3 the simplified mooring system is designed by the mooring system simplification methodology in section 4 the model experimental setup and the results are described in sections 5 and 6 respectively finally the conclusion is drawn in section 7 2 outline of the mooring system simplification methodology in this paper we only give an outline of the mooring system simplification methodology while the details can be found in liang et al 2020 the mooring system simplification for model experiment requires that the motion response of the floating structure with the original and simplified mooring systems should be equivalent the motion response of floating structure under environmental excitation can be obtained by 2 m a y c y k y f e f m where m and a are respectively the mass and the added mass matrix of the floating structure c is the damping matrix k is the stiffness matrix y y y are the acceleration velocity and position vectors of the floating structure respectively f m is the mooring force and f e is the external environmental force for the floating structure in a particular environmental condition the difference of its motion response mainly results from the f m when coupling with different mooring systems as can be inferred if the f m of the original mooring system is modeled accurately by the simplified mooring system the motion response of the floating structure can remain unchanged in a model test when its original mooring system is replaced by the simplified mooring system therefore the governing principles of designing a simplified mooring system can be drawn as follows 1 the equivalent of static restoring forces in the vessel six degrees of freedom dofs 2 the equivalent of dynamic restoring forces in the vessel six dofs 3 the equivalent of motion responses of vessel mooring coupled system the three governing principles can be expressed mathematically as follows 3 ϕ 1 1 n 1 j 1 n 1 r j s r j s r j s 2 4 ϕ 2 1 n 2 j 1 n 2 r j d r j d r m a x d 2 5 ϕ 3 c o v y s y o v y s v y o where r s and r s r 6 n 1 which are the static restoring force vector of the original and simplified mooring systems respectively r d and r d r 6 n 2 which are the dynamic restoring forces of the original and simplified mooring systems respectively r m a x d is the maximum dynamic restoring force of the original mooring system n 1 and n 2 are the number of elements in the static and dynamic restoring force series respectively j indicates the j th element in the restoring force series y s y o are the time histories of the floating structure motion response when coupled with simplified and original mooring systems respectively c o v is the covariance operation v is the variance operation the equivalence of the static and dynamic restoring forces can be quantified by the ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 which are the relative deviation of the restoring force between original and simplified mooring systems the smaller value of ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 indicate a better equivalence of the static and dynamic restoring forces the equivalence of the vessel mooring coupled dynamics is quantified by the correlation coefficient ϕ 3 the vessel mooring coupled system has a higher correlation if the ϕ 3 is closer to 1 in a scale model experiment the mooring chain model can be made of different materials such as stainless steel galvanized steel aluminum brass and different types of plastics while its axial stiffness is provided by a light linear spring thus the diameter of the chain model is not fully correlated with the axial stiffness and submerged mass the static restoring force of a mooring system is determined by the diameter unrelated parameters such as mooring line number line length axial stiffness submerged mass and mooring system layout besides the diameter unrelated parameters the dynamic restoring force of a mooring system is determined by the diameter related parameters such as nominal diameter and dry mass therefore the diameter related and diameter unrelated parameters of the simplified mooring system can be designed separately by achieving the equivalent of static and dynamic restoring forces to find the optimal diameter unrelated parameters the multi objective optimization problem for achieving the static restoring force equivalent can be established p r o b l e m 1 m i n i m i z e f l e a ω s u b n α ϕ 1 i i 1 6 s u b j e c t t o l e a ω s u b n α ω s where l is the mooring line length e a is the axial stiffness ω s u b is the submerged mass n is the mooring line number α represents the mooring system layout i indicates the i th dof of the vessel model with the achieving of the static restoring force equivalence several sets of diameter unrelated parameters can be obtained non dimensionalizing those sets of parameters by eq 6 to convert them into points in a coordinate system the diameter unrelated parameter sets are divided into different groups by grouping the corresponding points with a sphere which has a radius of δ u one representative set of diameter unrelated parameters is selected from each group since an arbitrary solution in the same group can represent the others the fig 1 gives an example of non dimensionalizing and grouping of the solutions 6 p i p i p i min p i max p i min where the p i is the i th dimensionless design variable p i max and p i min are the maximum and minimum values of design variable p i thereafter the diameter related parameters can be designed for each representative set of diameter unrelated parameters by achieving the dynamic restoring force the corresponding multi objective optimization problem can be established p r o b l e m 2 m i n i m i z e f d ω d r y ϕ 2 i i 1 6 s u b j e c t t o d ω d r y ω d where d is the nominal diameter ω d r y is the dry mass i indicates the i th dof of the vessel model the global optimum solutions of the p r o b l e m 1 and p r o b l e m 2 are difficult to obtain since the objective functions may be in contradiction the nsga ii srinivas and deb 1994 deb et al 2002 hassan et al 2005 can be utilized to solve the p r o b l e m 1 and p r o b l e m 2 the details of the mooring system simplification methodology can be found in liang et al 2020 after the diameter related and diameter unrelated parameters are obtained the desired simplified mooring system can be selected according to the equivalence of vessel mooring coupled dynamics when the floating structure couples with the original and simplified mooring systems 3 description of the model in this study a catenary mooring system of a semi submersible vlfs module is selected as an example to demonstrate the mooring system simplification methodology the two coordinate systems used to define the motion of vlfs module include the global coordinate system o g x g y g z g and the body fixed coordinate system o b x b y b z b the global coordinate system is fixed in space with o g x g y g plane located at the still water surface and z g axis oriented straight up the body fixed coordinate system is fixed to the vlfs module and coincides with the global coordinate system in its initial position see fig 2 as shown in fig 3 the semi submersible vlfs module is composed of ten cylinder columns five pontoons and eight cylinder braces the red points on the side of the pontoons indicate the fairleads the properties of the vlfs module are listed in table 1 each mooring chain of the original mooring system consists of two segments the top segment and the bottom segment the properties of the original mooring system including the chain length for operational and survival conditions l o and l s the nominal diameter d the dry mass ω d r y the submerged mass ω s u b and the axial stiffness e a are listed in table 2 the original mooring system of the vlfs module consists of 20 mooring chains stretching out from 10 fairleads and can be grouped into 10 bunches according to the fairleads it is reasonable to simplify the 2 mooring chains of each bunch into one mooring chain thus the number of the mooring chain in the simplified mooring system is reduced as 10 the original mooring system is anchored at the water depth of 50 m the coordinates of its anchor points and the fairleads are listed in table 3 the environmental conditions utilized in this study consist four regular waves and three irregular waves which are listed in tables 4 and 5 where env is the abbreviation of environment the env 5 irregular wave is the operational condition and the env 6 and env 7 irregular waves are the survival conditions 4 design of the simplified mooring system to demonstrate the feasibility of the mooring system simplification methodology a 10 chains simplified mooring system is designed for the vlfs scale model test to replace the 20 chains original mooring system according to table 2 the top segment length of the original mooring system is larger in the survival condition than that in the operational condition which leads to the changes in performance of the original mooring system consequently the original mooring system for the operational and survival conditions should be respectively modeled by two simplified mooring systems in this study it is required that the parameters of the two simplified mooring systems are the same except that the top segment length is increased in the survival condition therefore the top segment length for the survival condition can be updated based on the obtained simplified mooring system for operational condition 4 1 simplification design for operational condition 4 1 1 problem establishment the chain number should be determined before designing the simplified mooring system as described in section 3 the chains in the original mooring system are grouped into ten bundles it is reasonable to simplify each bundle of the original mooring chains into one thus the simplified mooring system should consist of 10 mooring chains meanwhile the anchor point and fairlead of each mooring chain in the simplified system locates at the average position of corresponding bundle of mooring chains in the original mooring system which are listed in table 6 corresponding to the original mooring system the mooring chain in the simplified mooring system should be divided into top and bottom segments the diameter unrelated mooring chain parameters of each segment including mooring chain segment length l o submerged mass ω s u b and the axial stiffness e a are found by achieving the static restoring force equivalence hence the corresponding multi objective optimization problem can be established based on the p r o b l e m 1 p r o b l e m 3 m i n i m i z e f l o t l o b ω s u b t ω s u b b e a t e a b ϕ 1 i i 1 6 s u b j e c t t o l o t l o b ω s u b t ω s u b b e a t e a b ω s where ω s is the feasible range of design variables the superscript t and b represent the top segment and bottom segment respectively the diameter related mooring chain parameters including nominal diameter d and dry mass ω d r y are found by achieving the dynamic restoring force equivalence meanwhile the dry mass ω d r y can be obtained by the equation 7 ω d r y ω s u b 1 4 k d 2 π ρ where ω s u b is the submerged mass k is an empirical parameter for the studlink mooring chain used in this paper k 1 89 ρ is the water density thus the nominal diameter d is the only decision variable the multi objective optimization problem for achieving the dynamic restoring force equivalent in operational condition can be established based on p r o b l e m 2 p r o b l e m 4 m i n i m i z e f d t d b ϕ 2 i i 1 6 s u b j e c t t o d t d b ω d where ω d is the feasible range of design variables 4 1 2 simplified mooring system for operational condition the population and generation of nsga ii are respectively set as 300 and 100 for solving the p r o b l e m 3 and the static restoring force equivalent of the original and simplified mooring systems is achieved if the ϕ 1 is less than 0 02 eleven sets of diameter unrelated parameters are obtained with the achieving of static restoring force equivalent non dimensionalizing the eleven sets of solutions to convert them into points in a coordinate system the eleven points are divided into two groups by a sphere with a radius of 0 1 the representative set of diameter unrelated parameters selected from the two groups are listed in table 7 the static restoring forces of the two candidate simplified mooring systems and the original mooring system are compared in fig 4 it is clear to see that the static restoring force of the two candidate simplified mooring systems agree well with that of the original mooring system with the achieving of the static restoring force equivalent the diameter related parameters can be designed by achieving the dynamic restoring force equivalent according to the numerical simulation the dynamic restoring forces of the two candidate simplified mooring systems are obtained by applying the forced oscillation to their fairleads here the forced oscillation is the motion response of the vlfs module coupled with the original mooring system under the operational condition the population and generation of nsga ii are both set as 100 for solving the p r o b l e m 4 and the equivalent of the dynamic restoring force is achieved if the ϕ 2 is less than 0 05 after the computation is completed several sets of nominal diameter are obtained for the two candidate simplified mooring systems in this study the chain model is made of steel and the ratio of the submerged mass and dry mass for steel stud link chain is approximately equal to 0 87 thus the obtained nominal diameter with the ratio of the submerged mass and dry mass close to 0 87 is selected for each simplified mooring system as listed in table 8 as shown in fig 5 the dynamic restoring force of the two candidate simplified mooring systems coincide well with that of the original mooring system further the equivalence of motion response of the vessel mooring coupled system is validated to select the desired simplified mooring system the typical time series of the motion responses of the vlfs model coupled with the set 1 simplified mooring system and the original mooring system are presented in fig 6 the good coincidence of the vlfs motion response indicates that the simplified mooring system is equivalent with the original mooring system the correlation coefficients or ϕ 3 i for each set of the simplified mooring system are calculated and listed in table 9 when coupled with the two candidate simplified mooring systems the correlation coefficients of the vlfs module motion responses are all higher than 0 9 except for the roll motion of set 2 simplified mooring system the correlation coefficients are higher when the vlfs module coupled with the set 1 simplified mooring system than that coupled with the set 2 simplified mooring system therefore the set 1 simplified mooring system is selected as the desired simplified mooring system for operational condition 4 2 simplification design for survival condition 4 2 1 problem establishment the simplified mooring system for the survival condition is the same with that of the operational condition except that the mooring chain top segment length should be increased since the top segment length is the only design variable and the requirement of dynamic restoring force equivalence is more stringent the top segment length for survival condition is updated by achieving the dynamic restoring force equivalent directly thus the corresponding multi objective optimization problem for updating the top segment length is the same as p r o b l e m 4 except that the top segment length for survival condition l s t is the only design variable the population and generation of nsga ii are both set as 100 for finding the optimal top segment length the motion response of the vlfs module coupled with original mooring system under the two survival conditions are calculated to prepare the forced oscillation series for achieving dynamic restoring force equivalent and the equivalent is achieved if the ϕ 2 i is less than 0 05 4 2 2 simplified mooring system for survival condition with the achieving of dynamic restoring force equivalent ten sets of top segment length l s t are obtained the ten solutions are non dimensionalized and divided into one group by a sphere with a radius of 0 1 the selected representative top segment length for survival condition is listed in table 11 the comparison of dynamic restoring force of the original mooring system and the simplified mooring system under the survival condition env 7 irregular wave is shown in fig 7 which shows a good agreement of the dynamic restoring force between the original and simplified mooring systems the fig 8 shows the motion response of the vlfs module in env 7 irregular wave it can be found that the motion response of the vlfs module coincides well when it is coupled with the original and simplified mooring systems the correlation coefficients for the simplified mooring system are obtained as listed in table 10 the correlation coefficients for the two survival conditions are all larger than 0 9 which indicates that the motion response of the vlfs module coupled with the simplified mooring system is equivalent to that of the original mooring system in survival condition the complete parameters of the simplified mooring system are given in table 11 the simplified mooring system consists of 10 mooring chains and the coordinates of its anchor point and fairlead are listed in table 6 the calculation of designing process is completed on a server with two e5 2650 cpus and takes less than 10 hours according to the numerical simulation results the simplified mooring system designed by the proposed methodology has the equivalent static and dynamic restoring forces with the original mooring system and the vlfs module has a equivalent motion response when coupled with the original and simplified mooring systems thereafter a series of model tests were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mooring system simplification methodology 5 experimental setup a series of model tests of the original and simplified mooring systems were carried out based on the numerical simulation to further validate the proposed methodology the model tests were performed in the ocean engineering basin at shanghai jiao tong university the length width and depth of the basin are 50 m 30 m and 6 m respectively an artificial moveable bottom is employed to adjust the water depth various ocean environments including collinear or non collinear waves currents and winds can be modeled by using a double flap high powered wave generator a high pressure water jet current generation system and an axial wind fan the linear scale ratio is 1 100 in experimental tests the water depth of the model test is fixed at 0 5 meters in model scale the properties of the vlfs module the original and simplified mooring systems are listed in tables 1 2 and 11 the geometry and mass properties of the vlfs module were exactly modeled including the dimensions mass draft position of the center of gravity cog and radii of gyration the mooring chain models of the original and simplified mooring systems were fabricated by using small steel chains and their axial stiffness were exactly modeled by light linear springs the mooring chain models were fixed at the corresponding anchor points which are listed in tables 3 and 6 respectively figs 9 and 10 show snapshots of the vlfs model and mooring chain model several weights were placed on the deck to adjust the mass and the position of the cog of the vlfs model the bulbs on the mast were the targets of the non contact optical motion tracking system to measure the 6 dof motion of the vlfs model the top end tension of mooring chains were measured by force transducers the ambient wave elevation was measured by wave gauges the layout of the experiment is shown in fig 11 where the range of the force transducer is 0 10 kg with the precision of 0 001 kg the measurement precision of the non contact optical motion tracking system is 0 1 mm and the range of the wave gauge is 0 30 cm with the precision of 1 mm the environmental conditions of regular and irregular wave parameters are listed in tables 4 and 5 the accuracy of the model fabrication was validated by the static offset test and non moored decay test the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems was investigated based on a series of tests including decay test white noise test and the regular and irregular wave tests the time duration of irregular wave tests was 3 h in the full scale which was 18 min in the model test 6 results and discussion 6 1 calibration of the vlfs and mooring chain models the non moored decay test for the vlfs model was conducted to calibrate the model fabrication the motion response of the vlfs model in heave roll and pitch dofs measured in decay test are compared with the simulation results in fig 12 the good coincidence indicates that the geometry and mass properties of the vlfs model were exactly modeled the original and simplified mooring chain models were installed on the calibrated vlfs model and the static offset test was performed to calibrate the chain model fabrication the measured static restoring forces of the original and simplified mooring systems for operational and survival conditions are compared with the simulation results in fig 13 it can be seen that the measured static restoring forces coincide very well with the simulation results which implies that the mooring chain models were correctly fabricated and the two mooring systems were properly installed on the vlfs model meanwhile fig 13 shows that the static performance of the original and simplified mooring systems are equivalent since the static restoring forces of the two mooring systems for both operational and survival conditions coincide well 6 2 decay test the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems in natural period and damping coefficient was validated by performing a decay test as shown in fig 14 for both operational and survival conditions the measured motion responses of the vlfs model moored by the original and simplified mooring systems coincide well except some differences caused by the initial position deviation of the vlfs model can be observed in surge dof for operational condition further the natural period and damping coefficient calculated from the measured results are listed in tables 12 and 13 the difference of the natural period of the 6 dof motion responses of the vlfs model moored by the original and simplified mooring systems is less than 4 and the difference of the corresponding damping coefficient is not larger than 0 02 which implies that the two mooring systems have the equivalent damping and stiffness characteristics within the tolerance hence the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems for both operational and survival conditions is preliminarily verified by the decay test the decreasing of the mooring chain length leads to a stronger restoring force of the mooring system the natural periods of surge sway and yaw motions of the vlfs model coupled with the mooring system for operational condition are only 50 to 60 of that for the survival condition however the natural periods of heave roll and pitch motions are not significantly affected by the change of mooring chain length 6 3 white noise and regular wave tests the original and simplified mooring systems for operational condition were utilized in the white noise and regular wave tests to investigate the equivalence of their performance in waves the properties of the regular waves are listed in table 4 the motion raos of the vlfs model with the original and simplified mooring systems are calculated based on the results measured in white noise test which are shown in fig 15 for both original and simplified mooring systems the motion response of the vlfs model is mainly concentrated on the frequency lower than 0 4 rad s the motion near the natural frequency dominants the motion response in surge sway pitch and yaw dofs for the heave and pitch motions besides the rao peak at natural frequency an obvious peak can be observed at the frequency lower than 0 2 rad s and near 0 4 rad s meanwhile a relatively small peak of the roll and pitch motions can be observed at the frequency near 1 2 rad s according to the white noise test results the raos of the vlfs model motion responses show a good agreement which indicates the vlfs model has the same amplitude of motion response at the same frequency moored by the original and simplified mooring systems the results validate the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring system the deviations appear in the raos is attributed to the experimental setup and the data measurement the motion responses of the vlfs model coupled with the original and simplified mooring systems were measured in the regular wave test the motion responses under the env 1 and env 4 regular waves are shown in fig 16 as examples where the high frequency noise in the measured results were filtered out the motion response of the vlfs model with the simplified mooring system coincides well with that of the original mooring system however since the vlfs model has the lower raos at the frequency of 0 6 rad s the actual motion response of the vlfs model excited by regular wave is consequently small taking the surge motion in env 1 regular wave as an example fig 16 a the maximum amplitude of the surge motion is less than 0 2 meters which is 2 millimeters measured in the model test in such a small measured value the actual surge motion response may be affected by the system noise and is difficult to completely extract from the measured results which leads to an obvious deviation of the vlfs model surge motion response with the increasing of the wave height and period the actual motion response of the vlfs model dominates the measured results and the coincidence shows for the motion response of the vlfs model when moored by the original and simplified mooring systems further the correlation coefficients of the vlfs motion responses when moored by the original and simplified mooring systems are calculated based on the regular wave test results and listed in table 14 it can be found that except for env 1 regular wave the correlation coefficients of vlfs motion response are higher than 0 95 which indicates a high equivalence of vlfs motion response when moored by the original and simplified mooring systems and confirms the equivalence of the two kinds of mooring systems in summary the results of the white noise and regular wave test show that the simplified mooring system for operational condition is equivalent with the original mooring system within acceptable discrepancy the simplified mooring system designed by the mooring system simplification methodology liang et al 2020 can be used in a scale model test to replace the original mooring system without significantly affecting the motion response of the vlfs model 6 4 irregular wave test the equivalent of the original and simplified mooring systems for operational and survival conditions was validated by performing an irregular wave test the properties of the irregular waves are presented in table 5 the typical time series of motion response of the vlfs model in the env 5 and env 7 irregular waves are shown in fig 17 as shown in the figure the vlfs model has the coincidence motion response when moored by the original and simplified mooring systems in survival condition however the deviation can be found in phase when the vlfs model is tested in operational condition the frequency range of the env 5 irregular wave is from 0 5 rad s to 1 9 rad s in which the moored vlfs model has a small motion response fig 15 thus the actual motion response excited by the env 5 irregular wave may be affected by the system noise and is difficult to completely extract from the measured results for the survival conditions the increasing of the significant wave height and decreasing of the wave peak frequency lead to the dominance of actual motion response in the measured results and the high equivalence of vlfs model motion response when moored by the original and simplified mooring system is also revealed further the power spectral density psd of the vlfs model motion response is obtained and shown in figs 18 and 19 the low frequency motion dominates the vlfs model motion response both in operational and survival conditions and the obvious wave frequency motion is observed in the heave roll and pitch dof in survival condition the effect of lower actual motion response in operational condition on the experimental results is also shown in psd of the vlfs model motion for the operational condition except for the surge motion the main power peak appears at the same frequency when vlfs model is moored by the original and simplified mooring system while the main peak value is smaller for the vlfs model with the simplified mooring system for the survival condition the 6 dof motion psds of the vlfs model with the original and simplified mooring systems coincide well in both low frequency and wave frequency while some discrepancy introduced by the fourier transform in main peak value can be observed in the roll motion although the measured results of the operational condition have some deviation the time series and psds of the vlfs model motions in survival condition are enough to validate that the original and simplified mooring systems have the equivalent performance under the irregular wave conditions further the equivalence of the vlfs model motion response is quantified by using correlation coefficients which are listed in table 15 the correlation coefficients in the two survival conditions are larger than 0 8 while the correlation coefficients are much lower in the operational condition as described before the experimental bias is the cause of the low correlation coefficients in operational condition and the correlation coefficients in the two survival conditions indicate a significant correlation of the vlfs model motion response and also confirms the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems the statistics of the vlfs model motion in the operational and survival conditions are compared in fig 20 where the height of the box represents the standard deviation the maximum and minimum value measured in the model test have some randomness and uncertainty thus instead of the maximum and minimum value the mean value and standard deviation are more effective in demonstrating the equivalence of the vlfs motion response the mean value and standard deviation of the motion response of the vlfs model with the simplified mooring system are close to that of the original mooring system in both operational and survival conditions which further proves that the motion responses of the vlfs model are equivalent in the irregular wave condition when it is moored by the original and simplified mooring systems it can be concluded that the simplified mooring system designed by the mooring system simplification methodology is equivalent with the original mooring system and can be utilized to replace the original mooring system in irregular wave tests the correlation coefficients obtained based on the model tests are lower than that obtained in the numerical simulation by comparing the tables 9 10 and 15 the discrepancy introduced by the model fabrication experimental setup and data measurement jointly reduce the equivalence of motion response of the vlfs coupled with the original and simplified mooring systems the small scale ratio which is 1 100 in this model test also enlarges the proportion of discrepancy and systematic noise in the measured result to some extent on the other aspect the linear theory used in the numerical simulation cannot accurately predict the damping and wave exciting force induced by nonlinear effects rudman and cleary 2016 in the scale model test meanwhile the nonlinear effects such as slamming and green water were frequently observed in the irregular wave tests in survival condition which also accounte for the discrepancies with the decreasing of the mooring line number the complexity of the experimental setup is reduced which also leads to the reduction of the experiment uncertainty moreover in our future work a model testing of a multi module vlfs with a mooring system consists 80 to 100 mooring chains is about to be conducted it can be expected that the validated mooring system simplification methodology can be a powerful tool for reducing mooring lines with retaining same dynamic response coupled with the vlfs in that case however reducing the number of fairleads might also be a valuable option to be further investigated 7 conclusion to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the mooring system simplification methodology proposed in our previous study liang et al 2020 a 10 chains simplified mooring system is designed to replace a 20 chains original mooring system in a scale model test and a series scale model test including decay test white noise test regular and irregular wave tests are presented in this paper to validate the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems the equivalence of the original and simplified mooring systems is calibrated by the model test results that the difference of the natural period and damping coefficient of the 6 dof motion response of the vlfs model with the original and simplified mooring system is less than 4 and 0 02 and the correlation coefficients of the vlfs motion response with the original and simplified mooring systems are larger than 0 9 in regular wave conditions and larger than 0 8 in survival conditions although the motion responses measured in the operational condition are affected by the system noise due to the selected too small scale ratio the statistical results agree well for the vlfs module with the original and simplified mooring systems the equivalence of the two mooring systems indicates that the mooring system simplification methodology is effective in designing the simplified mooring system to replace the original mooring system in a scale model test the model fabrication experimental setup data measurement can introduce the dependency to reduce the equivalence between the original and simplified mooring systems in the scale model experiment the nonlinear effects which cannot be accurately predicted when designing the simplified mooring system also accounte for the performance discrepancy between the original and simplified mooring systems if applicable the model scale ratio should be selected as large as possible to reduce the systematic noise effects in the measured experimental results with the validation of the mooring system simplification methodology this methodology can be used in the model test of a multi module vlfs with a mooring system consists 80 to 100 mooring chains in our future work with the help of mooring system simplification methodology an equivalent mooring system with less mooring chain can be designed and utilized in the model test to replace the original mooring system to reduce the difficulty of the model test and the uncertainty of the results credit authorship contribution statement mingxiao liang conceptualization methodology

21211,this paper investigates the trajectory tracking control problem of dynamic positioning ship subject to modeling uncertainties environment disturbances and unmeasurable velocity a novel adaptive fuzzy controller is designed to address this challenging problem by incorporating the prescribed performance control technique and adaptive fuzzy backstepping control method specifically a high gain observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasurable velocity vector then a special finite time performance function is introduced to impose performance specifications in advance on the output tracking errors according to the mission requirements in terms of mission completion time maximum permitted overshoot tracking accuracy subsequently through introducing error transformation functions the tracking control problem with guaranteed transient performance is transformed to the output constrained control problem in view of this an asymmetric barrier lyapunov function is designed to ensure that the transformed errors remain within specified ranges by virtue of lyapunov theory it is shown that all the closed loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking errors strictly comply with the prescribed performance envelops despite the presence of modeling uncertainties environmental disturbances and unmeasurable velocity finally numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method keywords finite time function prescribed tracking performance high gain observer fuzzy logic system dynamic positioning ship 1 introduction with the continuous development of economy the shortage of terrestrial energy has become an urgent problem thus the development of marine energy is necessary different from the traditional anchored auxiliary positioning system the dynamic positioning dp ship can operate independently in the deep sea so it can easily obtain the energy such as deep sea oil and gas dynamic positioning system has been extensively studied in the past decade including model predictive control abdelaal et al 2018 sliding mode control li et al 2018 backstepping control zhang et al 2019 output feedback control xia et al 2019 neural network control pan et al 2013 etc despite the recent advances nearly every one of the above references only considers the partially practical aspects including modeling uncertainties environmental interferences and unmeasurable velocity etc to overcome these problems many related studies have been proposed in order to deal with unmeasurable velocity a high gain observer was designed to estimate the unmeasurable velocity of the surface ship and the output feedback controller was designed in he et al 2017 a finite time velocity observer based visual servo error dynamics was formulated in wang and he 2019 it can exactly identify scaled velocities and regulate the unmanned surface vessel with completely unmeasurable velocities a fixed time extended state observer was introduced into zhang et al 2020 it achieved to velocity free sliding mode tracking control for surface vessels an adaptive observer was designed for the dynamic positioning ship to estimate the velocity of the ship in do 2011 and it can guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the closed loop system of the dynamic positioning ship in addition many research results assumed that the parameters of model were usually known however due to the parameter measurement error and the variability of the marine environment the parameters of the system model of marine surface vessels will inevitably change so corresponding methods need to be adopted to solve this problem adaptive neural integral sliding mode control method was designed in van 2019 which can guarantee the higher tracking performance in presence of unknown dynamics by combining adaptive neural network approach a high accuracy tracking control in limited working space for surface vessels was achieved under the unknown nonlinear dynamics in li et al 2016 and the path following control of underactuated ship by using the multilayer perception neural networks was proposed in shen and guo 2016 most of them focus on the steady state performance of the control system the dp ship s tracking error was converted into term in the closed loop design but the transient performance of the system cannot be guaranteed which leads to the excessive tracking error and more energy consumption considering the actual size of the dp ship it is required to strictly follow the planned path during the execution of task so as to avoid collisions due to excessive position error when passing through the specific area and the unknown area therefore the error constraints in tracking performance are very important prescribed performance control ppc technology was creatively proposed by bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 and it was successfully applied to nonlinear systems this method can effectively enable the tracking error to converge to a preset arbitrarily small residual set at a specified convergence rate whilst rendering the maximum overshoot smaller than a preset constant value or even no overshoot the attitude controller of the spacecraft which combines the prescribed performance method was introduced in order to ensure the stability of the transient performance of the spacecraft in hu et al 2018 an adaptive neural network controller combined with error transform function for a surface ship which cannot obtain accurate dynamic model guarantees the ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed loop system and ensures the preset tracking performance in dai et al 2016 in recent years researchers have tried their best to improve the ppc design to obtain faster convergence rate the ppc technique has been used in conjunction with the finite time control which can make the control system reach a stable state faster and then get a better control performance the finite time control theory was put forward in kushner 1966 which was aimed at the stability and analysis of stochastic system later the finite time theory has been widely used in various fields including attitude control of spacecraft hu et al 2018 trajectory tracking control of vessel wang et al 2017 autopilot control of unmanned vehicle huang et al 2019 and so on an adaptive robust trajectory tracking controller with a finite time disturbance observer was employed to improve the convergence speed of the error and the robustness of the control system in wang et al 2016 a finite time trajectory tracking controller based on barrier lyapunov function and radial basis function neural network for an underactuated marine surface vessel with position error constraint and system uncertainties has been proposed in fu et al 2019 to guarantee that the tracking error converges to zero in finite time and all closed loop signals were bounded a robust finite time h infinity controller was designed by lin et al 2018a to solve the problem of input delay and ensure the finite time convergence of all states under the condition of input delay a finite time observer was designed to estimate and compensate the time varying sideslip angle caused by the environment disturbances so as to ensure the finite time stability of the closed loop system in wang et al 2018a b it is noted that in these works the convergence time and steady state accuracy hinge directly on the selection of the design parameters while cannot be specified by the designer in advance according to the mission requirements motivated by the above discussion an adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller based on finite time control and prescribed performance control is proposed to achieve the trajectory tracking mission for dp ship while ensuring the prescribed transient and steady state performance metrics on tracking errors the main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows i the proposed control algorithm can accommodate modeling uncertainties environment disturbances and unmeasurable velocity moreover it can guarantee the prescribed transient and steady state tracking performance ii compared with the current research on full actuated marine surface ship the proposed control scheme which combines the prescribed performance control with a novel finite time performance function not only makes the settling time independent on initial conditions and parameters of system but also ensures the tracking errors less than preset values without resorting to judicious parameters selection thus the proposed method is designer friendly and easy to be implemented in practice the rest of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the problem formulation and preliminaries are provided while section 3 is dedicated to the design and analysis of finite time performance functions the proposed control algorithm and stability analysis are presented in section 4 and then the simulation results are given in section 5 to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme finally the conclusions are stated in section 6 2 problem formulation and preliminaries 2 1 modeling of dynamic positioning ship this paper addresses the trajectory tracking problem of dynamic positioning ship without velocity measurements the nonlinear motion model of kinematics and dynamics are described by fossen and strand 1999 1 η r ψ υ 2 m υ d υ τ d t where η x y ψ t is the vector describing the position of dynamic positioning ship in the earth fixed frame with x is the surge position y is the sway position ψ is the heading of the ship υ u ν r t is the vector describing the velocity of dynamic positioning ship in the body fixed frame with u is the surge velocity ν is the sway velocity r is the yaw rate of the ship r ψ is the rotation matrix obtained from rotation of z axis and its given by 3 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 with the property r t ψ r 1 ψ in addition m represents the system inertia matrix d represents the damping coefficient matrix d t ℜ 3 represents the force vector of the marine environment including wind wave flow etc while τ ℜ 3 represents the force and torque vector of the propulsion system of the dynamic positioning ship considering the actual thruster situation the control forces and moment are described as 4 τ τ max i f τ τ max τ i f τ min τ τ max τ min i f τ τ min where τ max and τ min are the physical limitations in the actual control process respectively represent the maximum and minimum control forces or moments to accomplish the trajectory tracking mission accurate position tracking control is required to align the desired position vector η d then the position error and its derivative can be defined as 5 η e η η d 6 η e η η d lemma 1 tee and ge 2006 for the continuous function d i η υ t ℜ 3 ℜ 3 ℜ ℜ i 1 2 3 there exist positive smooth and nondecreasing functions p i η υ ℜ 3 ℜ 3 ℜ and w i t ℜ ℜ such that 7 d i p i η υ w i t i 1 2 3 assumption 1 m and d are unknown d t is unknown time varying but bounded while w i t is the time dependent function and satisfies w i t ω m where ω m is an unknown positive constant remark 1 lemma 1 allows the multivariate perturbation term d i i 1 2 3 to be divided into a boundary function according to η and υ and a boundary function in terms of t the purpose of the conversion of time varying unknown disturbances is to approximate by the fuzzy estimation method in the design of the following controller therefore we only need to make assumptions about general time dependent effects remark 2 during the trajectory tracking the mass of the dynamic positioning ship is constantly changing due to fuel consumption indicating that the mass is time varying while the parameters of the damping coefficient and the disturbance function are also time varying under different operating conditions and marine environments so that assumption 1 is reasonable in practice remark 3 for a dynamic positioning ship the roll angle ϕ and the pitch angle θ are usually small so they can be ignored at the same time coriolis centripetal force can also be ignored when the vessel is moving at low speeds therefore the six degree of freedom kinematics and dynamics is converted into a three degree of freedom kinematics and dynamics as the system described in 1 and 2 which is reasonable 2 2 fuzzy logic system according to assumption 1 m d are consisted of unknown model uncertainties and d t is time varying so a fuzzy logic system fls is introduced in this paper the fls includes the fuzzy rule base the singleton function fuzzy inference engine and the center average defuzzifier the fls can estimate the nonlinear uncertainties in the system and make the system closer to the actual situation tong et al 2016 8 the fuzzy rule i if χ 1 i s a 1 q 1 χ 2 i s a 2 q 2 χ m i s a m q m then ϑ χ i s b q 1 q m where χ χ 1 χ 2 χ m t ℜ m and ϑ χ are the input and output vector respectively for the fuzzy system while a i q i i 1 2 m q i 1 2 l i t and b q 1 q m q 1 q m 1 2 l l i 1 m l i t represent a fuzzy set of χ i and ϑ χ respectively l i t denotes the number of a i q i and l is the number of fuzzy rules to be considered furthermore the fuzzy logic system is described by 9 ϑ χ q 1 1 l 1 t q m 1 l m t ϑ q 1 q m i 1 m ε a i q i χ i q 1 1 l 1 t q m 1 l m t i 1 m ε a i q i χ i where ϑ q 1 q m arg max ϑ ℜ ε b q 1 q m ϑ and ε b q 1 q m ϑ denotes the membership function of b q 1 q m ε a i q i χ i is the membership function of a i q i therefore we notate 10 θ ϑ 1 ϑ 2 ϑ l t ℜ l as the fuzzy parameter vector while the fuzzy basis function vector is defined as 11 ξ χ ξ 1 χ ξ 2 χ ξ l χ ℜ l where the fuzzy basis function is described as 12 ξ q 1 q m χ i 1 m ε a i q i χ i q 1 1 l 1 t q m 1 l m t i 1 m ε a i q i χ i based on 10 12 the fuzzy logic system 9 can be written as follow 13 ϑ χ θ t ξ χ lemma 2 universal approximation theorem tuo et al 2018 for any continuous function f χ u on a compact set ℜ m and for σ 0 there exists a fuzzy system g χ as the form of 13 such that 14 sup χ u f χ g χ σ according to lemma 2 for any given real continuous function f χ u the fuzzy logic system can realize the approximation according to the following formula 15 f χ θ t ξ χ α χ where θ ℜ l is the optimal parameter as following 16 θ arg min θ ℜ l s u p χ u f χ θ t ξ χ while α χ ℜ is the minimum approximation error assumption 2 θ and α χ satisfy the inequality θ θ m and α χ α m respectively where θ m and α m are positive bounds 2 3 control objective the trajectory tracking mission of dynamic positioning ship imposes some requirements on the closed loop design in terms of maneuver completion time permitted overshoot and accuracy tolerance in view of this these requirements are explicitly taken into account in the control design and the control objective is to design a control input τ such that the motion is achieved with guaranteed tracking performance which is necessary to meet the following goals despite the presence of time varying disturbances system parameter uncertainty and unmeasurable velocity r1 all signals in the closed loop system are bounded r2 the position error η e converges within the specified tolerances in a fixed time t f while exhibiting their maximum overshoots less than the corresponding constants prescribed in advance 3 the special finite time performance function finite time stability means that the state of the system can converge to the equilibrium point in finite time however the convergence time of existing finite time control approach is dependent of the initial value of the state jiang et al 2016 therefore a special finite time performance function which makes the convergence time independent of the initial state is described as follows definition 1 liu et al 2019 a c n n 1 continuous function ρ u t ℜ 0 ℜ is called a finite time performance function if there exists a preset time t 0 such that 1 ρ u t is positive and strictly decreasing over time for t 0 t 2 ρ u t ρ u s 0 for all t t to meet the mission requirements stated above we impose appropriate behavioral bounds on the translational position error η e i t i 1 2 3 expressed as 17 δ i ρ u i t η e i t δ i ρ u i t where δ i and δ i are design constants chosen as δ i 1 0 δ i 1 if η e i 0 0 and δ i 1 0 δ i 1 if η e i 0 0 and both cases can be used in case of zero initial condition and ρ u i t is the performance function defined by shao et al 2020a b 18 ρ u i t a i 0 a i 1 t a i 2 t 2 a i 3 t 3 a i 4 t 4 if t t f ρ u i s if t t f where t f and ρ u i s represent the desired fixed time and steady value of ρ u i t respectively and the parameters a i j j 0 1 2 3 4 are determined by a group of condition equations given below 19 ρ u i 0 a i 0 ρ u i 0 a i 1 0 ρ u i t f a i 0 a i 1 t f a i 2 t f 2 a i 3 t f 3 a i 4 t f 4 ρ u i s ρ u i t f a i 1 2 a i 2 t f 3 a i 3 t f 2 4 a i 4 t f 3 0 ρ u i t f 2 a i 2 6 a i 3 t f 12 a i 4 t f 2 0 it is notable that the positive constant a i 0 needs to be chosen such that 17 is fulfilled at t 0 in what follows we establish a central lemma for ρ u i t lemma 3 if the parameters a i 0 ρ u i s ρ u i s a i 0 and t f are given in advance then the following properties hold liu et al 2019 p1 ρ u i t exists and is unique p2 ρ u i t is c 2 continuous for all t 0 p3 ρ u i t is strictly decreasing over time for t 0 t f it is clear from lemma 3 and definition 1 that ρ u i t can be used as a special finite time performance function note that apart from the properties as stated in lemma 3 the finite time performance function ρ u i t also has a significant flexibility in drafting its convergence characteristics in terms of settling time and steady value to shed light upon this point the following two examples are considered case a take a i 0 10 ρ u i s 1 and choose different values of t f case b take a i 0 20 t f 80 s and choose different values of ρ u i s the theoretical responses of ρ u i t under various scenarios are shown in fig 1 as can be seen tuning the design parameters t f and ρ u i s can explicitly render ρ u i t exhibiting different behavioral metrics and moreover ρ u i t is continuous everywhere for all t 0 and strictly decreasing over time for t 0 t f according to lemma 3 it follows from 17 19 that δ i a i 0 if η e i 0 0 or δ i a i 0 if η e i 0 0 and t f denote the upper bounds on the overshoot and settling time of η e i t respectively whereas ρ u i s introduces the maximum allowable size of η e i t at the steady state and can be set as a sufficiently small value satisfying the required accuracy tolerance so we can impose a priori performance attributes necessary to meet the mission demands on the position error η e i t by properly selecting the finite time performance function ρ u i t as well as the design parameters δ i and δ i remark 4 as dictated by p2 in lemma 3 the finite time performance function defined in the polynomial form of 18 is c 2 continuous for all time which is sufficient for the subsequent controller design 4 control design and stability analysis in this section a novel fuzzy adaptive controller based on finite time performance function will be derived by using error transformation and fuzzy logic system combining with symmetric barrier lyapunov function the architecture of the resulted closed loop system is sketched in fig 2 4 1 error transformation from a theoretical viewpoint it is very difficult to directly incorporate the prescribed performance bounds defined by 17 into the closed loop design so the error transformation is defined by 20 ϒ η i t η e i t ρ u i t remark 5 if the transformed error ϒ η i t satisfies the inequality δ i ϒ η i t δ i i 1 2 3 for all time the positing error η e i t will evolve along its preset performance envelop then we take the derivative of ϒ η i t we have 21 ϒ η i 1 ρ u i η e i ρ u i ϒ η i in order to simplify the expression of formula we define ϒ η ϒ η 1 ϒ η 2 ϒ η 3 t γ u diag i 1 2 3 1 ρ u i and ρ u diag i 1 2 3 ρ u i so we can rewrite 21 as follows 22 ϒ η γ u η e ρ u ϒ η here we further define the new state vector z 1 ϒ η and z 2 υ i c with i c denotes the virtual control law and it is designed at latter discussion then the dynamics 2 is transformed into 23 m z 2 τ d m i c d z 2 d i c where d p η υ ω t p η υ p 1 η υ p 2 η υ p 3 η υ t and ω t w 1 t w 2 t w 3 t t is the unknown disturbance vector which is bounded due to assumption 1 and the formula 7 4 2 high gain observer for low speed ships such as dynamic positioning ships the error of velocity is large when it is in low speed motion which leads to the situation that the velocity is not measurable therefore we use a high gain observer to estimate the unmeasurable velocity the considered high gain observer can be represented by the following lin et al 2018a 24 ϕ ħ i ħ i 1 i 1 2 n ϕ ħ n ƛ 1 ħ n ƛ 2 ħ n 1 ƛ n 1 ħ 2 ħ 1 y t where ħ i is the state variables of high gain observer ϕ is an arbitrarily small positive constant ƛ 1 ƛ n 1 are parameters which ensure that the polynomial s n ƛ 1 s n 1 ƛ n 1 s 1 1 can be hurwitz and y t is the output variable of system remark 6 if y t and its first n 1 derivative are bounded namely y k q k k 0 1 n 1 with q k is a positive constant then it can ensure the following equation 25 ħ k 1 ϕ k y k ϕ ζ k 1 k 0 1 n 1 where ζ ħ n ƛ 1 ħ n 1 ƛ n 1 ħ 1 and its k 1 derivative is ζ k 1 while there are positive constants t and ζ m such that ζ k 1 ζ m for t t when the output y and its derivative y k are bounded ħ k 1 ϕ k can converge to y k and the error is also bounded therefore ħ k 1 ϕ k can provide an estimation of the unmeasured derivative of the system output until the n 1 order for the trajectory tracking of the dynamic positioning ship the position η is the output of the system according to 24 the high gain observer of dynamic positioning ship is presented as follows 26 ϕ ħ 1 ħ 2 ϕ ħ 2 ƛ 1 ħ 2 ħ 1 η then according to 26 we can obtain η ˆ which denotes the estimation of η and its derivative η ˆ as 27 η ˆ ħ 1 η ˆ 1 ϕ ħ 2 considering the expression of 25 with k 0 we have 28 η ˆ η ħ 1 η ϕ ζ where ζ ħ 2 ƛ 1 ħ 1 substituting the second equation of 27 into 1 the υ ˆ which denotes the estimation of υ can be expressed as 29 υ ˆ r t ψ 1 ϕ ħ 2 base on 1 25 and 29 we then obtain 30 υ ˆ υ r t ψ 1 ϕ ħ 2 η r t ψ ϕ ζ apparently according to 30 and remark 6 we get 31 υ ˆ υ ϕ ζ ϕ ζ m where ζ m is a positive constant 4 3 adaptive fuzzy controller design in this subsection we concentrate on the design of an adaptive fuzzy controller with the aim of guaranteeing the boundedness of all closed loop signals in order to ensure the position error performance bounds inspired by shao et al 2020a b we choose the symmetric barrier lyapunov function as follows tee et al 2009 32 v 1 v 11 v 12 v 13 where 33 v 1 i k 1 2 log δ i 2 δ i 2 ϒ η i 2 with i 1 2 3 k 1 is a positive constant and k 1 0 1 taking the derivatives of v 1 with respect to time t and substituting 22 into it leads to 34 v 1 k 1 ϒ η t n η γ u η e ρ u ϒ η where n η diag i 1 2 3 1 δ i 2 ϒ η i 2 the virtual control law is designed as follows 35 i c r t ρ u ϒ η k 3 γ u 1 ϒ η η d where k 3 is a designed positive constant now we take the υ ˆ which is the estimation of the high gain observer instead of υ so the new state vector z ˆ 2 can be written as 36 z ˆ 2 υ ˆ i c based on 1 34 35 and 36 we have 37 v 1 k 1 k 3 ϒ η t n η ϒ η k 1 ϒ η t n η γ u r z ˆ 2 to rewrite 23 with the new state vector z ˆ 2 we notate 38 m z 2 τ d m i c d υ ˆ then consider the following lyapunov function 39 v 2 v 1 1 2 z ˆ 2 t m z ˆ 2 evaluating the time derivative of v 2 we have 40 v 2 v 1 z ˆ 2 t m i c d υ ˆ τ z ˆ 2 t d substituting 7 and 37 into 40 and the following inequalities can be obtained 41 v 2 k 1 k 3 ϒ η t n η ϒ η k 1 ϒ η t n η γ u r z ˆ 2 z ˆ 2 t m i c d υ ˆ τ z ˆ 2 t p ω the desired robust controller is designed as 42 τ c k 1 r t n η γ u ϒ η m i c d υ ˆ k 2 z ˆ 2 p ω k 1 r t n η γ u ϒ η k 2 z ˆ 2 f ˆ where k 1 ℜ is a design constant k 2 ℜ 3 3 is the positive constant matrix and f ˆ m i c d υ ˆ p ω for the dynamic positioning ship control system m d are unknown and d is time varying therefore the expected control law 42 is difficult to achieve based on the fuzzy logic system in section 2 2 we take the fuzzy logic system 13 instead of the unknown term containing m d p and ω to apply for the model of dynamic positioning ship we define x ˆ x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ 3 x ˆ 4 x ˆ 5 x ˆ 6 t x y ψ u v r t ℜ 6 as the input vector of the fuzzy logic system and f ˆ x ˆ f ˆ 1 x ˆ f ˆ 2 x ˆ f ˆ 3 x ˆ t ℜ 3 as the output vector of the fuzzy logic system meanwhile we design the fuzzy rules as following 43 if x i s a 1 q 1 y i s a 2 q 2 ψ i s a 3 q 3 u i s a 4 q 4 v i s a 5 q 5 r i s a 6 q 6 then f ˆ 1 x ˆ i s b 1 q 1 q 6 f ˆ 2 x ˆ i s b 2 q 1 q 6 f ˆ 3 x ˆ i s b 3 q 1 q 6 where a i q i i 1 2 m q i 1 2 l i denote the fuzzy set of the i th input variable b j q 1 q 6 j 1 2 3 q 1 q 6 1 2 l l i 1 6 l i denote the fuzzy set of the output variable while l i i 1 6 is the number of a i q i and l is the total number of the fuzzy logic rules furthermore by means of center average defuzzifier product inference and singleton fuzzifier the fuzzy logic system of dynamic positioning ship is described by 44 f ˆ x ˆ θ t ξ x ˆ where θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 with θ j θ j 1 θ j 2 θ j l t ℜ l is the fuzzy parameter vectors θ j q 1

of a i q i taking the fuzzy logic system to estimate the unknown term in 42 yield 46 m i c d υ ˆ p ω θ t ξ x ˆ α x ˆ where α x ˆ ℜ 3 is the minimum estimation error and θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 ℜ l 3 is the

j 2 θ j m 2 is a positive constant 1 as shown in 58 it is concluded that v 0 as long as v β κ which indicates that the set ω ϒ η z ˆ 2 υ η θ ˆ j θ j v β κ is positively invariant therefore we can conclude the boundedness of v and hence v 1 and v 2 for all time with v bounded and according to 50 ϒ η z ˆ 2 θ j are bounded for all time since ϒ η is bounded which implies that η e i t i 1 2 3 are strictly confined within the corresponding performance envelops defined by 17 and n η γ u are bounded in the view of 6 η is bounded from the boundedness of η e and η d from 35 and 36 i c and υ ˆ are bounded thus with the boundedness of υ ˆ it is further concluded that υ is bounded due to 47 θ j is bounded then θ ˆ j θ j θ j is also bounded apart from the above it can also be referred from 48 and 49 that τ is bounded therefore we claim that all closed loop signals are bounded 2 as dictated by 1 ϒ η is bounded and thus η e i t i 1 2 3 evolve strictly along the corresponding performance envelopes defined by 17 then with the selection of ρ u i t i 1 2 3 defined by 18 as well as the design constants δ i and δ i we readily conclude that η e i t will converge to the set ω η e η e i ρ u i s i 1 2 3 within the preset terminal time t f whilst exhibiting a maximum overshoot no more than δ i a i 0 if η e i 0 0 or δ i a i 0 if η e i 0 0 this completes the proof remark 7 from a theoretical viewpoint the proposed control scheme can achieve trajectory tracking with prescribed performance metrics necessary to meet the mission demands in the presence of unknown system parameters the unmeasurable velocity and time varying disturbances unlike the common practice in the relevant literature the responses of the trajectory tracking errors under the proposed control framework can be solely determined by suitable selection of the finite time performance function ρ i t i 1 2 3 as well as the design parameters δ i and δ i i 1 2 3 this is a prominent advantage that allows the control system designers to flexibly draft the achievable performance metrics in advance according to the specific mission demands furthermore the disassociation of the control parameters from the closed loop responses makes the control parameters selection an easy task remark 8 as opposed to most existing works on prescribed performance control in which exponential decaying performance functions are commonly used the proposed control method enables the position error η e i t i 1 2 3 to converge to a prescribed residual set within a preset terminal time this is attributed to the utilization of the special finite time performance function as defined by 18 furthermore compared to the existing finite time control approaches the designed controller not only renders the terminal time and residual sets of the translational position errors independent on system initial conditions as well as design parameters but also prescribes the maximum overshoots less than given constants remark 9 the proposed method can be easily extended to address the trajectory tracking control problem of the dynamic positioning ship and the full actuated surface ship with slight modifications in addition it is notable that this model with the typical form of the euler lagrange equation has two main advantages first it shares some well known properties of the euler lagrange systems which will be employed in control synthesis and stability analysis see section 4 for the details second it can be utilized to describe a wide range of dynamic systems such as spacecraft system robotic system etc seen in this light the theoretical results of this work can be readily extended to more general systems whose dynamics are expressed as euler lagrange equations remark 10 to assist the engineers in practically implementing the proposed control scheme we describe the algorithm in a pseudocode form as given in table 1 5 numerical simulations 5 1 performance of the proposed control law and the contrast control law in this subsection numerical simulations are carried out to testify the effectiveness of the proposed control method in close to realistic environment the model data comes from the dynamic

to meet the needs of special tasks and ensure the tracking effect the desired trajectory η d is composed of two parts one is a straight line trajectory the other is a curve trajectory η d 3 t 0 0 t i

and τ min 4 06 1 0 3 kn 4 06 1 0 4 kn 5 8 1 0 4 kn m t to satisfy trajectory tracking requirements the performance bounds described by 18 on the position error is designed by choosing the parameters listed in table 2 the total number of fuzzy rules l is l 729 and the parameters of fuzzy logic system is designed as θ 1 1 1 0 4 i 729 729 θ 2 1 1 0 4 i 729 729 θ 3 1 1 0 4 i 729 729 λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 1 1 0

chosen by trial k 1 0 4 k 2 d i a g 1 8 1 8 0 6 k 3 0 3 the simulation step is uniformly set to 0 2 then the time varying disturbances d t are designed as d t r t η f d t with f d t 0 2 1 0 6 1 0 7 sin 0 6 t 0 3 sin 0 4 t 0 3 sin 0 8 t 0 2 1 0 6 sin 0 6 t 0 2 1 0 6 cos 0 8 t t the simulation results of proposed controller are provided infigs 3 8 to illustrate the controller meet the requirements of preset performance the transformed errors are shown in fig 3 from which it can be seen that ϒ η i t i 1 2 3 is bounded for comparison the adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller proposed in lin et al 2018b is also simulated and then the simulation results are sketched in figs 4 6 it is noted that the performance of trajectory which is expressed by the proposed method in fig 4 is better than the contrast method further the position errors are plotted in fig 5 it is apparent that the position error of proposed method satisfied the desired performance metric ρ u i s in a contrary the contrast method in lin et al 2018b fails to guarantee the transient error and leads to exceed steady value ρ u i s from fig 6 it gives the response of the control input with proposed method and contrast method it can be observed that the contrast method is good at the thrust controlling so the proposed method should be improved for input control fig 7 shows the boundedness of the norms of adaptive update law in order to verify the effect of the high gain observer the responses which display the estimated value of velocity and the actual value of velocity are shown in fig 8 which reveals that the estimated value tracks the actual value very well overall the proposed control method can guarantee the trajectory tracking with prescribed transient and steady state error bounds the high gain observer can estimate the unmeasurable velocity and fuzzy logic system can also well estimate the unknown system parameters meanwhile it can achieve the finite time control in the actual task of dp ship with time varying disturbances as a result the effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been illustrated in addition the difference between proposed control approach and contrast approach is highlighted and summarized in table 3 5 2 performance of changing the parameter of criteria on the proposed control law in this subsection to verify the sensitivity of the proposed method s performance to parameter selection the experiments were carried out based on different k 1 k 2 and k 3 values the simulation results of parameters adjustment are represented in figs 9 12 in order to explain the influence of the adjustment of parameters k 1 k 2 and k 3 on the controller better we divide into 4 cases to discuss 1 the time response of the trajectory tracking and the position error

tracking and the position error when k 1 0 4 k 2 diag 2 3 2 3 2 3 and k 3 0 3 4 the time response of the trajectory tracking and the position error when k 1 0 4 k 2 diag 1 8 1 8 0 6 and k 3 3 the parameters described in case 1 are designed in the proposed control scheme in the manuscript and it is obtained through continuous debugging to ensure the requirements of task case 2 represents the impact of k 1 changing on the controller performance case 3 is the impact of k 2 changing on the controller performance case 4 shows the effect of k 3 changing on the controller performance it is apparently the performance of controller is not sensitive to the varying of k 1 but it is more sensitive to the changing of k 2 and k 3 the varying may even cause system instability 6 conclusions in this paper a promising solution to the problem of trajectory tracking control of dp ship with guaranteed transient and steady state performance has been provided the special finite time performance function is developed to impose the desired behavioral metrics on the position errors according to the mission requirements about maneuver completion time and permitted overshoot by using the adaptive fuzzy estimation technique in conjunction with the symmetric barrier lyapunov function based on the finite time performance function and the high gain observer a novel adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme is derived which guarantees the boundedness of all closed loop signals and the satisfaction of the prescribed performance metrics in the presence of uncertain model time varying environment disturbance and unmeasurable velocity finally numerical simulations are carried out to testify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach in future works we will concentrate on building a semi physical simulation platform connect the simulation program to the hardware in the loop test system through the serial port and verify the practical applicability of the proposed

21211,this paper investigates the trajectory tracking control problem of dynamic positioning ship subject to modeling uncertainties environment disturbances and unmeasurable velocity a novel adaptive fuzzy controller is designed to address this challenging problem by incorporating the prescribed performance control technique and adaptive fuzzy backstepping control method specifically a high gain observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasurable velocity vector then a special finite time performance function is introduced to impose performance specifications in advance on the output tracking errors according to the mission requirements in terms of mission completion time maximum permitted overshoot tracking accuracy subsequently through introducing error transformation functions the tracking control problem with guaranteed transient performance is transformed to the output constrained control problem in view of this an asymmetric barrier lyapunov function is designed to ensure that the transformed errors remain within specified ranges by virtue of lyapunov theory it is shown that all the closed loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and the tracking errors strictly comply with the prescribed performance envelops despite the presence of modeling uncertainties environmental disturbances and unmeasurable velocity finally numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method keywords finite time function prescribed tracking performance high gain observer fuzzy logic system dynamic positioning ship 1 introduction with the continuous development of economy the shortage of terrestrial energy has become an urgent problem thus the development of marine energy is necessary different from the traditional anchored auxiliary positioning system the dynamic positioning dp ship can operate independently in the deep sea so it can easily obtain the energy such as deep sea oil and gas dynamic positioning system has been extensively studied in the past decade including model predictive control abdelaal et al 2018 sliding mode control li et al 2018 backstepping control zhang et al 2019 output feedback control xia et al 2019 neural network control pan et al 2013 etc despite the recent advances nearly every one of the above references only considers the partially practical aspects including modeling uncertainties environmental interferences and unmeasurable velocity etc to overcome these problems many related studies have been proposed in order to deal with unmeasurable velocity a high gain observer was designed to estimate the unmeasurable velocity of the surface ship and the output feedback controller was designed in he et al 2017 a finite time velocity observer based visual servo error dynamics was formulated in wang and he 2019 it can exactly identify scaled velocities and regulate the unmanned surface vessel with completely unmeasurable velocities a fixed time extended state observer was introduced into zhang et al 2020 it achieved to velocity free sliding mode tracking control for surface vessels an adaptive observer was designed for the dynamic positioning ship to estimate the velocity of the ship in do 2011 and it can guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the closed loop system of the dynamic positioning ship in addition many research results assumed that the parameters of model were usually known however due to the parameter measurement error and the variability of the marine environment the parameters of the system model of marine surface vessels will inevitably change so corresponding methods need to be adopted to solve this problem adaptive neural integral sliding mode control method was designed in van 2019 which can guarantee the higher tracking performance in presence of unknown dynamics by combining adaptive neural network approach a high accuracy tracking control in limited working space for surface vessels was achieved under the unknown nonlinear dynamics in li et al 2016 and the path following control of underactuated ship by using the multilayer perception neural networks was proposed in shen and guo 2016 most of them focus on the steady state performance of the control system the dp ship s tracking error was converted into term in the closed loop design but the transient performance of the system cannot be guaranteed which leads to the excessive tracking error and more energy consumption considering the actual size of the dp ship it is required to strictly follow the planned path during the execution of task so as to avoid collisions due to excessive position error when passing through the specific area and the unknown area therefore the error constraints in tracking performance are very important prescribed performance control ppc technology was creatively proposed by bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 and it was successfully applied to nonlinear systems this method can effectively enable the tracking error to converge to a preset arbitrarily small residual set at a specified convergence rate whilst rendering the maximum overshoot smaller than a preset constant value or even no overshoot the attitude controller of the spacecraft which combines the prescribed performance method was introduced in order to ensure the stability of the transient performance of the spacecraft in hu et al 2018 an adaptive neural network controller combined with error transform function for a surface ship which cannot obtain accurate dynamic model guarantees the ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed loop system and ensures the preset tracking performance in dai et al 2016 in recent years researchers have tried their best to improve the ppc design to obtain faster convergence rate the ppc technique has been used in conjunction with the finite time control which can make the control system reach a stable state faster and then get a better control performance the finite time control theory was put forward in kushner 1966 which was aimed at the stability and analysis of stochastic system later the finite time theory has been widely used in various fields including attitude control of spacecraft hu et al 2018 trajectory tracking control of vessel wang et al 2017 autopilot control of unmanned vehicle huang et al 2019 and so on an adaptive robust trajectory tracking controller with a finite time disturbance observer was employed to improve the convergence speed of the error and the robustness of the control system in wang et al 2016 a finite time trajectory tracking controller based on barrier lyapunov function and radial basis function neural network for an underactuated marine surface vessel with position error constraint and system uncertainties has been proposed in fu et al 2019 to guarantee that the tracking error converges to zero in finite time and all closed loop signals were bounded a robust finite time h infinity controller was designed by lin et al 2018a to solve the problem of input delay and ensure the finite time convergence of all states under the condition of input delay a finite time observer was designed to estimate and compensate the time varying sideslip angle caused by the environment disturbances so as to ensure the finite time stability of the closed loop system in wang et al 2018a b it is noted that in these works the convergence time and steady state accuracy hinge directly on the selection of the design parameters while cannot be specified by the designer in advance according to the mission requirements motivated by the above discussion an adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller based on finite time control and prescribed performance control is proposed to achieve the trajectory tracking mission for dp ship while ensuring the prescribed transient and steady state performance metrics on tracking errors the main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows i the proposed control algorithm can accommodate modeling uncertainties environment disturbances and unmeasurable velocity moreover it can guarantee the prescribed transient and steady state tracking performance ii compared with the current research on full actuated marine surface ship the proposed control scheme which combines the prescribed performance control with a novel finite time performance function not only makes the settling time independent on initial conditions and parameters of system but also ensures the tracking errors less than preset values without resorting to judicious parameters selection thus the proposed method is designer friendly and easy to be implemented in practice the rest of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the problem formulation and preliminaries are provided while section 3 is dedicated to the design and analysis of finite time performance functions the proposed control algorithm and stability analysis are presented in section 4 and then the simulation results are given in section 5 to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme finally the conclusions are stated in section 6 2 problem formulation and preliminaries 2 1 modeling of dynamic positioning ship this paper addresses the trajectory tracking problem of dynamic positioning ship without velocity measurements the nonlinear motion model of kinematics and dynamics are described by fossen and strand 1999 1 η r ψ υ 2 m υ d υ τ d t where η x y ψ t is the vector describing the position of dynamic positioning ship in the earth fixed frame with x is the surge position y is the sway position ψ is the heading of the ship υ u ν r t is the vector describing the velocity of dynamic positioning ship in the body fixed frame with u is the surge velocity ν is the sway velocity r is the yaw rate of the ship r ψ is the rotation matrix obtained from rotation of z axis and its given by 3 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 with the property r t ψ r 1 ψ in addition m represents the system inertia matrix d represents the damping coefficient matrix d t ℜ 3 represents the force vector of the marine environment including wind wave flow etc while τ ℜ 3 represents the force and torque vector of the propulsion system of the dynamic positioning ship considering the actual thruster situation the control forces and moment are described as 4 τ τ max i f τ τ max τ i f τ min τ τ max τ min i f τ τ min where τ max and τ min are the physical limitations in the actual control process respectively represent the maximum and minimum control forces or moments to accomplish the trajectory tracking mission accurate position tracking control is required to align the desired position vector η d then the position error and its derivative can be defined as 5 η e η η d 6 η e η η d lemma 1 tee and ge 2006 for the continuous function d i η υ t ℜ 3 ℜ 3 ℜ ℜ i 1 2 3 there exist positive smooth and nondecreasing functions p i η υ ℜ 3 ℜ 3 ℜ and w i t ℜ ℜ such that 7 d i p i η υ w i t i 1 2 3 assumption 1 m and d are unknown d t is unknown time varying but bounded while w i t is the time dependent function and satisfies w i t ω m where ω m is an unknown positive constant remark 1 lemma 1 allows the multivariate perturbation term d i i 1 2 3 to be divided into a boundary function according to η and υ and a boundary function in terms of t the purpose of the conversion of time varying unknown disturbances is to approximate by the fuzzy estimation method in the design of the following controller therefore we only need to make assumptions about general time dependent effects remark 2 during the trajectory tracking the mass of the dynamic positioning ship is constantly changing due to fuel consumption indicating that the mass is time varying while the parameters of the damping coefficient and the disturbance function are also time varying under different operating conditions and marine environments so that assumption 1 is reasonable in practice remark 3 for a dynamic positioning ship the roll angle ϕ and the pitch angle θ are usually small so they can be ignored at the same time coriolis centripetal force can also be ignored when the vessel is moving at low speeds therefore the six degree of freedom kinematics and dynamics is converted into a three degree of freedom kinematics and dynamics as the system described in 1 and 2 which is reasonable 2 2 fuzzy logic system according to assumption 1 m d are consisted of unknown model uncertainties and d t is time varying so a fuzzy logic system fls is introduced in this paper the fls includes the fuzzy rule base the singleton function fuzzy inference engine and the center average defuzzifier the fls can estimate the nonlinear uncertainties in the system and make the system closer to the actual situation tong et al 2016 8 the fuzzy rule i if χ 1 i s a 1 q 1 χ 2 i s a 2 q 2 χ m i s a m q m then ϑ χ i s b q 1 q m where χ χ 1 χ 2 χ m t ℜ m and ϑ χ are the input and output vector respectively for the fuzzy system while a i q i i 1 2 m q i 1 2 l i t and b q 1 q m q 1 q m 1 2 l l i 1 m l i t represent a fuzzy set of χ i and ϑ χ respectively l i t denotes the number of a i q i and l is the number of fuzzy rules to be considered furthermore the fuzzy logic system is described by 9 ϑ χ q 1 1 l 1 t q m 1 l m t ϑ q 1 q m i 1 m ε a i q i χ i q 1 1 l 1 t q m 1 l m t i 1 m ε a i q i χ i where ϑ q 1 q m arg max ϑ ℜ ε b q 1 q m ϑ and ε b q 1 q m ϑ denotes the membership function of b q 1 q m ε a i q i χ i is the membership function of a i q i therefore we notate 10 θ ϑ 1 ϑ 2 ϑ l t ℜ l as the fuzzy parameter vector while the fuzzy basis function vector is defined as 11 ξ χ ξ 1 χ ξ 2 χ ξ l χ ℜ l where the fuzzy basis function is described as 12 ξ q 1 q m χ i 1 m ε a i q i χ i q 1 1 l 1 t q m 1 l m t i 1 m ε a i q i χ i based on 10 12 the fuzzy logic system 9 can be written as follow 13 ϑ χ θ t ξ χ lemma 2 universal approximation theorem tuo et al 2018 for any continuous function f χ u on a compact set ℜ m and for σ 0 there exists a fuzzy system g χ as the form of 13 such that 14 sup χ u f χ g χ σ according to lemma 2 for any given real continuous function f χ u the fuzzy logic system can realize the approximation according to the following formula 15 f χ θ t ξ χ α χ where θ ℜ l is the optimal parameter as following 16 θ arg min θ ℜ l s u p χ u f χ θ t ξ χ while α χ ℜ is the minimum approximation error assumption 2 θ and α χ satisfy the inequality θ θ m and α χ α m respectively where θ m and α m are positive bounds 2 3 control objective the trajectory tracking mission of dynamic positioning ship imposes some requirements on the closed loop design in terms of maneuver completion time permitted overshoot and accuracy tolerance in view of this these requirements are explicitly taken into account in the control design and the control objective is to design a control input τ such that the motion is achieved with guaranteed tracking performance which is necessary to meet the following goals despite the presence of time varying disturbances system parameter uncertainty and unmeasurable velocity r1 all signals in the closed loop system are bounded r2 the position error η e converges within the specified tolerances in a fixed time t f while exhibiting their maximum overshoots less than the corresponding constants prescribed in advance 3 the special finite time performance function finite time stability means that the state of the system can converge to the equilibrium point in finite time however the convergence time of existing finite time control approach is dependent of the initial value of the state jiang et al 2016 therefore a special finite time performance function which makes the convergence time independent of the initial state is described as follows definition 1 liu et al 2019 a c n n 1 continuous function ρ u t ℜ 0 ℜ is called a finite time performance function if there exists a preset time t 0 such that 1 ρ u t is positive and strictly decreasing over time for t 0 t 2 ρ u t ρ u s 0 for all t t to meet the mission requirements stated above we impose appropriate behavioral bounds on the translational position error η e i t i 1 2 3 expressed as 17 δ i ρ u i t η e i t δ i ρ u i t where δ i and δ i are design constants chosen as δ i 1 0 δ i 1 if η e i 0 0 and δ i 1 0 δ i 1 if η e i 0 0 and both cases can be used in case of zero initial condition and ρ u i t is the performance function defined by shao et al 2020a b 18 ρ u i t a i 0 a i 1 t a i 2 t 2 a i 3 t 3 a i 4 t 4 if t t f ρ u i s if t t f where t f and ρ u i s represent the desired fixed time and steady value of ρ u i t respectively and the parameters a i j j 0 1 2 3 4 are determined by a group of condition equations given below 19 ρ u i 0 a i 0 ρ u i 0 a i 1 0 ρ u i t f a i 0 a i 1 t f a i 2 t f 2 a i 3 t f 3 a i 4 t f 4 ρ u i s ρ u i t f a i 1 2 a i 2 t f 3 a i 3 t f 2 4 a i 4 t f 3 0 ρ u i t f 2 a i 2 6 a i 3 t f 12 a i 4 t f 2 0 it is notable that the positive constant a i 0 needs to be chosen such that 17 is fulfilled at t 0 in what follows we establish a central lemma for ρ u i t lemma 3 if the parameters a i 0 ρ u i s ρ u i s a i 0 and t f are given in advance then the following properties hold liu et al 2019 p1 ρ u i t exists and is unique p2 ρ u i t is c 2 continuous for all t 0 p3 ρ u i t is strictly decreasing over time for t 0 t f it is clear from lemma 3 and definition 1 that ρ u i t can be used as a special finite time performance function note that apart from the properties as stated in lemma 3 the finite time performance function ρ u i t also has a significant flexibility in drafting its convergence characteristics in terms of settling time and steady value to shed light upon this point the following two examples are considered case a take a i 0 10 ρ u i s 1 and choose different values of t f case b take a i 0 20 t f 80 s and choose different values of ρ u i s the theoretical responses of ρ u i t under various scenarios are shown in fig 1 as can be seen tuning the design parameters t f and ρ u i s can explicitly render ρ u i t exhibiting different behavioral metrics and moreover ρ u i t is continuous everywhere for all t 0 and strictly decreasing over time for t 0 t f according to lemma 3 it follows from 17 19 that δ i a i 0 if η e i 0 0 or δ i a i 0 if η e i 0 0 and t f denote the upper bounds on the overshoot and settling time of η e i t respectively whereas ρ u i s introduces the maximum allowable size of η e i t at the steady state and can be set as a sufficiently small value satisfying the required accuracy tolerance so we can impose a priori performance attributes necessary to meet the mission demands on the position error η e i t by properly selecting the finite time performance function ρ u i t as well as the design parameters δ i and δ i remark 4 as dictated by p2 in lemma 3 the finite time performance function defined in the polynomial form of 18 is c 2 continuous for all time which is sufficient for the subsequent controller design 4 control design and stability analysis in this section a novel fuzzy adaptive controller based on finite time performance function will be derived by using error transformation and fuzzy logic system combining with symmetric barrier lyapunov function the architecture of the resulted closed loop system is sketched in fig 2 4 1 error transformation from a theoretical viewpoint it is very difficult to directly incorporate the prescribed performance bounds defined by 17 into the closed loop design so the error transformation is defined by 20 ϒ η i t η e i t ρ u i t remark 5 if the transformed error ϒ η i t satisfies the inequality δ i ϒ η i t δ i i 1 2 3 for all time the positing error η e i t will evolve along its preset performance envelop then we take the derivative of ϒ η i t we have 21 ϒ η i 1 ρ u i η e i ρ u i ϒ η i in order to simplify the expression of formula we define ϒ η ϒ η 1 ϒ η 2 ϒ η 3 t γ u diag i 1 2 3 1 ρ u i and ρ u diag i 1 2 3 ρ u i so we can rewrite 21 as follows 22 ϒ η γ u η e ρ u ϒ η here we further define the new state vector z 1 ϒ η and z 2 υ i c with i c denotes the virtual control law and it is designed at latter discussion then the dynamics 2 is transformed into 23 m z 2 τ d m i c d z 2 d i c where d p η υ ω t p η υ p 1 η υ p 2 η υ p 3 η υ t and ω t w 1 t w 2 t w 3 t t is the unknown disturbance vector which is bounded due to assumption 1 and the formula 7 4 2 high gain observer for low speed ships such as dynamic positioning ships the error of velocity is large when it is in low speed motion which leads to the situation that the velocity is not measurable therefore we use a high gain observer to estimate the unmeasurable velocity the considered high gain observer can be represented by the following lin et al 2018a 24 ϕ ħ i ħ i 1 i 1 2 n ϕ ħ n ƛ 1 ħ n ƛ 2 ħ n 1 ƛ n 1 ħ 2 ħ 1 y t where ħ i is the state variables of high gain observer ϕ is an arbitrarily small positive constant ƛ 1 ƛ n 1 are parameters which ensure that the polynomial s n ƛ 1 s n 1 ƛ n 1 s 1 1 can be hurwitz and y t is the output variable of system remark 6 if y t and its first n 1 derivative are bounded namely y k q k k 0 1 n 1 with q k is a positive constant then it can ensure the following equation 25 ħ k 1 ϕ k y k ϕ ζ k 1 k 0 1 n 1 where ζ ħ n ƛ 1 ħ n 1 ƛ n 1 ħ 1 and its k 1 derivative is ζ k 1 while there are positive constants t and ζ m such that ζ k 1 ζ m for t t when the output y and its derivative y k are bounded ħ k 1 ϕ k can converge to y k and the error is also bounded therefore ħ k 1 ϕ k can provide an estimation of the unmeasured derivative of the system output until the n 1 order for the trajectory tracking of the dynamic positioning ship the position η is the output of the system according to 24 the high gain observer of dynamic positioning ship is presented as follows 26 ϕ ħ 1 ħ 2 ϕ ħ 2 ƛ 1 ħ 2 ħ 1 η then according to 26 we can obtain η ˆ which denotes the estimation of η and its derivative η ˆ as 27 η ˆ ħ 1 η ˆ 1 ϕ ħ 2 considering the expression of 25 with k 0 we have 28 η ˆ η ħ 1 η ϕ ζ where ζ ħ 2 ƛ 1 ħ 1 substituting the second equation of 27 into 1 the υ ˆ which denotes the estimation of υ can be expressed as 29 υ ˆ r t ψ 1 ϕ ħ 2 base on 1 25 and 29 we then obtain 30 υ ˆ υ r t ψ 1 ϕ ħ 2 η r t ψ ϕ ζ apparently according to 30 and remark 6 we get 31 υ ˆ υ ϕ ζ ϕ ζ m where ζ m is a positive constant 4 3 adaptive fuzzy controller design in this subsection we concentrate on the design of an adaptive fuzzy controller with the aim of guaranteeing the boundedness of all closed loop signals in order to ensure the position error performance bounds inspired by shao et al 2020a b we choose the symmetric barrier lyapunov function as follows tee et al 2009 32 v 1 v 11 v 12 v 13 where 33 v 1 i k 1 2 log δ i 2 δ i 2 ϒ η i 2 with i 1 2 3 k 1 is a positive constant and k 1 0 1 taking the derivatives of v 1 with respect to time t and substituting 22 into it leads to 34 v 1 k 1 ϒ η t n η γ u η e ρ u ϒ η where n η diag i 1 2 3 1 δ i 2 ϒ η i 2 the virtual control law is designed as follows 35 i c r t ρ u ϒ η k 3 γ u 1 ϒ η η d where k 3 is a designed positive constant now we take the υ ˆ which is the estimation of the high gain observer instead of υ so the new state vector z ˆ 2 can be written as 36 z ˆ 2 υ ˆ i c based on 1 34 35 and 36 we have 37 v 1 k 1 k 3 ϒ η t n η ϒ η k 1 ϒ η t n η γ u r z ˆ 2 to rewrite 23 with the new state vector z ˆ 2 we notate 38 m z 2 τ d m i c d υ ˆ then consider the following lyapunov function 39 v 2 v 1 1 2 z ˆ 2 t m z ˆ 2 evaluating the time derivative of v 2 we have 40 v 2 v 1 z ˆ 2 t m i c d υ ˆ τ z ˆ 2 t d substituting 7 and 37 into 40 and the following inequalities can be obtained 41 v 2 k 1 k 3 ϒ η t n η ϒ η k 1 ϒ η t n η γ u r z ˆ 2 z ˆ 2 t m i c d υ ˆ τ z ˆ 2 t p ω the desired robust controller is designed as 42 τ c k 1 r t n η γ u ϒ η m i c d υ ˆ k 2 z ˆ 2 p ω k 1 r t n η γ u ϒ η k 2 z ˆ 2 f ˆ where k 1 ℜ is a design constant k 2 ℜ 3 3 is the positive constant matrix and f ˆ m i c d υ ˆ p ω for the dynamic positioning ship control system m d are unknown and d is time varying therefore the expected control law 42 is difficult to achieve based on the fuzzy logic system in section 2 2 we take the fuzzy logic system 13 instead of the unknown term containing m d p and ω to apply for the model of dynamic positioning ship we define x ˆ x ˆ 1 x ˆ 2 x ˆ 3 x ˆ 4 x ˆ 5 x ˆ 6 t x y ψ u v r t ℜ 6 as the input vector of the fuzzy logic system and f ˆ x ˆ f ˆ 1 x ˆ f ˆ 2 x ˆ f ˆ 3 x ˆ t ℜ 3 as the output vector of the fuzzy logic system meanwhile we design the fuzzy rules as following 43 if x i s a 1 q 1 y i s a 2 q 2 ψ i s a 3 q 3 u i s a 4 q 4 v i s a 5 q 5 r i s a 6 q 6 then f ˆ 1 x ˆ i s b 1 q 1 q 6 f ˆ 2 x ˆ i s b 2 q 1 q 6 f ˆ 3 x ˆ i s b 3 q 1 q 6 where a i q i i 1 2 m q i 1 2 l i denote the fuzzy set of the i th input variable b j q 1 q 6 j 1 2 3 q 1 q 6 1 2 l l i 1 6 l i denote the fuzzy set of the output variable while l i i 1 6 is the number of a i q i and l is the total number of the fuzzy logic rules furthermore by means of center average defuzzifier product inference and singleton fuzzifier the fuzzy logic system of dynamic positioning ship is described by 44 f ˆ x ˆ θ t ξ x ˆ where θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 with θ j θ j 1 θ j 2 θ j l t ℜ l is the fuzzy parameter vectors θ j q 1

of a i q i taking the fuzzy logic system to estimate the unknown term in 42 yield 46 m i c d υ ˆ p ω θ t ξ x ˆ α x ˆ where α x ˆ ℜ 3 is the minimum estimation error and θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 ℜ l 3 is the

high gain observer the nonlinear adaptive fuzzy controller based on finite time performance function for the dynamic positioning system is designed as 48 τ k 1 r t n η γ u ϒ η k 2 z ˆ 2 θ ˆ t ξ x ˆ with the fuzzy parameter adaptive update laws as 49 θ ˆ j θ j ξ x ˆ z ˆ 2 j λ j θ ˆ j where j 1 2 3 θ j ℜ l l is the positive constant matrix θ ˆ θ ˆ 1 θ ˆ 2 θ ˆ 3 ℜ l is the estimation of the ideal

certain initial conditions choose the appropriate parameters k 1 k 2 θ ϕ ƛ 1 λ j j 1 2 3 a i 0 ρ u i s t f and the finite time performance function ρ u i t i 1 2 3 with the design constants δ i and δ i i 1 2 3 such that ϒ η 0 ϒ η ℜ 3 δ i ϒ η i δ i i 1 2 3 hold implementing the control law 48 together with the fuzzy parameter adaptive update law 49 can guarantee that control objective in section 2 3 can be achieved proof consider the following lyapunov function candidate 50 v v 2 j 1 3 θ j t θ j 1 θ j where θ θ ˆ θ evaluating the time derivative of v and substituting 34 and 40 into it leads to 51 v k 1 k 3 ϒ η t n η ϒ η k 1 ϒ η t n η γ u r z ˆ 2 z ˆ 2 t m i c d υ ˆ τ z ˆ 2 t d j 1 3 θ j t θ j 1 θ ˆ j inserting 41 and 46 into 51 we obtain 52 v k 1 k 3 ϒ η t n η ϒ η k 1 ϒ η t n η γ u r z ˆ 2 z ˆ 2 t τ z ˆ 2 t θ t ξ x ˆ α x ˆ substituting 48 and 49 into 52 we get 53 v k 1 k 3 ϒ η t n η ϒ η k 1 ϒ η t n η γ u r z ˆ 2 z ˆ 2 t k 1 r t n η ρ u ϒ η k 2 z ˆ 2 θ ˆ t ξ x ˆ z ˆ 2 t θ t ξ x ˆ α x ˆ j

bound of ξ x ˆ α x ˆ and θ j respectively substituting 55 56 and 57 into 53 and arranging the resulting yields 58 v 2 k 3 v 1 2 k 2 i 3 3 1 2 z ˆ 2 t z ˆ 2 1 2 ϕ 2 ζ m 2 1 2 α m 2 j 1 3 λ j ξ m 2 2 θ

j 2 θ j m 2 is a positive constant 1 as shown in 58 it is concluded that v 0 as long as v β κ which indicates that the set ω ϒ η z ˆ 2 υ η θ ˆ j θ j v β κ is positively invariant therefore we can conclude the boundedness of v and hence v 1 and v 2 for all time with v bounded and according to 50 ϒ η z ˆ 2 θ j are bounded for all time since ϒ η is bounded which implies that η e i t i 1 2 3 are strictly confined within the corresponding performance envelops defined by 17 and n η γ u are bounded in the view of 6 η is bounded from the boundedness of η e and η d from 35 and 36 i c and υ ˆ are bounded thus with the boundedness of υ ˆ it is further concluded that υ is bounded due to 47 θ j is bounded then θ ˆ j θ j θ j is also bounded apart from the above it can also be referred from 48 and 49 that τ is bounded therefore we claim that all closed loop signals are bounded 2 as dictated by 1 ϒ η is bounded and thus η e i t i 1 2 3 evolve strictly along the corresponding performance envelopes defined by 17 then with the selection of ρ u i t i 1 2 3 defined by 18 as well as the design constants δ i and δ i we readily conclude that η e i t will converge to the set ω η e η e i ρ u i s i 1 2 3 within the preset terminal time t f whilst exhibiting a maximum overshoot no more than δ i a i 0 if η e i 0 0 or δ i a i 0 if η e i 0 0 this completes the proof remark 7 from a theoretical viewpoint the proposed control scheme can achieve trajectory tracking with prescribed performance metrics necessary to meet the mission demands in the presence of unknown system parameters the unmeasurable velocity and time varying disturbances unlike the common practice in the relevant literature the responses of the trajectory tracking errors under the proposed control framework can be solely determined by suitable selection of the finite time performance function ρ i t i 1 2 3 as well as the design parameters δ i and δ i i 1 2 3 this is a prominent advantage that allows the control system designers to flexibly draft the achievable performance metrics in advance according to the specific mission demands furthermore the disassociation of the control parameters from the closed loop responses makes the control parameters selection an easy task remark 8 as opposed to most existing works on prescribed performance control in which exponential decaying performance functions are commonly used the proposed control method enables the position error η e i t i 1 2 3 to converge to a prescribed residual set within a preset terminal time this is attributed to the utilization of the special finite time performance function as defined by 18 furthermore compared to the existing finite time control approaches the designed controller not only renders the terminal time and residual sets of the translational position errors independent on system initial conditions as well as design parameters but also prescribes the maximum overshoots less than given constants remark 9 the proposed method can be easily extended to address the trajectory tracking control problem of the dynamic positioning ship and the full actuated surface ship with slight modifications in addition it is notable that this model with the typical form of the euler lagrange equation has two main advantages first it shares some well known properties of the euler lagrange systems which will be employed in control synthesis and stability analysis see section 4 for the details second it can be utilized to describe a wide range of dynamic systems such as spacecraft system robotic system etc seen in this light the theoretical results of this work can be readily extended to more general systems whose dynamics are expressed as euler lagrange equations remark 10 to assist the engineers in practically implementing the proposed control scheme we describe the algorithm in a pseudocode form as given in table 1 5 numerical simulations 5 1 performance of the proposed control law and the contrast control law in this subsection numerical simulations are carried out to testify the effectiveness of the proposed control method in close to realistic environment the model data comes from the dynamic

to meet the needs of special tasks and ensure the tracking effect the desired trajectory η d is composed of two parts one is a straight line trajectory the other is a curve trajectory η d 3 t 0 0 t i

and τ min 4 06 1 0 3 kn 4 06 1 0 4 kn 5 8 1 0 4 kn m t to satisfy trajectory tracking requirements the performance bounds described by 18 on the position error is designed by choosing the parameters listed in table 2 the total number of fuzzy rules l is l 729 and the parameters of fuzzy logic system is designed as θ 1 1 1 0 4 i 729 729 θ 2 1 1 0 4 i 729 729 θ 3 1 1 0 4 i 729 729 λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 1 1 0 13 for the gaussian membership functions ε a i q i x ˆ the center of matrix is c e n t e r 30 30 3 14 2 2 0 785 and the width of matrix is w i d t h 30 0 30 30 0 30 3 14 0 3 14 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 785 0 0

chosen by trial k 1 0 4 k 2 d i a g 1 8 1 8 0 6 k 3 0 3 the simulation step is uniformly set to 0 2 then the time varying disturbances d t are designed as d t r t η f d t with f d t 0 2 1 0 6 1 0 7 sin 0 6 t 0 3 sin 0 4 t 0 3 sin 0 8 t 0 2 1 0 6 sin 0 6 t 0 2 1 0 6 cos 0 8 t t the simulation results of proposed controller are provided infigs 3 8 to illustrate the controller meet the requirements of preset performance the transformed errors are shown in fig 3 from which it can be seen that ϒ η i t i 1 2 3 is bounded for comparison the adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller proposed in lin et al 2018b is also simulated and then the simulation results are sketched in figs 4 6 it is noted that the performance of trajectory which is expressed by the proposed method in fig 4 is better than the contrast method further the position errors are plotted in fig 5 it is apparent that the position error of proposed method satisfied the desired performance metric ρ u i s in a contrary the contrast method in lin et al 2018b fails to guarantee the transient error and leads to exceed steady value ρ u i s from fig 6 it gives the response of the control input with proposed method and contrast method it can be observed that the contrast method is good at the thrust controlling so the proposed method should be improved for input control fig 7 shows the boundedness of the norms of adaptive update law in order to verify the effect of the high gain observer the responses which display the estimated value of velocity and the actual value of velocity are shown in fig 8 which reveals that the estimated value tracks the actual value very well overall the proposed control method can guarantee the trajectory tracking with prescribed transient and steady state error bounds the high gain observer can estimate the unmeasurable velocity and fuzzy logic system can also well estimate the unknown system parameters meanwhile it can achieve the finite time control in the actual task of dp ship with time varying disturbances as a result the effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been illustrated in addition the difference between proposed control approach and contrast approach is highlighted and summarized in table 3 5 2 performance of changing the parameter of criteria on the proposed control law in this subsection to verify the sensitivity of the proposed method s performance to parameter selection the experiments were carried out based on different k 1 k 2 and k 3 values the simulation results of parameters adjustment are represented in figs 9 12 in order to explain the influence of the adjustment of parameters k 1 k 2 and k 3 on the controller better we divide into 4 cases to discuss 1 the time response of the trajectory tracking and the position error when k 1 0 4 k 2 diag 1 8 1 8 0 6 and k 3 0 3 2 the time response of the trajectory tracking and the position error when k 1 400 k 2 diag 1 8 1 8 0 6 and k 3 0 3 3 the time response of the trajectory tracking and the position error when k 1 0 4 k 2 diag 2 3 2 3 2 3 and k 3 0 3 4 the time response of the trajectory tracking and the position error when k 1 0 4 k 2 diag 1 8 1 8 0 6 and k 3 3 the parameters described in case 1 are designed in the proposed control scheme in the manuscript and it is obtained through continuous debugging to ensure the requirements of task case 2 represents the impact of k 1 changing on the controller performance case 3 is the impact of k 2 changing on the controller performance case 4 shows the effect of k 3 changing on the controller performance it is apparently the performance of controller is not sensitive to the varying of k 1 but it is more sensitive to the changing of k 2 and k 3 the varying may even cause system instability 6 conclusions in this paper a promising solution to the problem of trajectory tracking control of dp ship with guaranteed transient and steady state performance has been provided the special finite time performance function is developed to impose the desired behavioral metrics on the position errors according to the mission requirements about maneuver completion time and permitted overshoot by using the adaptive fuzzy estimation technique in conjunction with the symmetric barrier lyapunov function based on the finite time performance function and the high gain observer a novel adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme is derived which guarantees the boundedness of all closed loop signals and the satisfaction of the prescribed performance metrics in the presence of uncertain model time varying environment disturbance and unmeasurable velocity finally numerical simulations are carried out to testify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach in future works we will concentrate on building a semi physical simulation platform connect the simulation program to the hardware in the loop test system through the serial port and verify the practical applicability of the proposed control algorithm how to better deal with the input saturation problem will also become the focus of future work credit authorship contribution statement yuanhui wang conceptualization methodology

21212,this study aims at portraying the vertical vibration characteristics of an end bearing pile interacting with the saturated soil that is of distinctly inhomogeneous behavior in the radial direction due to the construction disturbance the pile is considered a one dimensional bar the saturated soil is considered by the biot s two phase linear theory and its radial inhomogeneity is simulated by the gradual variation of soil properties radially in a linear way in practical terms it is partitioned into a number of vertical ring shaped zones in the radial direction with the soil properties approximately remain the same within the same soil zone the pile soil dynamic interaction is then obtained by solving the governing equations of each soil zone and is substituted into the governing equation of the pile to derive the analytical solution for the dynamic impedance at the pile head the present solution is validated by comparing with other solutions meanwhile it is employed to investigate the effect of the construction disturbance on the vertical vibration of the pile for different pile soil parameters keywords vertical vibration saturated soil construction disturbance radial inhomogeneity complex impedance 1 introduction pile foundations have been increasingly adopted in engineering as the soil base is insufficient to support the load from the superstructures in most cases liang et al 2018a 2018b he et al 2019 li et al 2019b except the static loads pile foundations usually withstand vertical dynamic loadings liu et al 2019 investigating the behavior of pile foundations under vertical dynamic loadings can provide theoretical basis for aseismic design yang et al 2020 dynamic foundation design and non destructive testing of the piles meng et al 2020 given this many researchers have been engaged in this field in the past few decades despite some achievements based on the numerical methods shi et al 2014 ai and wang 2017 li et al 2019a most of the studies are focused on simulating the pile soil dynamic interaction by introducing more accurate models and on this basis solving the dynamic characteristics of the piles by analytical or semi analytical methods under this guidance many types of models have been proposed such as the winkler model yesilce and catal 2008 ding et al 2014 liu et al 2018 plane strain model novak et al 1978 zheng et al 2016 2017 wu et al 2020 luan et al 2020 and three dimensional axisymmetric model nogami and novak 1976 wu et al 2014 zheng et al 2015a these models with increasing accuracy greatly promoted the development of the pile vibration theory in coastal areas the soil can be simplified as a two phase medium as it is generally saturated by ground water shi and zhao 2020 as a result the pile vibration theories for the single phase soil case are not appropriate for the piles interacting with the two phase soil as they cannot take the effect of the permeability into account under this background some researchers developed the two phase medium theory in which the two phase soil is considered using the dynamic consolidation theory built by biot 1956 under the proposed idea zeng and rajapakse 1999 examined the vertical vibration of a pile partially embedded in homogeneous saturated soil then lu et al 2009 zheng et al 2015b and ai et al 2016 2018 established the corresponding solutions allowing for the stratification of the soil further some researchers extended the studies to more complicated conditions for example yang and pan 2010 took the end bearing pile into account based on the hypothesis that the pile overlies a rigid bedrock liu et al 2014 and ding et al 2017 extended the corresponding solution for the solid pile to that for the open ended pipe pile by considering the dynamic action of the soil plug xiao et al 2018 introduced the rayleigh love rod theory to approximately simulate the 3d effect of the wave propagation of a large diameter pile zhang et al 2019c considered the transversely isotropic behavior of the soil li et al 2019d extended the solution for the saturated soil to that for the frozen saturated soil by introducing the conception of the temperature in most cases the soil would be compacted or relaxed during pile installation this ubiquitous phenomenon is known as the construction disturbance as the disturbance degree of the soil is inversely related to its distance from the pile i e the soil closer to the pile is more strongly disturbed the soil surrounding the pile is of distinctly inhomogeneous behavior in the radial direction hu et al 2018 ji et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b this well nigh inevitable question plays an important role in the static capacity zhou et al 2017 and dynamic characteristic of the pile li and gao 2019a 2019b given this it has been a focus problem in the field of pile vibration theory over the years based on the review of the related literatures it can be derived that they simulated this phenomenon in much the same way i e varying the soil properties radially in a certain way such as a linear way parabolic way exponential way and so on based on these train of thoughts a range of models have been put forward from the weakened annular boundary zone model veletsos and dotson 1988 and non reflective boundary zone model dotson and veletsos 1990 han and sabin 1995 to the district boundary zone model el naggar 2000 wang et al 2019 and the shear complex stiffness transfer model yang et al 2009 zhang and pan 2017 li and gao 2019b the accuracy of the models is continuously improved with a wider application range similarly the saturated soil would also be inevitably disturbed during the installation of the pile li et al 2019c however the aforementioned studies were mainly focused on the analysis of the piles in the single phase soil thus resulting in insufficient research on those in the saturated soil in view of this this paper simulates the radial inhomogeneity of the saturated soil using a more accurate model and on this basis addresses the vibration of an end bearing pile subjected to vertical dynamic loading by analytical method based on the proposed solutions the effect of the construction disturbance for different parameters of the pile length and longitudinal wave velocity and the soil porosity and darcy permeability coefficient are investigated 2 model establishing 2 1 mathematical model a mathematical model presented in fig 1 is established to examine the vertical vibration of an end bearing pile interacting with the radially inhomogeneous saturated soil the vertical exciting force p 0 e i ω t is acted on the head of the visco elastic solid pile with a length of h p and a radius of r p in practice it can represent many types of dynamic loads such as the exciting force inspired by the handheld hammer in non destructive testing of pile the exciting force inspired by the dynamic machines when used as the dynamic machine foundation etc the pile installation would disturb the pile surrounding soil thus leading to distinct variation of soil properties to simulate this phenomenon the surrounding soil with a free top surface and overlies a rigid bedrock is partitioned into finite vertical ring shaped zones numbered by 1 j m and r j represents the inside radius of the jth zone to build the corresponding analytical solution the soil in the same zone is assumed to be homogeneous but varies zone to zone this approximate simulation method can meet the accuracy requirements if m is large enough in this system subjected to small deformations and strains the pile contacts perfectly with the soil which means that the shear stress equilibrium and displacement continuity conditions are satisfied at the pile soil interface 2 2 governing equations according to biot the governing equation of the saturated soil under the axisymmetric condition is given as follows when the radial displacement component

solution is compared with the solution for a pile embedded in radially inhomogeneous single phase medium proposed by yang et al 2009 and the plane strain solution for a pile embedded in radially inhomogeneous saturated soil developed by wang et al 2019 to verify its reliability then a systematic sensitivity analysis which aims at revealing the effect of the construction disturbance under different conditions is conducted with the aid of the proposed solution in the absence of special note the necessary parameters introduced are as follows h p 10 m r p 0 25 m v p 3600 m s ρ p 2500 kg m 3 δ p 100000 n s m 2 ρ s 2650 kg m 3 ρ f 1000 kg m 3 n 0 4 k s 36 gpa k f 2 gpa k d 10 5 m s g m 35 mpa g 1 21 mpa the size of the disturbed zone is r d 1 r p although the shear modulus of the disturbed zone can be assumed to vary in any form it is assumed to vary radially inwards in a linear way in this paper for simplicity the disturbance degree is defined as x g 1 g m in actual engineering the disturbance range and degree can be easily determined by testing the soil parameters i e the density and shear modulus more specifically collect the specimens using the soil sampler along the radial direction before and after pile installation then obtain the soil density and shear modulus through laboratory tests the distance from the pile shaft to the point where the soil properties are not affected by pile installation is the disturbance range the ratio of the soil parameters close to the pile to those in the undisturbed zone can be considered as the disturbance degree 4 1 verification the surrounding soil is partitioned into a number of vertical ring shaped zones in this study to simulate its inhomogeneity in the radial direction accordingly the calculation precision is largely depended on the number of the soil zones i e m prior to the comparisons the truncation of m is discussed and the results are presented in fig 2 for a given f the dynamic stiffness increases while the dynamic damping above the cut off frequency decreases as m increases during this process the calculated curves tend to converge especially for a higher f besides the effect of m is proved to be negligible when it is beyond a certain value 80 in this case in light of this m is given a value of 80 given n 0 the present solution is degenerated into that for a pile embedded in radially inhomogeneous single phase medium and is compared with the solution of yang et al 2009 as shown in fig 3 the calculated curves obtained from the degenerate solution and those from yang s solution coincide perfectly with each other then comparison between the present solution and the plane strain solution for a pile embedded in radially inhomogeneous saturate soil developed by wang et al 2019 is carried out the results are portrayed in fig 4 the present solution reflects a cut off frequency denoted by f c in the following analysis below which the dynamic damping remains almost to be zero however this phenomenon cannot be observed in the plane strain solution as the waves are assumed to propagate only horizontally thus the corresponding dynamic damping is overestimated while the dynamic stiffness is underestimated below the cut off frequency 4 2 effect of the construction disturbance for different pile soil parameters as mentioned above the construction disturbance makes the saturated soil radially inhomogeneous this phenomenon is commonly represented by two coefficients i e the disturbance range and disturbance degree in the following sensitivity analysis concerning the effect of the construction disturbance for different pile soil parameters these two coefficients are both involved to give a greater insight into the vertical vibration characteristics of the pile interacting with the saturated soil 4 2 1 effect of the construction disturbance for different pile parameters the effect of the construction disturbance for different pile parameters the length and longitudinal wave velocity is studied in this part the results are presented in figs 5 12 the effect of the weakening range on the complex impedance of the pile for different pile length is presented in fig 5 below the cut off frequency the dynamic stiffness decreases dramatically with f while the dynamic damping remains almost to be zero after that they both exhibit a rapid increase with a small increase in frequency for a given frequency the complex impedance above the cut off frequency decreases as the weakening range increases demonstrating a decrease in the capacity to resist vertical deformation and vibration besides the decreasing ratio of the dynamic stiffness decreases at low frequencies while increases at high frequencies for the dynamic damping however the decreasing ratio decreases in the whole frequency range moreover the soil weakening has no effect on the cut off frequency under the same weakening range the dynamic stiffness damping is considerably higher while the cut off frequency is smaller for a pile with h p 15 m than that for a pile with h p 10 m for a given increase in the weakening range the percentage decrease in the dynamic stiffness damping of a pile with h p 15 m is higher lower compared with that of a pile with h p 10 m and this phenomenon becomes more notable for a higher frequency demonstrating that the capacity of a longer pile to resist the dynamic deformation vibration is more less notably reduced by the weakening of the saturated soil the effect of the strengthening range on the complex impedance of the pile for different pile length is presented in fig 6 where the strengthening degree is assigned as x 1 5 for a given frequency the complex impedance increases with an increasing strengthening range of the soil in addition the increasing trend of the dynamic stiffness tends to be convergent at low frequencies while becomes more notable at high frequencies the increasing trend of the dynamic damping converges in the whole frequency range compared the results for a pile with h p 15 m and those for a pile with h p 10 m it can be noted that for a given increase in the strengthening range the percentage increase in the dynamic stiffness damping of a longer pile is higher lower especially at higher frequencies the effect of the disturbance degree on the complex impedance of the pile for different pile length is presented in figs 7 and 8 as shown in fig 7 the complex impedance decreases with the decreasing ratio increases for increasing weakening degree conversely that displayed in fig 8 increases and the increasing trend tends to converge with increases in the strengthening degree for a given increase in the weakening strengthening degree the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness exhibits an increase while that in the dynamic damping decreases slightly as the pile length increases on the whole the effect degree of the construction disturbance on the dynamic stiffness increases while that on the dynamic damping decreases for an increasing pile length the effect of the disturbance range on the complex impedance of the pile for different longitudinal wave velocity of the pile is shown in figs 9 and 10 as v p increases the cut off frequency i e f c remains unchanged while the complex impedance decreases when f f c the decreasing degree of the dynamic stiffness decreases gradually with frequency after that it increases with frequency until tends to be convergent the decrease in the dynamic damping is found to be more pronounced with frequency when f f c for a given increase in the weakening strengthening range the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness of a pile with v p 4000 m s is lower than that of a pile with v p 3600 m s besides this phenomenon becomes less pronounced with frequency when f f c and is more notable for a higher frequency when f f c on the contrary the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic damping increases with an increasing v p especially for a higher frequency when f f c besides the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness caused by the soil weakening strengthening is more notably affected by the increase of v p than that in the dynamic damping the effect of the disturbance degree on the complex impedance of the pile for different longitudinal wave velocity of the pile is shown in figs 11 and 12 similar to those presented in figs 9 and 10 the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness for a given weakening strengthening degree is lower while that in the dynamic damping is slightly higher for a pile with a higher v p generally speaking the effect of the construction disturbance on the dynamic stiffness is weakened while that on the dynamic damping is strengthened by the increase of v p 4 2 2 effect of the construction disturbance for different soil parameters the effect of the construction disturbance and its relationship with different soil parameters porosity and darcy permeability coefficient is investigated in this part the results are displayed in figs 13 20 figs 13 16 illustrate the effect of the construction disturbance on the complex impedance for different soil porosity for a given f and soil disturbance condition the dynamic stiffness damping decreases for an increasing n when f f c the effect of n on the dynamic stiffness decreases with f when f f c a more pronounced effect of n on the dynamic stiffness damping can be observed for an increasing f besides the cut off frequency remains unchanged when n increases as shown in figs 13 and 15 the percentage decrease in the dynamic stiffness caused by the increase of soil weakening range degree with a larger n is lower while that in the dynamic damping is slightly higher i e the resistance capacity to the dynamic deformation is less affected while that to the dynamic vibration is more affected the results in figs 14 and 16 present the similar principles where the percentage increase in the dynamic stiffness due to the increase of the strengthening range degree is lower while that in the dynamic damping is slightly higher for a larger n figs 17 20 present the effect of the construction disturbance on the complex impedance for different darcy permeability coefficient of the soil an increase in k d would result in the following aspects an unchanged cut off frequency an almost unchanged dynamic stiffness below the cut off frequency an increase decrease in the dynamic stiffness damping above the cut off frequency especially for a higher f in addition the effect degree of the soil disturbance range or degree on the dynamic stiffness increases slightly while that on the dynamic damping decreases slightly with an increasing k d compared the results in figs 13 20 with those in figs 5 12 what needs to be pointed out is that the effect degree of the construction disturbance is less sensitive to the soil parameters porosity and darcy permeability coefficient than to the pile parameters length and longitudinal wave velocity 5 conclusions an analytical solution is built and is employed to examine the effect of the construction disturbance of the saturated soil on the vertical vibration characteristics of an end bearing pile under different conditions comparisons with other solutions confirmed that the present solution is reliable and is more accurate than the plane strain solution the following conclusions can be condensed 1 both the dynamic stiffness and damping above the cut off frequency decrease increase as the weakening strengthening range or degree increases which demonstrates a decrease increase in the resistance capacity to vertical deformation and vibration 2 for increasing length or decreasing longitudinal wave velocity of the pile the dynamic stiffness damping increases the dynamic stiffness increases with decreases in the porosity or increases in the darcy permeability coefficient of the soil while the dynamic damping increases as the porosity or darcy permeability coefficient of the soil decreases besides the pile parameters exhibit a more pronounced effect than the soil parameters 3 with increasing pile length and darcy permeability coefficient of the soil or decreasing longitudinal wave velocity of the pile and soil porosity the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness caused by the soil weakening strengthening range or degree increases while that in the dynamic damping decreases moreover the effect degree of the construction disturbance indicates lower sensitivity to the soil parameters than to the pile parameters it should be pointed out that although the proposed analytical solution is reliable there still exists some limitations for example the analytical solution is not applicable for the large deformation condition the radial displacement of the soil is not considered when establishing the governing equation of the soil in addition the present solution cannot be applied to the large diameter pile because of the obvious three dimensional effect of wave propagation credit authorship contribution statement zhenya li methodology writing

21212,this study aims at portraying the vertical vibration characteristics of an end bearing pile interacting with the saturated soil that is of distinctly inhomogeneous behavior in the radial direction due to the construction disturbance the pile is considered a one dimensional bar the saturated soil is considered by the biot s two phase linear theory and its radial inhomogeneity is simulated by the gradual variation of soil properties radially in a linear way in practical terms it is partitioned into a number of vertical ring shaped zones in the radial direction with the soil properties approximately remain the same within the same soil zone the pile soil dynamic interaction is then obtained by solving the governing equations of each soil zone and is substituted into the governing equation of the pile to derive the analytical solution for the dynamic impedance at the pile head the present solution is validated by comparing with other solutions meanwhile it is employed to investigate the effect of the construction disturbance on the vertical vibration of the pile for different pile soil parameters keywords vertical vibration saturated soil construction disturbance radial inhomogeneity complex impedance 1 introduction pile foundations have been increasingly adopted in engineering as the soil base is insufficient to support the load from the superstructures in most cases liang et al 2018a 2018b he et al 2019 li et al 2019b except the static loads pile foundations usually withstand vertical dynamic loadings liu et al 2019 investigating the behavior of pile foundations under vertical dynamic loadings can provide theoretical basis for aseismic design yang et al 2020 dynamic foundation design and non destructive testing of the piles meng et al 2020 given this many researchers have been engaged in this field in the past few decades despite some achievements based on the numerical methods shi et al 2014 ai and wang 2017 li et al 2019a most of the studies are focused on simulating the pile soil dynamic interaction by introducing more accurate models and on this basis solving the dynamic characteristics of the piles by analytical or semi analytical methods under this guidance many types of models have been proposed such as the winkler model yesilce and catal 2008 ding et al 2014 liu et al 2018 plane strain model novak et al 1978 zheng et al 2016 2017 wu et al 2020 luan et al 2020 and three dimensional axisymmetric model nogami and novak 1976 wu et al 2014 zheng et al 2015a these models with increasing accuracy greatly promoted the development of the pile vibration theory in coastal areas the soil can be simplified as a two phase medium as it is generally saturated by ground water shi and zhao 2020 as a result the pile vibration theories for the single phase soil case are not appropriate for the piles interacting with the two phase soil as they cannot take the effect of the permeability into account under this background some researchers developed the two phase medium theory in which the two phase soil is considered using the dynamic consolidation theory built by biot 1956 under the proposed idea zeng and rajapakse 1999 examined the vertical vibration of a pile partially embedded in homogeneous saturated soil then lu et al 2009 zheng et al 2015b and ai et al 2016 2018 established the corresponding solutions allowing for the stratification of the soil further some researchers extended the studies to more complicated conditions for example yang and pan 2010 took the end bearing pile into account based on the hypothesis that the pile overlies a rigid bedrock liu et al 2014 and ding et al 2017 extended the corresponding solution for the solid pile to that for the open ended pipe pile by considering the dynamic action of the soil plug xiao et al 2018 introduced the rayleigh love rod theory to approximately simulate the 3d effect of the wave propagation of a large diameter pile zhang et al 2019c considered the transversely isotropic behavior of the soil li et al 2019d extended the solution for the saturated soil to that for the frozen saturated soil by introducing the conception of the temperature in most cases the soil would be compacted or relaxed during pile installation this ubiquitous phenomenon is known as the construction disturbance as the disturbance degree of the soil is inversely related to its distance from the pile i e the soil closer to the pile is more strongly disturbed the soil surrounding the pile is of distinctly inhomogeneous behavior in the radial direction hu et al 2018 ji et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b this well nigh inevitable question plays an important role in the static capacity zhou et al 2017 and dynamic characteristic of the pile li and gao 2019a 2019b given this it has been a focus problem in the field of pile vibration theory over the years based on the review of the related literatures it can be derived that they simulated this phenomenon in much the same way i e varying the soil properties radially in a certain way such as a linear way parabolic way exponential way and so on based on these train of thoughts a range of models have been put forward from the weakened annular boundary zone model veletsos and dotson 1988 and non reflective boundary zone model dotson and veletsos 1990 han and sabin 1995 to the district boundary zone model el naggar 2000 wang et al 2019 and the shear complex stiffness transfer model yang et al 2009 zhang and pan 2017 li and gao 2019b the accuracy of the models is continuously improved with a wider application range similarly the saturated soil would also be inevitably disturbed during the installation of the pile li et al 2019c however the aforementioned studies were mainly focused on the analysis of the piles in the single phase soil thus resulting in insufficient research on those in the saturated soil in view of this this paper simulates the radial inhomogeneity of the saturated soil using a more accurate model and on this basis addresses the vibration of an end bearing pile subjected to vertical dynamic loading by analytical method based on the proposed solutions the effect of the construction disturbance for different parameters of the pile length and longitudinal wave velocity and the soil porosity and darcy permeability coefficient are investigated 2 model establishing 2 1 mathematical model a mathematical model presented in fig 1 is established to examine the vertical vibration of an end bearing pile interacting with the radially inhomogeneous saturated soil the vertical exciting force p 0 e i ω t is acted on the head of the visco elastic solid pile with a length of h p and a radius of r p in practice it can represent many types of dynamic loads such as the exciting force inspired by the handheld hammer in non destructive testing of pile the exciting force inspired by the dynamic machines when used as the dynamic machine foundation etc the pile installation would disturb the pile surrounding soil thus leading to distinct variation of soil properties to simulate this phenomenon the surrounding soil with a free top surface and overlies a rigid bedrock is partitioned into finite vertical ring shaped zones numbered by 1 j m and r j represents the inside radius of the jth zone to build the corresponding analytical solution the soil in the same zone is assumed to be homogeneous but varies zone to zone this approximate simulation method can meet the accuracy requirements if m is large enough in this system subjected to small deformations and strains the pile contacts perfectly with the soil which means that the shear stress equilibrium and displacement continuity conditions are satisfied at the pile soil interface 2 2 governing equations according to biot the governing equation of the saturated soil under the axisymmetric condition is given as follows when the radial displacement component

solution is compared with the solution for a pile embedded in radially inhomogeneous single phase medium proposed by yang et al 2009 and the plane strain solution for a pile embedded in radially inhomogeneous saturated soil developed by wang et al 2019 to verify its reliability then a systematic sensitivity analysis which aims at revealing the effect of the construction disturbance under different conditions is conducted with the aid of the proposed solution in the absence of special note the necessary parameters introduced are as follows h p 10 m r p 0 25 m v p 3600 m s ρ p 2500 kg m 3 δ p 100000 n s m 2 ρ s 2650 kg m 3 ρ f 1000 kg m 3 n 0 4 k s 36 gpa k f 2 gpa k d 10 5 m s g m 35 mpa g 1 21 mpa the size of the disturbed zone is r d 1 r p although the shear modulus of the disturbed zone can be assumed to vary in any form it is assumed to vary radially inwards in a linear way in this paper for simplicity the disturbance degree is defined as x g 1 g m in actual engineering the disturbance range and degree can be easily determined by testing the soil parameters i e the density and shear modulus more specifically collect the specimens using the soil sampler along the radial direction before and after pile installation then obtain the soil density and shear modulus through laboratory tests the distance from the pile shaft to the point where the soil properties are not affected by pile installation is the disturbance range the ratio of the soil parameters close to the pile to those in the undisturbed zone can be considered as the disturbance degree 4 1 verification the surrounding soil is partitioned into a number of vertical ring shaped zones in this study to simulate its inhomogeneity in the radial direction accordingly the calculation precision is largely depended on the number of the soil zones i e m prior to the comparisons the truncation of m is discussed and the results are presented in fig 2 for a given f the dynamic stiffness increases while the dynamic damping above the cut off frequency decreases as m increases during this process the calculated curves tend to converge especially for a higher f besides the effect of m is proved to be negligible when it is beyond a certain value 80 in this case in light of this m is given a value of 80 given n 0 the present solution is degenerated into that for a pile embedded in radially inhomogeneous single phase medium and is compared with the solution of yang et al 2009 as shown in fig 3 the calculated curves obtained from the degenerate solution and those from yang s solution coincide perfectly with each other then comparison between the present solution and the plane strain solution for a pile embedded in radially inhomogeneous saturate soil developed by wang et al 2019 is carried out the results are portrayed in fig 4 the present solution reflects a cut off frequency denoted by f c in the following analysis below which the dynamic damping remains almost to be zero however this phenomenon cannot be observed in the plane strain solution as the waves are assumed to propagate only horizontally thus the corresponding dynamic damping is overestimated while the dynamic stiffness is underestimated below the cut off frequency 4 2 effect of the construction disturbance for different pile soil parameters as mentioned above the construction disturbance makes the saturated soil radially inhomogeneous this phenomenon is commonly represented by two coefficients i e the disturbance range and disturbance degree in the following sensitivity analysis concerning the effect of the construction disturbance for different pile soil parameters these two coefficients are both involved to give a greater insight into the vertical vibration characteristics of the pile interacting with the saturated soil 4 2 1 effect of the construction disturbance for different pile parameters the effect of the construction disturbance for different pile parameters the length and longitudinal wave velocity is studied in this part the results are presented in figs 5 12 the effect of the weakening range on the complex impedance of the pile for different pile length is presented in fig 5 below the cut off frequency the dynamic stiffness decreases dramatically with f while the dynamic damping remains almost to be zero after that they both exhibit a rapid increase with a small increase in frequency for a given frequency the complex impedance above the cut off frequency decreases as the weakening range increases demonstrating a decrease in the capacity to resist vertical deformation and vibration besides the decreasing ratio of the dynamic stiffness decreases at low frequencies while increases at high frequencies for the dynamic damping however the decreasing ratio decreases in the whole frequency range moreover the soil weakening has no effect on the cut off frequency under the same weakening range the dynamic stiffness damping is considerably higher while the cut off frequency is smaller for a pile with h p 15 m than that for a pile with h p 10 m for a given increase in the weakening range the percentage decrease in the dynamic stiffness damping of a pile with h p 15 m is higher lower compared with that of a pile with h p 10 m and this phenomenon becomes more notable for a higher frequency demonstrating that the capacity of a longer pile to resist the dynamic deformation vibration is more less notably reduced by the weakening of the saturated soil the effect of the strengthening range on the complex impedance of the pile for different pile length is presented in fig 6 where the strengthening degree is assigned as x 1 5 for a given frequency the complex impedance increases with an increasing strengthening range of the soil in addition the increasing trend of the dynamic stiffness tends to be convergent at low frequencies while becomes more notable at high frequencies the increasing trend of the dynamic damping converges in the whole frequency range compared the results for a pile with h p 15 m and those for a pile with h p 10 m it can be noted that for a given increase in the strengthening range the percentage increase in the dynamic stiffness damping of a longer pile is higher lower especially at higher frequencies the effect of the disturbance degree on the complex impedance of the pile for different pile length is presented in figs 7 and 8 as shown in fig 7 the complex impedance decreases with the decreasing ratio increases for increasing weakening degree conversely that displayed in fig 8 increases and the increasing trend tends to converge with increases in the strengthening degree for a given increase in the weakening strengthening degree the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness exhibits an increase while that in the dynamic damping decreases slightly as the pile length increases on the whole the effect degree of the construction disturbance on the dynamic stiffness increases while that on the dynamic damping decreases for an increasing pile length the effect of the disturbance range on the complex impedance of the pile for different longitudinal wave velocity of the pile is shown in figs 9 and 10 as v p increases the cut off frequency i e f c remains unchanged while the complex impedance decreases when f f c the decreasing degree of the dynamic stiffness decreases gradually with frequency after that it increases with frequency until tends to be convergent the decrease in the dynamic damping is found to be more pronounced with frequency when f f c for a given increase in the weakening strengthening range the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness of a pile with v p 4000 m s is lower than that of a pile with v p 3600 m s besides this phenomenon becomes less pronounced with frequency when f f c and is more notable for a higher frequency when f f c on the contrary the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic damping increases with an increasing v p especially for a higher frequency when f f c besides the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness caused by the soil weakening strengthening is more notably affected by the increase of v p than that in the dynamic damping the effect of the disturbance degree on the complex impedance of the pile for different longitudinal wave velocity of the pile is shown in figs 11 and 12 similar to those presented in figs 9 and 10 the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness for a given weakening strengthening degree is lower while that in the dynamic damping is slightly higher for a pile with a higher v p generally speaking the effect of the construction disturbance on the dynamic stiffness is weakened while that on the dynamic damping is strengthened by the increase of v p 4 2 2 effect of the construction disturbance for different soil parameters the effect of the construction disturbance and its relationship with different soil parameters porosity and darcy permeability coefficient is investigated in this part the results are displayed in figs 13 20 figs 13 16 illustrate the effect of the construction disturbance on the complex impedance for different soil porosity for a given f and soil disturbance condition the dynamic stiffness damping decreases for an increasing n when f f c the effect of n on the dynamic stiffness decreases with f when f f c a more pronounced effect of n on the dynamic stiffness damping can be observed for an increasing f besides the cut off frequency remains unchanged when n increases as shown in figs 13 and 15 the percentage decrease in the dynamic stiffness caused by the increase of soil weakening range degree with a larger n is lower while that in the dynamic damping is slightly higher i e the resistance capacity to the dynamic deformation is less affected while that to the dynamic vibration is more affected the results in figs 14 and 16 present the similar principles where the percentage increase in the dynamic stiffness due to the increase of the strengthening range degree is lower while that in the dynamic damping is slightly higher for a larger n figs 17 20 present the effect of the construction disturbance on the complex impedance for different darcy permeability coefficient of the soil an increase in k d would result in the following aspects an unchanged cut off frequency an almost unchanged dynamic stiffness below the cut off frequency an increase decrease in the dynamic stiffness damping above the cut off frequency especially for a higher f in addition the effect degree of the soil disturbance range or degree on the dynamic stiffness increases slightly while that on the dynamic damping decreases slightly with an increasing k d compared the results in figs 13 20 with those in figs 5 12 what needs to be pointed out is that the effect degree of the construction disturbance is less sensitive to the soil parameters porosity and darcy permeability coefficient than to the pile parameters length and longitudinal wave velocity 5 conclusions an analytical solution is built and is employed to examine the effect of the construction disturbance of the saturated soil on the vertical vibration characteristics of an end bearing pile under different conditions comparisons with other solutions confirmed that the present solution is reliable and is more accurate than the plane strain solution the following conclusions can be condensed 1 both the dynamic stiffness and damping above the cut off frequency decrease increase as the weakening strengthening range or degree increases which demonstrates a decrease increase in the resistance capacity to vertical deformation and vibration 2 for increasing length or decreasing longitudinal wave velocity of the pile the dynamic stiffness damping increases the dynamic stiffness increases with decreases in the porosity or increases in the darcy permeability coefficient of the soil while the dynamic damping increases as the porosity or darcy permeability coefficient of the soil decreases besides the pile parameters exhibit a more pronounced effect than the soil parameters 3 with increasing pile length and darcy permeability coefficient of the soil or decreasing longitudinal wave velocity of the pile and soil porosity the percentage decrease increase in the dynamic stiffness caused by the soil weakening strengthening range or degree increases while that in the dynamic damping decreases moreover the effect degree of the construction disturbance indicates lower sensitivity to the soil parameters than to the pile parameters it should be pointed out that although the proposed analytical solution is reliable there still exists some limitations for example the analytical solution is not applicable for the large deformation condition the radial displacement of the soil is not considered when establishing the governing equation of the soil in addition the present solution cannot be applied to the large diameter pile because of the obvious three dimensional effect of wave propagation credit authorship contribution statement zhenya li methodology writing

reference to calculations of piles was also made on this basis the author focused in the paper on new aspects of designing the hybrid foundations in serviceability limit states the know how review showed that the aspects of hybrid foundation design have been poorly recognized so far for practical reasons a simple calculation method for the hybrid foundations useful for initial decision making is still needed a new design method was presented based on a hybrid pile soil interaction concept a general design concept was described the assumptions were formulated and the method was explained in detail a practical application of this method has been demonstrated for a large diameter hybrid pile previously tested at full scale under lateral load the calculation results were compared with the well verified data obtained from the field test by incorporating the extended knowledge on the mechanism of the pile soil interaction a significantly reduced horizontal stress in front of the pile was achieved the conducted calculations confirmed that the hybrid monopile displacement is 40 70 lower compared to the standard monopile with similar dimensions this method allows the stability of the new hybrid monopiles under lateral load to be assessed in a better way the gained experiences can be useful for designers and other researchers to enhance the design of offshore wind turbines on monopiles

and gavin 2011 doherty and lehane 2018 fan and long 2005 pedram 2015a zhang et al 2020 in the paper a new approach to hybrid monopiles shaping and owts calculation was presented the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile foundation depends mainly on its stiffness in the soil the modern requirements for designing the owts foundations according to the eurocodes are now more sls than uls oriented dnvgl 2018 the serviceability of the owts may get lost due to an excessive tilting or horizontal displacement of the tower at mudline level considering the strict operational requirements of the turbines a maximum rotating angle of 0 25 and horizontal displacement of the pile head is often limited api 2014 dnvgl 2018 iso 2016 based on the results of research and analyses a practical method of calculating the hybrid monopiles was developed the proposed solution was improved with regards to the pile soil interaction in the initial phase of increasing displacements using the simplified calculations for the hybrid foundation allows the impact of a horizontal protection around the monopile to be initially assessed which generally improves the pile lateral stiffness by 40 70 the new calculations are advantageous when it comes to determining the pile diameter reducing the pile depth lowering the cost of foundation construction work and increasing the safety of owts in difficult conditions at the sea the research results indicate that the hybrid foundation provides a promising substructure for the offshore wind industry with broad applications on april 2020 the first hybrid foundation combining a large diameter monopile and caisson was installed at an offshore wind farm off the fujian province in china buljan 2020 the designing analyses in this paper relate rather to the static loading of the hybrid monopile according to other authors research wang et al 2018b anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 the lateral deformation of hybrid monopile foundations increases with the number of cycles but with a much smaller gradient increasing compared to a convential monopile foundation it is possible to modify the soil properties beneath the bearing plate by using an injection method trojnar 2004 2010 then displacement of the hybrid monopile tends to stabilize quickly for larger cycles owts with the hybrid monopile foundation can provide larger cyclic bearing capacities than those with the monopile foundation as well as more scour protection 2 stability of the hybrid foundations selected problems the new concept of the hybrid monopile for owt is shown in fig 2 the hybrid foundations with a horizontal round bearing plate are intensively researched and analyzed in various scientific centers arshi 2016 arshi and stone 2011 2012a b 2015a b arshi

calculation of the hybrid foundation stability is usually difficult to carry out using the simplified analytical formulas this is due to the requirement of taking the spatial aspect of the structure s interaction with the soil into account beuckelaers 2017 bouzid 2018 byrne et al 2019 el naggar and mehdi 2018 kim and jeong 2011b murphya et al 2018 pedram 2015a b c trojnar 2015 zachert and wichtmann 2020 zdravković et al 2015 the range of the interaction between the vertical and horizontal parts of the hybrid foundation depends on the total displacements of the whole structure but also on the relative displacements of its components and soil deformation in front of the pile the deformation of the soil around the foundation depends on the geometric proportions of the structure and loads in the case of the hybrid monopiles their interaction with soil primarily results from the simultaneous interaction of the horizontal bearing plate and the vertical pile shaft and depends on the hybrid pile rotation the calculation analysis of the foundation must take into account the kinematics of the soil induced by the pile shaft rotation and the pressure of the bearing plate on the ground an important aspect of design is the modelling of soil deformation around the monopile foundation which has been studied by other authors anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 cheng et al 2019 cuéllar et al 2012 haiderali and madabhushi 2012 2015 haiderali et al 2013 hajialilue bonab et al 2011 2013 hokmabadi et al 2012 janoyan and whelan 2004 leblanc et al 2010 lesny et al 2007 yang et al 2018 2019 yuan et al 2019 wang et al 2018a b zhang et al 2005 the calculation method given below is based on the assessment of soil kinematics around the hybrid pile which has been studied in multiple scales a small laboratory scale a full field test a 3d numerical simulation trojnar 2008a 2008b 2012 trojnar 2013 2019 the author s proposal of simplifying the complex mechanics of load transfer through the load bearing plate with a strain wedge is generally similar to other authors concepts based on 3d fem analyses chen et al 2020 li et al 2020 however to analyze the displacements of the hybrid foundations full scale tests are most needed trojnar 2009b 2010 byrne et al 2017 2019 beuckelaers 2017 zhang et al 2020 their importance concerns the stability assessment and the hybrid monopile calculations under extreme lateral load the calculation problems of the shallow hybrid foundations are analyzed in a similar way as spread foundations with an inclined base or other specifically shaped foundations such as bucket foundations skirt foundations or conical foundations the calculation methods for such foundations result from centrifuge model tests and numerical analyses for complex 2d or 3d systems these publications are characteristic in this field bransby and randolph 1998 cassidy and houlsby 2002 cheng et al 2019 gourvenec and barnett 2011 houlsby and cassidy 2002 larsen 2008 wang et al 2017 for the analysis of a hybrid monopile a commercial computer program is usually needed to determine the real displacement modern and expensive software is only seldom used by designers for the preliminary pile analysis because it requires a good knowledge of numerical modelling and the use of advanced data numerical methods also require an appropriate constitutive soil model for the 3d fe simulations therefore in practice simple calculation methods are still needed to obtain real values of pile displacements with the best possible consideration of the spatial conditions in the soil such assessments are usually needed at the initial decision making stages for the new owts and to analyze the strengthening of existing monopile owts 3 design of the standard monopiles a short review the behaviour of the monopile in the ground under lateral load horizontal force and bending moment mainly depends on the stiffness of the pile soil system bhattacharya 2019 dean 2010 randolph and gourvenec 2011 reese and van impe 2001 due to the nature of the pile soil interaction two types of piles are distinguished flexible with long shaft and rigid with short shaft for the flexible piles it is assumed that under lateral load the pile shaft is deformed and its horizontal soil stress decreases with depth for the rigid piles it is assumed that the pile shaft does not deform and the pile rotates in the soil when loaded the rotation accompanied by the resistance of the soil in front of the pile above the centre of rotation and behind the pile below the centre of rotation in the calculation one of three assumptions describing the soil can be made 1 homogeneous with a constant deformability regardless of depth 2 homogeneous with a deformability linearly decreasing with depth 3 non homogeneous with characteristics changing with depth according to a determined definition the first and second assumption are often used for the pile calculations in the winkler model wm they can be used with a one or two parameter relationship of the soil deformability and pile displacement assuming the constant soil characteristics the pile soil interaction is determined using the modulus of subgrade reaction k p y this parameter describes the relationship between the lateral pressure of the pile exerted on the soil p and the pile horizontal displacement y the adequate calculation result depends on the soil type length and diameter of the pile and the stiffness of the pile head fastening in the cap structure free or fixed the second design assumption is often used in most methods of pile calculations in cohesive and cohesionless soils the most frequent hypothesis includes constant or linearly changing characteristics of the soil with regards to depth as the criterion of foundation stiffness in the ground the ratio of the pile length l to its elastic length l s is assumed using the formulas l s 4ei k d l n 1 n 4 where ei pile shaft stiffness d pile diameter k modulus of subgrade reaction n coefficient depending on the type of soil for the rigid piles with short shaft l l s 1 5 and for the flexible piles with long shaft l l s 3 these formulas can be used to calculate the bending moment and displacement of the pile with a free or fixed pile head in the analyses of the large diameter monopiles more accurate analytical solutions are incorporated the stiffness of the pile in the ground is determined according to the formula ω m d p ei 1 5 using the relevant criterion ω l 2 5 for the rigid piles and ω l 2 5 for the flexible piles where d p design diameter of the pile m soil resistance factor k z m z the third design assumption is used for piles in layered subsoil the pile is treated as a vertical beam in an elastic medium the pile soil interaction is replaced by elastic supports along the pile to define the elastic supports p y curves are used describing the deformation displacement relationship at a certain depth using the appropriately selected curves gives a possibility to numerically illustrate the non linear behavior character of the pile under lateral load taking into account e g changes in shape or diameter of the pile at different depths variants of fastening of the pile head in the cap structure and the influence of soil layering on the pile bending a modern concept for the calculation analysis of the conditions of the spatial pile soil interaction includes the strain wedge model sw based on the hypothesis that in front of the pile a non deformable mass of soil is shaped together with an increase of lateral load and a change of stress ashour et al 2002 ashour and norris 2003 bouzid 2018 this method takes better account of the spatial stress in the soil due the rotation and displacement of the pile under lateral load the soil pushed in front of the pile has a shape of a spatial wedge and its dimensions depend on the current stress in the zone in front of the pile applying the calculation procedure with an incremental pile loading according to the known stress strain characteristics in soil wedge in front of the pile allows for a better identification of the p y curves the presented assumptions of the strain wedge were adapted in the further part of the paper to propose the calculations of the hybrid monopiles for owts 4 previous simple methods of designing the hybrid monopiles the review of the last 50 years shows how other authors looked for a simplified method of calculating the hybrid foundations the analytical solutions aspects of the hybrid foundation have been poorly recognized so far the oldest methods give rather unrealistic results further methods have been developed in central and eastern european countries and have not yet been published in english the broms method shown in fig 3 can be considered the first and most simplified analytical solution for the pile with the cap broms 1964 1965 the calculation depends on the pile behavior scheme in the soil and on fastening of the pile head in the cap structure free or fixed these calculations result in determining the unloading yield moment in the pile below the bearing plate however this very simple solution cannot be used in the practical calculation because it does not take into acount all effects of the pile stiffness changing and pile rotation the davisson gill method shown in fig 4 is a simple analytical solution for the pile in a two layer soil with two subgrade modules k1 and k2 with various modules ratio davisson and gill 1963 for such assumptions plots and coefficients are given for the pile as a beam on elastic supports the calculations are made for two schemes of the pile head free or fixed this method is more suitable for long piles due to the form of deformation of the pile in the ground a comparison of this method with other accurate calculations abbas et al 2018 stuedlein 2015 li et al 2019 shows that the results are not satisfactory this method cannot be used to calculate the real hybrid piles and soil stresses because many simplifications have been applied the spang method shown in fig 5 was used in germany in the 1970s it was incorporated in the field test of the large diameter hybrid pile d 1 2 m including soil stress measurement spang 1972 spang 1972 in the analytical solution it was recommended to use a double value of the modulus of subgrade reaction under the bearing plate up to 3d depth the result of this approach is a reduction in the maximum moment value of a hybrid pile by about 40 60 compared to a standard pile without plate this generally corresponds to the results of other authors research abdelkader 2015 el marassi 2011 archi 2016 pedram 2015b stone et al 2010 lehane et al 2014 trojnar 1995 yang et al 2019 however this method cannot be used for designing in the sls because it does not allow for a reliable calculation of the pile displacement the tsiprianovich method shown in fig 6 was used in the 1960s in the former ussr countries tsiprianovich 1971 in the calculation it was assumed that the horizontal bearing plate is not connected with the pile head and interacts with the soil in front of the plate only if the bearing plate has an inclined front surface the soil in front of the hybrid pile is additionally compacted as a result of the bearing plate action the unloading moment m δ occurs the calculation takes into account the linear change of the modulus of subgrade reaction and the design diameter of the pile this method has a very limited scope of application as it does not include the soil deformation in front of the pile resulting from the vertical pressure of the bearing plate the bakulina method shown in fig 7 was developed in russia based on model tests of a single pile with decoupled bearing plate embedded in the cohesive soil bakulina 2013 displacement of the hybrid pile is interpreted as a sum of effects from the horizontal force h and the moment м and change of the modulus of subgrade reaction beneath the plate the hybrid piles with the diameter d 0 4 m and length l 2 m were tested l d 5 in prototype scale several lateral load variants were used m h 1 2 3 with the variable bearing plate width b d 1 1 5 2 2 5 the given formulas may be valid only within the specified tested range the mathus method was developed in ukraine based on theoretical analyses of a single pile with the rigidly connected bearing plate coupled mathus 2013 the main assumptions are as follows 1 the hybrid foundation is absolutely rigid 2 the soil is a linear elastic medium whose deformability in vertical and horizontal direction is characterized by the soil modules with a rectangular and triangular variation distribution respectively 3 for small angles of rotation the interaction of both parts of the hybrid foundation can be described using the static equilibrium equations for identical angles of rotation of the bearing plate and the pile as shown in fig 8 5 a proposal for simplified calculations of hybrid monopiles 5 1 calculation assumptions based on own model tests trojnar 2008a 2010 2019 it was determined that the active soil area formed under the bearing plate in front of the hybrid pile is wedge shaped the wedge area is shown in fig 9 a marked as zone a in relation to the spatial stresses this space can be described using abcd points where the bc distance is width at the wedge end fig 10 it was assumed on the basis of other studies ahmed and hawlader 2016 ashour et al 2002 ashour and norris 2003 hajialilue bonab et al 2013 hokmabadi et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 the the depth of the wedge increases with the hybrid pile loading this can be described at a given depth as a change of the bc distance in front of the pile in successive load steps based on previous analyses of hybrid piles it was found that the change of depth of the wedge under the bearing plate occurs only in a limited range of the pile displacement trojnar 2009b 2010 trojnar 2013 2019 in this case the lateral pressure of the pile on the soil is due to the stress wedge in zone a it was assumed that the reaction force r in front of the hybrid pile resulting from stresses in the wedge impact zone depends on the vertical plate pressure and changes with the pile rotation based on the author s own research it was also observed that the maximum wedge size z h max corresponds to the stress limit state and soil deformation in front of the pile which can be described as the angle α max π 4 φ 2 at the maximum load the soil shear failure in wedge zone occurs and further displacements of the hybrid pile do not directly depend on the stresses under the plate anymore but on the final wedge size at the moment of the soil shear failure along the line 0 3 in fig 9b the wedge sizes were analyzed by means of numerical 3d models trojnar 2008b 2009b based on these fe analyses a function was determined which described the formation of the soil wedge under the plate with regards to the displacement of the hybrid monopile under the lateral load it was assumed that the α angle defining the wedge depth under the bearing plate may range from 0 to αmax numerical analysis was used to qualitatively identify the behavior of the soil wedge in front of the hybrid monopile and to develop a practical method for its calculation showed in fig 11 due to using the coupled plate fixed to the pile the soil in front of the hybrid monopile has a higher load bearing capacity than a standard monopile fig 11 presents the wedge shape as the soil stress difference for two numerical models of 5 m long piles a hybrid one and a standard one numerical modelling was carried out using the plaxis 3d foundation software the analysis was conducted for the monopile with the diameter of 1 2 m in homogenous sand a a mohr coulomb nonlinear elastic plastic soil model was used the following sand parameters were used for calculations internal friction angle φ 35 young s modulus e 80 mpa increased 1 5z with depth z cohesion c 0 001 mpa poisson s ratio ʋ 0 30 and dilatation angle 5 the plate pile connection is fully rigid special interface contact elements were employed to model the relationship between the plate and soil allowing detachment and sliding with regard to the shear resistance of the coulomb type friction coefficient f 0 5 was assumed the model dimensions and lateral load of the hybrid monopile were the same as in case of the piles in the field investigation trojnar 2009 based on numerical and model tests the reasons for changes of the soil wedge were determined consisting of two opposing phenomena 1 strengthening due to the vertical pressure of the plate on the soil in front of the pile and 2 loosening due to the soil displacement in front of the pile the first phenomenon results in the wedge formation whereas the second is associated with the gradual change of the wedge shape and size along with the displacement and rotation of the hybrid pile the parameter ψ shown in fig 12 was introduced to the mathematical description of these phenomena it describes the reduced soil loosening for the hybrid monopile compared to the standard monopile this issue may be presented as an exponential function ψ 1 1 x x the value ψ 0 corresponds to the lack of the wedge at zero load exerted on the hybrid pile the value ψ 1 translates to the wedge formation with the maximum dimensions and the maximum possible soil strain in front of the pile based on the 3d fe numerical analyses and full scale hybrid pile tests the m parameter was introduced as the ratio of soil stress in front of the standard and hybrid pile the change of this parameter depending on the displacement is also shown in fig 12 both curves ψ x and m y have a similar shape and were normalized with regard to the displacements of previously tested hybrid piles l d 4 2 m h 4 assuming the maximum soil strain within the wedge ε max 0 3 trojnar 2009 trojnar 2013a 2013b by introducing the modified m value it is possible in the future to even better match the theoretical solution for more test data however more full scale tests including actual displacement measurements of the hybrid monopiles are required by obtaining more data in the future it will be possible to parametrically take into account the impact of the soil type load type and the geometrical dimensions of the hybrid foundations for the calculations the following important assumptions were made fig 13 1 soil resistance beneath the bearing plate can be replaced by the r force under the bearing plate as a result of rotation the pressure is transferred from the bearing plate to the soil in front of the pile 2 the force r is applied at a distance of 2 3 of the plate s reach and inclined to the vertical at an α angle which changes as the soil wedge increases and the foundation displacement occurs this assumption is very simplified however it does not affect the final calculation result because it takes into account the total equivalent reduction of the hybrid monopile load caused by combined effects of the bearing plate and the pile 3 the horizontal soil pressure in front of the bearing plate is ignored for safety reasons possibility of exposing the plate surface 4 the plate bending is caused only by the subgrade reaction beneath the bearing plate and by the rotation of the pile 5 the pile vertical load is transferred to the ground by the pile skin friction and the pile base if pile shaft is too short the pile may be uplift and this must be checked by calculation 6 deformability of the soil under the plate is a constant value 5 2 calculation method it was assumed that the favourable effect of the bearing plate can be replaced by an equivalent reduction of initial lateral load of the standard pile without a plate m hyb m o dm h hyb h o dh when the hybrid pile is loaded it is rotating by δ angle the pile rotation is accompanied by the bearing plate also rotating by the same angle this is due to rigid connection of both parts of the hybrid foundation assuming a rectangular stress distribution under all sub areas of the plate its vertical displacement can be calculated using the formula 5 1 the vertical stress in the soil σ vi can be calculated from the formula 5 2 with influence factors η i from fig 14 and table 1 for pressure qi under sub areas of the plate in the case of small angles of rotation the vertical displacement at the end of the bearing plate can be calculated from the equation 5 3 5 1 s i σ v z i e 5 2 σ v i j q i η j q 5 8 χ q 1 4 ξ q 9 12 λ 5 3 s b tan δ b δ where s

step as previously assumed the soil resistance under the bearing plate was replaced by the r force inclined to the plate applied at distance e b 2 3 b from the pile the force inclination changes with the pile rotation the maximum force inclination corresponds to the maximum soil wedge size under the bearing plate then the inclination to the vertical for a line forming the frontal wedge surface is β max π 4 φ 2 the calculation scheme of the forces system is shown in fig 13 the relationship between horizontal stress values in the soil in front of the hybrid pile and the standard piles is described as the m parameter by this parameter also the change of total subgrade reaction under the bearing plate is described based on own field tests and numerical analyses of the hybrid piles the displacements and lateral soil pressure of the piles with and without the bearing plate were compared the variability of the m parameter is shown in fig 12 based on the measurement data and calculations of 5 m long piles of 1 2 mindiameter it was found that the effect of increasing a lateral stiffness of the hybrid pile can be presented graphically with the second degree polynomial function or more generally with the exponential function the initial part of the plot may indicate the friction effect between the bearing plate and the subsoil this article does not analyze this effect in detail the pure effect of greater soil resistance in front of the hybrid pile can be replaced by the equivalent reduction of the lateral load of the pile head dm dq depending on the current displacement using the real parameters of the bearing plate and the soil it is possible to calculate the total subsoil reaction r depending on the determined values of the horizontal displacement and the rotation of the pile comparing the equations 5 1 and 5 3 for the plate reach b d and considering the equivalent rectangular plate with 12 sub areas allowed a calculation the vertical component of the soil resistance r v under the bearing plate according to formulas 5 4 5 5 with factors in fig 14 and table 1 for layer thickness d 8 d 8 d 4 d 2 5 4 s d δ 1 e 0 965 r v d 2 d 8 0 691 r v d 2 d 8 0

together with the iterative procedure proposed in this paper the hybrid monopile displacement y and the reduced rotation angle of the pile head δ can be determined this is achieved by applying m i 1 h

the value of the horizontal component of the soil resistance under the bearing plate r h varies with the rigid soil wedge in front of the hybrid pile assuming that the parameter m describes the non linear increase of the horizontal component of the soil resistance under the bearing plate then the value of resistance can be calculated according to the equation 5 11 the component forces of the soil resistance r h r v reduce the bending of the hybrid pile the global unloading of the hybrid pile head dm and dh resulting from the plate interaction can be calculated in subsequent iteration

the research and analyses carried out so far confirm that the hybrid foundations are characterized by high lateral load bearing capacity and stiffness and can be used as an effective solution for offshore wind turbine foundations given the pile soil interaction at increasing lateral load it can be computationally determined that the bending of the new hybrid monopile shaft is 30 smaller than in the case of the standard monopile the practical aspects of the hybrid foundation design have been poorly recognized so far this applies particularly to the lack of simple calculation methods for predicting the stability of the new foundations such assessments are usually needed at the initial decision making stages for new owts and to analyze the strengthening of existing monopiles in owts using additional bearing plates placed on the seabed e g when replacing old power generators with new high power ones in the cases of new structures the increased rotor diameter and the increased height of the turbines lead to higher lateral loads transferred to the foundations in the case the new hybrid monopiles are used the costs of owts foundations and their installation can be significantly reduced the simplified calculation method presented in this paper allows its users to better check the hybrid monopile stability in the simple soil conditions in the serviceability limit state by adopting the concept of the soil wedge under the bearing plate the reduced rotation and horizontal displacement were confirmed compared to the standard monopile under the same load by using the proposed method of iterative calculations the hybrid monopile displacements may be decreased by 40 70 example calculations conducted according to the described method were positively validated based on the full scale tests of hybrid piles with l d 4 m h 4 a modified strain wedge model was developed to analyze the behaviour of laterally loaded hybrid monopiles in cohesionless soil calculation methods for the assessment of the soil resistance along the hybrid monopile were proposed and the sw model was used to describe the stress strain behaviour of the soils finally the validity and accuracy of the proposed calculation method were verified using a case study and the results derived from the full scale tests were compared to those calculated by the proposed method the

21213,first a review of knowledge developed over the previous 50 years was presented including various simplified methods of analyzing hybrid foundations to discuss this subject comprehensively a reference to calculations of piles was also made on this basis the author focused in the paper on new aspects of designing the hybrid foundations in serviceability limit states the know how review showed that the aspects of hybrid foundation design have been poorly recognized so far for practical reasons a simple calculation method for the hybrid foundations useful for initial decision making is still needed a new design method was presented based on a hybrid pile soil interaction concept a general design concept was described the assumptions were formulated and the method was explained in detail a practical application of this method has been demonstrated for a large diameter hybrid pile previously tested at full scale under lateral load the calculation results were compared with the well verified data obtained from the field test by incorporating the extended knowledge on the mechanism of the pile soil interaction a significantly reduced horizontal stress in front of the pile was achieved the conducted calculations confirmed that the hybrid monopile displacement is 40 70 lower compared to the standard monopile with similar dimensions this method allows the stability of the new hybrid monopiles under lateral load to be assessed in a better way the gained experiences can be useful for designers and other researchers to enhance the design of offshore wind turbines on monopiles

an increasing technological potential it can be achieved in short term through faster development of the offshore wind energy ewea 2015 2017 irena 2019 sanchez et al 2019 wiser et al 2016 fig 1 a

built in the southern baltic sea in poland pep 2018 fig 1b increasing rotor diameters will transfer increasingly higher loads to the foundations the dominant foundation type for offshore wind turbines owts is the monopile d 6 9 m l 20 30 m l d 4 5 it represents about 80 of the installed owts foundations the cost of foundations for typical offshore systems is mostly around 25 of the total sum using

and gavin 2011 doherty and lehane 2018 fan and long 2005 pedram 2015a zhang et al 2020 in the paper a new approach to hybrid monopiles shaping and owts calculation was presented the lateral load bearing capacity of the pile foundation depends mainly on its stiffness in the soil the modern requirements for designing the owts foundations according to the eurocodes are now more sls than uls oriented dnvgl 2018 the serviceability of the owts may get lost due to an excessive tilting or horizontal displacement of the tower at mudline level considering the strict operational requirements of the turbines a maximum rotating angle of 0 25 and horizontal displacement of the pile head is often limited api 2014 dnvgl 2018 iso 2016 based on the results of research and analyses a practical method of calculating the hybrid monopiles was developed the proposed solution was improved with regards to the pile soil interaction in the initial phase of increasing displacements using the simplified calculations for the hybrid foundation allows the impact of a horizontal protection around the monopile to be initially assessed which generally improves the pile lateral stiffness by 40 70 the new calculations are advantageous when it comes to determining the pile diameter reducing the pile depth lowering the cost of foundation construction work and increasing the safety of owts in difficult conditions at the sea the research results indicate that the hybrid foundation provides a promising substructure for the offshore wind industry with broad applications on april 2020 the first hybrid foundation combining a large diameter monopile and caisson was installed at an offshore wind farm off the fujian province in china buljan 2020 the designing analyses in this paper relate rather to the static loading of the hybrid monopile according to other authors research wang et al 2018b anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 the lateral deformation of hybrid monopile foundations increases with the number of cycles but with a much smaller gradient increasing compared to a convential monopile foundation it is possible to modify the soil properties beneath the bearing plate by using an injection method trojnar 2004 2010 then displacement of the hybrid monopile tends to stabilize quickly for larger cycles owts with the hybrid monopile foundation can provide larger cyclic bearing capacities than those with the monopile foundation as well as more scour protection 2 stability of the hybrid foundations selected problems the new concept of the hybrid monopile for owt is shown in fig 2 the hybrid foundations with a horizontal round bearing plate are intensively researched and analyzed in various scientific centers arshi 2016 arshi and stone 2011 2012a b 2015a b arshi

calculation of the hybrid foundation stability is usually difficult to carry out using the simplified analytical formulas this is due to the requirement of taking the spatial aspect of the structure s interaction with the soil into account beuckelaers 2017 bouzid 2018 byrne et al 2019 el naggar and mehdi 2018 kim and jeong 2011b murphya et al 2018 pedram 2015a b c trojnar 2015 zachert and wichtmann 2020 zdravković et al 2015 the range of the interaction between the vertical and horizontal parts of the hybrid foundation depends on the total displacements of the whole structure but also on the relative displacements of its components and soil deformation in front of the pile the deformation of the soil around the foundation depends on the geometric proportions of the structure and loads in the case of the hybrid monopiles their interaction with soil primarily results from the simultaneous interaction of the horizontal bearing plate and the vertical pile shaft and depends on the hybrid pile rotation the calculation analysis of the foundation must take into account the kinematics of the soil induced by the pile shaft rotation and the pressure of the bearing plate on the ground an important aspect of design is the modelling of soil deformation around the monopile foundation which has been studied by other authors anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 cheng et al 2019 cuéllar et al 2012 haiderali and madabhushi 2012 2015 haiderali et al 2013 hajialilue bonab et al 2011 2013 hokmabadi et al 2012 janoyan and whelan 2004 leblanc et al 2010 lesny et al 2007 yang et al 2018 2019 yuan et al 2019 wang et al 2018a b zhang et al 2005 the calculation method given below is based on the assessment of soil kinematics around the hybrid pile which has been studied in multiple scales a small laboratory scale a full field test a 3d numerical simulation trojnar 2008a 2008b 2012 trojnar 2013 2019 the author s proposal of simplifying the complex mechanics of load transfer through the load bearing plate with a strain wedge is generally similar to other authors concepts based on 3d fem analyses chen et al 2020 li et al 2020 however to analyze the displacements of the hybrid foundations full scale tests are most needed trojnar 2009b 2010 byrne et al 2017 2019 beuckelaers 2017 zhang et al 2020 their importance concerns the stability assessment and the hybrid monopile calculations under extreme lateral load the calculation problems of the shallow hybrid foundations are analyzed in a similar way as spread foundations with an inclined base or other specifically shaped foundations such as bucket foundations skirt foundations or conical foundations the calculation methods for such foundations result from centrifuge model tests and numerical analyses for complex 2d or 3d systems these publications are characteristic in this field bransby and randolph 1998 cassidy and houlsby 2002 cheng et al 2019 gourvenec and barnett 2011 houlsby and cassidy 2002 larsen 2008 wang et al 2017 for the analysis of a hybrid monopile a commercial computer program is usually needed to determine the real displacement modern and expensive software is only seldom used by designers for the preliminary pile analysis because it requires a good knowledge of numerical modelling and the use of advanced data numerical methods also require an appropriate constitutive soil model for the 3d fe simulations therefore in practice simple calculation methods are still needed to obtain real values of pile displacements with the best possible consideration of the spatial conditions in the soil such assessments are usually needed at the initial decision making stages for the new owts and to analyze the strengthening of existing monopile owts 3 design of the standard monopiles a short review the behaviour of the monopile in the ground under lateral load horizontal force and bending moment mainly depends on the stiffness of the pile soil system bhattacharya 2019 dean 2010 randolph and gourvenec 2011 reese and van impe 2001 due to the nature of the pile soil interaction two types of piles are distinguished flexible with long shaft and rigid with short shaft for the flexible piles it is assumed that under lateral load the pile shaft is deformed and its horizontal soil stress decreases with depth for the rigid piles it is assumed that the pile shaft does not deform and the pile rotates in the soil when loaded the rotation accompanied by the resistance of the soil in front of the pile above the centre of rotation and behind the pile below the centre of rotation in the calculation one of three assumptions describing the soil can be made 1 homogeneous with a constant deformability regardless of depth 2 homogeneous with a deformability linearly decreasing with depth 3 non homogeneous with characteristics changing with depth according to a determined definition the first and second assumption are often used for the pile calculations in the winkler model wm they can be used with a one or two parameter relationship of the soil deformability and pile displacement assuming the constant soil characteristics the pile soil interaction is determined using the modulus of subgrade reaction k p y this parameter describes the relationship between the lateral pressure of the pile exerted on the soil p and the pile horizontal displacement y the adequate calculation result depends on the soil type length and diameter of the pile and the stiffness of the pile head fastening in the cap structure free or fixed the second design assumption is often used in most methods of pile calculations in cohesive and cohesionless soils the most frequent hypothesis includes constant or linearly changing characteristics of the soil with regards to depth as the criterion of foundation stiffness in the ground the ratio of the pile length l to its elastic length l s is assumed using the formulas l s 4ei k d l n 1 n 4 where ei pile shaft stiffness d pile diameter k modulus of subgrade reaction n coefficient depending on the type of soil for the rigid piles with short shaft l l s 1 5 and for the flexible piles with long shaft l l s 3 these formulas can be used to calculate the bending moment and displacement of the pile with a free or fixed pile head in the analyses of the large diameter monopiles more accurate analytical solutions are incorporated the stiffness of the pile in the ground is determined according to the formula ω m d p ei 1 5 using the relevant criterion ω l 2 5 for the rigid piles and ω l 2 5 for the flexible piles where d p design diameter of the pile m soil resistance factor k z m z the third design assumption is used for piles in layered subsoil the pile is treated as a vertical beam in an elastic medium the pile soil interaction is replaced by elastic supports along the pile to define the elastic supports p y curves are used describing the deformation displacement relationship at a certain depth using the appropriately selected curves gives a possibility to numerically illustrate the non linear behavior character of the pile under lateral load taking into account e g changes in shape or diameter of the pile at different depths variants of fastening of the pile head in the cap structure and the influence of soil layering on the pile bending a modern concept for the calculation analysis of the conditions of the spatial pile soil interaction includes the strain wedge model sw based on the hypothesis that in front of the pile a non deformable mass of soil is shaped together with an increase of lateral load and a change of stress ashour et al 2002 ashour and norris 2003 bouzid 2018 this method takes better account of the spatial stress in the soil due the rotation and displacement of the pile under lateral load the soil pushed in front of the pile has a shape of a spatial wedge and its dimensions depend on the current stress in the zone in front of the pile applying the calculation procedure with an incremental pile loading according to the known stress strain characteristics in soil wedge in front of the pile allows for a better identification of the p y curves the presented assumptions of the strain wedge were adapted in the further part of the paper to propose the calculations of the hybrid monopiles for owts 4 previous simple methods of designing the hybrid monopiles the review of the last 50 years shows how other authors looked for a simplified method of calculating the hybrid foundations the analytical solutions aspects of the hybrid foundation have been poorly recognized so far the oldest methods give rather unrealistic results further methods have been developed in central and eastern european countries and have not yet been published in english the broms method shown in fig 3 can be considered the first and most simplified analytical solution for the pile with the cap broms 1964 1965 the calculation depends on the pile behavior scheme in the soil and on fastening of the pile head in the cap structure free or fixed these calculations result in determining the unloading yield moment in the pile below the bearing plate however this very simple solution cannot be used in the practical calculation because it does not take into acount all effects of the pile stiffness changing and pile rotation the davisson gill method shown in fig 4 is a simple analytical solution for the pile in a two layer soil with two subgrade modules k1 and k2 with various modules ratio davisson and gill 1963 for such assumptions plots and coefficients are given for the pile as a beam on elastic supports the calculations are made for two schemes of the pile head free or fixed this method is more suitable for long piles due to the form of deformation of the pile in the ground a comparison of this method with other accurate calculations abbas et al 2018 stuedlein 2015 li et al 2019 shows that the results are not satisfactory this method cannot be used to calculate the real hybrid piles and soil stresses because many simplifications have been applied the spang method shown in fig 5 was used in germany in the 1970s it was incorporated in the field test of the large diameter hybrid pile d 1 2 m including soil stress measurement spang 1972 spang 1972 in the analytical solution it was recommended to use a double value of the modulus of subgrade reaction under the bearing plate up to 3d depth the result of this approach is a reduction in the maximum moment value of a hybrid pile by about 40 60 compared to a standard pile without plate this generally corresponds to the results of other authors research abdelkader 2015 el marassi 2011 archi 2016 pedram 2015b stone et al 2010 lehane et al 2014 trojnar 1995 yang et al 2019 however this method cannot be used for designing in the sls because it does not allow for a reliable calculation of the pile displacement the tsiprianovich method shown in fig 6 was used in the 1960s in the former ussr countries tsiprianovich 1971 in the calculation it was assumed that the horizontal bearing plate is not connected with the pile head and interacts with the soil in front of the plate only if the bearing plate has an inclined front surface the soil in front of the hybrid pile is additionally compacted as a result of the bearing plate action the unloading moment m δ occurs the calculation takes into account the linear change of the modulus of subgrade reaction and the design diameter of the pile this method has a very limited scope of application as it does not include the soil deformation in front of the pile resulting from the vertical pressure of the bearing plate the bakulina method shown in fig 7 was developed in russia based on model tests of a single pile with decoupled bearing plate embedded in the cohesive soil bakulina 2013 displacement of the hybrid pile is interpreted as a sum of effects from the horizontal force h and the moment м and change of the modulus of subgrade reaction beneath the plate the hybrid piles with the diameter d 0 4 m and length l 2 m were tested l d 5 in prototype scale several lateral load variants were used m h 1 2 3 with the variable bearing plate width b d 1 1 5 2 2 5 the given formulas may be valid only within the specified tested range the mathus method was developed in ukraine based on theoretical analyses of a single pile with the rigidly connected bearing plate coupled mathus 2013 the main assumptions are as follows 1 the hybrid foundation is absolutely rigid 2 the soil is a linear elastic medium whose deformability in vertical and horizontal direction is characterized by the soil modules with a rectangular and triangular variation distribution respectively 3 for small angles of rotation the interaction of both parts of the hybrid foundation can be described using the static equilibrium equations for identical angles of rotation of the bearing plate and the pile as shown in fig 8 5 a proposal for simplified calculations of hybrid monopiles 5 1 calculation assumptions based on own model tests trojnar 2008a 2010 2019 it was determined that the active soil area formed under the bearing plate in front of the hybrid pile is wedge shaped the wedge area is shown in fig 9 a marked as zone a in relation to the spatial stresses this space can be described using abcd points where the bc distance is width at the wedge end fig 10 it was assumed on the basis of other studies ahmed and hawlader 2016 ashour et al 2002 ashour and norris 2003 hajialilue bonab et al 2013 hokmabadi et al 2012 yuan et al 2019 the the depth of the wedge increases with the hybrid pile loading this can be described at a given depth as a change of the bc distance in front of the pile in successive load steps based on previous analyses of hybrid piles it was found that the change of depth of the wedge under the bearing plate occurs only in a limited range of the pile displacement trojnar 2009b 2010 trojnar 2013 2019 in this case the lateral pressure of the pile on the soil is due to the stress wedge in zone a it was assumed that the reaction force r in front of the hybrid pile resulting from stresses in the wedge impact zone depends on the vertical plate pressure and changes with the pile rotation based on the author s own research it was also observed that the maximum wedge size z h max corresponds to the stress limit state and soil deformation in front of the pile which can be described as the angle α max π 4 φ 2 at the maximum load the soil shear failure in wedge zone occurs and further displacements of the hybrid pile do not directly depend on the stresses under the plate anymore but on the final wedge size at the moment of the soil shear failure along the line 0 3 in fig 9b the wedge sizes were analyzed by means of numerical 3d models trojnar 2008b 2009b based on these fe analyses a function was determined which described the formation of the soil wedge under the plate with regards to the displacement of the hybrid monopile under the lateral load it was assumed that the α angle defining the wedge depth under the bearing plate may range from 0 to αmax numerical analysis was used to qualitatively identify the behavior of the soil wedge in front of the hybrid monopile and to develop a practical method for its calculation showed in fig 11 due to using the coupled plate fixed to the pile the soil in front of the hybrid monopile has a higher load bearing capacity than a standard monopile fig 11 presents the wedge shape as the soil stress difference for two numerical models of 5 m long piles a hybrid one and a standard one numerical modelling was carried out using the plaxis 3d foundation software the analysis was conducted for the monopile with the diameter of 1 2 m in homogenous sand a a mohr coulomb nonlinear elastic plastic soil model was used the following sand parameters were used for calculations internal friction angle φ 35 young s modulus e 80 mpa increased 1 5z with depth z cohesion c 0 001 mpa poisson s ratio ʋ 0 30 and dilatation angle 5 the plate pile connection is fully rigid special interface contact elements were employed to model the relationship between the plate and soil allowing detachment and sliding with regard to the shear resistance of the coulomb type friction coefficient f 0 5 was assumed the model dimensions and lateral load of the hybrid monopile were the same as in case of the piles in the field investigation trojnar 2009 based on numerical and model tests the reasons for changes of the soil wedge were determined consisting of two opposing phenomena 1 strengthening due to the vertical pressure of the plate on the soil in front of the pile and 2 loosening due to the soil displacement in front of the pile the first phenomenon results in the wedge formation whereas the second is associated with the gradual change of the wedge shape and size along with the displacement and rotation of the hybrid pile the parameter ψ shown in fig 12 was introduced to the mathematical description of these phenomena it describes the reduced soil loosening for the hybrid monopile compared to the standard monopile this issue may be presented as an exponential function ψ 1 1 x x the value ψ 0 corresponds to the lack of the wedge at zero load exerted on the hybrid pile the value ψ 1 translates to the wedge formation with the maximum dimensions and the maximum possible soil strain in front of the pile based on the 3d fe numerical analyses and full scale hybrid pile tests the m parameter was introduced as the ratio of soil stress in front of the standard and hybrid pile the change of this parameter depending on the displacement is also shown in fig 12 both curves ψ x and m y have a similar shape and were normalized with regard to the displacements of previously tested hybrid piles l d 4 2 m h 4 assuming the maximum soil strain within the wedge ε max 0 3 trojnar 2009 trojnar 2013a 2013b by introducing the modified m value it is possible in the future to even better match the theoretical solution for more test data however more full scale tests including actual displacement measurements of the hybrid monopiles are required by obtaining more data in the future it will be possible to parametrically take into account the impact of the soil type load type and the geometrical dimensions of the hybrid foundations for the calculations the following important assumptions were made fig 13 1 soil resistance beneath the bearing plate can be replaced by the r force under the bearing plate as a result of rotation the pressure is transferred from the bearing plate to the soil in front of the pile 2 the force r is applied at a distance of 2 3 of the plate s reach and inclined to the vertical at an α angle which changes as the soil wedge increases and the foundation displacement occurs this assumption is very simplified however it does not affect the final calculation result because it takes into account the total equivalent reduction of the hybrid monopile load caused by combined effects of the bearing plate and the pile 3 the horizontal soil pressure in front of the bearing plate is ignored for safety reasons possibility of exposing the plate surface 4 the plate bending is caused only by the subgrade reaction beneath the bearing plate and by the rotation of the pile 5 the pile vertical load is transferred to the ground by the pile skin friction and the pile base if pile shaft is too short the pile may be uplift and this must be checked by calculation 6 deformability of the soil under the plate is a constant value 5 2 calculation method it was assumed that the favourable effect of the bearing plate can be replaced by an equivalent reduction of initial lateral load of the standard pile without a plate m hyb m o dm h hyb h o dh when the hybrid pile is loaded it is rotating by δ angle the pile rotation is accompanied by the bearing plate also rotating by the same angle this is due to rigid connection of both parts of the hybrid foundation assuming a rectangular stress distribution under all sub areas of the plate its vertical displacement can be calculated using the formula 5 1 the vertical stress in the soil σ vi can be calculated from the formula 5 2 with influence factors η i from fig 14 and table 1 for pressure qi under sub areas of the plate in the case of small angles of rotation the vertical displacement at the end of the bearing plate can be calculated from the equation 5 3 5 1 s i σ v z i e 5 2 σ v i j q i η j q 5 8 χ q 1 4 ξ q 9 12 λ 5 3 s b tan δ b δ where s

step as previously assumed the soil resistance under the bearing plate was replaced by the r force inclined to the plate applied at distance e b 2 3 b from the pile the force inclination changes with the pile rotation the maximum force inclination corresponds to the maximum soil wedge size under the bearing plate then the inclination to the vertical for a line forming the frontal wedge surface is β max π 4 φ 2 the calculation scheme of the forces system is shown in fig 13 the relationship between horizontal stress values in the soil in front of the hybrid pile and the standard piles is described as the m parameter by this parameter also the change of total subgrade reaction under the bearing plate is described based on own field tests and numerical analyses of the hybrid piles the displacements and lateral soil pressure of the piles with and without the bearing plate were compared the variability of the m parameter is shown in fig 12 based on the measurement data and calculations of 5 m long piles of 1 2 mindiameter it was found that the effect of increasing a lateral stiffness of the hybrid pile can be presented graphically with the second degree polynomial function or more generally with the exponential function the initial part of the plot may indicate the friction effect between the bearing plate and the subsoil this article does not analyze this effect in detail the pure effect of greater soil resistance in front of the hybrid pile can be replaced by the equivalent reduction of the lateral load of the pile head dm dq depending on the current displacement using the real parameters of the bearing plate and the soil it is possible to calculate the total subsoil reaction r depending on the determined values of the horizontal displacement and the rotation of the pile comparing the equations 5 1 and 5 3 for the plate reach b d and considering the equivalent rectangular plate with 12 sub areas allowed a calculation the vertical component of the soil resistance r v under the bearing plate according to formulas 5 4 5 5 with factors in fig 14 and table 1 for layer thickness d 8 d 8 d 4 d 2 5 4 s d δ 1 e 0 965 r v d 2 d 8 0 691 r v d 2 d 8 0

together with the iterative procedure proposed in this paper the hybrid monopile displacement y and the reduced rotation angle of the pile head δ can be determined this is achieved by applying m i 1 h

the value of the horizontal component of the soil resistance under the bearing plate r h varies with the rigid soil wedge in front of the hybrid pile assuming that the parameter m describes the non linear increase of the horizontal component of the soil resistance under the bearing plate then the value of resistance can be calculated according to the equation 5 11 the component forces of the soil resistance r h r v reduce the bending of the hybrid pile the global unloading of the hybrid pile head dm and dh resulting from the plate interaction can be calculated in subsequent iteration

results the results of the full scale field tests on two monopiles installed in medium sand and their comparison with the calculation data are shown in fig 17 the research was presented in detail in

load was determined for the hybrid monopile h hyb 213 kn m hyb 703 kn m this result shows that the load exerted on the hybrid pile is much smaller which resulted from the favourable effects of the bearing plate in this case the horizontal force load for the hybrid monopile is reduced by almost 15 and for the moment it is reduced by almost 30 compared to the standard monopile the calculated displacement of the hybrid monopile under this load is y hyb 13 mm and is considered as a final result the bearing plate effect calculated as the ratio of the displacement of the standard and hybrid foundation is e p calc y std y hyb 1 62 this value is similar to the field measurement e p test 1 70 accuracy of approximately 5 fig 18 shows a comparison of the plate effect calculations with the experimental values described in other papers trojnar 2004 2010 2019 using the exponential form of the m function a satisfactory compliance of calculations and measurements was obtained 6 conclusions the research and analyses carried out so far confirm that the hybrid foundations are characterized by high lateral load bearing capacity and stiffness and can be used as an effective solution for offshore wind turbine foundations given the pile soil interaction at increasing lateral load it can be computationally determined that the bending of the new hybrid monopile shaft is 30 smaller than in the case of the standard monopile the practical aspects of the hybrid foundation design have been poorly recognized so far this applies particularly to the lack of simple calculation methods for predicting the stability of the new foundations such assessments are usually needed at the initial decision making stages for new owts and to analyze the strengthening of existing monopiles in owts using additional bearing plates placed on the seabed e g when replacing old power generators with new high power ones in the cases of new structures the increased rotor diameter and the increased height of the turbines lead to higher lateral loads transferred to the foundations in the case the new hybrid monopiles are used the costs of owts foundations and their installation can be significantly reduced the simplified calculation method presented in this paper allows its users to better check the hybrid monopile stability in the simple soil conditions in the serviceability limit state by adopting the concept of the soil wedge under the bearing plate the reduced rotation and horizontal displacement were confirmed compared to the standard monopile under the same load by using the proposed method of iterative calculations the hybrid monopile displacements may be decreased by 40 70 example calculations conducted according to the described method were positively validated based on the full scale tests of hybrid piles with l d 4 m h 4 a modified strain wedge model was developed to analyze the behaviour of laterally loaded hybrid monopiles in cohesionless soil calculation methods for the assessment of the soil resistance along the hybrid monopile were proposed and the sw model was used to describe the stress strain behaviour of the soils finally the validity and accuracy of the proposed calculation method were verified using a case study and the results derived from the full scale tests were compared to those calculated by the proposed method the presented calculation method requires more analysis number in the future and improvement based on more data from the full scale hybrid monopile tests credit authorship contribution statement krzysztof

21214,scour prediction is essential for the design of offshore foundation structures in this study we experimentally investigate the clear water scour around pile groups of the circular arrangement with uniform bed sediment and steady current five pile group arrangements and two flow velocities are considered we illustrate the scouring process around each arrangement and derive the equilibrium scour depth based on our experimental results as well as previously published data we check the accuracy of three widely used empirical methods in predicting equilibrium scour depth of pile groups it is found that based on the effective diameter calculated for a rectangular arrangement the predictions of all the selected methods lead to significant overestimation here we propose a new effective diameter to represent the characteristic geometry of a circular arrangement essentially the projected width of a pile group is calculated by the diameter of a monopile that has the same cross sectional area of the pile group using the new effective diameter the predictions from the selected empirical methods are remarkably improved keywords scour experimental modeling pile group circular arrangement 1 introduction pile supported foundations are commonly used in the coastal and offshore environment such as bridge piers piled breakwaters and offshore wind turbine foundations the presence of such foundations changes the flow pattern in their vicinity and leads to bed shear stress amplification which results in increasing sediment mobility therefore scour occurs around the foundation structures and influences their stability and usability remarkably thus it is essential to accurately predict the sediment scour at piled foundations for their safe design for a circular cylinder the scour mechanisms and scour depth have been studied through both physical experiments and numerical simulations raudkivi and ettema 1983 pointed out that the equilibrium scour depth under clear water condition is related to the mean particle size of the bed sediment the distribution of particle size and the water depth relative to the pier diameter etc melville and chiew 1999 conducted a series of experiments and reported that the maximum scour depth depends on four factors including flow velocity flow shallowness sediment coarseness and time factor more studies to understand the scour around a circular cylinder are given by sumer and fredsøe 2002 roulund et al 2005 qi et al 2012 akhlaghi et al 2020 and liang et al 2020 in reality foundations are often constructed in a group of piles based on mechanical and economic considerations due to the high three dimensionality of the flow the mechanism of the scouring at pile groups is very complicated the results of the scour around a single circular cylinder foundation cannot be applied to pile groups directly sumer et al 2005 studied both global and local scour at square pile groups including 2 2 square 3 3 square and 5 5 square amini et al 2011 examined the local scour around a rectangular arrangement pile groups under steady clear water condition and the effect of varying pile group arrangements spacing and submergence ratios was discussed through a series of experiments on rectangular arrangement of piles lança et al 2013 showed that different group configurations that is different pile spacing alignment angles numbers and arrangements of pile group columns cause different interactions between the pile group and the flow field and hence lead to different scour patterns and equilibrium scour depth laboratory experiments are conducted to study local scour around three piers in tandem or staggered alignment zhou et al 2020 through a series of laboratory experiments yang et al 2020 investigated the influence of the pile spacing and froude number on scour around rectangular arrangement pile groups the process is more complicated if the flow is not constant but a wave chow et al 1978 studied the wave scour around 2 2 and 2 3 legged pile structures sumer and fredsøe 1998 studied the effect of configuration on wave scour around pile groups including 2 pile 3 pile in both tandem and side by side arrangements and 4 x 4 square pile group through laboratory experiments qi et al 2019 investigated the scour around twin piles under combined current and wave conditions and the effect of various gaps and alignments were discussed according to the above mentioned research works various empirical formulas and mathematical methods have been proposed to estimate the equilibrium scour depth at pile groups the hec 18 hydraulic engineering circular no 18 has evolved progressively over the years and it is currently a recommendation by fhwa the federal highway administration arneson et al 2012 the fdot florida department of transportation method is also widely used to calculate the equilibrium scour depth at pile group foundations melville and coleman 2000 proposed a procedure to predict the scour depth at complex piers involving equations that are used to characterize the different combinations of pier components a method to predict the local scour at a complex pier was proposed by coleman 2005 the method recognizes the relative scouring potentials of the components of complex piers and the transition of scouring processes occurring for varying pile cap elevation there are also alternative techniques to estimate the equilibrium scour depth following azimi et al 2017 an anfis adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system has been employed to predict scour depth around rectangular arrangement pile groups an integrated framework of elm extreme learning machines was developed by ebtehaj et al 2018 to predict local scour depth around pile groups in rectangular arrangements various parameters on the scour depth at rectangular arrangement pile groups have been evaluated through the probabilistic framework such as flow condition the status of bed sediment incipient motion and piles arrangement homaei and najafzadeh 2020 however most of the studies on pile group foundations investigate rectangular arrangements and there is still a lack of knowledge in scouring at pile groups of circular arrangement in this work we study the clear water scour around pile groups of circular arrangement a series of laboratory experiments under steady current flow with non cohesive sediment are conducted we propose a new effective diameter to represent the characteristic geometric scales of pile groups in circular arrangements the performance of three widely used methods on estimating equilibrium scour depth of pile groups is checked based on both present results and published data with the new effective diameter all the selected methods are improved significantly on estimating equilibrium scour depth for circular arrangement pile groups and the most favorable method is also given 2 experimental setup and methods the experiments were carried out in a rectangular brick sided flume which was 10 m long 1 m wide and 0 3 m deep located at the integrated water environment management laboratory hohai university a flow straighter with a honeycomb pattern and a wave absorber composed of a sponge and polystyrene layer is equipped at the flume entrance to guarantee uniform and steady inlet flow conditions at the downstream end of the flume the water level is controlled by an adjustable tailgate weir the water that flows over the weir falls into an underground reservoir three pumps are used to elevate the water into the entrance of the flume a layout of the apparatus is illustrated in fig 1 in the present study because of the similar experimental environment we calculate the critical flow velocity of the sediment using the equation given by tang et al 2013 u c 30 1 cm s some preliminary runs are conducted with a visual inspection of the particle motion and at u 30 1 cm s occasional single particle movement is observed two flow velocities are used here since the maximum scour depth occurs at the threshold of sediment motion alabi 2006 one of the flow velocity is u 1 u c 0 93 which is slightly below the critical condition for a circular cylinder local scour is initiated when the approaching mean flow velocity u exceeds 0 47 u c sheppard and renna 2005 considering the effect of flow velocity on the scour depth another flow velocity is u 1 u c 0 74 which is higher than 0 47u c all the experiments are tested with constant water level h 25 cm the approaching flow velocity is measured with a vectrino acoustic doppler velocimeter adv manufactured by nortek the velocity measurement is taken in the middle of the sediment section without models and the velocity profile is obtained since a threshold flow velocity of u u c 0 93 experiments are performed under clear water conditions the reynolds number r e ρ u d ν ranges from 0 64 1 0 4 to 2 24 1 0 4 and the froude number f r u g h varies from 0 143 to 0 179 the working section is a 4 m long 1 m wide and 0 16 m thick sediment pit which is located at 6 m downstream of the inlet tank uniform non cohesive sand with a mean particle size d 50 0 575 mm specific gravity s 2 65 and the geometric standard deviation σ g 1 29 is used as the bed sediment as the sediment is practically uniform σ g 1 5 the effect of sediment gradation on the scour depth is negligible raudkivi and ettema 1983 all the parameters are summarized in table 1 five pile group configurations are tested in the present study including 6 pile cap 6pc 8 pile cap 8pc 10 pile cap 10pc triangular arrays of circular cylinders tacc hexagonal arrays of circular cylinders hacc and a monopile different gaps between adjacent piles g and different incident flow angles α are also considered the caps of all the pile cap foundations are above the water and all the piles are inclined with an inclination of 5 1 for each pile scour around circular piles with different diameters and different inclination angles towards downstream has been investigated experimentally by vaghefi et al 2016a following this research the scour depth decreases with the increasing inclined angle with the inclined angle 14 and 7 the reduction of scour depth between the inclined and vertical pile is around 13 and 6 respectively through laboratory experiments on scour around a laterally inclined circular pier vaghefi et al 2016b found that the difference of the maximum scour depth between the vertical pile and inclined pile inclined angle 21 is only 4 in addition scour around an inclined pile with various inclined directions has been investigated by mahmoudi 2017 following the research the relative standard deviation of the scour depth with different inclined directions is 12 6 at the inclined angle 21 in the present study as the inclined angle is about 11 the inclination effect on the scour depth is limited the radius of the circle of piles r varies with different pile group arrangements the g and r of the pile cap models is taken as the value at the initial bed level all the models are installed in the middle of the sediment section different incident flow angles α are also considered and α 0 describes the alignment position with one leg facing the direction of incident flow attack the geometry of the models is shown in fig 2 all the pile cap models are made by plexiglass and the other two models are made by aluminum all the models go to the recess bottom for each case the scour depth is measured at 4 points around each pile the measurement point starts from the upstream face β 0 and the interval is 90 the meter tape is attached on each pile with the resolution is 1 mm an endoscope is used to take photos of the meter tape at definite time intervals and the scour depth is obtained by analyzing the images all the test parameters and results are shown in table 2 3 results and analyses 3 1 temporal evolution of scour depth the duration of the experiments was 30 h 1800 min for most cases while several of them were 54 h 3240 min to determine the effects of time length in fig 3 the maximum scour depth s is normalized using the diameter of the pile and s d is plotted in time here the flow velocity is u 0 93 u c according to fig 3 the scour depth evolves rapidly in the first 480 min for all the models after 480 min the process is relatively slower and exhibits an asymptotic trend towards the equilibrium conditions and from this figure it is clear that the maximum scour depth around 6 pile cap model did not increase monotonously with time fig 4 presents the pile arrangements and the time records of scour depths at individual piles for 6 pile cap model because the model is symmetric only half of the model is shown in this figure at the first 480 min the maximum scour occurred at pile 4 which was the downstream pile of the model as time passed the scour at upstream piles increased and the sediment moved to the downstream pile then the scour at pile 4 decreased and the maximum scour occurred at another pile 3 2 time scale the time scale is defined as a reference value to assess the scouring rate the temporal evolution of scour depth around a vertical pile has been investigated by sumer et al 1992 following the research for a substantial amount of scour to develop a certain amount of time must elapse this time is called the time scale of the scour process the time scale of the scour process may be defined in several ways sumer and fredsøe 2002 according to cardoso and bettess 1999 the scour time scale t of a single vertical pile is the time at which s t 0 632 s e where s t is the scour depth at time t and s e is the equilibrium scour depth some empirical formulas are available to calculate the time scale of the sour process for a single vertical pile such as sumer and fredsøe 2002 however as mentioned above the maximum scour depth around pile group models may not increase monotonously with time according to schendel et al 2018 the time scale of the scour process t could be calculated by 1 t 1 s e n d 0 t e n d s e n d s t d t where s e n d is the scour depth at the end of the test and s t is the scour depth at time t schendel et al 2018 also pointed out that as the increase of scour depth from s e n d towards the equilibrium depth can be expected to be rather slow it is assumed that the determined time scales are smaller than values which would have been obtained based on equilibrium scour depths the scour time scale t for each test is shown in table 2 for the pile group models the time scale of the scour process t ranges from 131 4 to 330 4 min at u 0 93 u c while it varies from 118 0 to 303 4 min at u 0 74 u c for the monopile t is 453 8 and 665 8 min with u 0 93 u c and u 0 74 u c respectively which is larger than that of the pile group models the observation may be due to that the pile group effect leads to a more complicated flow and more turbulence around the pile groups hence a larger scour rate of pile groups than that of monopile sumer and fredsøe 2002 found that the scour time scale t of a single vertical pile decreases with increasing flow velocity and the present results of the monopile agree with the observation however the scour time scale of the pile groups is not in conformity with this trend this may be that the flow around the pile groups is more complicated and results in the different scour process of the pile groups 3 3 equilibrium scour depth 3 3 1 criterion for equilibrium in clear water scour the equilibrium scour depth is approached very slowly in time laursen 1963 in practical engineering the equilibrium condition is difficult to reach and define this is because peak flows may last only a number of hours hence it has insufficient time to generate equilibrium depth melville and chiew 1999 however the definition of time to equilibrium plays an important role in the design of scour experiments ettema 1980 has defined the equilibrium phase of the scour process where the scour depth practically does not increase anymore coleman et al 2003 stated that an equilibrium scour hole may continue to deepen at a relative slow rate each author has a different interpretation of the meaning of concepts like practically or relative slow rate the reported subjectivity has important implications on the design of scour experiments in an attempt to avoid the error caused by subjectivity melville and chiew 1999 and grimaldi 2005 suggested that the time to equilibrium condition should be satisfied with that the rate of increase of scour does not exceed a specific percentage of the pier diameter in the succeeding 24 h period i e 2 d s d t n d 24 h where s is the scour depth t is the time d is the diameter of the pier and n is the specific percentage e g 5 or 1 67 of the pier diameter fig 5 shows the temporal evolution and development rate per hour of normalized scour depth s d of hexagonal arrays of circular cylinders hacc for 3240 mins from this figure even the duration was 3240 min the scour around the hacc model does not reach its equilibrium and still slightly increases with time as the experiments in the present study have not reached the equilibrium the time factor k t was used to account for the effect of time on the development of scour depth k t is defined as the fraction of equilibrium scour depth at time t i e k t s t s e here s t is the scour depth at time t and s e is the equilibrium scour depth according to baghbadorani et al 2017 in the present study the value of s e is achieved by the following method the value of k t for each case is calculated at 1800 min if the duration is less than 1800 min k t is calculated at the end of the test then the equilibrium scour depth could be derived through s e s t k t 3 3 2 effective diameter of pile group since the mechanism of scouring at pile groups is more complex the k t equations derived for the single pier cannot be directly applied to the pile group models in the present study the k t equations were modified for use in pile groups by substituting d d p g where d p g is the effective diameter of the pile group baghbadorani et al 2017 according to arneson et al 2012 the expression for effective diameter of pile group could be expressed as 3 d p g k s p d p r o j where k s p is the effect of adjacent pile spacing and d p r o j is the projected width of the pile group the coefficient for pile spacing effect from hec 18 arneson et al 2012 could be expressed as 4 k s p 1 4 3 1 d d p r o j 1 s p d 0 6 in which d is the diameter of the pile s p is the center distance between adjacent piles the projected width of the pile group is the sum of the projections of the non overlapping widths of the individual piles and it is illustrated in fig 6 then the projected width of pile group could be expressed as 5 d p r o j d 1 d 2 d 5 in the offshore environment many pile group foundations could be found in a circular arrangement while the effective diameter of arneson et al 2012 was obtained for pile groups of the rectangular arrangement the use of effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 on pile groups in a circular arrangement is still doubtable here a new effective diameter of pile group was proposed for pile groups of the circular arrangement and it could be expressed as 6 d p g k s p d p r o j for the models in the present study various incident flow angles lead to different flow blockage and result in different equilibrium scour depth table 3 shows the relative standard deviation rsd of the scour depth at the end of each test s e n d with different incident flow angle for each model and s e n d varied little with incident flow angle therefore the effect of the incident flow angle was negligible wave forces on pile group structures have been investigated by qu et al 2017 and an effective diameter was introduced to represent the characteristic geometric scales of pile supported structures in light of qu et al 2017 the modified projected width of pile group d p r o j here is the diameter of a monopile has the same cross sectional area of the pile group and it is written as 7 d p r o j 4 i n a i π i 1 2 n where n is the number of piles in pile group structures and a i is the cross sectional area of each pile the effect of adjacent piles spacing k s p is the same as eq 4 based on d p r o j 3 3 3 extrapolated equilibrium scour depth in the present study three k t equations are selected and shown in table 4 which are from melville and chiew 1999 kothyari et al 2007 and lança et al 2013 respectively table 5 compares the selected k t equations based on both effective diameters and mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient cc between the measured and calculated value are presented fig 7 shows the measured data and fitted curves of scour temporal evolution for hexagonal arrays of circular cylinders based on effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 from table 5 and fig 7 the k t equation from lança et al 2013 agrees better with the experimental data therefore the k t equation of lança et al 2013 was used for the extrapolation of scour data for all the pile group configurations in the present study the equilibrium scour depth based on both effective diameters were shown in table 6 3 4 comparison with existing empirical methods as illustrated in the first section various empirical formulas and mathematical methods have been developed to estimate the equilibrium scour depth at pile groups in the present study three widely used methods are chosen to evaluate their performance on circular pile group arrangements which are hec 18 arneson et al 2012 a method from coleman 2005 and fdot sheppard and renna 2005 from melville and coleman 2000 the equilibrium scour depth s with uniform sediment around pile group under steady current condition could be expressed as 8 s e d k y k d k p g k i where s e is the equilibrium scour depth d is the diameter of the pile k y is the effect of water depth k d is the effect of sediment size k p g is the effect of pile group and k i is the effect of flow velocity for the selected three methods the pile groups are all treated as a monopile with an effective diameter to represents the pile group effect then eq 8 could be modified to 9 s e d p g c k y k d k i in which d p g is the effective diameter of pile group and c is the constant coefficient the factors of three selected methods are shown in table 7 clear water scour around triangular arrays of circular cylinders tacc was studied by vittal et al 1994 by considering four sediment sizes and five incident flow angles experimental study on clear water scour around hexagonal arrays of circular cylinders hacc in steady flow conditions was investigated by yagci et al 2017 with considering four gaps between adjacent piles and three incident flow angles to evaluate the selected methods on the circular arrangement pile group both present experimental results and results from vittal et al 1994 and yagci et al 2017 were used the performance of existing methods is assessed on the basis of parameters as follows mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient cc and discrepancy ratio dr for mape and rmse a value of zeros indicates good performance and large positive values are undesirable for cc a value of 1 is desirable and smaller values close to 0 is undesirable discrepancy ratio dr of 1 shows an unbiased model whereas dr 1 shows under prediction and dr 1 shows over prediction behavior a comparison was also made by counting the number of predictions close to perfect agreement line and points within and outside 30 error lines 3 4 1 results based on original effective diameter the value of statistical indices based on effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 for selected equations are shown in table 8 from table 8 the poorest equation in terms of mape and rmse is coleman 2005 equation while the best equation with the smallest mape and rmse is hec 18 in terms of the correlation coefficient the method of coleman 2005 shows the best performance with cc 0 87 and the poorest method is hec 18 with cc 0 77 scatter plots of predicted and observed values of normalized scour depth based on effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 for the selected equations are shown in fig 8 from this figure hec 18 has the most number of predictions that lie within 30 error lines with 56 of predictions within the two bounds while for the method of coleman 2005 only 17 of predictions fall between the two bounds in terms of dr all three methods suffer from over prediction with dr 1 and the most severe case of over prediction belongs to coleman 2005 with 83 of prediction above 30 error line while 44 of predictions were above 30 for hec 18 equation 3 4 2 results based on new effective diameter table 9 presents the value of statistical indices based on the new effective diameter of the pile group for the selected methods in terms of mape and rmse all the selected methods provide a considerable improvement in estimating equilibrium scour depth on circular arrangement pile groups based on the new effective diameter according to dr the value of all the methods decreases and leads to less overestimation the correlation coefficient cc also increases for all the methods and the poorest method was hec 18 with cc 0 78 while the methods of coleman 2005 and fdot were 0 88 and 0 91 respectively scatter plots of predicted and observed values of normalized scour depth based on the new effective diameter of the pile group are shown in fig 9 for the selected three methods the number of predictions lies within 30 lines all increases significantly for practical engineering the results of overestimation are more favorable due to the high safety margins even though all the methods provide conservative results the poorest method is hec 18 with 43 of the results are under prediction while the number of under prediction of coleman 2005 and fdot are 19 and 17 respectively meanwhile the maximum under predictions are 31 2 17 4 and 13 1 for the method of hec 18 coleman 2005 and fdot respectively considering the other error analysis from table 9 the method of coleman 2005 and fdot are recommended on estimating equilibrium scour depth for circular arrangement pile groups in practical engineering it should be pointed out that based on both effective diameters the predictions of all the selected methods showed poor performance on predicting equilibrium scour depth with low flow velocity u 0 74 u c besides only one water depth is considered in the present study therefore the effect of flow velocity and water depth should be verified with more studies in the future 4 conclusion the clear water scour around circular arrangement pile groups under steady current condition is investigated experimentally in this study two flow velocities and five pile group arrangements are considered the scouring process around each model is illustrated and the equilibrium scour depth is obtained through extrapolation three widely used methods for estimation of equilibrium scour depth at pile groups are compared through both present experimental data and published data the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 a new effective diameter is proposed to represent the characteristic geometry of pile groups in a circular arrangement essentially the projected width of the pile group is calculated by the diameter of a monopile which has the same cross sectional area of the pile group 2 compared with three k t equations of melville and chiew 1999 kothyari et al 2007 and lança et al 2013 the equilibrium scour depth is obtained through extrapolation from k t equation of lança et al 2013 since it shows the best agreement with the measured results three widely used methods for estimating equilibrium scour depth of pile groups are selected to check their performance on circular arrangements compared with the results based on effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 all the selected methods provide considerable improvements by adopting the new effective diameter 3 using the new effective diameter the errors of all the selected methods on estimating equilibrium scour depth at pile groups of circular arrangements are in the same order while the methods of coleman 2005 and fdot provide more conservative predictions for practical engineering purposes the methods of coleman 2005 and fdot are recommended for pile groups of circular arrangement since they provide relatively high safety margins based on our experimental results all the selected scour depth prediction methods show good performances in estimating the pile cap model s scour depth without considering the inclination effect further studies should check if the methods can be applied to the pile supported foundations with larger inclination besides as the present results are obtained from laboratory experiments it will be useful to check if the new effective diameter can be applied to the practical structures in

21214,scour prediction is essential for the design of offshore foundation structures in this study we experimentally investigate the clear water scour around pile groups of the circular arrangement with uniform bed sediment and steady current five pile group arrangements and two flow velocities are considered we illustrate the scouring process around each arrangement and derive the equilibrium scour depth based on our experimental results as well as previously published data we check the accuracy of three widely used empirical methods in predicting equilibrium scour depth of pile groups it is found that based on the effective diameter calculated for a rectangular arrangement the predictions of all the selected methods lead to significant overestimation here we propose a new effective diameter to represent the characteristic geometry of a circular arrangement essentially the projected width of a pile group is calculated by the diameter of a monopile that has the same cross sectional area of the pile group using the new effective diameter the predictions from the selected empirical methods are remarkably improved keywords scour experimental modeling pile group circular arrangement 1 introduction pile supported foundations are commonly used in the coastal and offshore environment such as bridge piers piled breakwaters and offshore wind turbine foundations the presence of such foundations changes the flow pattern in their vicinity and leads to bed shear stress amplification which results in increasing sediment mobility therefore scour occurs around the foundation structures and influences their stability and usability remarkably thus it is essential to accurately predict the sediment scour at piled foundations for their safe design for a circular cylinder the scour mechanisms and scour depth have been studied through both physical experiments and numerical simulations raudkivi and ettema 1983 pointed out that the equilibrium scour depth under clear water condition is related to the mean particle size of the bed sediment the distribution of particle size and the water depth relative to the pier diameter etc melville and chiew 1999 conducted a series of experiments and reported that the maximum scour depth depends on four factors including flow velocity flow shallowness sediment coarseness and time factor more studies to understand the scour around a circular cylinder are given by sumer and fredsøe 2002 roulund et al 2005 qi et al 2012 akhlaghi et al 2020 and liang et al 2020 in reality foundations are often constructed in a group of piles based on mechanical and economic considerations due to the high three dimensionality of the flow the mechanism of the scouring at pile groups is very complicated the results of the scour around a single circular cylinder foundation cannot be applied to pile groups directly sumer et al 2005 studied both global and local scour at square pile groups including 2 2 square 3 3 square and 5 5 square amini et al 2011 examined the local scour around a rectangular arrangement pile groups under steady clear water condition and the effect of varying pile group arrangements spacing and submergence ratios was discussed through a series of experiments on rectangular arrangement of piles lança et al 2013 showed that different group configurations that is different pile spacing alignment angles numbers and arrangements of pile group columns cause different interactions between the pile group and the flow field and hence lead to different scour patterns and equilibrium scour depth laboratory experiments are conducted to study local scour around three piers in tandem or staggered alignment zhou et al 2020 through a series of laboratory experiments yang et al 2020 investigated the influence of the pile spacing and froude number on scour around rectangular arrangement pile groups the process is more complicated if the flow is not constant but a wave chow et al 1978 studied the wave scour around 2 2 and 2 3 legged pile structures sumer and fredsøe 1998 studied the effect of configuration on wave scour around pile groups including 2 pile 3 pile in both tandem and side by side arrangements and 4 x 4 square pile group through laboratory experiments qi et al 2019 investigated the scour around twin piles under combined current and wave conditions and the effect of various gaps and alignments were discussed according to the above mentioned research works various empirical formulas and mathematical methods have been proposed to estimate the equilibrium scour depth at pile groups the hec 18 hydraulic engineering circular no 18 has evolved progressively over the years and it is currently a recommendation by fhwa the federal highway administration arneson et al 2012 the fdot florida department of transportation method is also widely used to calculate the equilibrium scour depth at pile group foundations melville and coleman 2000 proposed a procedure to predict the scour depth at complex piers involving equations that are used to characterize the different combinations of pier components a method to predict the local scour at a complex pier was proposed by coleman 2005 the method recognizes the relative scouring potentials of the components of complex piers and the transition of scouring processes occurring for varying pile cap elevation there are also alternative techniques to estimate the equilibrium scour depth following azimi et al 2017 an anfis adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system has been employed to predict scour depth around rectangular arrangement pile groups an integrated framework of elm extreme learning machines was developed by ebtehaj et al 2018 to predict local scour depth around pile groups in rectangular arrangements various parameters on the scour depth at rectangular arrangement pile groups have been evaluated through the probabilistic framework such as flow condition the status of bed sediment incipient motion and piles arrangement homaei and najafzadeh 2020 however most of the studies on pile group foundations investigate rectangular arrangements and there is still a lack of knowledge in scouring at pile groups of circular arrangement in this work we study the clear water scour around pile groups of circular arrangement a series of laboratory experiments under steady current flow with non cohesive sediment are conducted we propose a new effective diameter to represent the characteristic geometric scales of pile groups in circular arrangements the performance of three widely used methods on estimating equilibrium scour depth of pile groups is checked based on both present results and published data with the new effective diameter all the selected methods are improved significantly on estimating equilibrium scour depth for circular arrangement pile groups and the most favorable method is also given 2 experimental setup and methods the experiments were carried out in a rectangular brick sided flume which was 10 m long 1 m wide and 0 3 m deep located at the integrated water environment management laboratory hohai university a flow straighter with a honeycomb pattern and a wave absorber composed of a sponge and polystyrene layer is equipped at the flume entrance to guarantee uniform and steady inlet flow conditions at the downstream end of the flume the water level is controlled by an adjustable tailgate weir the water that flows over the weir falls into an underground reservoir three pumps are used to elevate the water into the entrance of the flume a layout of the apparatus is illustrated in fig 1 in the present study because of the similar experimental environment we calculate the critical flow velocity of the sediment using the equation given by tang et al 2013 u c 30 1 cm s some preliminary runs are conducted with a visual inspection of the particle motion and at u 30 1 cm s occasional single particle movement is observed two flow velocities are used here since the maximum scour depth occurs at the threshold of sediment motion alabi 2006 one of the flow velocity is u 1 u c 0 93 which is slightly below the critical condition for a circular cylinder local scour is initiated when the approaching mean flow velocity u exceeds 0 47 u c sheppard and renna 2005 considering the effect of flow velocity on the scour depth another flow velocity is u 1 u c 0 74 which is higher than 0 47u c all the experiments are tested with constant water level h 25 cm the approaching flow velocity is measured with a vectrino acoustic doppler velocimeter adv manufactured by nortek the velocity measurement is taken in the middle of the sediment section without models and the velocity profile is obtained since a threshold flow velocity of u u c 0 93 experiments are performed under clear water conditions the reynolds number r e ρ u d ν ranges from 0 64 1 0 4 to 2 24 1 0 4 and the froude number f r u g h varies from 0 143 to 0 179 the working section is a 4 m long 1 m wide and 0 16 m thick sediment pit which is located at 6 m downstream of the inlet tank uniform non cohesive sand with a mean particle size d 50 0 575 mm specific gravity s 2 65 and the geometric standard deviation σ g 1 29 is used as the bed sediment as the sediment is practically uniform σ g 1 5 the effect of sediment gradation on the scour depth is negligible raudkivi and ettema 1983 all the parameters are summarized in table 1 five pile group configurations are tested in the present study including 6 pile cap 6pc 8 pile cap 8pc 10 pile cap 10pc triangular arrays of circular cylinders tacc hexagonal arrays of circular cylinders hacc and a monopile different gaps between adjacent piles g and different incident flow angles α are also considered the caps of all the pile cap foundations are above the water and all the piles are inclined with an inclination of 5 1 for each pile scour around circular piles with different diameters and different inclination angles towards downstream has been investigated experimentally by vaghefi et al 2016a following this research the scour depth decreases with the increasing inclined angle with the inclined angle 14 and 7 the reduction of scour depth between the inclined and vertical pile is around 13 and 6 respectively through laboratory experiments on scour around a laterally inclined circular pier vaghefi et al 2016b found that the difference of the maximum scour depth between the vertical pile and inclined pile inclined angle 21 is only 4 in addition scour around an inclined pile with various inclined directions has been investigated by mahmoudi 2017 following the research the relative standard deviation of the scour depth with different inclined directions is 12 6 at the inclined angle 21 in the present study as the inclined angle is about 11 the inclination effect on the scour depth is limited the radius of the circle of piles r varies with different pile group arrangements the g and r of the pile cap models is taken as the value at the initial bed level all the models are installed in the middle of the sediment section different incident flow angles α are also considered and α 0 describes the alignment position with one leg facing the direction of incident flow attack the geometry of the models is shown in fig 2 all the pile cap models are made by plexiglass and the other two models are made by aluminum all the models go to the recess bottom for each case the scour depth is measured at 4 points around each pile the measurement point starts from the upstream face β 0 and the interval is 90 the meter tape is attached on each pile with the resolution is 1 mm an endoscope is used to take photos of the meter tape at definite time intervals and the scour depth is obtained by analyzing the images all the test parameters and results are shown in table 2 3 results and analyses 3 1 temporal evolution of scour depth the duration of the experiments was 30 h 1800 min for most cases while several of them were 54 h 3240 min to determine the effects of time length in fig 3 the maximum scour depth s is normalized using the diameter of the pile and s d is plotted in time here the flow velocity is u 0 93 u c according to fig 3 the scour depth evolves rapidly in the first 480 min for all the models after 480 min the process is relatively slower and exhibits an asymptotic trend towards the equilibrium conditions and from this figure it is clear that the maximum scour depth around 6 pile cap model did not increase monotonously with time fig 4 presents the pile arrangements and the time records of scour depths at individual piles for 6 pile cap model because the model is symmetric only half of the model is shown in this figure at the first 480 min the maximum scour occurred at pile 4 which was the downstream pile of the model as time passed the scour at upstream piles increased and the sediment moved to the downstream pile then the scour at pile 4 decreased and the maximum scour occurred at another pile 3 2 time scale the time scale is defined as a reference value to assess the scouring rate the temporal evolution of scour depth around a vertical pile has been investigated by sumer et al 1992 following the research for a substantial amount of scour to develop a certain amount of time must elapse this time is called the time scale of the scour process the time scale of the scour process may be defined in several ways sumer and fredsøe 2002 according to cardoso and bettess 1999 the scour time scale t of a single vertical pile is the time at which s t 0 632 s e where s t is the scour depth at time t and s e is the equilibrium scour depth some empirical formulas are available to calculate the time scale of the sour process for a single vertical pile such as sumer and fredsøe 2002 however as mentioned above the maximum scour depth around pile group models may not increase monotonously with time according to schendel et al 2018 the time scale of the scour process t could be calculated by 1 t 1 s e n d 0 t e n d s e n d s t d t where s e n d is the scour depth at the end of the test and s t is the scour depth at time t schendel et al 2018 also pointed out that as the increase of scour depth from s e n d towards the equilibrium depth can be expected to be rather slow it is assumed that the determined time scales are smaller than values which would have been obtained based on equilibrium scour depths the scour time scale t for each test is shown in table 2 for the pile group models the time scale of the scour process t ranges from 131 4 to 330 4 min at u 0 93 u c while it varies from 118 0 to 303 4 min at u 0 74 u c for the monopile t is 453 8 and 665 8 min with u 0 93 u c and u 0 74 u c respectively which is larger than that of the pile group models the observation may be due to that the pile group effect leads to a more complicated flow and more turbulence around the pile groups hence a larger scour rate of pile groups than that of monopile sumer and fredsøe 2002 found that the scour time scale t of a single vertical pile decreases with increasing flow velocity and the present results of the monopile agree with the observation however the scour time scale of the pile groups is not in conformity with this trend this may be that the flow around the pile groups is more complicated and results in the different scour process of the pile groups 3 3 equilibrium scour depth 3 3 1 criterion for equilibrium in clear water scour the equilibrium scour depth is approached very slowly in time laursen 1963 in practical engineering the equilibrium condition is difficult to reach and define this is because peak flows may last only a number of hours hence it has insufficient time to generate equilibrium depth melville and chiew 1999 however the definition of time to equilibrium plays an important role in the design of scour experiments ettema 1980 has defined the equilibrium phase of the scour process where the scour depth practically does not increase anymore coleman et al 2003 stated that an equilibrium scour hole may continue to deepen at a relative slow rate each author has a different interpretation of the meaning of concepts like practically or relative slow rate the reported subjectivity has important implications on the design of scour experiments in an attempt to avoid the error caused by subjectivity melville and chiew 1999 and grimaldi 2005 suggested that the time to equilibrium condition should be satisfied with that the rate of increase of scour does not exceed a specific percentage of the pier diameter in the succeeding 24 h period i e 2 d s d t n d 24 h where s is the scour depth t is the time d is the diameter of the pier and n is the specific percentage e g 5 or 1 67 of the pier diameter fig 5 shows the temporal evolution and development rate per hour of normalized scour depth s d of hexagonal arrays of circular cylinders hacc for 3240 mins from this figure even the duration was 3240 min the scour around the hacc model does not reach its equilibrium and still slightly increases with time as the experiments in the present study have not reached the equilibrium the time factor k t was used to account for the effect of time on the development of scour depth k t is defined as the fraction of equilibrium scour depth at time t i e k t s t s e here s t is the scour depth at time t and s e is the equilibrium scour depth according to baghbadorani et al 2017 in the present study the value of s e is achieved by the following method the value of k t for each case is calculated at 1800 min if the duration is less than 1800 min k t is calculated at the end of the test then the equilibrium scour depth could be derived through s e s t k t 3 3 2 effective diameter of pile group since the mechanism of scouring at pile groups is more complex the k t equations derived for the single pier cannot be directly applied to the pile group models in the present study the k t equations were modified for use in pile groups by substituting d d p g where d p g is the effective diameter of the pile group baghbadorani et al 2017 according to arneson et al 2012 the expression for effective diameter of pile group could be expressed as 3 d p g k s p d p r o j where k s p is the effect of adjacent pile spacing and d p r o j is the projected width of the pile group the coefficient for pile spacing effect from hec 18 arneson et al 2012 could be expressed as 4 k s p 1 4 3 1 d d p r o j 1 s p d 0 6 in which d is the diameter of the pile s p is the center distance between adjacent piles the projected width of the pile group is the sum of the projections of the non overlapping widths of the individual piles and it is illustrated in fig 6 then the projected width of pile group could be expressed as 5 d p r o j d 1 d 2 d 5 in the offshore environment many pile group foundations could be found in a circular arrangement while the effective diameter of arneson et al 2012 was obtained for pile groups of the rectangular arrangement the use of effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 on pile groups in a circular arrangement is still doubtable here a new effective diameter of pile group was proposed for pile groups of the circular arrangement and it could be expressed as 6 d p g k s p d p r o j for the models in the present study various incident flow angles lead to different flow blockage and result in different equilibrium scour depth table 3 shows the relative standard deviation rsd of the scour depth at the end of each test s e n d with different incident flow angle for each model and s e n d varied little with incident flow angle therefore the effect of the incident flow angle was negligible wave forces on pile group structures have been investigated by qu et al 2017 and an effective diameter was introduced to represent the characteristic geometric scales of pile supported structures in light of qu et al 2017 the modified projected width of pile group d p r o j here is the diameter of a monopile has the same cross sectional area of the pile group and it is written as 7 d p r o j 4 i n a i π i 1 2 n where n is the number of piles in pile group structures and a i is the cross sectional area of each pile the effect of adjacent piles spacing k s p is the same as eq 4 based on d p r o j 3 3 3 extrapolated equilibrium scour depth in the present study three k t equations are selected and shown in table 4 which are from melville and chiew 1999 kothyari et al 2007 and lança et al 2013 respectively table 5 compares the selected k t equations based on both effective diameters and mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient cc between the measured and calculated value are presented fig 7 shows the measured data and fitted curves of scour temporal evolution for hexagonal arrays of circular cylinders based on effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 from table 5 and fig 7 the k t equation from lança et al 2013 agrees better with the experimental data therefore the k t equation of lança et al 2013 was used for the extrapolation of scour data for all the pile group configurations in the present study the equilibrium scour depth based on both effective diameters were shown in table 6 3 4 comparison with existing empirical methods as illustrated in the first section various empirical formulas and mathematical methods have been developed to estimate the equilibrium scour depth at pile groups in the present study three widely used methods are chosen to evaluate their performance on circular pile group arrangements which are hec 18 arneson et al 2012 a method from coleman 2005 and fdot sheppard and renna 2005 from melville and coleman 2000 the equilibrium scour depth s with uniform sediment around pile group under steady current condition could be expressed as 8 s e d k y k d k p g k i where s e is the equilibrium scour depth d is the diameter of the pile k y is the effect of water depth k d is the effect of sediment size k p g is the effect of pile group and k i is the effect of flow velocity for the selected three methods the pile groups are all treated as a monopile with an effective diameter to represents the pile group effect then eq 8 could be modified to 9 s e d p g c k y k d k i in which d p g is the effective diameter of pile group and c is the constant coefficient the factors of three selected methods are shown in table 7 clear water scour around triangular arrays of circular cylinders tacc was studied by vittal et al 1994 by considering four sediment sizes and five incident flow angles experimental study on clear water scour around hexagonal arrays of circular cylinders hacc in steady flow conditions was investigated by yagci et al 2017 with considering four gaps between adjacent piles and three incident flow angles to evaluate the selected methods on the circular arrangement pile group both present experimental results and results from vittal et al 1994 and yagci et al 2017 were used the performance of existing methods is assessed on the basis of parameters as follows mean absolute percentage error mape root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient cc and discrepancy ratio dr for mape and rmse a value of zeros indicates good performance and large positive values are undesirable for cc a value of 1 is desirable and smaller values close to 0 is undesirable discrepancy ratio dr of 1 shows an unbiased model whereas dr 1 shows under prediction and dr 1 shows over prediction behavior a comparison was also made by counting the number of predictions close to perfect agreement line and points within and outside 30 error lines 3 4 1 results based on original effective diameter the value of statistical indices based on effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 for selected equations are shown in table 8 from table 8 the poorest equation in terms of mape and rmse is coleman 2005 equation while the best equation with the smallest mape and rmse is hec 18 in terms of the correlation coefficient the method of coleman 2005 shows the best performance with cc 0 87 and the poorest method is hec 18 with cc 0 77 scatter plots of predicted and observed values of normalized scour depth based on effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 for the selected equations are shown in fig 8 from this figure hec 18 has the most number of predictions that lie within 30 error lines with 56 of predictions within the two bounds while for the method of coleman 2005 only 17 of predictions fall between the two bounds in terms of dr all three methods suffer from over prediction with dr 1 and the most severe case of over prediction belongs to coleman 2005 with 83 of prediction above 30 error line while 44 of predictions were above 30 for hec 18 equation 3 4 2 results based on new effective diameter table 9 presents the value of statistical indices based on the new effective diameter of the pile group for the selected methods in terms of mape and rmse all the selected methods provide a considerable improvement in estimating equilibrium scour depth on circular arrangement pile groups based on the new effective diameter according to dr the value of all the methods decreases and leads to less overestimation the correlation coefficient cc also increases for all the methods and the poorest method was hec 18 with cc 0 78 while the methods of coleman 2005 and fdot were 0 88 and 0 91 respectively scatter plots of predicted and observed values of normalized scour depth based on the new effective diameter of the pile group are shown in fig 9 for the selected three methods the number of predictions lies within 30 lines all increases significantly for practical engineering the results of overestimation are more favorable due to the high safety margins even though all the methods provide conservative results the poorest method is hec 18 with 43 of the results are under prediction while the number of under prediction of coleman 2005 and fdot are 19 and 17 respectively meanwhile the maximum under predictions are 31 2 17 4 and 13 1 for the method of hec 18 coleman 2005 and fdot respectively considering the other error analysis from table 9 the method of coleman 2005 and fdot are recommended on estimating equilibrium scour depth for circular arrangement pile groups in practical engineering it should be pointed out that based on both effective diameters the predictions of all the selected methods showed poor performance on predicting equilibrium scour depth with low flow velocity u 0 74 u c besides only one water depth is considered in the present study therefore the effect of flow velocity and water depth should be verified with more studies in the future 4 conclusion the clear water scour around circular arrangement pile groups under steady current condition is investigated experimentally in this study two flow velocities and five pile group arrangements are considered the scouring process around each model is illustrated and the equilibrium scour depth is obtained through extrapolation three widely used methods for estimation of equilibrium scour depth at pile groups are compared through both present experimental data and published data the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 a new effective diameter is proposed to represent the characteristic geometry of pile groups in a circular arrangement essentially the projected width of the pile group is calculated by the diameter of a monopile which has the same cross sectional area of the pile group 2 compared with three k t equations of melville and chiew 1999 kothyari et al 2007 and lança et al 2013 the equilibrium scour depth is obtained through extrapolation from k t equation of lança et al 2013 since it shows the best agreement with the measured results three widely used methods for estimating equilibrium scour depth of pile groups are selected to check their performance on circular arrangements compared with the results based on effective diameter from arneson et al 2012 all the selected methods provide considerable improvements by adopting the new effective diameter 3 using the new effective diameter the errors of all the selected methods on estimating equilibrium scour depth at pile groups of circular arrangements are in the same order while the methods of coleman 2005 and fdot provide more conservative predictions for practical engineering purposes the methods of coleman 2005 and fdot are recommended for pile groups of circular arrangement since they provide relatively high safety margins based on our experimental results all the selected scour depth prediction methods show good performances in estimating the pile cap model s scour depth without considering the inclination effect further studies should check if the methods can be applied to the pile supported foundations with larger inclination besides as the present results are obtained from laboratory experiments it will be useful to check if the new effective diameter can be applied to the practical structures in
